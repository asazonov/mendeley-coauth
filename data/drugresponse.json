        "abstract": "Pharmacogenomics is the study of the role of inherited and ac-quired genetic variation in drug response.1 Clinically relevant pharmacogenetic examples, mainly involving drug metabolism, have been known for decades, but recently, the field of pharmacogenetics has evolved into \u201cpharmacogenomics,\u201d involving a shift from a focus on individual candidate genes to genome-wide association studies. Such studies are based on a rapid scan of markers across the genome of persons affected by a particular disorder or drug-response pheno-type and persons who are not affected, with tests for association that compare genetic variation in a case\u2013control setting.2 An example is provided in this issue of the Journal: McCormack and colleagues, testing for genomewide association, identified an HLA allele that is associated with hypersensitivity reactions to the anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug carbamazepine in persons of European descent.3 Pharmacogenomics facilitates the identification of biomarkers that can help physicians optimize drug selection, dose, and treatment duration and avert adverse drug reactions. In addition, pharmacogenomics can provide new insights into mechanisms of drug action and as a result can contribute to the development of new therapeutic agents. In 2003, two reviews of pharmacogenetics were published the Journal.4,5 Since then, both genomic science and its application to drug response have undergone major advances.6 Here we review some of those advances, with an emphasis on discovery through genomewide association studies. We describe examples that highlight principles of pharmacogenomics that are relevant to a wide variety of drugs. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has altered drug labels and issued warnings about pharmacogenomic variation affecting drug response, raising the issue of the level of evidence required to show clinical utility7 and the respective roles of regulatory agencies such as the FDA and of academic and professional societies in the evaluation of pharmacogenetic analyses for the clinic.",

These developments have reemphasized the concept of personalized medicine. Here we review the impact of omics technologies on one key aspect of personalized medicine: the individual drug response.

These pharmacogenetic strategies offer the prospect of identifying biological predictors of psychotropic drug response and could provide the means of determining the molecular substrates of drug efficacy and drug-induced adverse events.\\n\\nMETHOD: The authors discuss methods issues in executing pharmacogenetic studies, review the first generation of pharmacogenetic studies of psychotropic drug response, and consider future directions for this rapidly evolving field.\\n\\nRESULTS: Pharmacogenetics has been most commonly used in studies of antipsychotic drug efficacy, antidepressant drug response, and drug-induced adverse effects. Data from antipsychotic drug studies indicate that polymorphisms within the serotonin 2A and dopamine receptor 2 genes may influence drug efficacy in schizophrenia. Moreover, a growing body of data suggests a relationship between the serotonin transporter gene and clinical effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors used to treat depression. A significant relationship between genetic variation in the cytochrome P450 system and drug-induced adverse effects may exist for certain medications. Finally, a number of independent studies point to a significant effect of a dopamine D(3) receptor polymorphism on susceptibility to tardive dyskinesia.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Initial research into the pharmacogenetics of psychotropic drug response suggests that specific genes may influence phenotypes associated with psychotropic drug administration. These results remain preliminary and will require further replication and validation. New developments in molecular biology, human genomic information, statistical methods, and bioinformatics are ongoing and could pave the way for the next generation of pharmacogenetic studies in psychiatry.",

        "abstract": "Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogenic and migratory factor that regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of signalling proteins via intracellular production of H2O2 (refs 1, 2-3). Mammalian 2-Cys peroxiredoxin type II (Prx II; gene symbol Prdx2) is a cellular peroxidase that eliminates endogenous H2O2 produced in response to growth factors such as PDGF and epidermal growth factor; however, its involvement in growth factor signalling is largely unknown. Here we show that Prx II is a negative regulator of PDGF signalling. Prx II deficiency results in increased production of H2O2, enhanced activation of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) and phospholipase Cgamma1, and subsequently increased cell proliferation and migration in response to PDGF. These responses are suppressed by expression of wild-type Prx II, but not an inactive mutant. Notably, Prx II is recruited to PDGFR upon PDGF stimulation, and suppresses protein tyrosine phosphatase inactivation. Prx II also leads to the suppression of PDGFR activation in primary culture and a murine restenosis model, including PDGF-dependent neointimal thickening of vascular smooth muscle cells. These results demonstrate a localized role for endogenous H2O2 in PDGF signalling, and indicate a biological function of Prx II in cardiovascular disease.",

A haplotype map, or HapMap, intended to reveal such a variation pattern, has been recently developed by the International HapMap Consortium. Here, we present a conceptual model for directly characterizing specific DNA sequence variants that are responsible for drug response based on the haplotype structure provided by HapMap. Our model is developed in the maximum likelihood context, incorporated by clinically meaningful mathematical functions that model drug response and implemented with the EM algorithm. Our model is employed to a pharmacogenetic study of cardiovascular disease with 107 patients. We found that the haplotype constituted by allele Gly16 (G) at codon 16 and allele Glu27 (G) at codon 27 genotyped within the beta2AR candidate gene exhibits a different effect on heart rate curve from the rest haplotypes. Parents with the diplotype consisting of two copies of haplotype GG are more sensitive in heart rate to increasing dosages of dobutamine than those with other haplotypes. This model provides a powerful tool for elucidating the genetic variants of drug response and ultimately designing personalized medications based on each patient's genetic constitution.",

However, it has proven difficult to isolate genes that underlie common complex disease, and genetic variations that influence clinical responses to drugs remain largely uncovered. The candidate gene approach to uncover genetic variations that contribute to disease susceptibility or variations in response to common drugs has not met expectations. Although the sib-pair linkage approach has certain theoretical advantages in dealing with common/complex disease, success has been slow in coming. Meanwhile family studies including siblings, cousins and second cousins, and studies in well-defined founder populations, have increasingly gained popularity and enabled scientists to map and isolate genes for common complex disease, such as schizophrenia and asthma. The latter method has generated new hope that this approach may also be effective in mapping genes that regulate drug response. Indeed, there is compelling evidence that corticosteroid sensitivity is a mapable trait in patients with asthma. Collectively, these studies support the value of leveraging information available within population-based data systems to map and isolate genes for common complex disease and drug response",

In the current genomic era, pharmacogenetic research is applied to all fields of drug treatment in clinical medicine, including hypertension research. In contrast to the traditional approach, however, the influence of individual genetic variation on the efficacy of a drug (ie, the pharmacodynamic response) is the major focus of pharmacogenetic research and its clinical applicability. Therefore, the identification of individual genetic variation influencing the blood pressure-lowering effect of an antihypertensive compound and the implementation of this knowledge into clinical practice is the major goal of pharmacogenetic research in the field of hypertension.

This approach promises faster relief from symptoms, a lowering of side effect risks and a reduction in healthcare costs. Pharmacogenomic tests used by the pharmaceutical companies themselves can be used to help identify suitable subjects for clinical trials, aid in interpretation of clinical trial results, find new markets for current products and speed up the development of new treatments and therapies. This type of approach should also see fewer compounds failing during later phases of development.

Epigenetic aberrations can affect drug treatment by modulating the expressions of key genes involved in the metabolism and distribution of drugs as well as drug targets, thereby contributing to interindividual variation in drug response. These epigenetic alterations, along with the epigenetic profiles of circulating nucleic acids, have great potential to be used as biomarkers for personalized therapy, particularly in the treatment of cancer.

        "abstract": "Geographic patterns of genetic variation, including variation at drug metabolizing enzyme (DME) loci and drug targets, indicate that geographic structuring of inter-individual variation in drug response may occur frequently. This raises two questions: how to represent human population genetic structure in the evaluation of drug safety and efficacy, and how to relate this structure to drug response. We address these by (i) inferring the genetic structure present in a heterogeneous sample and (ii) comparing the distribution of DME variants across the inferred genetic clusters of individuals. We find that commonly used ethnic labels are both insufficient and inaccurate representations of the inferred genetic clusters, and that drug-metabolizing profiles, defined by the distribution of DME variants, differ significantly among the clusters. We note, however, that the complexity of human demographic history means that there is no obvious natural clustering scheme, nor an obvious appropriate degree of resolution. Our comparison of drug-metabolizing profiles across the inferred clusters establishes a framework for assessing the appropriate level of resolution in relating genetic structure to drug response.",

This is a rapidly expanding field with the hope that, within a few years, prospective genotyping will lead to patients being prescribed drugs which are both safer and more effective ('the right drug for the right patient', or personalized medicine). There are many existing examples in the literature of strong associations between genetic variation and drug response, and some of these even form the basis of accepted clinical tests. The molecular basis for some of these associations is described, and includes examples of variation in genes responsible for absorption and metabolism of the drug, and in target and disease genes. However, there are many issues surrounding the legal, regulatory and ethical framework to these studies that remain unanswered, and a huge amount of education both for the public and healthcare professionals will be needed before the results of this new medicine can be widely accepted.",

With the availability of large-scale, high-density single nucleotide polymorphism markers, a great challenge is how to associate haplotype structures and complex drug response through its underlying pharmacodynamic mechanisms. RESULTS: We have derived a general statistical model for detecting an interactive network of DNA sequence variants that encode pharmacodynamic processes based on the haplotype map constructed by single nucleotide polymorphisms. The model was validated by a pharmacogenetic study for two predominant beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) subtypes expressed in the heart, beta1AR and beta2AR. Haplotypes from these two receptors trigger significant interaction effects on the response of heart rate to different dose levels of dobutamine. This model will have implications for pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic research and drug discovery.

We sought to determine whether proteomic signatures of untreated cells were sufficient for the prediction of drug response. Experimental Design: In this study, a machine learning model system was developed to classify cell line chemosensitivity exclusively based on proteomic profiling. Using reverse-phase protein lysate microarrays, protein expression levels were measured by 52 antibodies in a panel of 60 human cancer cell (NCI-60) lines.

Examples of the genetics of pharmacokinetics are presented for phase I (cytochromes P450) and phase II (conjugating enzymes) drug-metabolizing enzymes and for phase III drug transporters. The example used to explain the genetics of pharmacodynamics is glycoprotein IIIa and the response to antiplatelet effects of aspirin. Genetics linked to a defined pathology and its corresponding drug therapies is exemplified by ADRB1, ACE, CETP and APOE and drug response in metabolic syndrome. The examples of cytochrome P450s, APOE and ADRB2 in relation to ethnicity, age and gender are presented to describe genetics of physiologic regulation. Finally, environmental-genetic interactions are exemplified by CYP7A1 and the effects of diet on plasma lipid levels, and by APOE and the effects of smoking in cardiovascular disease.

        "abstract": "Since cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, there is an urgent need to find better treatments. Currently, the use of chemotherapeutics remains the predominant option for cancer therapy. However, one of the major obstacles for successful cancer therapy using these chemotherapeutics is that patients often do not respond or eventually develop resistance after initial treatment. Therefore identification of genes involved in chemotherapeutic response is critical for predicting tumour response and treating drug-resistant cancer patients. A group of genes commonly lost or inactivated are tumour suppressor genes, which can promote the initiation and progression of cancer through regulation of various biological processes such as cell proliferation, cell death and cell migration/invasion. Recently, mounting evidence suggests that these tumour suppressor genes also play a very important role in the response of cancers to a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs. In the present review, we will provide a comprehensive overview on how major tumour suppressor genes [Rb (retinoblastoma), p53 family, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, BRCA1 (breast-cancer susceptibility gene 1), PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), Hippo pathway, etc.] are involved in chemotherapeutic drug response and discuss their applications in predicting the clinical outcome of chemotherapy for cancer patients. We also propose that tumour suppressor genes are critical chemotherapeutic targets for the successful treatment of drug-resistant cancer patients in future applications.",

Profiling tumors from patients undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant drug treatment can yield markers of therapeutic response.

Functional mapping is particularly powerful in determining the genetic commonality and differences of drug efficacy vs. drug toxicity and drug sensitivity vs. drug resistance. We pinpoint several future directions in which functional mapping can be coupled with systems biology to unravel the genetic and metabolic machinery of drug response. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Genetic variation of SLC6A4, HTR1A, MAOA, COMT and BDNF has been associated with depression, variable antidepressant drug responses as well as impacts on brain regions of emotion processing that are modulated by antidepressants. Pharmacogenetic studies are using psychometric outcome measures of drug response and are hampered by small effect sizes that might be overcome by the use of intermediate endophenotypes of drug response, which are suggested by imaging studies. Such an approach will not only tighten the relationship between genes and drug response, but also yield new insights into the neurobiology of depression and individual drug responses. This article provides a comprehensive overview of pharmacogenetic, imaging genetics and drug response studies, utilizing imaging techniques within the context of antidepressive drug therapy.",

Methods: From May 1994 through February 2005, histoculture drug response assay data were obtained from 359 lung cancer specimens held in our institute. We examined chemosensitivities of the tissues to cisplatin, doxorubicin, mitomycin C, 5-fluorouracil, docetaxel, paclitaxel, etoposide, irinotecan, and gemcitabine. Cutoff inhibition rates were determined with each drug for non-small cell lung cancer and were used to calculate predictabilities for chemotherapy responses. Results: The evaluability of the histoculture drug response assay was high at 97.4%. Good predictability, including true-positive and true-negative rates of 73.2% and 100%, respectively, with an accuracy of 83.0%, was observed. Conclusion: The histoculture drug response assay appears to be applicable to non-small cell lung cancer for the prediction of responses to chemotherapy. \u00a9 2007 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.",

However, organoid generation protocols require fresh tumor tissue, which limits organoid research and clinical use. This study investigates cellular morphology, viability, and drug response of organoids derived from frozen tissues. The results demonstrate that viable organoids can be grown from flash-frozen and thawed tissue and from bulk tissues slowly frozen in DMSO supplemented media. While the freezing process affects the basal metabolic rate of the cells, the optical metabolic imaging index correlates between organoids derived from fresh and frozen tissue and can be used to detect drug response of organoids grown from frozen tissues. The slow, DMSO frozen tissue yielded organoids with more accurate drug response than the flash frozen tissues, and thus bulk tissue should be preserved for subsequent organoid generation by slow freezing in DMSO supplemented media.",

However, not all of these SNPs are functional. It would be impractical and costly to evaluate every individual SNP for functionality experimentally. Consequently, one of the major challenges for researchers has been to seek out functional SNPs from all the SNPs in the human genome. In silico or bioinformatic methods are economical, less labor intensive, yet powerful approaches to filter out potentially functional SNPs in drug-response genes for further study. This allows researchers to prioritize which SNPs to subsequently evaluate experimentally for drug-response studies, as well as potentially providing insights into possible mechanisms underlying how SNPs may affect drug-response genes.",

Major contributory factors affecting progress in the field include: (i) the need for large clinical populations and control/placebo-treated cohorts to be studied; (ii) the difficulty in evaluating drug response in many instances with empirical or qualitative treatment response values often not available; (iii) interactions of underlying biochemical pathways are often not fully understood, both in terms of mode-of-action of a therapeutic compound itself and in the occurrence of side effects; (iv) population-specific frequency data for reported genetic variants and physically mapped genomic markers for evaluation in drug response studies are often not readily and/or publicly available; (v) accurate, high-throughput, cost-effective polymorphism detection and screening methods are required; and (vi) sophisticated biostatistical data analysis programs to perform the multi-parametric tests and permutation analyses necessary are still under development.

Thus, very important issue to address is individual therapy optimization. Recent results have shown evidence that variable efficacy of treatment and risk of motor and mental complications could have genetic origin. Significant roles in that process play (pharmaco)genomic/genetic studies of PD. Variability in genes coding for drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug receptors and proteins involved in drug pathway signaling is an important factor determining inter-individual variability in drug responses. Interpersonal differences in drug responses are clearly documented although individualized treatment of PD is not widely known. Treatment with antiparkinsonian drugs is associated with the development of complications, such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), hallucinations and excessive daytime sleepiness. Carriers of specific genetic polymorphisms are particularly susceptible to development of some of these drug adverse effects. Pharmacogenomics aims to understand the relationship between genetic factors and inter-individual variations in drug responses, and to translate this information in therapy tailored to individual patient genetics. Relatively few efforts have been made to investigate the role of pharmacogenetics in the individual response to anti-PD drugs. Thus, many genetic variations and polymorphisms in myriad of different proteins can influence individual response to anti-PD drugs.",

Cancer pharmacogenomics provides the opportunity to analyze two sets of DNA, that of the tumor (somatic) and that of the host (germline). Germline variants are inherited variations and are often associated with the pharmacokinetic behavior of a drug, including drug disposition and ultimately drug efficacy and/or toxicity, whereas somatic mutations are often useful in predicting the pharmacodynamic response to drugs. Pharmacoethnicity, or ethnic diversity in drug response or toxicity, is an increasingly recognized factor accounting for interindividual variations in anticancer drug response. Pharmacoethnicity is often determined by germline pharmacogenomic factors and the distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms across various populations, but it may also be influenced by nongenetic factors, such as environmental factors.

Women are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression and may also report more atypical and anxiety symptoms than men. Men and women also differ in the metabolism and distribution of antidepressants and the presence of oestrogen in women of childbearing age may interfere with the mechanism of action of a number of antidepressants. These differences have led many researchers to question whether antidepressants are equally effective and tolerated in men and women. While some reports suggest that selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are more effective and result in fewer adverse drug reactions in women than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), gender differences in antidepressant response remains a controversial topic. The potential effects of antidepressant exposure in utero and in breast milk further complicate treatment options for antenatal and postnatal depression. While some research suggests the SSRI paroxetine is teratogenic, further carefully designed naturalistic studies are required to fully evaluate these effects. Finally, response to antidepressants and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions is marked by inter-individual variability which may be in part due to genetic differences. Future studies should therefore consider genotypes of the mother, foetus and infant in antidepressant response.",

Combining drug targets, drug response expression profiles, and the human physical interaction network, we infer 99 human drug response pathways and study their properties. Based on the newly inferred pathways, we develop a pathway-based drug-drug similarity measure and compare it to two common, gold standard drug-drug similarity measures. Remarkably, our measure provides better correspondence to these gold standards than similarity measures that are based on associations between drugs and known pathways, or on drug-specific gene expression profiles. It further improves the prediction of drug side effects and indications, elucidating specific response pathways that may be associated with these drug properties.

Identifying molecular targets (e.g., genetic variants) delineating the genetic basis of drug response could help understand the complex nature of drug response. The last decade has witnessed significant advances in genome-wide profiling technologies for genetic/epigenetic variations and gene expression. As an unbiased, cell-based model for pharmacogenomic discovery, a tremendous resource of whole-genome molecular targets has been accumulated for the HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) during the past decade. The current progress, particularly in cancer pharmacogenomics, using the LCL model was reviewed to illustrate the potential impact of systems biology approaches on pharmacogenomic discovery.",

Analysis of 161 TFs and 24 treatments revealed 334 significantly associated TF-treatment pairs. Investigation of 20 selected pairs yielded literature support for 13 of these associations, often from studies where perturbation of the TF expression changes drug response. Experimental validation of significant GENMi associations in taxanes and anthracyclines across two triple-negative breast cancer cell lines corroborates our findings. The method is shown to be more sensitive than an alternative, genome-wide association study-based approach that does not use gene expression.

In a real-world setting, clinicians would have access to both steady-state expression levels of patient tissue(s) and a patient's genotypic profile, and yet the predictive power of transcripts versus markers is not well understood. We have previously shown that a collection of genotyped and expression-profiled yeast strains can provide a model for personalized medicine. Here we compare the predictive power of 6,229 steady-state mRNA transcript levels and 2,894 genotyped markers using a pattern recognition algorithm. We were able to predict with over 70% accuracy the drug sensitivity of 104 individual genotyped yeast strains derived from a cross between a laboratory strain and a wild isolate. We observe that, independently of drug mechanism of action, both transcripts and markers can accurately predict drug response. Marker-based prediction is usually more accurate than transcript-based prediction, likely reflecting the genetic determination of gene expression in this cross.",

        "abstract": "We combine mathematical modeling with experiments in living mice to quantify the relative roles of intrinsic cellular vs. tissue-scale physiological contributors to chemotherapy drug resistance, which are difficult to understand solely through experimentation. Experiments in cell culture and in mice with drug-sensitive (E\u00b5-myc/Arf-/-) and drug-resistant (E\u00b5-myc/p53-/-) lymphoma cell lines were conducted to calibrate and validate a mechanistic mathematical model. Inputs to inform the model include tumor drug transport characteristics, such as blood volume fraction, average geometric mean blood vessel radius, drug diffusion penetration distance, and drug response in cell culture. Model results show that the drug response in mice, represented by the fraction of dead tumor volume, can be reliably predicted from these inputs. Hence, a proof-of-principle for predictive quantification of lymphoma drug therapy was established based on both cellular and tissue-scale physiological contributions. We further demonstrate that, if the in vitro cytotoxic response of a specific cancer cell line under chemotherapy is known, the model is then able to predict the treatment efficacy in vivo. Lastly, tissue blood volume fraction was determined to be the most sensitive model parameter and a primary contributor to drug resistance.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale analysis of cellular response to anticancer drugs typically focuses on variation in potency (half-maximum inhibitory concentration, (IC50)), assuming that it is the most important difference between effective and ineffective drugs or sensitive and resistant cells. We took a multiparametric approach involving analysis of the slope of the dose-response curve, the area under the curve and the maximum effect (Emax). We found that some of these parameters vary systematically with cell line and others with drug class. For cell-cycle inhibitors, Emax often but not always correlated with cell proliferation rate. For drugs targeting the Akt/PI3K/mTOR pathway, dose-response curves were unusually shallow. Classical pharmacology has no ready explanation for this phenomenon, but single-cell analysis showed that it correlated with significant and heritable cell-to-cell variability in the extent of target inhibition. We conclude that parameters other than potency should be considered in the comparative analysis of drug response, particularly at clinically relevant concentrations near and above the IC50.",

        "abstract": "It is well recognized that most medications exhibit wide interpatient variability in their efficacy and toxicity. For many medications, these interindividual differences are due in part to polymorphisms in genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and/or drug targets (e.g., receptors, enzymes). Pharmacogenomics is a burgeoning field aimed at elucidating the genetic basis for differences in drug efficacy and toxicity, and it uses genome-wide approaches to identify the network of genes that govern an individual's response to drug therapy. For some genetic polymorphisms (e.g., thiopurine S-methyltransferase), monogenic traits have a marked effect on pharmacokinetics (e.g., drug metabolism), such that individuals who inherit an enzyme deficiency must be treated with markedly different doses of the affected medications (e.g., 5%-10% of the standard thiopurine dose). Likewise, polymorphisms in drug targets (e.g., beta adrenergic receptor) can alter the sensitivity of patients to treatment (e.g., beta-agonists), changing the pharmacodynamics of drug response. Recognizing that most drug effects are determined by the interplay of several gene products that govern the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medications, pharmacogenomics research aims to elucidate these polygenic determinants of drug effects. The ultimate goal is to provide new strategies for optimizing drug therapy based on each patient's genetic determinants of drug efficacy and toxicity. This chapter provides an overview of the current pharmacogenomics literature and offers insights for the potential impact of this field on the safe and effective use of medications.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: There are growing expectations that imaging biomarkers for tumor therapeutic drug response assessment will speed up preclinical testing of anticancer drugs in rodent models. The only imaging biomarker presently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is tumor size measurement based on either World Health Organization (WHO) criteria or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Frequently, preclinical data are accumulated from multiple research centers on multiple continents using scanners from different manufacturers and sometimes even using different imaging modalities. Very expensive cancer drug response studies can be compromised by inadequate controls to assure precision and accuracy of tumor size measurements. This project was undertaken to develop standardized quality assurance (QA) procedures using a multimodality preclinical tumor response phantom to validate the accuracy of tumor size measurements based on WHO criteria, RECIST, or global tumor volume criteria for evaluation of cytostatic drugs.\\n\\nMETHODS: A tumor response phantom containing five low contrast test objects designed to simulate animal tumor models was made of tissue-mimicking materials. Imaging of the phantom was performed using three modalities in two institutions to evaluate size measurement of tumor-simulating test objects.\\n\\nRESULTS: Evaluation of tumor measurements from the three commonly used imaging devices in two different institutions for monitoring tumor size changes showed that a single phantom for multiple modalities was feasible. The tumor response phantom validated precision and accuracy of tumor response data input from ultrasound, computed tomography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging devices.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Measurement results show that the standardized QA procedures using the tumor response phantom can provide a rationale check of data that excludes input from poorly maintained instruments, inadequate measurement protocols, or random operator error that frequently introduce unacceptable variability or systematic error in multiple institutions trials.",

We investigated the survival phenotype and the protein level of c-myc, a B-RAF target molecule, in melanoma cells, carrying a different mutational status in B-RAF, upon paclitaxel, doxorubicin and H2O2 treatment. For the first time, we reported c-myc modulation is critical for melanoma drug response. It appeared drug-specific and post-transcriptionally driven through PP2A; in correlation, cell pre-treatment with okadaic acid (OA), a specific PP2A inhibitor, as well as PP2A silencing of melanoma cells, was able to increase melanoma cell drug-sensitivity and c-myc protein level.

In this study, we demonstrate the application of an integrative, multidimensional approach in order to identify miRNAs that are associated with chemotherapeutic resistance and sensitivity utilizing publicly available drug response, miRNA loci copy number, miRNA expression, and mRNA expression data from independent resources. By instigating a logical stepwise strategy, we have identified specific miRNAs that are associated with resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents and provide a proof of principle demonstration of how these various databases may be exploited to derive relevant pharmacogenomic results.",

Targeted inhibitors of BRAF and its downstream effectors are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. These agents offer the possibility of greater efficacy and less toxicity than current therapies for tumors driven by oncogenic mutations in the MAPK pathway. Early clinical results with the BRAF-selective inhibitor PLX4032 suggest that this strategy will prove successful in a select group of patients whose tumors are driven by V600E BRAF. Relief of physiologic feedback upon pathway inhibition may, however, attenuate drug response and contribute to the development of acquired resistance. An improved understanding of the adaptive response of cancer cells to MAPK pathway inhibition may thus aid in the identification of those patients most likely to respond to targeted pathway inhibitors and provide a rational basis for tailored combination strategies.",

In order to develop new drugs and treatments, the physiology of these pathogenic protozoans has been studied in detail, specifically the significance of membrane transporters in host parasites interactions. Aquaporins and Aquaglyceroporins (AQPs) are a part of the major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) super-family. AQPs are characterized for their ability to facilitate the diffusion of water (aquaporin), glycerol (aquaglyceroporin), and other small-uncharged solutes. Furthermore, AQPs have been shown to allow the ubiquitous passage of some metalloids, such as trivalent arsenic and antimony. These trivalent metalloids are the active ingredient of a number of chemotherapeutic agents used against certain cancers and protozoan parasitic infections. Recently, the importance of the AQPs not only in osmotic adaptations but also as a factor in drug resistance of the trypanosomatid parasites has been reported. In this review, we will describe the physiological functions of aquaporins and their effect in drug response across the different trypanosomatids.",

We describe biological and behavioural sources of variability and how these contribute to the long-known efficacy-effectiveness gap. In this context, efficacy describes how a drug performs under conditions of clinical trials, whereas effectiveness describes how it performs under conditions of everyday clinical practice. We argue that a broad range of pre- and post-licensing technologies will need to be harnessed to bridge the efficacy-effectiveness gap. Successful approaches will not be limited to the current notion of pharmacogenomics-based personalized medicines, but will also entail the wider use of electronic health-care tools to improve drug prescribing and patient adherence.",

Liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MRM) is a versatile platform for biomarker measurement. In this study, we describe the development and use of the LC-MRM platform to study the adaptive signaling responses of melanoma cells to inhibitors of HSP90 (XL888) and MEK (AZD6244). XL888 had good anti-tumor activity against NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines as well as BRAF mutant cells with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo. LC-MRM analysis showed HSP90 inhibition to be associated with decreased expression of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, modules in the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, and the MAPK/CDK4 signaling axis in NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines and the inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling in BRAF mutant melanoma xenografts with acquired vemurafenib resistance. The LC-MRM approach targeting more than 80 cancer signaling proteins was highly sensitive and could be applied to fine needle aspirates from xenografts and clinical melanoma specimens (using 50 \u03bcg of total protein). We further showed MEK inhibition to be associated with signaling through the NF\u03baB and WNT signaling pathways, as well as increased receptor tyrosine kinase expression and activation. Validation studies identified PDGF receptor \u03b2 signaling as a potential escape mechanism from MEK inhibition, which could be overcome through combined use of AZD6244 and the PDGF receptor inhibitor, crenolanib. Together, our studies show LC-MRM to have unique value as a platform for the systems level understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drug response and therapeutic escape. This work provides the proof-of-principle for the future development of LC-MRM assays for monitoring drug responses in the clinic.",

We summarize some of the perceptual aspects discussed by Ropeik (2008) and comment on decision-making by the single decision-maker. It seems that the heuristics discussed by Ropeik (2008) are related to those private decision-makers who may not benefit from extensive technical, scientific, and legal advice sufficiently to make well-informed decisions and, perhaps more importantly, may not have the funds for that advice. Dose-response models are intangible, abstract quantities: unlike private goods and services, they are not priced by the market. We suggest a duality between the private and the public decision-maker that in the end may loose its crispness, because it can occur in the same person. Nonetheless, this duality is evident at the analysis phase of decision-making, relative to the decision phase, and thus, provides a convenient way to address the issues addressed by Ropeik (2008). In particular, for at least legal and common sense reasons, the public decision-maker must follow a scientific-analytical causal process - as represented by models of dose-response - to select and justify her choice of one over the other. Whether the final decision as to which model is to be used in regulatory law is a matter that goes beyond the analytical aspects of the choice and is governed by political and other aspects of governance.",

        "abstract": "Interest in polyamine catabolism has increased since it has been directly associated with the cytotoxic response of multiple tumour types to exposure to specific anti-tumour polyamine analogues. Human polyamine catabolism was considered to be a two-step pathway regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) that provides substrate for an acetylpolyamine oxidase (APAO). Further, the super-induction of SSAT by several anti-tumour polyamine analogues has been implicated in the cytotoxic response of specific solid-tumour phenotypes to these agents. This high induction of SSAT has been correlated with cellular response to the anti-tumour polyamine analogues in several systems and considerable progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate the analogue-induced expression of SSAT. A polyamine response element has been identified and the transacting transcription factors that bind and stimulate transcription of SSAT have been cloned and characterized. The link between SSAT activity and cellular toxicity is thought to be based on the production of H(2)O(2) by the activity of the constitutive APAO that uses the SSAT-produced acetylated polyamines. The high induction of SSAT and the subsequent activity of APAO are linked to the cytotoxic response of some tumour cell types to specific polyamine analogues. However, we have recently cloned a variably spliced human polyamine oxidase (PAOh1) that is inducible by specific polyamine analogues, efficiently uses unacetylated spermine as a substrate, and also produces toxic H(2)O(2) as a product. The results of studies with PAOh1 suggest that it is an additional enzyme in polyamine catabolism that has the potential to significantly contribute to polyamine homoeostasis and drug response. Most importantly, PAOh1 is induced by specific polyamine analogues in a tumour-phenotype-specific manner in cell lines representative of the major forms of solid tumours, including lung, breast, colon and prostate. The sensitivity to these anti-tumour polyamine analogues can be significantly reduced if the tumour cells are co-treated with 250 microM of the polyamine oxidase inhibitor N (1), N (4)-bis(2,3-butadienyl)-1,4-butanediamine (MDL 72,527), suggesting that the H(2)O(2) produced by PAOh1 does in fact play a direct role in the observed cytotoxicity. These results strongly implicate PAOh1 as a new target that, in combination with SSAT, may be exploited for therapeutic advantage. The current understanding of the role and regulation of these two important polyamine catabolic enzymes are discussed.",

In this study, a rapid and high-throughput in vitro drug response assay was developed using a combination of microwell array and molecular imaging. The microwell array provided high-throughput analysis of drug response, which was quantified based on the reduction in intracellular uptake (2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-D-glucose) (2-NBDG). Using this synergistic approach, the drug response measurement was completed within 4 h, and only a couple thousand cells were needed for quantification. The broader application of this microwell molecular imaging approach was demonstrated by evaluating the drug response of two cancer cell lines, cervical (HeLa) and bladder (5637) cancer cells, to two distinct classes of chemotherapy drugs (cisplatin and paclitaxel). This approach did not require an extended cell culturing period, and the quantification of cellular drug response was 4-16 times faster compared with other cell-microarray drug response studies. Moreover, this molecular imaging approach had comparable sensitivity to traditional cell viability assays, i.e., the MTT assay and propidium iodide labeling of cellular nuclei;and similar throughput results as flow cytometry using only 1,000-2,000 cells. Given the simplicity and robustness of this microwell molecular imaging approach, it is anticipated that the assay can be adapted to quantify drug responses in a wide range of cancer cells and drugs and translated to clinical settings for a rapid in vitro drug response using clinically isolated samples.",

Inflammation presents in a variety of acute and chronic disease states and can contribute to disease resolution or progression depending upon the type, magnitude and duration of response. Importantly, it has been shown to modulate pharmacokinetic processes leading to variability in therapeutic drug response. Membrane-associated drug transporters are important determinants of drug disposition and pharmacokinetics and we, among others, have identified inflammation-mediated changes in their expression and regulation. Here, we discuss the current state of knowledge on drug transporter expression during acute and chronic inflammatory conditions and postulate how the altered expression of these transporters may modify the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clinically important therapeutics. As understanding determinants of interpatient variability in therapeutic drug response is essential to the practice of medicine, this area of research warrants future clinical focus.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacogenomics seeks to explain the variability in drug response. Neurotransmitter transporters from the SLCA6 family are direct or indirect targets for psychotropic drugs, and their genetic variations may directly influence response to antidepressant or antipsychotic drugs. Furthermore, drug transporters located in natural barriers, such as the blood brain barrier, may influence response to psychoactive substrates. In the 5'-upstream regulatory region of the neuronal serotonin transporter lays a 44-base pair insertion/deletion polymorphism resulting in a long and a short variant. Several studies have reported a better response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in individuals carrying two long alleles, however, some studies report contradictory results. Moreover, several genetic variants are known in the human norepinephrine transporter gene, and though one study reports differences in antidepressant response due to the NET G1287A polymorphism, results should be replicated by others before conclusions can be drawn. Dopamine transporters play an important role in psychotropic drug response, and a variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of the dopamine transporter gene has been studied in regards to possible correlation with antipsychotic drug response but without showing an association. P-glycoprotein has been shown to influence drug concentrations in CNS but so far, the studies on genetic polymorphisms did not show effects on the phenotype of response.Thus, several studies have looked at the influence of genetic polymorphisms on psychotropic drug response gaining different results. Best evidence exists for the serotonin transporter polymorphism influencing the response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors but the effects are relatively small. So far, transporter genotypes are not yet eligible for individual prediction of drug response.",

        "abstract": "In the last few years, DNA methylation has become one of the most studied gene regulation mechanisms in carcinogenesis as a result of the cumulative evidence produced by the scientific community. Moreover, advances in the technologies that allow detection of DNA methylation in a variety of analytes have opened the possibility of developing methylation-based tests. A number of studies have provided evidence that specific methylation changes can alter the response to different therapeutic agents in cancer and, therefore, be useful biomarkers. For example, the association of the methylation status of DNA repair genes such as MGMT and MLH1 illustrate the two main mechanisms of response to DNA damaging agents. Loss of methylation of MGMT, and the subsequent increase in gene expression, leads to a reduction in response to alkylating agents as a result of enhanced repair of drug-induced DNA damage. Conversely, the increase in methylation of MLH1 and its resulting loss of expression has been consistently observed in drug-resistant tumor cells. MLH1 encodes a mismatch repair enzyme activated in response to DNA damage; activation of MLH1 also induces apoptosis of tumor cells, and thus loss of its expression leads to resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Other methylation-regulated genes that could serve as biomarkers in cancer therapy include drug transporters, genes involved in microtubule formation and stability, and genes related to hormonal therapy response. These methylation markers have potential applications for disease prognosis, treatment response prediction, and the development of novel treatment strategies.",

At the same time, reasonably comprehensive molecular data such as gene expression, proteomic and metabolomic data are now available for collections of hundreds to thousands of individuals. If these data are structured in a statistically robust and computationally tractable way, such as a network model, they can aid in the analysis of new pharmacogenomics studies by suggesting novel hypotheses for the regulation of genes involved in drug metabolism and response. Similarly, hypotheses taken from these same models can direct genome-wide association studies by focusing the genome-wide association studies analysis on a number of specific hypotheses informed by the relationships customarily seen between a gene's expression or protein activity and genetic variation at a particular locus. Network models based on other sorts of systematic biological data such as cell-based surveys of drug effect on gene expression and mining of literature and electronic medical records for associations between clinical and molecular phenotypes also promise similar utility. Although surely primitive in comparison with what will be developed, these model-based approaches to leveraging the increasing volume of data generated in the course of patient care and medical research nevertheless suggest a huge opportunity to improve our understanding of biological systems involved in pharmacogenomics and apply them to questions of medical relevance.",

Furthermore, combining biochemical profiles with genomic information was better at predicting drug response.

Even in the presence of symptomatic etiology of epilepsy--focal seizures and syndromes; high seizure frequency prior to or during treatment; seizure clustering; and poor or delayed response to first adequate drug therapy--up to 60% of children with treated epilepsy are able to enter long-term remission.

We determined the in vitro drug response profiles for 478 biopsy specimens from patients with the following malignant glial histologies: astrocytoma (n = 71), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 39), glioblastoma multiforme (n = 259), oligodendroglioma (n = 40), and glioma (n = 69). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Samples were tested for drug resistance to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), cisplatin, dacarbazine, paclitaxel, vincristine, and irinotecan. Biomarkers associated with drug resistance were detected by immunohistochemistry, including multidrug resistance gene-1, glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1), O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and mutant p53. RESULTS: In vitro drug resistance in malignant gliomas was independent of prior therapy. High-grade glioblastomas showed a lower level of extreme drug resistance than low-grade astrocytomas to cisplatin (11% versus 27%), temozolomide (14% versus 27%), irinotecan (33% versus 53%), and BCNU (29% versus 38%). A substantial percentage of brain tumors overexpressed biomarkers associated with drug resistance, including MGMT (67%), GSTP1 (49%), and mutant p53 (41%). MGMT and GSTP1 overexpression was independently associated with in vitro resistance to BCNU, whereas coexpression of these two markers was associated with the greatest degree of BCNU resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of in vitro drug response and profiles of relevant tumor-associated biomarkers may assist the clinician in stratifying patient treatment regimens.",

We determined the in vitro drug response profiles for 478 biopsy specimens from patients with the following malignant glial histologies: astrocytoma (n = 71), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 39), glioblastoma multiforme (n = 259), oligodendroglioma (n = 40), and glioma (n = 69). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Samples were tested for drug resistance to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), cisplatin, dacarbazine, paclitaxel, vincristine, and irinotecan. Biomarkers associated with drug resistance were detected by immunohistochemistry, including multidrug resistance gene-1, glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1), O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and mutant p53. RESULTS: In vitro drug resistance in malignant gliomas was independent of prior therapy. High-grade glioblastomas showed a lower level of extreme drug resistance than low-grade astrocytomas to cisplatin (11% versus 27%), temozolomide (14% versus 27%), irinotecan (33% versus 53%), and BCNU (29% versus 38%). A substantial percentage of brain tumors overexpressed biomarkers associated with drug resistance, including MGMT (67%), GSTP1 (49%), and mutant p53 (41%). MGMT and GSTP1 overexpression was independently associated with in vitro resistance to BCNU, whereas coexpression of these two markers was associated with the greatest degree of BCNU resistance.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many pharmaceutical drugs are known to be ineffective or have negative side effects in a substantial proportion of patients. Genomic advances are revealing that some non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) may cause differences in drug efficacy and side effects. Therefore, it is desirable to evaluate nsSNVs of interest in their ability to modulate the drug response.\\nRESULTS: We found that the available data on the link between drug response and nsSNV is rather modest. There were only 31 distinct drug response-altering (DR-altering) and 43 distinct drug response-neutral (DR-neutral) nsSNVs in the whole Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB). However, even with this modest dataset, it was clear that existing bioinformatics tools have difficulties in correctly predicting the known DR-altering and DR-neutral nsSNVs. They exhibited an overall accuracy of less than 50%, which was not better than random diagnosis. We found that the underlying problem is the markedly different evolutionary properties between positions harboring nsSNVs linked to drug responses and those observed for inherited diseases. To solve this problem, we developed a new diagnosis method, Drug-EvoD, which was trained on the evolutionary properties of nsSNVs associated with drug responses in a sparse learning framework. Drug-EvoD achieves a TPR of 84% and a TNR of 53%, with a balanced accuracy of 69%, which improves upon other methods significantly.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The new tool will enable researchers to computationally identify nsSNVs that may affect drug responses. However, much larger training and testing datasets are needed to develop more reliable and accurate tools.\\n",

The cellular mechanisms of drug resistance include the overexpression of energy-dependent transporters that eject anticancer drugs from cells such as p-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance related protein (MRP), the mutation of drug targets, the activation of DNA repair pathways, the defects in cellular death pathways and so on. The genetic and epigenetic changes of these genes can lead to cancer drug resistance. Among these mechanisms, microRNAs (miRNAs) which are critical and essential for many important processes such as development, differentiation, and even carcinogenesis have been reported to regulate the chemo-sensitivity of tumor cells. In this paper we briefly review the relationship between miRNA and cancer drug resistance.",

In the course of attempting to map genes for drug response using 269 LCLs from the International HapMap Project, we evaluated the extent to which biological noise and non-genetic confounders contribute to trait variability in LCLs. While drug responses could be technically well measured on a given day, we observed significant day-to-day variability and substantial correlation to non-genetic confounders, such as baseline growth rates and metabolic state in culture. After correcting for these confounders, we were unable to detect any QTLs with genome-wide significance for drug response. A much higher proportion of variance in mRNA levels may be attributed to non-genetic factors (intra-individual variance--i.e., biological noise, levels of the EBV virus used to transform the cells, ATP levels) than to detectable eQTLs. Finally, in an attempt to improve power, we focused analysis on those genes that had both detectable eQTLs and correlation to drug response; we were unable to detect evidence that eQTL SNPs are convincingly associated with drug response in the model. While LCLs are a promising model for pharmacogenetic experiments, biological noise and in vitro artifacts may reduce power and have the potential to create spurious association due to confounding.",

To investigate this, we developed a more clinically relevant onychomycosis in vitro test model. Human nail powder inoculated with T. rubrum and incubated in liquid RPMI 1640 salt medium, which did not support growth alone, developed extensive and invasive mycelial growth. Antifungal drugs were added at different concentrations and cultures incubated for 1 to 4 weeks. Fungal survival was determined by spreading cultures on PDA plates without drug and measuring CFU after 1 to 4 weeks incubation. Drug activity was expressed as the nail minimum fungicidal concentration (Nail-MFC) required for 99.9% elimination of viable fungus. Terbinafine Nail-MFC was 4 mg/ml after 1 week exposure, decreasing to 1 mg/ml / after 4 weeks exposure, much higher than MFCs 5 0.03 mg/ml determined in standard NCCLS MIC assays. In contrast, other clinically used drugs were unable to kill T. rubrum after 4 weeks incubation in this model. Invasive mycelial growth on nail appears to protect T. rubrum from the cidal action of systemic drugs, thus providing a rationale for the long treatment periods in onychomycosis.",

        "abstract": "An insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been described in chromosome 17q23 of the human genome. Subjects with the genotype DD have markedly higher plasma ACE levels than those with genotype II; although ACE concentration in plasma is not rate-limiting for the production of angiotensin II, it has been suggested that the renin-angiotensin system may have an enhanced role in cardiovascular homeostasis in subjects with DD genotype or D allele. Meta-analysis confirmed the association of the D allele with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, but these relations are still uncertain with longevity and renal deterioration. Otherwise, I allele seems to be related with an improved response to physical training. The I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene is not a marker for any form of hypertension, though some conflicting results have been described. Nevertheless this polymorphism may have an influence on the antihypertensive response, particularly when using ACE inhibitors (ACEI). For example, blood pressure normalization with captopril in patients suffering from cardiac failure would be more effective in II genotype; conversely, both regression in left ventricular hypertrophy and improvement in diastolic filling would be greater after long-term treatment with enalapril in patients with essential hypertension and DD genotype. Conflicting results were also described using ACEI as a renoprotective therapy. This review therefore supports the justification for further evaluation in appropriately powered studies.",

Numerous methods have been proposed towards this end, most of them focusing on novel statistical methods and model selection techniques that attempt to uncover groups of genes, whose expression profiles are directly and robustly correlated with drug response. However, biological systems process information through the crosstalk of multiple signaling networks, whose ultimate phenotypic consequences may only be determined by the combined input of relevant interacting systems. By restricting predictive signatures to direct gene-drug correlations, biologically meaningful interactions that may serve as superior predictors are ignored. Here we demonstrate that predictive signatures, which incorporate the interaction between background gene expression patterns and individual predictive probes, can provide superior models than those that directly relate gene expression levels to pharmacological response, and thus should be more widely utilized in pharmacogenetic studies.",

It also provides an interface between environment and the genotype leading to functional plasticity of the genome. While drug response can be modulated by the epigenome, the therapeutic intervention by drugs can also be considered as an environmental cue for epigenetic alterations. The effect of genetic polymorphism has accrued considerable interest and population polymorphism leading to variation in drug response is being studied extensively. The available data on the epigenetic marking of the whole genome in different contexts implies that no biological pathway or process in the mammalian system is free of epigenetic influence and thus, drug metabolism would not be an exception. In the light of the fact that the epigenome is not only variable between individuals, but that it also varies between different tissues of the same individual and with the age of the individual, it is still a long journey to transit from the correlation to causal relationship between drug response and the epigenomic variations. The present review is focused on recent developments in the area and a brief discussion of the future prospects and challenges.",

From RNA-seq data obtained for adult male and female sea lice, 62.48M reads were assembled in 70,349 high-quality contigs. BLASTX analysis against UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot and the ESTs available for crustaceans in the NCBI database identified 870 transcripts previously related to genes associated with delousing drug response. Furthermore, 14 candidate genes were validated through RT-qPCR and were evaluated with deltamethrin and azamethiphos bioassays. The results evidenced an overregulation of genes involved in ion transport in salmon lice treated with deltamethrin, while those treated with azamethiphos evidenced an overregulation of genes such as cytochrome P450, Carboxylesterase, and acetylcholine receptors.

We aimed to determine the effect of the ABCB1 gene on epilepsy drug response, using a unique large cohort of epilepsy patients with prospectively measured seizure and drug response outcomes. Methods: The ABCB1 3435C???T polymorphism and three-SNP haplotype, plus a comprehensive set of tag SNPs across ABCB1 and adjacent ABCB4, were genotyped in a cohort of 503 epilepsy patients with prospectively measured seizure and drug response outcomes. Clinical, demographic, and genetic data were analysed. Treatment outcome was measured in terms of time to 12-month remission, time to first seizure, and time to drug withdrawal due to inadequate seizure control or side-effects. Randomly selected genome-wide HapMap SNPs (n=129) were genotyped in all patients for genomic control. Findings: Number of seizures before treatment was the dominant feature predicting seizure outcome after starting antiepileptic drug therapy, measured by both time to first seizure (hazard ratio 1??34, 95% CI 1??21-1??49, p<0??0001) and time to 12-month remission (0??83, 0??73-0??94, p=0??003). There was no association of the ABCB1 3435C???T polymorphism, the three-SNP haplotype, or any gene-wide tag SNP with time to first seizure after starting drug therapy, time to 12-month remission, or time to drug withdrawal due to unacceptable side-effects or to lack of seizure control. Interpretation: We found no evidence that ABCB1 common variation influences either seizure or drug withdrawal outcomes after initiation of antiepileptic drug therapy. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy are resistant to treatment with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). The ABC drug transporter proteins are hypothesized to mediate drug resistance in epilepsy. More recently, a non-ABC putative transporter, RLIP76, has also been proposed to be involved in the mechanism of pharmacoresistance. One previous association study of six polymorphisms in RLIP76 failed to find any association with drug resistance in a retrospective cohort of epilepsy patients. We aimed to look for an association with outcomes reflecting drug response in a larger prospective cohort, with gene-wide coverage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the role of common polymorphisms in RLIP76 in epilepsy pharmacoresistance by genotyping 23 common RLIP76 polymorphisms in a prospective cohort of 503 epilepsy patients, from the standard and new anti-epileptic drugs (SANAD) prospective study of new and old AEDs. A total of 13 of these were tested for association with four outcomes reflecting response to drugs: time to first seizure, time to 12-month remission, time to withdrawal due to inadequate seizure control, and time to withdrawal due to unacceptable adverse drug events. RESULTS: No significant associations, allowing for multiple testing, were found in the whole cohort. There was also no effect in a subgroup of patients on carbamazepine, which is thought to be a RLIP76 substrate, although two polymorphisms were associated with time to first seizure (p = 0.007). DISCUSSION: We failed to demonstrate any association between RLIP76 polymorphisms and four different measures of drug response in the larger cohort, but a subgroup analysis of patients receiving carbamazepine suggested an association that should be investigated further. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that common variants in RLIP76 are unlikely to contribute to epilepsy drug response.",

Genes associated with drug response can provide insight to understand the mechanisms of drug resistance, identify promising therapeutic opportunities, and facilitate personalized treatment. Estrogen receptor (ER) positive and ER negative breast cancer have distinct clinical behavior and molecular properties. However, to date, few studies have rigorously assessed drug response genes in them. In this study, our goal was to systematically identify genes associated with multidrug response in ER positive and ER negative breast cancer cell lines. We tested 27 human breast cell lines for response to seven chemotherapeutic agents (cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, epirubicin, fluorouracil, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel). We integrated publicly available gene expression profiles of these cell lines with their in vitro drug response patterns, then applied meta-analysis to identify genes related to multidrug response in ER positive and ER negative cells separately. One hundred eighty-eight genes were identified as related to multidrug response in ER positive and 32 genes in ER negative breast cell lines. Of these, only three genes (DBI, TOP2A, and PMVK) were common to both cell types. TOP2A was positively associated with drug response, and DBI was negatively associated with drug response. Interestingly, PMVK was positively associated with drug response in ER positive cells and negatively in ER negative cells. Functional analysis showed that while cell cycle affects drug response in both ER positive and negative cells, most biological processes that are involved in drug response are distinct. A number of signaling pathways that are uniquely enriched in ER positive cells have complex cross talk with ER signaling, while in ER negative cells, enriched pathways are related to metabolic functions. Taken together, our analysis indicates that distinct mechanisms are involved in multidrug response in ER positive and ER negative breast cells.",

A number of cell culture platforms have been developed in recent years to improve predictivity and further to elucidate the mechanisms governing the differing responses observed in vitro versus in vivo. One detrimental aspect of current in vitro models is their inability to decouple the effect of different extrinsic factors on the responsiveness of the cells to drug treatment. Here, we have used an engineered poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microwell array as a reductionist approach to study the effect of environmental parameters, independently of each other. It is observed for MCF-7 breast cancer cells, that culture within the three-dimensional (3D) environment of the microwells alone had an effect on the response to Taxol and results in a reduction of cell death in comparison to cells cultured on flat substrates. Additionally the microwells allowed the response of single versus multicell clusters to be differentiated. It was found that the formation of cell-cell contacts alters the drug response, depending on the type of adhesive protein present. Thus, with this microwell platform it is revealed that the presence of cell-cell contacts in addition to the dimensionality and the matrix composition of the environment are important mediators of altered drug responses. In conclusion the microwell array can not only serve as a platform to reveal which parameters of the extracellular environment affect drug response but further the interdependence of these parameters.",

The aim of this study was to better understand the relationship between morphine and butorphanol analgesic efficacy tested against multiple pain modalities within the same individuals. Participants included healthy men (n = 72) and women (n = 67) who underwent thermal, pressure, and ischemic experimental pain testing before and after the double-blind administration of morphine and butorphanol during separate testing sessions. Factor analysis revealed 6 factors with analgesic effects grouped primarily by pain modality and specific to either morphine or butorphanol. Hierarchical cluster analysis of individual factor scores led to 4 distinct drug response profiles. Three groups displayed exceptional analgesic efficacy produced by 1 type of opioid on 1 pain stimulus modality, whereas the fourth drug response profile was characterized by average analgesic efficacy across all pain modalities for both opioids. These findings suggest that opioids with varying efficacy at the ?? and ?? receptors produce independent effects on unique pain mechanisms and that individual responsiveness for some is dependent on pain mechanism and opioid type, although a subset of the population is moderately responsive to opioids regardless of efficacy of receptor binding or predominant pain mechanism being activated. Perspective: This investigation provides a foundation for understanding patterns of opioid efficacy in varying types of pain. Our findings suggest that opioid response patterns are more complex than originally thought with about half of individuals exhibiting opioid and pain modality specific analgesic response profiles. ?? 2011 by the American Pain Society.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To determine whether conventional contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) could be used to identify imaging phenotypes associated with a doxorubicin drug response gene expression program in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using an integrated imaging-genomic approach. Materials and Methods: Thirty HCCs were analyzed and scored individually across six predefined imaging phenotypes. Unsupervised and supervised bioinformatics analyses were performed to correlate the imaging scores with the corresponding tumor microarray data (each microarray contained gene expression measurements across ???18,000 genes) to identify relationships between the imaging traits and underlying tumor gene expression. Enrichment for a predefined doxorubicin-response gene expression program was then performed against the imaging phenotype-associated genes and enrichment determined. Results: An imaging phenotype related to tumor margins on arterial phase images demonstrated significant correlation with the doxorubicin-response transcriptional program (P < .05, q < 0.1). It was also significantly associated with HCC venous invasion and tumor stage (P < .05, q < 0.1). Tumors with higher tumor margin scores were more strongly associated with the doxorubicin resistance transcriptional program and had a greater prevalence of venous invasion and worse stage. Tumors with lower tumor margin scores, however, demonstrated a converse relationship. Conclusions: It is possible to identify HCC imaging phenotypes at CT that correlate with a doxorubicin drug response gene expression program. Given the role of doxorubicin in regional therapies for HCC management, it is possible that such an approach could be used to guide HCC therapy on a tumor-by-tumor basis on the basis of underlying tumor gene expression patterns. ?? 2007 SIR.",

Specimens were obtained from 115 patients with endometrial cancer treated at Keio University Hospital between 1994 and 2002. Tumor fragments were cultured on collagen sponge gel with cisplatin for 7 days, and cell viability was assessed. The cutoff value of the 50% inhibitory concentration of cisplatin was set at 23 microg/mL. Sensitivity of stage III or IV disease to chemotherapy was investigated, and differences of 5-year progression-free survival between patients with sensitive and resistant tumors were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Tumors were evaluable in 93.0% of patients (107/115). Among 38 patients in stages III or IV, 23 received chemotherapy containing cisplatin. Seven sensitive tumors did not recur, while recurrence/progression occurred within 6 months in 8/16 patients with tumors showing low sensitivity. Among stages III and IV patients, there was a significant difference of 5-year progression-free survival (P < 0.05) between those with tumors showing high or low sensitivity. Accordingly, the HDRA may predict the efficacy of chemotherapy for endometrial cancer.",

EEG power analysis was performed by both conventional fixed frequency band and adjusted frequency band based on individual alpha frequency (IAF) in 16 drug-naive patients before and after drug administration. In the theta bands determined by both conventional fixed band and IAF methods, the EEG power after treatment was larger than that before treatment. In addition, there was a correlation between EEG power and clinical drug response evaluated by changes in BPRS score. With regard to this correlation, IAF methods showed no apparent advantage over methods using conventional fixed frequency bands. Conventional quantitative EEG analysis can still serve as a useful tool for the assessment of short-term outcome of drug treatment.",

        "abstract": "Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, uses a cascade of enzymes that include cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase (cTXNPx) for detoxification of peroxides, an event pivotal for survival of digenic parasites living in two disparate biological environments. In this study, we observed an increase in promastigote cTXNPx levels after exposure to H(2)O(2) and this group did not show any cell death; however, exposure to a combination of H(2)O(2) and nitric oxide resulted in significant reduction of cTXNPx levels accompanied by high cell death. The protective relationship between higher levels of cTXNPx and survival was further substantiated by the improved ability of L. donovani promastigotes overexpressing cTXNPx to withstand exposure to H(2)O(2) and nitric oxide combination as compared with vector transfectants. In addition, cTXNPx transfectants demonstrated increased virulence, causing higher parasite burden in macrophages as compared with vector transfectants. Interestingly, the cTXNPx transfectants as promastigotes or amastigotes were resistant to clearance by the anti-leishmanial drug antimony, suggesting a cTXNPx link to drug response. Mechanistically, cTXNPx overexpression was protective against changes in Ca(2+) homeostasis but not against mitochondrial hyperpolarization brought about by exposure to H(2)O(2) and nitric oxide. Therefore, this study provides a link between cTXNPx expression to survival, virulence and drug response in L. donovani.",

The Olympus IV100 Laser Scanning Microscope, with ultra-narrow microscope objectives (\"stick objectives\"), is used for three-color whole-body imaging of the two-color cancer cells interacting with the GFP-expressing stromal cells. In this model, drug response of both cancer and stromal cells in the intact live animal is also imaged in real time. Various in vivo phenomena of tumor-host interaction and cellular dynamics were imaged, including mitotic and apoptotic tumor cells, stromal cells interacting with the tumor cells, tumor vasculature, and tumor blood flow. This new model system enables the first cellular and subcellular images of unperturbed tumors in the live intact animal. New visible real-time targets for novel anticancer agents are provided in this model, including the color-coded interacting cancer and stromal cells, tumor vasculature, and blood flow. This imageable model should lead to many new insights of in vivo cancer cell biology and to novel drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "The cardiac potassium channel encoded by the human ether-\u00e0-go-go related gene (HERG) is blocked by a diverse array of common therapeutic compounds. Even transient exposure to such agents may provoke the life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia torsades de pointes in some, but not all, individuals. Although the molecular and genetic factors predicting such wide variability in drug response remain unclear, known sequence variations within the coding region of HERG do not explain the adverse drug response in many cases. Although other proteins can modulate HERG function, no studies have identified protein partners capable of limiting the pharmacological sensitivity of HERG. Here we show that KCR1, a protein identified previously in rat cerebellum, is a plasma membrane-associated protein expressed at the RNA level in the human heart and can be immunoprecipitated with HERG. Functionally, KCR1 reduces the sensitivity of HERG to classic proarrhythmic HERG blockers (sotalol, quinidine, dofetilide) in both cardiac and noncardiac cell lines. We propose that KCR1, when coupled to HERG, may limit the sensitivity of HERG to proarrhythmic drug blockade and may be a rational target for modifying the proarrhythmic effects of otherwise clinically useful compounds.",

Methods typically select single biomarkers or groups of related biomarkers but do not account for response that is strictly dependent on many simultaneous genetic alterations. This shortcoming reflects the combinatorics and multiple-testing problem associated with many-body biologic interactions. We developed a novel approach, Multivariate Organization of Combinatorial Alterations (MOCA), to partially address these challenges. Extending on previous work that accounts for pairwise interactions, the approach rapidly combines many genomic alterations into biomarkers of drug response, using Boolean set operations coupled with optimization; in this framework, the union, intersection, and difference Boolean set operations are proxies of molecular redundancy, synergy, and resistance, respectively. The algorithm is fast, broadly applicable to cancer genomics data, is of immediate use for prioritizing cancer pharmacogenomics experiments, and recovers known clinical findings without bias. Furthermore, the results presented here connect many important, previously isolated observations. Cancer Res; 73(6); 1-10. \u00a92012 AACR.",

        "abstract": "Deconvoluting the molecular target signals behind observed drug response phenotypes is an important part of phenotype-based drug discovery and repurposing efforts. We demonstrate here how our network-based deconvolution approach, named target addiction score (TAS), provides insights into the functional importance of druggable protein targets in cell-based drug sensitivity testing experiments. Using cancer cell line profiling data sets, we constructed a functional classification across 107 cancer cell models, based on their common and unique target addiction signatures. The pan-cancer addiction correlations could not be explained by the tissue of origin, and only correlated in part with molecular and genomic signatures of the heterogeneous cancer cells. The TAS-based cancer cell classification was also shown to be robust to drug response data resampling, as well as predictive of the transcriptomic patterns in an independent set of cancer cells that shared similar addiction signatures with the 107 cancers. The critical protein targets identified by the integrated approach were also shown to have clinically relevant mutation frequencies in patients with various cancer subtypes, including not only well-established pan-cancer genes, such as PTEN tumor suppressor, but also a number of targets that are less frequently mutated in specific cancer types, including ABL1 oncoprotein in acute myeloid leukemia. An application to leukemia patient primary cell models demonstrated how the target deconvolution approach offers functional insights into patient-specific addiction patterns, such as those indicative of their receptor-type tyrosine-protein kinase FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) status and co-addiction partners, which may lead to clinically actionable, personalized drug treatment developments. To promote its application to the future drug testing studies, we have made available an open-source implementation of the TAS calculation in the form of a stand-alone R package.",

The assertion that these drug administration instructions bias estimates of effectiveness has undergone surprisingly little empirical investigation. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to determine whether drug administration instructions informing subjects of a placebo condition affect the drug response and affect the saliva concentration of the stimulant. METHODS: We assessed caffeine responses and levels of saliva concentration of caffeine in 52 subjects who were randomly assigned to receive one of two drug administration instructions: (a) placebo-informed instructions (i.e., individuals informed of the placebo) analogous to those used in double-blind studies and (b) placebo-uninformed instructions (i.e., individuals informed they are taking an active stimulant). RESULTS: On most measures (systolic blood pressure, heart rate, hand steadiness, reaction time, fatigue, and tension), drug administration instructions did not significantly influence caffeine response. Instructions also had no significant effect on saliva concentration of caffeine. However, only individuals who were uninformed of the placebo condition showed significant diastolic blood pressure and vigor increases with 125 mg caffeine, and significant hand steadiness impairment and vigor increases with 325 mg caffeine compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These overall findings suggest that a limited bias is introduced by drug administration instructions. The results do not support any suggestion that information about the existence of a placebo condition dramatically influences conclusions drawn about drug responses in placebo-controlled trials.",

        "abstract": "Bevacizumab is the fi rst vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted agent shown to increase survival in patients receiving first- and second-line intravenous 5-FU-based chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Bevacizumab is typically well tolerated and its major side effects include hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding, gastrointestinal perforation and arterial thrombotic events. Although exfoliative dermatitis has been described as a side effect in 19% of patients, skin rash (type unspecified) has rarely been described in patients following infusion of bevacizumab. We recently reported the fi rst patient with colon cancer manifesting a correlation between rash and a positive drug response with bevacizumab. A 49-year old male with T3 N1 M1 rectal carcinoma received modified FOLFOX-6/bevacizumab, which he tolerated very well except for grade 2 skin rash related to bevacizumab. The rash continued to progress as the serum carcinoembryonic antigen decreased significantly. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography scan confirmed response to FOLFOX/bevacizumab. We therefore believe that this rash was linked to bevacizumab administration and correlated with response to therapy. Grade 1/2 rash has been described in patients after infusion of bevacizumab in initial phase I and II studies. Skin rash was observed in 34% and 46% of patients in the Kabbinavar's study receiving 5 mg/kg dose and 10 mg/kg respectively but no patient developed > grade 3 rash. This toxicity was not well described in pivotal phase III studies. On the other hand, acneiform rash occurs in > 90% patients who receive cetuximab and panitumumab, severity of which appears to be predictive of response. To our knowledge, this case report is the second report of possible correlation between rash and a positive drug response associated with bevacizumab and warrants further investigation of similar observation.",

        "abstract": "This article reviews several techniques from machine learning that can be used to study the problem of identifying a small number of features, from among tens of thousands of measured features, that can accurately predict a drug response. Prediction problems are divided into two categories: sparse classification and sparse regression. In classification, the clinical parameter to be predicted is binary, whereas in regression, the parameter is a real number. Well-known methods for both classes of problems are briefly discussed. These include the SVM (support vector machine) for classification and various algorithms such as ridge regression, LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), and EN (elastic net) for regression. In addition, several well-established methods that do not directly fall into machine learning theory are also reviewed, including neural networks, PAM (pattern analysis for microarrays), SAM (significance analysis for microarrays), GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis), and k-means clustering. Several references indicative of the application of these methods to cancer biology are discussed.",

Here, we show that SNPs are highly enriched at mouse strain-selective adipose tissue binding sites for PPAR??, a nuclear receptor for anti-diabetic drugs. Many such SNPs alter binding motifs for PPAR?? or cooperating factors and functionally regulate nearby genes whose expression is strain selective and imbalanced in heterozygous F1 mice. Moreover, genetically determined binding of PPAR?? accounts for mouse strain-specific transcriptional effects of TZD drugs, providing proof of concept for personalized medicine related to nuclear receptor genomic occupancy. In human fat, motif-altering SNPs cause differential PPAR?? binding, provide a molecular mechanism for some expression quantitative trait loci, and are risk factors for dysmetabolic traits in genome-wide association studies. One PPAR?? motif-altering SNP is associated with HDL levels and other metabolic syndrome parameters. Thus, natural genetic variation in PPAR?? genomic occupancy determines individual disease risk and drug response.",

We define and test a new collection based on gene co-expression in cancer cell lines to compare the performance of the standard collections to an externally derived cell line based collection. The results show that GSEA findings vary significantly depending on the collection chosen for analysis. Henceforth, collections should be carefully selected and reported in studies that leverage GSEA.",

We demonstrate both the reproducibility and the clinical translatability of this approach by identifying associations between a genotype and drug response, and established mechanisms of resistance. In addition, our results suggest that PCTs may represent a more accurate approach than cell line models for assessing the clinical potential of some therapeutic modalities.

The genetic polymorphism of the CYP2D6 influences plasma concentration of a wide variety of drugs metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme, including antipsychotic drugs used for schizophrenia treatment. Additionally, CYP2D6 is involved in the metabolism of endogenous substrates in the brain, and reported to be located in regions such as the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, which are impaired in schizophrenia. Moreover, recently we have found that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers are under-represented in a case-control association study of schizophrenia. Furthermore, null CYP2D6 activity in healthy volunteers is associated with personality characteristics of social cognitive anxiety, which may bear some resemblance to milder forms of psychotic-like symptoms. In keeping with this, CYP2D6 may influence, not only variability to drug response, but also vulnerability to disease in schizophrenia patients.",

EGFR-dependent breast cancer cell lines undergo a striking reversion of the malignant phenotype upon treatment with inhibitors targeting the receptor, or downstream signalling intermediates such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase). Using this approach, we have recently reported that EGFR signalling in breast cancer can be effectively inhibited by blocking the activity of a key protease, TACE [TNFalpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha)-converting enzyme], which regulates the bioavailability of EGFR ligands. These results suggest a new way to target EGFR signalling in tumours of the breast and other epithelial tissues and underline the value of three-dimensional extracellular matrix culture models for exploring cancer-relevant signalling processes ex vivo.",

The idea to determine an individual's response to a prescribed medicine came into inception around 29 years ago. Pharmacogenetics is used to predict the drug response and efficacy, as well as potential adverse effects. We investigated the functional significance of the C3435T polymorphism of the MDR1 gene in a South Indian population. The patients were divided into responders and non-responders based on their clinical outcome and AED response. The risk of drug resistance was significantly higher in patients bearing TT genotype in comparison to carriers of the homozygous CC genotype [TT vs. CC, ??2=12.52; p=0.001, Odds ratio=2.34 (95% CI: 1.942-11.32)]. We suggest that the influence of the C3435T polymorphism in predicting the drug-resistance in epilepsy, might be significant and further investigations focusing on carbamazepine and phenytoin, in various ethnic populations are necessary to clarify the effect of C3435T polymorphism on the multidrug resistance in epilepsy patients. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

For this reason, platforms for high capture efficiency of CTCs are essential for clinical evaluation of patient-specific drug responses of CTCs. Recently, nanostructure based platforms have been developed with a high capture efficiency of more than 93% due to high-affinity binding and the 3D nanotopographic features of the nanostructure substrate. In this study, the breast carcinoma cell-line (BT20) cells with an ultra-low abundance range were captured by streptavidin (STR)-functionalized silicon nanowire (SiNW) platforms for evaluation of capture efficiency. A capture efficiency of more than 90% was achieved. Specific drug responses of BT20 cells captured on STR-SiNW platforms were analyzed using tamoxifen or docetaxel as a function of incubation time and dose, and compared with a 96-well plate platform. The drug responses of CTCs on STR-SiNW platforms were more sensitive than a 96-well plate platform. In addition, CTCs were successfully captured and evaluated their size distribution from the blood of breast cancer patients using fluorescence imaging. In conclusion, we suggest that the SiNW platform is adaptable for clinical use in evaluation of CTCs and drug response tests.",

STAR*D provides a large sample to address hypotheses of association of genetic variants and antidepressant response. While it is debatable whether discovery of the many risk variants that increase the likelihood of drug response or drug side effects will be useful for predictive tests that can be used to guide prescribing practices, these findings will more likely illuminate previously unheralded biologic pathways involved in critical aspects of antidepressant effects on human brain. Since the STAR*D trial was not designed with a pharmacogenetics study, there are a number of inherent limitations that pit the practical goals of the STAR*D trial against the experimental constraints that are often required in a human genetics study. Even with these limitations, it is unlikely that another single study will be available in the foreseeable future that will allow testing of hypotheses relating to the genetic influence on drug treatment of depression.

We systematically analyzed all available pharmacogenetic data from Medline databases (1970-2003) on the impact that genetic polymorphisms have on positive and adverse reactions to antidepressants and antipsychotics. Additionally, dose adjustments that would compensate for genetically caused differences in blood concentrations were calculated. To study pharmacokinetic effects, data for 36 antidepressants were screened. We found that for 20 of those, data on polymorphic CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 were found and that in 14 drugs such genetic variation would require at least doubling of the dose in extensive metabolizers in comparison to poor metabolizers. Data for 38 antipsychotics were examined: for 13 of those CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotype was of relevance. To study the effects of genetic variability on pharmacodynamic pathways, we reviewed 80 clinical studies on polymorphisms in candidate genes, but those did not for the most part reveal significant associations between neurotransmitter receptor and transporter genotypes and therapy response or adverse drug reactions. In addition associations found in one study could not be replicated in other studies. For this reason, it is not yet possible to translate pharmacogenetic parameters fully into therapeutic recommendations. At present, antidepressant and antipsychotic drug responses can best be explained as the combinatorial outcome of complex systems that interact at multiple levels. In spite of these limitations, combinations of polymorphisms in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways of relevance might contribute to identify genotypes associated with best and worst responders and they may also identify susceptibility to adverse drug reactions.",

As such, these approaches preclude the analysis of both complex heterogeneous phenotypic responses and subtle changes in cell morphology across physiologically relevant cell panels. Here, we describe the application of a cell-based assay and custom designed image analysis algorithms designed to monitor morphologic phenotypic response in detail across distinct cancer cell types. We further describe the integration of these methods with automated data analysis workflows incorporating principal component analysis, Kohonen neural networking, and kNN classification to enable rapid and robust interrogation of such data sets. We show the utility of these approaches by providing novel insight into pharmacologic response across four cancer cell types, Ovcar3, MiaPaCa2, and MCF7 cells wild-type and mutant for p53. These methods have the potential to drive the development of a new generation of novel therapeutic classes encompassing pharmacologic compositions or polypharmacology in appropriate disease context.",

In this study, we developed models to detect allele-specific perturbations on interactions, in which a genetic locus with alternative alleles exerted a differing influence on an interaction. We utilized the models to investigate the dynamic behavior of an integrated molecular network undergoing genetic perturbations in yeast. Our results revealed the complexity of regulatory relationships between genetic loci and networks, in which different genetic loci perturb specific network modules. In addition, significant within-module functional coherence was found. We then used the network perturbation model to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of individual differences in response to 100 diverse small molecule drugs. As a result, we identified sub-networks in the integrated network that responded to variations in DNA associated with response to diverse compounds and were significantly enriched for known drug targets. Literature mining results provided strong independent evidence for the effectiveness of these genetic perturbing networks in the elucidation of small-molecule responses in yeast.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate whether the effects of anticancer agents are able to be predicted, the results of sensitivity tests on anticancer agents were compared with the results of preoperative chemotherapy. METHODS: Biopsies were taken from 25 patients with esophageal cancer and 10 with gastric cancer, before chemotherapy, and the drug sensitivity was determined after culturing for 1 week. The chemotherapy consisted of low-dose cis-diamino-dichloroplatinum + 5-fluorouracil, and its clinical effect was determined after 3 or 5 weeks. RESULTS: Sensitivity was determined in 20 of the esophageal cancer patients and 8 of the gastric cancer patients, accounting for 80% of all the patients. Of the 11 patients judged to have sensitivity by the histoculture drug response assay (HDRA), 7 had a partial response, and of the 17 judged to have no sensitivity, 16 had a minor response or no change (NC). It was thus demonstrated that predictions of the effect of anticancer agents could be made with considerable accuracy using HDRA. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of the NC patients was poor, and distant metastasis, thought to be an adverse effect, soon appeared. From the viewpoint of both medical costs and patient quality of life, treatments other than preoperative chemotherapy should be selected for patients assessed to have NC. We believe that these sensitivity tests should be introduced clinically.",

To carry out a case-control analysis between AGT and aspirin-induced bronchospasm following treatment with an anti-asthma drug, montelukast (MLK), 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AGT were genotyped in 56 AIA cohort. Genotyping was performed with TaqMan assay and haplotypes were inferred using PHASE algorithm ver. 2.0. Statistical analyses of each SNPs and haplotypes were performed using SAS version 9.1. Among 13 variants displaying significant signals, two SNPs (+2401C>G and +2476C>T) in the intronic region of AGT were significantly associated with modification of drug response even after correction for multiple testing (P=0.0009-0.002; P corr=0.02-0.03). Furthermore, the two variants also exhibited associations with MLK response rate (P=0.0003-0.0006; P corr=0.006-0.01). Although our results are preliminary and further replication in a larger-scale group of subjects should be warranted, these observations provide evidence that AGT variants might be one of genetic factors involved in the response of anti-asthma drugs in AIA patients. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

We profiled signaling pathway activity in a collection of breast cancer cell lines before and after stimulation with physiologically relevant ligands, which revealed the variability in network activity among cells of known genotype and molecular subtype. Despite the receptor-based classification of breast cancer subtypes, we found that the abundance and activity of signaling proteins in unstimulated cells (basal profile), as well as the activity of proteins in stimulated cells (signaling profile), varied within each subtype. Using a partial least-squares regression approach, we constructed models that significantly predicted sensitivity to 23 targeted therapeutics. For example, one model showed that the response to the growth factor receptor ligand heregulin effectively predicted the sensitivity of cells to drugs targeting the cell survival pathway mediated by PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and Akt, whereas the abundance of Akt or the mutational status of the enzymes in the pathway did not. Thus, basal and signaling protein profiles may yield new biomarkers of drug sensitivity and enable the identification of appropriate therapies in cancers characterized by similar functional dysregulation of signaling networks.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and utility of a histoculture drug response assay (HDRA) for treatment of squamous cell carcinoma in the oral cavity. Nineteen patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity were assessed. Tumor tissue samples were histocultured on Gelfoam sponge gels in 24-well plates, followed by treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 300 ??g/ml), cisplatinum (CDDP, 20 ??g/ml), 4-0-tetrahydropyranyl adriamycin (THP, 4.6 ??g/ml), bleomycin (BLM, 20 ??g/ml), adriamycin (ADM, 15 ??g/ml) and docetaxel (TXT, 100 ??g/ml). The controls were cultured without drug treatment. After completion of the culture, the relative cell survival in the tumors was determined using an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H tetrazolium bromide) assay. The inhibition rate was calculated, and sensitivity was defined as a tumor inhibition rate greater than 60% for 5-FU, 40% for TXT, and 50% for the other drugs. All cases were successfully evaluated by the HDRA, and no apparent relationships between the chemosensitivity test results and clinico-histopathological characteristics were seen. CDDP tended to be sensitive, whereas 5-FU, THP, and BLM tended to show resistance in many cases. A good correlation was obtained between the chemosensitivity test results and clinical response. In conclusion, HDRA is a useful method for selection of an anticancer agent for individual oral cancer patients, because of its ease of evaluation and high predictability. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Myosin-binding protein C (Mybpc3)-targeted knock-in mice (KI) recapitulate typical aspects of human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We evaluated whether these functional alterations can be reproduced in engineered heart tissue (EHT) and yield novel mechanistic information on the function of cMyBP-C. EHTs were generated from cardiac cells of neonatal KI, heterozygous (HET) or wild-type controls (WT) and developed without apparent morphological differences. KI had 70% and HET 20% lower total cMyBP-C levels than WT, accompanied by elevated fetal gene expression. Under standard culture conditions and spontaneous beating, KI EHTs showed more frequent burst beating than WT and occasional tetanic contractions (14/96). Under electrical stimulation (6Hz, 37\u00b0C) KI EHTs exhibited shorter contraction and relaxation times and a twofold higher sensitivity to external [Ca2+]. Accordingly, the sensitivity to verapamil was 4-fold lower and the response to isoprenaline or the Ca2+ sensitizer EMD 57033 2- to 4-fold smaller. The loss of EMD effect was verified in 6-week-old KI mice in vivo. HET EHTs were apparently normal under basal conditions, but showed similarly altered contractile responses to [Ca2+], verapamil, isoprenaline and EMD. In contrast, drug-induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ transients (Fura-2) were essentially normal. In conclusion, the present findings in auxotonically contracting EHTs support the idea that cMyBP-C's normal role is to suppress force generation at low intracellular Ca2+ and stabilize the power-stroke step of the cross bridge cycle. Pharmacological testing in EHT unmasked a disease phenotype in HET. The altered drug response may be clinically relevant.\u00a9 2013 The Authors.",

Genetic mapping has proven to be a powerful tool for detecting and identifying specific genes affecting complex traits, that is, quantitative trait loci (QTL), based on polymorphic markers. In this article, we present a novel statistical model for genetic mapping of QTL governing pharmacodynamic processes. In principle, this model is a combination of functional mapping proposed to map function-valued traits and linkage disequilibrium mapping designed to provide high-resolution mapping of QTL by making use of recombination events created at a historic time. We implement a closed-form solution for the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate the population genetic parameters of QTL and the simplex algorithm to estimate the curve parameters describing the pharmacodynamic changes of different QTL genotypes in response to drug dose or concentrations. Extensive simulations are performed to investigate the statistical properties of our model. The implications of our model in pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic research are discussed.",

Catechol-O-methyltransferase and monoamine oxidase enzymes are important agents in the metabolic inactivation of these neurotransmitters (ie, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine). Functional polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase and monoamine oxidase A genes causes variation in enzyme activities. We investigated the relationship of catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158Met and monoamine oxidase A promoter repeat polymorphism with response to conventional neuroleptic treatment in schizophrenia.Ninety-four schizophrenic patients formed 2 different study populations. The responders had experienced a fair and steady response to conventional neuroleptics. The nonresponders had failed to achieve an acceptable response to conventional neuroleptics. We also used a control population of 94 age-matched and gender-matched blood donors. Genotyping of the catechol-O-methyltransferase and monoamine oxidase A genes was performed by polymerase chain reaction.Forty-three percent of the nonresponders had a low activity catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype compared with 16% of the responders (P = 0.009). Monoamine oxidase A genotype alone did not differ significantly between the groups. Moreover, the risk of having both low-activity catechol-O-methyltransferase and monoamine oxidase A genotypes was over 6 times more common (odds ratio = 6.16, P = 0.03) in the nonresponders compared with responders. The whole population of patients with schizophrenia did not differ from the controls.The low-activity catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype may be associated with unsatisfactory drug response to conventional neuroleptics or alternatively be involved in a subset of schizophrenics. The role of monoamine oxidase A genotype seems to be additive in this respect.",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of global cancer mortality worldwide. However, the molecular mechanism underlying its carcinogenesis and drug resistance is not well understood. To identify novel functionally important genes that were differentially expressed due to combinations of genetic and epigenetic changes, we analyzed datasets containing genome-wide mRNA expression, DNA copy number alterations and DNA methylation status from 154 primary GC samples and 47 matched non-neoplastic mucosa tissues from Asian patients. We used concepts of 'within' and 'between' statistical analysis to compare the difference between tumors and controls within each platform, and assessed the correlations between platforms. This 'multi-regulated gene (MRG)' analysis identified 126 differentially expressed genes that underwent a combination of copy number and DNA methylation changes. Most genes were located at genomic loci associated with GC. Statistical enrichment analysis showed that MRGs were enriched for cancer, GC and drug response. We analysed several MRGs that previously had not been associated with GC. Knockdown of DDX27, TH1L or IDH3G sensitized cells to epirubicin or cisplatin, and knockdown of RAI14 reduced cell proliferation. Further studies showed that overexpression of DDX27 reduced epirubicin-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Levels of DDX27 mRNA and protein were increased in early-stage gastric tumors, and may be a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for GC. In summary, we used an integrative bioinformatics strategy to identify novel genes that are altered in GC and regulate resistance of GC cells to drugs in vitro.",

In addition, we review our approach to HAP Marker discovery, which involves discovering SNPs in the functional regions of genes by sequencing, organizing these SNPs into HAP Markers for an index population of ethnically diverse individuals and calculating population frequencies for these HAP Markers. For clinical correlations, HAP Markers are defined and correlated to clinical data using the in-house DecoGen Informatics System.

Neuroblastoma is a p53 wild type malignancy at diagnosis and repression of p53 signaling plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Recently developed small molecule inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction are able to overcome this repression and potently activate p53 dependent apoptosis in malignancies with intact p53 downstream signaling. We used the small molecule MDM2 inhibitor, Nutlin-3a, to determine the p53 drug response signature in neuroblastoma cells. In addition to p53 mediated apoptotic signatures, GSEA and pathway analysis identified a set of p53-repressed genes that were reciprocally over-expressed in neuroblastoma patients with the worst overall outcome in multiple clinical cohorts. Multifactorial regression analysis identified a subset of four genes (CHAF1A, RRM2, MCM3, and MCM6) whose expression together strongly predicted overall and event-free survival (p<0.0001). The expression of these four genes was then validated by quantitative PCR in a large independent clinical cohort. Our findings further support the concept that oncogene-driven transcriptional networks opposing p53 activation are essential for the aggressive behavior and poor response to therapy of high-risk neuroblastoma.",

The IR of 50% dose PTX (20\u2009\u03bcg/mL, median 30.6%) was markedly decreased, while that of 50% dose 254-S (10\u2009\u03bcg/mL, median 63.3%) still retained its inhibition effect compared to 100% dose. Most recurrent samples had higher IRs than primary lesions, but the IRs of different drugs differed between primary and recurrent lesions, even with samples from the same patients. PTX has a higher IR to ATC tissues in the HDRA, which suggests that it may be a key drug for the treatment of patients with ATC.",

        "title": "Chemosensitivity of uterine cervical cancer demonstrated by the histoculture drug response assay",
        "abstract": "Uterine cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in the female population worldwide. In vitro chemosensitivity test is important to find effective drugs in uterine cervical cancer that requires the established chemotherapeutic strategies. The purpose of this study is to investigate the chemosensitivity of uterine cervical cancer using the histoculture drug response assay (HDRA). Sixty-five fresh tumor tissues were obtained from patients with cervical cancer: 47 squamous cell carcinomas, 11 adenocarcinomas, and 7 adenosquamous cell carcinomas. The median age was 44 years (range, 25-74 years), and the median follow-up duration was 26.3 months (range, 1.6-52.7 months). The clinical stage by the International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) was stage I of 80.0% (52/65) and stage HA of 13.8% (9/65). The inhibition rates of ten chemotherapeutic agents against these cancer tissues were tested using the HDRA method according to established methods. Five agents were evaluated as sensitive drugs in cervical cancer with inhibition rates of greater than 30%: 41.0% for carboplatin, 35.0% for cisplatin, 33.8% for paclitaxel, 41.4% for belotecan, and 49.2% for topotecan. Especially, carboplatin combined with paclitaxel showed an inhibition rate of 54.0%, which was higher than any other single agent. However, there were no noticeable differences in chemosensitivity according to histopathologic types and FIGO stage. Despite such limitation, the HDRA may be a promising chemosensitivity test to predict an effective drug for each patient. The HDRA could provide useful information that is invaluable for the design of individualized treatments in patients with cervical cancer. (copyright) 2009 Tohoku University Medical Press.",

        "abstract": "Despite the increasing evidence of the importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of multiple biological processes, the molecular bases supporting this regulation are still barely understood in crustaceans. Therefore, the molecular characterization and transcriptome modulation of the miRNA biogenesis pathway were evaluated in the salmon louse Caligus rogercresseyi, an ectoparasite that constitutes one of the biggest concerns for salmonid aquaculture industry. Hence, RNA-Seq analysis was conducted from six different developmental stages, and also after bioassays with delousing drugs Deltamethrin and Azamethiphos using adult individuals. In silico analysis evidenced 24 putative genes involved in the miRNA pathway such as biogenesis, transport, maturation and miRNA-target interaction. Moreover, 243 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, 15 of which showed non-synonym mutations. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that CCR4-Not complex subunit 3 (CNOT3) was upregulated at earlier developmental stages (nauplius I-II and copepodid), and also after the exposure to Azamethiphos, but not to Deltamethrin. In contrast, the subunit 7 (CNOT7) showed an inverse expression pattern. Different Argonaute transcripts were associated to chalimus and adult stages, revealing specific expression patterns in response to antiparasitic drugs. Our results suggest novel insights into the regulatory network of the post-transcriptional gene regulation in C. rogercresseyi mediated by miRNAs, evidencing a putative role during the ontogeny and drug response.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To provide insight into potential regulatory mechanisms of gene expression underlying addiction, analgesia, psychotropic drug response and adverse drug events, genome-wide association studies searching for variants associated with these phenotypes has been undertaken with limited success. We undertook analysis of these results with the aim of applying epigenetic knowledge to aid variant discovery and interpretation. METHODS: We applied conditional imputation to results from 26 genome-wide association studies and three candidate gene-association studies. The analysis workflow included data from chromatin conformation capture, chromatin state annotation, DNase I hypersensitivity, hypomethylation, anatomical localization and biochronicity. We also made use of chromatin state data from the epigenome roadmap, transcription factor-binding data, spatial maps from published Hi-C datasets and 'guilt by association' methods. RESULTS: We identified 31 pharmacoepigenomic SNPs from a total of 2024 variants in linkage disequilibrium with lead SNPs, of which only 6% were coding variants. Interrogation of chromatin state using our workflow and the epigenome roadmap showed agreement on 34 of 35 tissue assignments to regulatory elements including enhancers and promoters. Loop boundary domains were inferred by association with CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) and cohesin, suggesting proximity to topologically associating domain boundaries and enhancer clusters. Spatial interactions between enhancer-promoter pairs detected both known and previously unknown mechanisms. Addiction and analgesia SNPs were common in relevant populations and exhibited large effect sizes, whereas a SNP located in the promoter of the SLC1A2 gene exhibited a moderate effect size for lithium response in bipolar disorder in patients of European ancestry. SNPs associated with drug-induced organ injury were rare but exhibited the largest effect sizes, consistent with the published literature. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that an in silico bioinformatics-based approach using integrative analysis of a diversity of molecular and morphological data types can discover pharmacoepigenomic variants that are suitable candidates for further validation in cell lines, animal models and human clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Kinase encoding genes plays an important role in mood disorder, being associated with both the pathophysiology of depression and the mechanisms of antidepressant treatment. The Ras-Raf-MAPK signal pathway are also possible targets for investigation as potential genetic predictors of antidepressant treatment response. Variation in kinase encoding genes and genegene interaction in the Ras-Raf-MAPK signal pathway may affect the efficacy of antidepressant treatment. The present study aimed to explore the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype that it constructed in kinase encoding genes, and gene-gene interaction in the Ras-Raf-MAPK signal pathway with antidepressant drug response. Methods: 302 cases of patients with depression met with DSM-? and CCMD-3 diagnosis criteria were recruited into this study and were assessed with 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) before and after 8-week antidepressants treatment. All cases were divided into two groups (Remitter and non-remitter group) according to HAMD-17 scores after 8-week treatment. Genomic DNA was extracted by DNA extracting assay. 24 SNPs in 5 genes associated with the Ras-Raf-MAPK signal pathway were genotyped in these patients. All data were analyzed by SPSS 13.0, Unphased 3.0.13, SHEsis online analysis and MDR-2.0 beta 6 software to identify genetic association with antidepressant drug response. Results: 1. Only SNPs (A/G genotype) of RSKL2 (rs7156590) in the Ras-Raf-MAPK signal pathway in male and female patients was close to significance with antidepressant drugs response (Male P = 0.0608, Female P = 0.083), any correlations in other SNPs of loci with antidepressant drugs response were not be found. 2. Proportion of CCAGA Haplotype that RSK(<sub>2/ 3/ 4</sub>)-RSKL(<sub>1/ 2</sub>) gene loci SNPs constructed in remitter group in female depressed patients was markedly lower than that in non-remitter group (P<0.05), proportion of CAGGA haplotype that RSK(2/ 3/ 4)- RSKL(1/ 2) gene loci SNPs constructed in remitter group was also close to significant higher that in non-remitter group (P = 0.0533, OR:1.705 95% CI: 0.990-2.935); But proportion of AAAGGG haplotype that RSK(<sub>2/ 3/ 4</sub>)-RSKL(<sub>1/ 2</sub>) gene loci SNPs constructed in male patients was significantly greater than that in nonremitter group (P<0.05), proportion of CAAGGG Haplotype that RSK(<sub>2/ 3/ 4</sub>)-RSKL(<sub>1/ 2</sub>) gene loci SNPs constructed in remitter group was close to lower than that in non-remitter group (P = 0.079). 3. MEK1 (rs28730804) and RSK3 (rs2229712) in the Ras-Raf-MAPK signal pathway were of gene-gene interaction, and affected antidepressant drugs response in female depressed patients (P = 0.041), but it was not found in male patients. Conclusions: 1. Some SNPs in the Ras-Raf-MAPK signal pathway maybe was associated with antidepressant drugs response, especially A/G heterozygote of kinases encoding gene perhaps promote antidepressant drugs response. 2. Lower perception of CCAGA haplotype in female depressed patients may positively influence antidepressant drugs response, while higher perceptions of AAAGGG haplotype in male patients may positively influence antidepressant drugs response. 3. MEK1 (rs28730804) and RSK3 (rs2229712) in the Ras-Raf-MAPK signal pathway were of genegene interaction in female depressed patients, and remarkably affected antidepressant drugs response.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of a pharmacological treatment for phenylketonuria (PKU) raised new questions about function and dysfunction of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), the enzyme deficient in this disease. To investigate the interdependence of the genotype, the metabolic state (phenylalanine substrate) and treatment (BH(4) cofactor) in the context of enzyme function in vitro and in vivo, we (i) used a fluorescence-based method for fast enzyme kinetic analyses at an expanded range of phenylalanine and BH(4) concentrations, (ii) depicted PAH function as activity landscapes, (iii) retraced the analyses in eukaryotic cells, and (iv) translated this into the human system by analyzing the outcome of oral BH(4) loading tests. PAH activity landscapes uncovered the optimal working range of recombinant wild-type PAH and provided new insights into PAH kinetics. They demonstrated how mutations might alter enzyme function in the space of varying substrate and cofactor concentrations. Experiments in eukaryotic cells revealed that the availability of the active PAH enzyme depends on the phenylalanine-to-BH(4) ratio. Finally, evaluation of data from BH(4) loading tests indicated that the patient's genotype influences the impact of the metabolic state on drug response. The results allowed for visualization and a better understanding of PAH function in the physiological and pathological state as well as in the therapeutic context of cofactor treatment. Moreover, our data underscore the need for more personalized procedures to safely identify and treat patients with BH(4)-responsive PAH deficiency.",

The histoculture drug response assay (HDRA) has been shown to be a reliable method for in vitro chemoresponse assessment. In this study, we have correlated the HDRA assessment with survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHOD: Tumor specimens from 41 of 42 patients undergoing treatment for HNSCC were successfully evaluated by the HDRA. Tumor tissue was histocultured on Gelfoam sponges gel in 24-well plates, followed by treatment with cisplatin (15 microg/mL) or 5-fluorouracil (40 microg/mL) in triplicate. A control group received no drug treatment. After completion of drug treatment, the relative cell survival in the tumors was determined using the MTT assay. The inhibition rate (IR) for each drug was calculated relative to the control for each case, and sensitivity was defined as a tumor IR of greater than 30%. Treatment was based on established protocols for the location and stage of the tumor and included surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Survival comparisons were performed using the generalized Wilcoxon test for the comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: Resistance to 5-fluorouracil was present in 13 cases (32%), to cisplatinum in 13 cases (32%), and to both agents in 11 cases (27%). The 2-year cause-specific survival was significantly greater for patients sensitive to 5-fluorouracil (85% vs 64%; p =.04), cisplatinum (86% vs 64%; p =.05), or both agents (85% vs 63%; p =.01). The association between HDRA assessment of chemoresponse and clinical outcome remained significant even after controlling for the effects of TNM stage and the presence of recurrent cancer at presentation by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Chemosensitivity determined by the HDRA seems to be a strong predictor of survival in patients with advanced HNSCC and should be considered further.",

In this study, we investigated the ability of several pattern recognition methods to identify the most informative markers in the CYP2D6 gene for the prediction of CYP2D6 metabolizer status. METHODS: Four data-mining tools were explored: decision trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, and the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. Marker selection was performed separately in eight population samples of different ethnic origin to evaluate to what extent the most informative markers differ across ethnic groups. RESULTS: Our results show that the number of polymorphisms required to predict CYP2D6 metabolic phenotype with a high accuracy can be dramatically reduced owing to the strong haplotype block structure observed at CYP2D6. MDR and neural networks provided nearly identical results and performed the best. CONCLUSION: Data-mining methods, such as MDR and neural networks, appear as promising tools to improve the efficiency of genotyping tests in pharmacogenetics with the ultimate goal of pre-screening patients for individual therapy selection with minimum genotyping effort.",

        "abstract": "Drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYPs) enzymes are expressed in the liver, as well as in extrahepatic tissues such as the brain. Here we show for the first time that drug metabolism by a CYP within the brain, illustrated using CYP2B and the anesthetic propofol (2, 6-diisopropylphenol, Diprivan), can meaningfully alter the pharmacological response to a CNS acting drug. CYP2B is expressed in the brains of animals and humans, and this CYP isoform is able to metabolize centrally acting substrates such as propofol, ecstasy, and serotonin. Rats were given intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injections of vehicle, C8-xanthate, or 8-methoxypsoralen (CYP2B mechanism-based inhibitors) and then tested for sleep time following propofol (80 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Both inhibitors significantly increased sleep-time (1.8- to 2-fold) and brain propofol levels, while having no effect on plasma propofol levels. Seven days of nicotine treatment can induce the expression of brain, but not hepatic, CYP2B, and this induction reduced propofol sleep times by 2.5-fold. This reduction was reversed in a dose-dependent manner by i.c.v. injections of inhibitor. Sleep times correlated with brain (r=0.76, P=0.0009), but not plasma (r=0.24, P=0.39) propofol concentrations. Inhibitor treatments increased brain, but not plasma, propofol levels, and had no effect on hepatic enzyme activity. These data indicate that brain CYP2B can metabolize neuroactive substrates (eg, propofol) and can alter their pharmacological response. This has wider implications for localized CYP-mediated metabolism of drugs, neurotransmitters, and neurotoxins within the brain by this highly variable enzyme family and other CYP subfamilies expressed in the brain.",

        "abstract": "The pleiotropic drug response (PDR) or multidrug resistance (MDR) are cellular defence mechanisms present in all species to deal with potential toxicity from environmental small molecule toxins or bioactives. The rapid induction of MDR by xenobiotics in mammalian cells and PDR in budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) has been well studied but how pathway specificity is achieved across different structural classes of xenobiotics is not well understood. As a novel approach to this problem we investigated the genome-wide network of genes modulating the yeast PDR. Fluorescently-tagged ABC pumps Pdr5p-GFP and Yor1p-GFP were used as real-time reporters for the Pdr1p/Pdr3p controlled response. Using the yeast non-essential gene deletion set fifty-four gene deletions that suppressed up-regulation of reporter fluorescence to the cell surface in the presence of atorvastatin were identified by high content confocal automated microscopy. Secondary validation using spot dilution assays to known PDR substrates and Western blot assays of Pdr5p expression confirmed 26 genes able to modulate the PDR phenotype. By analysis of network connectivity, an additional 10 genes that fell below the primary screen cut-off were predicted to be involved in PDR and confirmed as above. The PDR modulating genes taken together were enriched in signalling (Rho-GTPase, MAPK), Mediator complexes, and chromatin modification (subunits of ADA and SAGA complexes). Many of the gene deletions cause extra sensitivity in \u0394pdr1\u0394pdr3 strains strongly suggesting that there are alternative pathways to upregulate PDR, independently of Pdr1p/Pdr3p. We present here the first high-content microscopy screening for PDR modulators, and identify genes that are previously unsuspected regulators of PDR apparently contributing via network interactions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There are many predictive factors for gefitinib sensitivity, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, EGFR copy number, and k-ras mutation. To investigate all of them is too expensive. We evaluated the chemosensitivity for gefitinib in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using a histoculture drug response assay (HDRA).\\n\\nMETHODS: Surgically resected fresh tumor specimens from 22 patients with NSCLC were used. There were 13 male and 9 female patients, ranging in age from 49 to 84 (average 70) years old. Sixteen patients (73%) were smokers. Sixteen adenocarcinomas, four squamous cell carcinomas, and two other histological types were included. Small pieces of viable cancer tissue were placed on the collagen gel and then cultured for 7 days in the presence of gefitinib.\\n\\nRESULTS: The HDRA was successful in all specimens. A dose-response relation was observed between inhibition rates and gefitinib concentration (p = 0.016). The inhibition rate at 20 microg/ml (IR(20)) in adenocarcinoma without smoking (39.2% +/- 35.1%, n = 6) was higher than that with smoking (2.2% +/- 5.0%, n = 10, P = 0.001) and that of nonadenocarcinoma (16.9% +/- 23.6%, n = 6, P = 0.09). Gene mutation analysis was performed in two of three adenocarcinomas without smoking, which showed especially high IR(20) values, and sensitizing mutations were observed in these specimens. A cutoff inhibition rate of approximately 40%-50% appeared to be suitable for a concentration of 20 microg/ml.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: HDRA appears to be applicable for evaluating sensitivity to gefitinib in NSCLC. It provides a convenient method for predicting the response to gefitinib in patients with NSCLC whose fresh tumor specimens are available.",

        "abstract": "A major topic about the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia is the wide variability of antipsychotic effects among patients when treated with each drug, leading to the clinical judgement of a limited 'class effect', also for similar molecules. Paliperidone is the major metabolite of risperidone and pharmacodynamic activities are highly comparable, even though some differences have been reported. Paliperidone showed to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia in a number of short and long term studies, however only two short term studies evaluated the differences in clinical response among patients switched from risperidone to paliperidone. The aim of this study is to evaluate, by means of a naturalistic observational follow-up, the possible concordance of clinical response to risperidone and paliperidone. Thirty-one patients affected by schizophrenia treated with risperidone and showing poor clinical response were enrolled in the study. Patients were switched to paliperidone and assessed for psychopathology, cognition, general functioning, extrapyramidal tolerability and attitude towards treatment at baseline and after 2, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. The repeated measures analysis showed an overall significant improvement on several domains after 12 weeks of treatment (Table 1). Remarkably over 40% of patients showed a non-concordant clinical response to paliperidone and risperidone. In conclusion, this naturalistic observation suggests that paliperidone and his mother drug, risperidone may show significant differences both in efficacy and tolerability at individual level. Reasons for this should be looked for at biological levels not necessarily involving the receptor affinity and pharmacological activity profile. ?? 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",

We have previously shown that the individual haplotype GAACC in the PDE11A gene was associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) based on block-by-block analysis.

In this study, we have further explored whether the whole region 2q31-q32 contribute to MDD or antidepressant response 278 depressed Mexican-American participants and 321 matched healthy controls. Although there is no significant interaction between the two genes, the remission rate of individual carrying the combination genotype at rs1880916 (AG/AA) and rs1549870 (GG) is significantly increased. We analyzed the global haplotype by examining 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PDE11A and six SNPs in PDE1A. None of the haplotypes consisting of six SNPs in the PDE1A have a significant difference between depressed and control groups. Among haplotypes consisting of 16 SNPs across 440 kb in the PDE11A gene, 18 common haplotypes (with frequency higher than 0.8%) have been found in the studied population. Six haplotypes showed significantly different frequencies between the MDD group and the control group. The phylogenetic network result for the 16 SNPs showed that several historic recombination events have happened in the PDE11A gene. The frequency of one haplotype is significantly lower in the remitter group than in the nonremitter group for the depressed participants treated with either desipramine or fluoxetine. Thus, our data suggest that the PDE11A global haplotype is associated with both MDD and antidepressant drug response.",

        "abstract": "The product of the ABCB1 gene, P-glycoprotein (PGP), is a transmembrane active efflux pump for a variety of drugs. It is a putative mechanism of multidrug resistance in a range of diseases. It is postulated that ABCB1 polymorphisms contribute to variability in PGP function, and that therefore multidrug resistance is, at least in part, genetically determined. However, studies of ABCB1 genotype or haplotype and PGP expression, activity or drug response have produced inconsistent results. This critical review of ABCB1 genotype and PGP function, including mRNA expression, PGP-substrate drug pharmacokinetics and drug response, highlights methodological limitations of existing studies, including inadequate power, potential confounding by co-morbidity and co-medication, multiple testing, poor definition of disease phenotype and outcomes, and analysis of multiple drugs that might not be PGP substrates. We have produced recommendations for future research that will aid clarification of the association between ABCB1 genotypes and factors related to PGP activity.",

        "abstract": "Objective: This study aims to improve understanding of antipsychotic non/response and assess the potential for personalized schizophrenia treatment. Methods: We used data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). Efficacy measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and neurocognitive functioning. Side effect measures included weight, lipids, glucose, heart rate and QT prolongation. Latent class analysis was conducted for each of the five drugs on the individual treatment effects to study whether there were subgroups of drug responders. The posterior probabilities of belonging to a particular response group were correlated across drugs to examine if patients not responding to one drug are likely to respond to a different drug and whether response to one drug may help to predict response to another drug. Results: We identified four qualitatively distinct response groups: Optimal Responders, Average Responders, Global Responders and Non-Responders. Different patterns of correlations with demographics and clinical variables across classes provided further support for the validity of these groups. The low correlations between posterior probabilities of the same response groups across drugs implied that patients generally belonged to different response groups for different drugs. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the existence of subgroups of patients characterized by distinct patterns of drug response. Further, findings suggest that patients who experience a poor response to one drug may be an optimal responder to another antipsychotic. Taken together these findings demonstrate the potential to personalize schizophrenia treatment and highlight the importance of identifying better predictors of drug response. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As there is now evidence that switching clinical nonresponders early in primary systemic therapy to alternate treatment regimens can enhance survival in some breast cancer patients, the need for a robust intermediate endpoint that can guide treatment response across all tumor subtypes is urgent. Recently, chemotherapy drugs have been shown to induce a decrease in RNA quality in tumor cells from breast cancer biopsies in some patients at midtherapy, and that this has been associated with subsequent achievement of pathological complete response (pCR). The decrease in RNA quality has been shown to be associated with RNA disruption; aberrant RNA bands visualized by RNA electrophoresis have been associated with subsequent tumor cell death. The objectives of these studies are to show that a new assay based on induction of RNA disruption in tumor cells by chemotherapy can stratify at midtherapy, pCR responders from non-pCR responders irrespective of clinical response and to present early evidence that clinically useful RNA disruption can be detected as early as 14 days after initiation of treatment. METHODS: RNA disruption in tumor cells was quantified by analysis of the RNA electrophoresis banding pattern and expressed as an RNA disruption index (RDI). To develop the RNA disruption assay (RDA), RDI was correlated with clinical outcome (pCR) from the NCIC-CTG MA.22 breast cancer clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00066443). RDA Zones were established by stratifying patients using RDI values into Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Zone 3 included seven out of eight pCR responders, whereas Zone 1 contained no pCR responders. An intermediate zone (Zone 2) was established which contained one pCR. Subsequently, to determine early drug response, RNA disruption was examined by RDI after 14 days exposure to trastuzumab, zoledronic acid, or letrozole + cyclophosphamide +/- sorafenib therapy. RESULTS: In MA.22, RDA stratified 23 of 85 patients in Zone 1 as pCR nonresponders, 24 patients in Zone 2, an intermediate zone, and 38 patients in Zone 3, pCR responders and non-pCR patients who share RDI comparable to those achieving pCR. In the early response studies, after 14 days exposure to chemotherapy, some RNA disruption as measured by RDI elevation could be detected in 3/12 trastuzumab, 7/15 zoledronic acid, 5/29 letrozole + cyclophosphamide, and 5/23 letrozole + cyclophosphamide + sorafenib patients. CONCLUSIONS: RDA is a novel intermediate endpoint that has promise for clinical utility for breast cancers early in response-guided primary systemic therapy.",

        "abstract": "Induction chemotherapy or concomitant chemoradiotherapy has been used increasingly to improve survival, organ preservation and function in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). However, this regimen encounters significant side effects with potential adverse reactions causing many disadvantages for patients. Therefore, reliable chemosensitivity assays are needed to accurately predict the response to chemotherapy and guide the selection and treatment of patients with HNC. The main purpose of this study was to examine the optimal drug concentrations for evaluating in vitro chemosensitivity using the histoculture drug response assay (HDRA). The tested tumor specimens included 7 from oral cavities (14.3%), 12 from oropharynx (24.5%), 10 hypopharynx (20.4%), 3 larynx (6.1%), 5 sinonasal (10.2%), 2 salivary glands (4.1%), and 10 from metastatic lymph nodes (20.4%), respectively. Histopathologic types of all 49 specimens were squamous cell carcinoma. We investigated the optimal drug concentrations in HDRA searching at doses of 4-100 ??g/ml for cisplatin and 60-1500 ??g/ml for 5-FU. We considered the concentration of 20 ??g/ml to be appropriate for evaluating cisplatin sensitivity in HNC among the tested dosages. As for cisplatin sensitivity in vitro, the 50% cut-off inhibition index (I.I.) was found to have a significant association with the clinical response to chemotherapy, with an accurate prediction rate of 77.8%. The HDRA shows a predictive value for chemosensitivity in HNC patients using the optimal drug concentration cut-off with this site specificity. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "It has been difficult to identify genes affecting drug response to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). We used multiple cross-sectional assessments of depressive symptoms in a population-based study to identify potential genetic interactions with SSRIs as a model to study genetic variants associated with SSRI response. This study, embedded in the prospective Rotterdam Study, included all successfully genotyped participants with data on depressive symptoms (CES-D scores). We used repeated measurement models to test multiplicative interaction between genetic variants and use of SSRIs on repeated CESD scores. Besides a genome-wide analysis, we also performed an analysis which was restricted to genes related to the serotonergic signaling pathway. A total of 273 out of 14937 assessments of depressive symptoms in 6443 participants, use of an SSRI was recorded. After correction for multiple testing, no plausible loci were identified in the genome-wide analysis. However, among the top 10 independent loci with the lowest p-values, findings within two genes (FSHR and HMGB4) might be of interest. Among 26 genes related to the serotonergic signaling pathway, the rs6108160 polymorphism in the PLCB1 gene reached statistical significance after Bonferroni correction (p-value=8.1e-5). Also, the widely replicated 102C>T polymorphism in the HTR2A gene showed a statistically significant drug-gene interaction with SSRI use. Therefore, the present study suggests that drug-gene interaction models on (repeated) cross-sectional assessments of depressive symptoms in a population-based study can identify potential loci that may influence SSRI response.",

The study group included hundred primary invasive ductal carcinoma patients who subsequently received chemotherapy (the regimen generally consisted of commonly used drugs like adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and docetaxal and their combinations). Blood samples from 100 healthy individuals used as controls were also genotyped for the MDR1 gene. This investigation revealed a statistically significant correlation with response to various regimens of adjuvant chemotherapy showing a low response to therapy with CT/TT genotype at (exon 12) 1236 codon (p<0.001) and favorable response to therapy with CT/TT genotype (exon 26) at 3435 codon (p<0.001). The combined effect of both the exons, i.e., mutant exon 12 and wildtype 26 gave poor response, whereas the combination of mutated exon 26 and wildtype exon 12 gave favorable response to chemotherapy (p<0.0005).

In an analysis of ED patients and their genotypes in the GNB3 C825T, the ACE I/D and the NOS3 G894T polymorphisms, there was no evidence for influence of the genotypes on the susceptibility to develop ED. At the same time, a significant variation in drug response to sildenafil dependent on the genotypes in the GNB3 C825T and ACE I/D polymorphisms was demonstrated.

In parallel, only 50% of ACE D allele carriers showed a positive response to sildenafil in contrast to men genotype II in the ACE I/D polymorphism, who had a response rate of 75%.

        "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) and more specifically the expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) have been studied extensively in vitro. Unfortunately, it appears that the predictive value of MDR recognized in vitro is mostly an incorrect measure to determine the responsiveness of a particular tumour in the clinic. This misunderstood or overvalued role of MDR might explain the failure of strategies to reverse Pgp function by the use of modulators in solid tumours. To obtain more insight in in vivo drug resistance we investigated a panel of 15 human ovarian cancer xenografts consisting of the most common histological subtypes known in ovarian cancer patients. The response rate to cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin in the xenografts resembled the results of phase II trials with these agents in ovarian cancer patients. This resemblance justifies drug resistance studies in this experimental in vivo human tumour system. We determined the expression levels of MDR 1, MRP 1, LRP and topoisomerase IIalpha mRNA by the RNase protection assay and the presence of MRP1 and LRP proteins by immunohistochemistry. The S-phase fraction was investigated as a separate parameter by flow cytometry. In none of the 15 ovarian cancer xenografts was MDR 1 expression detectable. The expression levels of MRP 1 and LRP were low to moderate and resembled the presence of the MRP1 and LRP proteins. There was a weak, inverse relationship between the expression levels of LRP and sensitivity to cisplatin and cyclophosphamide (r = -0.44 and -0.45), but not to doxorubicin. The levels of topoisomerase IIalpha varied among the xenografts (0.73-2.66) and failed to correlate with doxorubicin resistance (r = 0.14). The S-phase fraction, however, showed a relation with the sensitivity to cisplatin (r = 0.66). Among the determinants studied in ovarian cancer in vivo, LRP mRNA and the S-phase fraction were the best predictive factors for drug response and most specifically for the activity of cisplatin.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: This study reports the prevalence of five clinically significant variants associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disorders, and variable responses of individuals to commonly prescribed cardiovascular drugs in a South Indian population from the state of Kerala. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA isolated from 100 out-patient samples from Kerala were sequenced to examine the frequency of clinically relevant polymorphisms in the genes MYBPC3 (cardiomyopathy), SLCO1B1 (statin-induced myopathy), CYP2C9, VKORC1 (response to warfarin) and CYP2C19 (response to clopidogrel). RESULTS: Our analyses revealed the frequency of a 25 bp deletion variant of MYBPC3 associated with risk of cardiomyopathy was 7%, and the SLCO1B1 \"C\" allele associated with risk for statin-induced myopathy was 15% in this sample group. Among the other variants associated with dose-induced toxicity of warfarin, VKORC1 (c.1639G>A), was detected at 22%, while CYP2C9*3 and CYP2C9*2 alleles were present at a frequency of 15% and 3% respectively. Significantly, the tested sample population showed high prevalence (66%) of CYP2C19*2 variant, which determines response to clopidogrel therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified that certain variants associated with cardiovascular disease and related drug response in the five genes, especially those in VKORC1, CYP2C19 and MYBPC3, are highly prevalent in the Kerala population, with almost 2 times higher prevalence of CYP2C19*2 variant compared with other regions in the country. Since the variants chosen in this study have relevance in disease phenotype and/or drug response, and are detected at a higher frequency, this study is likely to encourage clinicians to perform genetic testing before prescribing therapy.",

Therefore, we investigated the clinical value of the histoculture drug response assay for ovarian cancer. Tumor specimens were cultured for 7 days on collagen gel sponge in medium containing cisplatin, and the 50% inhibitory concentration was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Then the in vitro sensitivity to cisplatin was compared with the clinical response and survival. Apoptosis of tumor cells was also investigated. Among 173 ovarian cancer patients, 164 were evaluable by the assay, and 29 patients had measurable lesions for which the clinical response could be determined. The 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in patients with chemosensitive tumors than in those with chemoresistant tumors when the cutoff value was set at a 50% inhibitory concentration of 25 microg/mL and the accuracy of the assay was 82.8% (24/29). As chemosensitivity to cisplatin became greater, the number of apoptotic cells also increased. This chemosensitivity assay may help predict the clinical response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, thus improving the survival of ovarian cancer patients.",

Here, we introduce an approach that uses drug perturbation data from GEM models to predict drug efficacy in human cancer. Network-based analysis of expression profiles from in vivo treatment of GEM models identified drugs and drug combinations that inhibit the activity of FOXM1 and CENPF, which are master regulators of prostate cancer malignancy. Validation of mouse and human prostate cancer models confirmed the specificity and synergy of a predicted drug combination to abrogate FOXM1/CENPF activity and inhibit tumorigenicity. Network-based analysis of treatment signatures from GEM models identified treatment-responsive genes in human prostate cancer that are potential biomarkers of patient response. More generally, this approach allows systematic identification of drugs that inhibit tumor dependencies, thereby improving the utility of GEM models for prioritizing drugs for clinical evaluation.",

We conducted three independent 6-week treatment studies in outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) to develop a pharmacogenomic model predicting response and nonresponse. We screened candidate genomic markers for association with response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). No patients had received any antidepressant drug treatment in the current episode of depression. Outcome evaluation was blinded to drug and genotype data. The prediction model derived from a development sample of 239 completer cases treated with SSRIs comprised haplotypes and polymorphisms related to serotonin synthesis, serotonin transport, glutamate receptors, and GABA synthesis. The model was evaluated prospectively for prediction of outcome in a validation sample of 176 new SSRI-treated completer cases. The model gave a prediction in 60% of these cases. Predictive values were 85% for predicted responders and 86% for predicted nonresponders, compared to prior probabilities of 66% for observed response and 34% for observed nonresponse in those cases (both P<0.001). Convergent cross-validation was obtained through failure of the model to predict outcomes in a third independent sample of 189 completer cases who received non-SSRI antidepressants. We suggest proof of principle for genetic guidance to use or avoid SSRIs in a majority of Korean depressed patients.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel strategy to identify drug-repositioning opportunities. The starting point of our method is the generation of a signature summarising the consensual transcriptional response of multiple human cell lines to a compound of interest (namely the seed compound). This signature can be derived from data in existing databases, such as the connectivity-map, and it is used at first instance to query a network interlinking all the connectivity-map compounds, based on the similarity of their transcriptional responses. This provides a drug neighbourhood, composed of compounds predicted to share some effects with the seed one. The original signature is then refined by systematically reducing its overlap with the transcriptional responses induced by drugs in this neighbourhood that are known to share a secondary effect with the seed compound. Finally, the drug network is queried again with the resulting refined signatures and the whole process is carried on for a number of iterations. Drugs in the final refined neighbourhood are then predicted to exert the principal mode of action of the seed compound. We illustrate our approach using paclitaxel (a microtubule stabilising agent) as seed compound. Our method predicts that glipizide and splitomicin perturb microtubule function in human cells: a result that could not be obtained through standard signature matching methods. In agreement, we find that glipizide and splitomicin reduce interphase microtubule growth rates and transiently increase the percentage of mitotic cells-consistent with our prediction. Finally, we validated the refined signatures of paclitaxel response by mining a large drug screening dataset, showing that human cancer cell lines whose basal transcriptional profile is anti-correlated to them are significantly more sensitive to paclitaxel and docetaxel.",

Isotopic uptake studies in cells demonstrated that BCRP transports allopurinol and genetic variants in ABCG2 affect this transport.

        "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive malignancies, with a 5-year overall survival of less than 5%. Tumor drug resistance to conventional chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, is often a significant contributor to poor overall survival. One of the common mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance is activation of cell signaling via increased phosphorylation of Mitogen-Activated kinase (MAP) kinases, leading to increased tumor survival and reduced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. A growing body of evidence suggests that the CXCL12/CXCR4 signal transduction axis in the tumor microenvironment is an important mediator of tumor migration, growth, and drug resistance. We hypothesized that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), an important cellular component of the TME, play a contributory role in the growth, invasiveness, and drug response of pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) by activating CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated signal transduction. To test this, we used an in vitro model system to study the growth, invasion, and drug response of human PCCs in the presence or absence of in vitro-generated CAFs. Functional studies demonstrated that co-culture of PCCs with CAFs led to significant increase in tumor cell invasion, which was abrogated by blockade of CXCR4 by AMD3100-plerixafor (AMD3100), a CXCR4 antagonist, and by siRNA-mediated knockdown of CXCR4 in CAFs. Increased invasion of PCCs after co-culture with orthotopically derived CAFs was also abrogated by CXCR4 blockade, demonstrating a critical role for this receptor in regulating the tumor-promoting abilities of CAFs. Additionally, we investigated the effect of CAFs on the MAPK Signaling pathway (MEK1/2, p-MEK1/2, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, Akt, and p-Akt) via Western blot assays. Further, we examined the effect of AMD3100 on the chemo-resistance of PCCs to gemcitabine. Our results indicated that AMD3100 reversed gemcitabine-mediated chemo-resistance of PCCs cells in the presence of CAFs or CAF-conditioned media. In co-culture with pancreatic cancer cells, CAFs induced activation of MAPK signaling pathways and enhanced transcription of Mn-SOD, G6PD, and catalase, genes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathways. Using phloretin, a ROS inhibitor, we observed attenuation of MAPK signaling, SOD activity, and reversal of drug resistance in CAF-exposed pancreatic cancer cells. These findings implicate CXCL12/CXCR4-dependent MAPK signaling and ROS pathways in CAF-mediated modulation of the growth, migration, and drug resistance of PCCs. Citation Format: Ahlim Al.

        "abstract": "Biomarker development for prediction of patient response to therapy is one of the goals of molecular profiling of human tissues. Due to the large number of transcripts, relatively limited number of samples, and high variability of data, identification of predictive biomarkers is a challenge for data analysis. Furthermore, many genes may be responsible for drug response differences, but often only a few are sufficient for accurate prediction. Here we present an analysis approach, the Convergent Random Forest (CRF) method, for the identification of highly predictive biomarkers. The aim is to select from genome-wide expression data a small number of non-redundant biomarkers that could be developed into a simple and robust diagnostic tool. Our method combines the Random Forest classifier and gene expression clustering to rank and select a small number of predictive genes. We evaluated the CRF approach by analyzing four different data sets. The first set contains transcript profiles of whole blood from rheumatoid arthritis patients, collected before anti-TNF treatment, and their subsequent response to the therapy. In this set, CRF identified 8 transcripts predicting response to therapy with 89% accuracy. We also applied the CRF to the analysis of three previously published expression data sets. For all sets, we have compared the CRF and recursive support vector machines (RSVM) approaches to feature selection and classification. In all cases the CRF selects much smaller number of features, five to eight genes, while achieving similar or better performance on both training and independent testing sets of data. For both methods performance estimates using cross-validation is similar to performance on independent samples.

        "abstract": "Genetic-based optimization of treatment prescription is becoming a central research focus in the management of chronic diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, which incur a prolonged drug-regimen adjustment. This study was aimed to identify genetic markers that can predict response to glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) immunotherapy for relapsing multiple sclerosis. For this purpose, we genotyped fractional cohorts of two glatiramer acetate clinical trials for HLA-DRB1*1501 and 61 single nucleotide polymorphisms within a total of 27 candidate genes. Statistical analyses included single nucleotide polymorphism-by-single nucleotide polymorphism and haplotype tests of drug-by-genotype effects in drug-treated versus placebo-treated groups. We report the detection of a statistically significant association between glatiramer acetate response and a single nucleotide polymorphism in a T-cell receptor beta (TRB@) variant replicated in the two independent cohorts (odds ratio=6.85). Findings in the Cathepsin S (CTSS) gene (P=0.049 corrected for all single nucleotide polymorphisms and definitions tested, odds ratio=11.59) in one of the cohorts indicate a possible association that needs to be further investigated. Additionally, we recorded nominally significant associations of response with five other genes, MBP, CD86, FAS, IL1R1 and IL12RB2, which are likely to be involved in glatiramer acetate's mode-of-action, both directly and indirectly. Each of these association signals in and of itself is consistent with the no-association null-hypothesis, but the number of detected associations is surprising vis-\u00e0-vis chance expectation. Moreover, the restriction of these associations to the glatiramer acetate-treated group, rather than the placebo group, clearly demonstrates drug-specific genetic effects. These findings provide additional progress toward development of pharmacogenetics-based personalized treatment for multiple sclerosis.",

        "abstract": "Antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome and is also of particular importance in those who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with improvement in long-term clinical outcomes in such patients and is presently the antiplatelet therapy of choice for secondary prevention of thrombotic events. However, a significant number of patients experience recurrent events despite antiplatelet therapy. Although poor patient compliance can account for some of these events, particularly in those patients who receive a drug-eluting stent, increasing evidence indicates that there is variability in response to antiplatelet therapy and patients who have higher levels of platelet reactivity are at increased risk for recurrent ischemic events. However, the lack of a consistent definition of inadequate platelet response, as well as the lack of a standardized measurement technique, has made it difficult to define how to treat these patients. To translate findings associated with variability in platelet response into improved patient care, it is necessary to gain a better understanding of what variable platelet response is, how it is measured, who it should be measured in, and what its clinical relevance is. The objective of this review is to evaluate the data regarding interindividual response variability to antiplatelet therapy with the aim of providing practical considerations and where possible, recommendations, regarding this topic for interventional cardiologists. \u00a9 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Genotyping these polymorphisms has been shown to be important in reducing the time of the trial and error process for finding the maintenance dose of warfarin thus reducing the risk of adverse effects of the drug. Method: We developed a real-time isothermal DNA amplification system for genotyping three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence warfarin response. For each SNP, real-time isothermal Helicase Dependent Amplification (HDA) reactions were performed to amplify a DNA fragment containing the SNP. Amplicons were detected by fluorescently labeled allele specific probes during real-time HDA amplification. Results: Fifty clinical samples were analyzed by the HDA-based method, generating a total of 150 results. Of these, 148 were consistent between the HDA-based assays and a reference method. The two samples with unresolved HDA-based test results were repeated and found to be consistent with the reference method. Conclusion: The HDA-based assays demonstrated a clinically acceptable performance for genotyping the VKORC1 - 1639G. >. A SNP and two SNPs (430C. >. T and 1075A. >.

        "abstract": "The high-risk human papillomavirus E6 (hrHPV E6) protein has been widely studied due to its implication in cervical cancer. In response to viral threat, activated kinases phosphorylate the IRF3 autoinhibitory domain, inducing type1 interferon production. HPV circumvents the antiviral response through the possible E6 interaction with IRF3 and abrogates p53's apoptotic activity by recruiting E6-associated protein. However, the molecular mechanism of IRF3 inactivation by hrHPV E6 has not yet been delineated. Therefore, we explored this mechanism through in silico examination of protein-protein and protein-ligand docking, binding energy differences, and computational alanine mutagenesis. Our results suggested that the LxxLL motifs of IRF3 binds within the hydrophobic pocket of E6, precluding Ser-patch phosphorylation, necessary for IRF3 activation and interferon induction. This model was further supported by molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, protein-ligand docking and drug resistance modeling revealed that the polar patches in the pocket of E6, which are crucial for complex stability and ligand binding, are inconsistent among hrHPV species. Such variabilities pose a risk of treatment failure owing to point mutations that might render drugs ineffective, and allude to multi-drug therapy. Overall, this study reveals a novel perspective of innate immune suppression in HPV infections and suggests a plausible therapeutic intervention.",

First, we show that our model not only reproduces the findings of past mathematical models but also agrees qualitatively with previously observed experimental findings in vitro. Then, the model is used to study two contrasting methods of chemotherapeutic dosing: (1) maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and (2) metronomic dosing. Results of our simulations confirm the typical clinical observation that a single front-loaded dosing to MTD leads to a period of remission followed by recurrence, while metronomic dosing maintains or reduces the tumor size. These results suggest patient treatment strategies should favor the more recently proposed metronomic dosing paradigm over the traditionally used MTD therapy. The model proposed here is adaptable to different solid tumor types as well as different chemotherapeutic drug pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, making it ideal for similar studies on different clinical problems.",

        "abstract": "Only a few approaches are available to address the mechanisms of cell death in vivo which are induced by anticancer treatment in patients with malignancies. In this study in vitro chemosensitivity testing of primary peripheral blood leukemic cells of five patients suffering from different leukemic non-Hodgkin's lymphomas was combined with the analysis of the in vivo rate of apoptosis by flow-cytometry (Annexin V and depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by JC-1). Furthermore, changes in expression patterns of apoptosis related proteins during chemotherapeutic treatment were detected by Western Blot. Gene expression profiling (HG-U133A, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was employed to identify common marker genes of in vivo drug response. In vitro chemosensitivity was tested using the cytotoxic agents which the patients were scheduled to receive and was strongly correlated with effective reduction of leukemic lymphoma cells in patients resulting in complete remissions in all five cases. Due to the rapid clearance of apoptotic tumor cells in vivo neither the analysis of the in vivo rate of apoptosis and depolarisation of MMP nor the assessment of expression of regulators of apoptosis showed concordant results concerning the drug response. However, assessment of gene expression during therapy could identify a set of 30 genes to significantly discriminate between samples from patients before treatment compared to samples from the same patients after receiving cytotoxic therapy. Among these 30 genes we found a high proportion of genes associated with apoptotic cell death, cell proliferation and cell cycle signalling including complement lysis inhibitor (clusterin/CLU), beta-catenin interacting protein (ICAT), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1), TNF alpha converting enzyme (ADAM17/TACE), homeo box A3 (HOX1), inositol polyphosphatase 5-phosphatase type IV (PPI5PIV) and inhibitor of p53 induced apoptosis alpha (IPIA-Alpha/NM23-H6). These results indicate that in vitro chemosensitivity testing and gene expression profiling can successfully be utilised to analyse in vivo drug response in patients with leukemic NHL's and can be used to explore new pathway models of drug-induced cell death in vivo which are independent of different lymphoma subtypes and different treatment regimens. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials & methods: Using 1000 Genomes Project data, we analyzed 723 GPX variants in 1092 individuals belonging to 14 populations. Combining functional prediction analyses of coding and noncoding variants, we developed a method to estimate haplotype functionality. Results: GPX rare variants have a higher functional impact than common variants. The frequency among Asian patients of haplotypes associated with normal functionality is significantly higher for GPX1 and lower for GPX3 than for non-Asian patients; no adaptation signals in GPX1 and GPX3 were found in Asian patients. Conclusion: GPX1 and GPX3 differences may be associated with alterations in antioxidant capacity and redox regulation, which suggests diverse susceptibility to complex disease and diverse response to relevant drugs in Asians compared with individuals with other ethnic origins.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to: (a) study the in vitro chemosensitivity of primary epithelial ovarian cancer to drug combinations with cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin (CBDCA), paclitaxel (PTX), epirubicin (EPI), or cyclophosphamide (CTX) utilizing the ATP tumorchemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA); (b) correlate the test results with clinical response in patients with FIGO stage III ovarian cancer; and (c) analyze the most useful parameters for interpretation of test results. METHODS: CBDCA/CTX, CBDCA/PTX, CDDP/PTX, and EPI/PTX were tested in 93 fresh human primary epithelial ovarian cancer specimens. Correlations of in vitro drug sensitivity/resistance and clinical response were performed in 38 patients with FIGO stage III disease utilizing Fisher's exact test and by comparison of progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between those testing as sensitive or resistant. A progression-free interval of more than 12 months following surgery was classified as clinical response. ATP-TCA results were analyzed using the median effective dose, area under the curve, or a defined sensitivity index. RESULTS: Evaluable test results were achieved in 83 of 93 patients (89%). EPI/PTX had the highest in vitro activity (P < 0.001). In the clinical correlation, 29 of 38 patients (76%) were classified as in vitro sensitive (sensitivity index [SI] <250) and 9 patients as in vitro resistant (SI >250). The SI was superior for interpretation of test results. Patients testing as chemosensitive had a significantly longer mean PFS (28.5 vs 12.6 months, P = 0.033) and OS (46.1 vs 17.6, P = 0.03) compared to those patients predicted to be resistant. The assay demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of 95, 44, 66, and 89%, respectively (Fisher's exact test, P = 0. 007). CONCLUSION: The observed in vitro efficacy of EPI/PTX in primary epithelial ovarian cancer specimens warrants further clinical evaluation. The high evaluability rate and the observed correlation with PFS and OS, within the limitations of a nonrandomized study, support the use of the ATP chemosensitivity assay in future prospective assay-directed trials.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The response to and toxicity of methotrexate (MTX) are unpredictable in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Intracellular polyglutamation of MTX, assessed by measuring concentrations of MTX polyglutamates (MTXGlu), has been demonstrated to be a promising predictor of drug response. Therefore, this study was aimed at investigating the genetic predictors of MTXGlu variability and associations between MTXGlu and drug response in JIA. METHODS: The study was designed as a single-center cross-sectional analysis of patients with JIA who were receiving stable doses of MTX at a tertiary care children's hospital. After informed consent was obtained from the 104 patients with JIA, blood was withdrawn during routine MTX-screening laboratory testing. Clinical data were collected by chart review. Genotyping for 34 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18 genes within the MTX metabolic pathway was performed. An ion-pair chromatographic procedure with mass spectrometric detection was used to measure MTXGlu1-7. RESULTS: Analysis and genotyping of MTXGlu was completed in the 104 patients. K-means clustering resulted in 3 distinct patterns of MTX polyglutamation. Cluster 1 had low red blood cell (RBC) MTXGlu concentrations, cluster 2 had moderately high RBC MTXGlu1+2 concentrations, and cluster 3 had high concentrations of MTXGlu, specifically MTXGlu3-5. SNPs in the purine and pyrimidine synthesis pathways, as well as the adenosine pathway, were significantly associated with cluster subtype. The cluster with high concentrations of MTXGlu3-5 was associated with elevated liver enzyme levels on liver function tests (LFTs), and there were higher concentrations of MTXGlu3-5 in children who reported gastrointestinal side effects and had abnormal findings on LFTs. No association was noted between MTXGlu and active arthritis. CONCLUSION: MTXGlu remains a potentially useful tool for determining outcomes in patients with JIA being treated with MTX. The genetic predictors of MTXGlu variability may also contribute to a better understanding of the intracellular biotransformation of MTX in these patients.",

Subjects with A1 allele (Taq IA restriction fragment length polymorphism) of the gene encoding for the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) seem to express lower number of DRD2 compared to subjects who do not have this allele. We investigated whether subjects homozygous for the A1 allele of the DRD2 gene have decreased response to DRD2 stimulation by apomorphine when compared with those homozygous for the A2 allele. Two hundred and two Caucasian subjects were genotyped for DRD2 Taq IA polymorphism, 6.9 % had the genotype A1A1 and 65% A2A2. Nine homozygous subjects/group were selected for the apomorphine study. Five, 10 and 20 &mgr;g/kg of apomorphine were administered subcutaneously according to a randomized crossover design. The main pharmacodynamic criterion was the plasma growth hormone increase induced by apomorphine. Secondarily, we measured oral temperature responses and yawns in response to apomorphine. Plasma apomorphine concentrations were similar for the two matched and only genotypically different groups. Apomorphine dose-dependently increased serum growth hormone concentration, and significant effect of time, dose by time interaction but no effect of genotype or genotype by dose interaction was shown. Apomorphine decreased body temperature, significant effect of dose, time, dose by time interaction but no effect of genotype or genotype by dose interaction were observed. The number of apomorphine-induced yawns increased dose-dependently but no significant difference between groups occurred. Thus, in this study apomorphine-induced responses were not modified by DRD2 Taq IA polymorphism although the power of the study could be insufficient to detect subtle differences.",

        "abstract": "Current in vitro models for tumor growth and metastasis are poor facsimiles of in vivo cancer physiology and thus, are not optimal for anti-cancer drug development. Three dimensional (3D) tissue organoid systems, which utilize human cells in a tailored microenvironment, have the potential to recapitulate in vivo conditions and address the drawbacks of current tissue culture dish 2D models. In this study, we created liver-based cell organoids in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor. The organoids were further inoculated with colon carcinoma cells in order to create liver-tumor organoids for in vitro modeling of liver metastasis. Immunofluorescent staining revealed notable phenotypic differences between tumor cells in 2D and inside the organoids. In 2D they displayed an epithelial phenotype, and only after transition to the organoids did the cells present with a mesenchymal phenotype. The cell surface marker expression results suggested that WNT pathway might be involved in the phenotypic changes observed between cells in 2D and organoid conditions, and may lead to changes in cell proliferation. Manipulating the WNT pathway with an agonist and antagonist showed significant changes in sensitivity to the anti-proliferative drug 5-fluoruracil. Collectively, the results show the potential of in vitro 3D liver-tumor organoids to serve as a model for metastasis growth and for testing the response of tumor cells to current and newly discovered drugs.",

        "abstract": "Cancer patients show large individual variation in their response to chemotherapeutic agents. Gemcitabine (dFdC) and AraC, two cytidine analogues, have shown significant activity against a variety of tumors. We previously used expression data from a lymphoblastoid cell line-based model system to identify genes that might be important for the two drug cytotoxicity. In the present study, we used that same model system to perform a genome-wide association (GWA) study to test the hypothesis that common genetic variation might influence both gene expression and response to the two drugs. Specifically, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mRNA expression data were obtained using the Illumina 550K(R) HumanHap550 SNP Chip and Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip, respectively, for 174 ethnically-defined \"Human Variation Panel\" lymphoblastoid cell lines. Gemcitabine and AraC cytotoxicity assays were performed to obtain IC(50) values for the cell lines. We then performed GWA studies with SNPs, gene expression and IC(50) of these two drugs. This approach identified SNPs that were associated with gemcitabine or AraC IC(50) values and with the expression regulation for 29 genes or 30 genes, respectively. One SNP in IQGAP2 (rs3797418) was significantly associated with variation in both the expression of multiple genes and gemcitabine and AraC IC(50). A second SNP in TGM3 (rs6082527) was also significantly associated with multiple gene expression and gemcitabine IC50. To confirm the association results, we performed siRNA knock down of selected genes with expression that was associated with rs3797418 and rs6082527 in tumor cell and the knock down altered gemcitabine or AraC sensitivity, confirming our association study results. These results suggest that the application of GWA approaches using cell-based model systems, when combined with complementary functional validation, can provide insights into mechanisms responsible for variation in cytidine analogue response.",

This reflects the revolution in molecular oncology and biotechnology witnessed over the last 30 years. The identifica-tion of molecular pathways intrinsic to the origin of cancer has resulted in finding targets for anticancer agents and molecular biomarkers predictive of drug response. The clinical application of biomarkers in oncology has resulted in the identification of rare cancers within common cancer types. Orphan drug development plays a key role in sustaining the era of personalized cancer medicine. Areas covered: The development of crizotinib and its companion Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit is presented in this paper to highlight how the field of medical oncology is integrating advances in molecular biology to deliver the goal of personalized cancer care. The molecular basis of ALK-positive lung cancer and the evidence that supported crizotinib in successfully receiving an accelerated, orphan drug marketing approval status are also discussed. Expert opinion: The international oncology community strives to improve cancer outcomes. The revolution in molecular oncology has enabled the transition toward an era of targeted therapy and personalized medicine. Oncologists actively encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop novel anticancer agents in conjunction with a companion diagnostic test. This iden-tifies a subgroup of patients most likely to respond to a drug thereby limiting unnecessary toxicity and cost. This together with the financial incentives established by the Orphan Drug Act will fuel continued research in oncology orphan drug development in association with predictive biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "Aims: Typically, only a proportion of the patients suffering from common diseases respond to frequently prescribed drugs. Since the presence of drug nonresponders in pharmacogenetic studies can adversely affect statistical power we propose a method to restrict genetic tests to drug responders only. In this paper, we estimate drug nonresponse in a clinical trial for the asthma drug montelukast as either the result of an inactive genetic variant or the presence of subgroups of patients not responding to the drug. Materials & methods: We propose finite mixture models where unobserved (latent) categorical variables represent either a drug responder or nonresponder class. Analytical results show this method can substantially improve power by testing for genetic variants only in the drug-responder class. We also demonstrate how, if appropriate, placebo data can be used to further increase power to detect genetic effects. Results: It was estimated that only 25\u201330% of the subjects responded to the drug montelukast. Genetic-association tests confined to the responder group resulted in a substantial increase in explained genetic variance, between 10.3 and 13.2%, for four markers in the arachidonate 5-lipoxigenase (ALOX5) and cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CYSLTR1) genes. Conclusion: The presence of subgroups of patients that do not respond to the drug was an important reason for nonresponse. Additional analyses using finite mixture models in pharmacogenetic studies may provide insight into drug nonresponse and a better discrimination between true and false discoveries",

        "abstract": "The detection and treatment of cancer has advanced significantly in the past several decades, with important improvements in our understanding of the fundamental molecular and genetic basis of the disease. Despite these advancements, drug-screening methodologies have remained essentially unchanged since the introduction of the in vitro human cell line screen in 1990. Although the existing methods provide information on the overall effects of compounds on cell viability, they are restricted by bulk measurements, large sample sizes, and lack capability to measure proliferation kinetics at the individual cell level. To truly understand the nature of cancer cell proliferation and to develop personalized adjuvant therapies, there is a need for new methodologies that provide quantitative information to monitor the effect of drugs on cell growth as well as morphological and phenotypic changes at the single cell level. Here we show that a quantitative phase imaging modality known as spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) addresses these needs and provides additional advantages over existing proliferation assays. We demonstrate these capabilities through measurements on the effects of the hormone estradiol and the antiestrogen ICI182,780 (Faslodex) on the growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Along with providing information on changes in the overall growth, SLIM provides additional biologically relevant information. For example, we find that exposure to estradiol results in rapidly growing cells with lower dry mass than the control population. Subsequently blocking the estrogen receptor with ICI results in slower growing cells, with lower dry masses than the control. This ability to measure changes in growth kinetics in response to environmental conditions provides new insight on growth regulation mechanisms. Our results establish the capabilities of SLIM as an advanced drug screening technology that provides information on changes in proliferation kinetics at the cellular level with greater sensitivity than any existing method.",

In this case report, a 71-year-old Hispanic female with primary peritoneal carcinoma received single agent VRL as fourth-line regimen, which she tolerated very well except for a skin rash related to VRL. The rash continued to progress throughout 6 cycles of VRL, and follow-up CT/PET scan demonstrated complete metabolic and radiological responses. We, therefore, believe that this rash was linked to VRL administration and correlated with response to therapy. Rash has been recognized as a useful surrogate marker with targeted agents such as cetuximab and erlotinib; to the best of our knowledge, this case report describes the first patient with a possible drug rash and its association with a positive outcome. This case report incites interest in further investigation of similar cases to support this observation, since there is a lack of reports of skin rash with VRL therapy.",

Eleven candidate genes were functionally validated using siRNA knockdown approach in multiple cancer cell lines. We also characterized the potential mechanisms of genes by determining their influence on the activity of 10 cancer-related signaling pathways using reporter gene assays. Most SNPs regulated gene expression in a trans manner, except 7 SNPs in the PIGB gene that were significantly associated with both the expression of PIGB and gemcitabine cytotoxicity.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that genetic variation might contribute to drug response via either cis- or trans- regulation of gene expression.

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain cancer with extremely poor prognostic outcome despite intensive treatment. All chemotherapeutic agents currently used have no greater than 30-40% response rate, many fall into the range of 10-20%, with delivery across the blood brain barrier (BBB) or chemoresistance contributing to the extremely poor outcomes despite treatment. Increased expression of the multidrug resistance protein 1(MRP1) in high grade glioma, and it's role in BBB active transport, highlights this member of the ABC transporter family as a target for improving drug responses in GBM. In this study we show that small molecule inhibitors and gene silencing of MRP1 had a significant effect on GBM cell response to temozolomide (150 \u03bcM), vincristine (100 nM), and etoposide (2 \u03bcM). Pre-treatment with Reversan (inhibitor of MRP1 and P-glycoprotein) led to a significantly improved response to cell death in the presence of all three chemotherapeutics, in both primary and recurrent GBM cells. The presence of MK571 (inhibitor of MRP1 and multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) led to an enhanced effect of vincristine and etoposide in reducing cell viability over a 72 h period. Specific MRP1 inhibition led to a significant increase in vincristine and etoposide-induced cell death in all three cell lines assessed. Treatment with MK571, or specific MRP1 knockdown, did not have any effect on temozolomide drug response in these cells. These findings have significant implications in providing researchers an opportunity to improve currently used chemotherapeutics for the initial treatment of primary GBM, and improved treatment for recurrent GBM patients.",

Here we studied the effects of such choices, exemplified by predicting sensitivity (as IC50) of cancer cell lines towards a variety of compounds. For this, we used three independent sample collections and applied several machine learning algorithms for predicting a variety of endpoints for drug response. We compared all possible models for combinations of sample collections, algorithm, drug, and labeling to an identically generated null model. The predictability of treatment effects varies among compounds, i.e. response could be predicted for some but not for all. The choice of sample collection plays a major role towards lowering the prediction error, as does sample size. However, we found that no algorithm was able to consistently outperform the other and there was no significant difference between regression and two- or three class predictors in this experimental setting. These results indicate that response-modeling projects should direct efforts mainly towards sample collection and data quality, rather than method adjustment.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between brain MRI and clinical characteristics and patterns of antiepileptic drug (AED) response in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). METHODS: A total of 165 MTLE patients were divided into seizure-free with AED (AED responders, n = 50), pharmacoresistant (n = 87), and remitting-relapsing seizure control group (n = 28). All groups were evaluated regarding age, frequency of seizures, and age at epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy, febrile seizures, presence and side of hippocampal atrophy (HA), and initial precipitating injuries. For gray matter (GM) MRI voxel-based morphometry (VBM) we selected only patients with unilateral HA on visual MRI analysis (n = 100). Comparisons were made between all groups and 75 healthy controls. RESULTS: Age at epilepsy onset was lower (p = 0.005) and initial frequency of seizures was higher in the pharmacoresistant compared with the other 2 groups (p = 0.018). All groups showed GM atrophy compared to controls in ipsilateral hippocampus, bilateral parahippocampal gyri, frontal, occipital, parietal, and cerebellar areas. In the AED responders group, such findings were more restricted to areas ipsilateral to the epileptic focus and more widespread in the pharmacoresistant and remitting-relapsing groups. VBM pairwise comparisons showed areas with GM volume reduction in the pharmacoresistant and remitting-relapsing groups compared with AED responders in bilateral periorbital frontal (p < 0.01), cingulum (p < 0.05), and temporal lobe contralateral to the epileptic focus (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacoresistant and remitting-relapsing groups presented a similar pattern of GM atrophy, which was more widespread compared with AED responders. Conversely, age at epilepsy onset was lower and initial seizure frequency was higher in pharmacoresistant patients",

Background: Due to an increasing recognition of DLB, its early detection and treatment is clamored. Methods: Among patients who were admitted to our hospital and diagnosed as Lewy Body Disease, 9 patients without a chief complaint of amnesia were extracted for the investigation of their clinical features, the results of nuclear scanning ([123I] Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy and brain SPECT) and Revised Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-R). Six patients were treated by drugs chosen from levodopa, donepezil, clo- Fig. 1 (1185). nazepam and quetiapine in accordance with their chief complaints. Results: None of the patients met DSM-IV-TR criteria for dementia, and mean score of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 27.3 +/- 2.5. Mean age of onset (68.2 +/- 7.8) was lower than those who were formerly diagnosed as DLB (70.5 +/- 4.3) (P = 0.45). Primary symptoms were Parkinsonism, depression, visual hallucination, image distortions and impaired color vision. Mean early H/M ratio was 1.60 +/- 0.2. Decreased blood flow in occipital lobe was observed in all patients and parietal lobe was also involved in = patients. On WMS-R, visual memory index (mean: 81 +/- 8.7) was lower than verbal memory index (mean: 99 +/- 10.6) (P = 0.05). Levodopa alone did not alter any non-motor symptoms, but 5 patients treated with donepezil had shown clinical improvement. Clonazepam was effective for all patients with REM sleep behavioral disorder, and quetiapine was beneficial for poor responders towards donepezil. Conclusions: As for patients whose clinical presentation suggest DLB, but do not meet the diagnostic criteria lacking progressive dementia, detailed examinations such as SPECT and WMS-R sometimes reveal subclinical cognitive dysfunctions. Detecting DLB and initiating drug therapies at an early stage may alleviate its progression resulting in better prognosis.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy and mechanisms of therapeutic action are largely described by atomic bonds and interactions local to drug binding sites. Here we introduce global connectivity analysis as a high-throughput computational assay of therapeutic action - inspired by the Google page rank algorithm that unearths most \"globally connected\" websites from the information-dense world wide web (WWW). We execute short timescale (30\u2005ps) molecular dynamics simulations with high sampling frequency (0.01\u2005ps), to identify amino acid residue hubs whose global connectivity dynamics are characteristic of the ligand or mutation associated with the target protein. We find that unexpected allosteric hubs - up to 20\u00c5 from the ATP binding site, but within 5\u00c5 of the phosphorylation site - encode the Gibbs free energy of inhibition (\u0394Ginhibition) for select protein kinase-targeted cancer therapeutics. We further find that clinically relevant somatic cancer mutations implicated in both drug resistance and personalized drug sensitivity can be predicted in a high-throughput fashion. Our results establish global connectivity analysis as a potent assay of protein functional modulation. This sets the stage for unearthing disease-causal exome mutations and motivates forecast of clinical drug response on a patient-by-patient basis. We suggest incorporation of structure-guided genetic inference assays into pharmaceutical and healthcare Oncology workflows.",

        "abstract": "Inflammatory reactions (IRs), both infectious and aseptic, downregulate numerous enzymes of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and ATP-binding cassette transporters. The mechanism involves proinflammatory cytokines and activation of transcription factors, nuclear factor-(kappa)B, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-(beta) and c-myc, which bind to negative regulatory elements and/or impede the binding of nuclear receptors to promoter elements. Downregulation of CYP enzymes and transporters modulates the kinetics of a drug, resulting in increased plasma and tissue concentrations of the drug and enhanced effect and/or toxicity. Clinical trials have shown that IRs increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. In this article, we speculate that IRs downregulate cardiac and vascular CYP enzymes (CYP2C8/9 and CYP2J2) responsible for the formation of vasorelaxant products. Patients with IRs should be advised that the risk of drug adverse effects and of cardiovascular diseases is increased; therefore, the benefit-risk ratio and use of drugs with narrow therapeutic index should be revaluated, as well as the conditions precipitating cardiovascular events.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in genetics have spurred rapid progress towards the systematic identification of genes involved in complex diseases. Still, the detailed understanding of the molecular and physiological mechanisms through which these genes affect disease phenotypes remains a major challenge. Here, we identify the asthma disease module, i.e. the local neighborhood of the interactome whose perturbation is associated with asthma, and validate it for functional and pathophysiological relevance, using both computational and experimental approaches. We find that the asthma disease module is enriched with modest GWAS P-values against the background of random variation, and with differentially expressed genes from normal and asthmatic fibroblast cells treated with an asthma-specific drug. The asthma module also contains immune response mechanisms that are shared with other immune-related disease modules. Further, using diverse omics (genomics, gene-expression, drug response) data, we identify the GAB1 signaling pathway as an important novel modulator in asthma. The wiring diagram of the uncovered asthma module suggests a relatively close link between GAB1 and glucocorticoids (GCs), which we experimentally validate, observing an increase in the level of GAB1 after GC treatment in BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells. The siRNA knockdown of GAB1 in the BEAS-2B cell line resulted in a decrease in the NFkB level, suggesting a novel regulatory path of the pro-inflammatory factor NFkB by GAB1 in asthma.",

However, a significant number of patients shows\u2014or develops along time and disease progression\u2014drug resistance. In addition, not all type 2 diabetic patients have the same responsiveness to drug treatment. Despite the presence of nongenetic factors (hepatic, renal, and intestinal), most of such variability is due to genetic causes. Pharmacogenomics studies have described association between single nucleotide variations and drug resistance, even though there are still conflicting results. To date, the most reliable approach to investigate allelic variants is Next-Generation Sequencing that allows the simultaneous analysis, on a genome-wide scale, of nucleotide variants and gene expression.

Preclinical models utilizing LAM patient-derived cells have been difficult to establish. We developed a novel animal model system to study the molecular mechanisms of TSC/LAM pathogenesis and tumorigenesis and provide a platform for drug testing.\\n\\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: TSC2-deficient human cells, derived from the angiomyolipoma of a LAM patient, were engineered to co-express both sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Cells were inoculated intraparenchymally, intravenously, or intratracheally into athymic NCr nu/nu mice and cells were tracked and quantified using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography (CT). Surprisingly, TSC2-deficient cells administered intratracheally resulted in rapid dissemination to lymph node basins throughout the body, and histopathological changes in the lung consistent with LAM. Estrogen was found to be permissive for tumor growth and dissemination. Rapamycin inhibited tumor growth, but tumors regrew after the drug treatment was withdrawn.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We generated homogeneous NIS/GFP co-expressing TSC2-deficient, patient-derived cells that can proliferate and migrate in vivo after intratracheal instillation. Although the animal model we describe has some limitations, we demonstrate that systemic tumors formed from TSC2-deficient cells can be monitored and quantified noninvasively over time using SPECT/CT, thus providing a much needed model system for in vivo drug testing and mechanistic studies of TSC2-deficient cells and their related clinical syndromes.",

To calculate parameter values we fit the model to histopathology measurements of the fraction of tumor killed after chemotherapy in human patients with colorectal cancer metastatic to liver (coefficient of determination R(2) = 0.94). To validate the model in a different tumor type, we input patient-specific model parameter values from glioblastoma; the model successfully predicts extent of tumor kill after chemotherapy (R(2) = 0.7-0.91). Toward prospective clinical translation, we calculate blood volume fraction parameter values from in vivo contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging from a separate cohort of patients with colorectal cancer metastatic to liver, and demonstrate accurate model predictions of individual patient responses (average relative error = 15%). Here, patient-specific data from either in vivo imaging or histopathology drives output of the model's formulas. Values obtained from standard clinical diagnostic measurements for each individual are entered into the model, producing accurate predictions of tumor kill after chemotherapy. Clinical translation will enable the rational design of individualized treatment strategies such as amount, frequency, and delivery platform of drug and the need for ancillary non-drug-based treatment.",

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Analysis of relationships of drug structure to biological response is key to understanding off-target and unexpected drug effects, and for developing hypotheses on how to tailor drug therapies. New methods are required for integrated analyses of a large number of chemical features of drugs against the corresponding genome-wide responses of multiple cell models.\\n\\nRESULTS: In this article, we present the first comprehensive multi-set analysis on how the chemical structure of drugs impacts on genome-wide gene expression across several cancer cell lines [Connectivity Map (CMap) database]. The task is formulated as searching for drug response components across multiple cancers to reveal shared effects of drugs and the chemical features that may be responsible. The components can be computed with an extension of a recent approach called Group Factor Analysis. We identify 11 components that link the structural descriptors of drugs with specific gene expression responses observed in the three cell lines and identify structural groups that may be responsible for the responses. Our method quantitatively outperforms the limited earlier methods on CMap and identifies both the previously reported associations and several interesting novel findings, by taking into account multiple cell lines and advanced 3D structural descriptors. The novel observations include: previously unknown similarities in the effects induced by 15-delta prostaglandin J2 and HSP90 inhibitors, which are linked to the 3D descriptors of the drugs; and the induction by simvastatin of leukemia-specific response, resembling the effects of corticosteroids.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source Code implementing the method is available at: http://research.ics.aalto.fi/mi/software/GFAsparse\\n\\nCONTACT: suleiman.khan@aalto.fi or samuel.kaski@aalto.fi\\n\\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

        "abstract": "DNA microarrays are powerful tools for the analysis of gene expression on a genomic scale. The importance of individual regulatory events for the process under study can however not be deduced unequivocally without additional experiments. We devised a strategy to identify central regulators of cancer drug responses by combining the results of microarray experiments with efficient methods for phenotypic testing of candidate genes. We exposed murine FL5.12 pro-B cells to cisplatin, camptothecin, methotrexate or paclitaxel, respectively and analysed the patterns of gene expression with cDNA microarrays. Drug-specific regulatory events as well as intersections between different apoptotic pathways, including previously studied responses to staurosporine and interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation, were identified. Genes shared by at least three pathways were chosen for further analysis. Ectopic expression of three such genes, TEAP, GP49B, and Lipin1 was found to have an anti-proliferative effect on pro-B cells. Interestingly, we identified hemoglobin alpha as a strong pro-apoptotic regulator. While hemoglobin-expressing cells were growing normally in the presence of IL-3, they displayed accelerated apoptosis with similar kinetics as Bax overexpressing cells upon IL-3 removal. The pro-apoptotic effect of hemoglobin was suppressed by Bcl-2 and was characterized by enhanced stimulation of caspase activity.",

A transgenic mouse line overexpressing tNOX was generated to determine its overall growth phenotype and susceptibility to EGCg. Cultured noncancer cells lack tNOX and are unresponsive to EGCg. Overexpression of tNOX in cultured noncancer cells through transfection resulted in both enhanced growth and an acquired inhibitory response to EGCg. The tNOX transgenic mouse line was developed using a phCMV2 vector with the hemagglutinin (HA) tag. Transgenic mice exhibited both an enhanced growth rate and a response to EGCg not observed with wild-type mice. Female transgenic mice grew twice as fast as wild type, and growth was reflected in an overall increased carcass weight. Administration of EGCg in the drinking water [500 mg/kg body weight (BW)] reduced the growth rate of the transgenic mice to that of wild-type mice. The findings provide in situ validation of the hypothesis that tNOX represents a necessary and sufficient molecular target as the basis for the protective and potential cancer therapeutic benefits of EGCg. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Patch-clamp experiments combined with transcript scanning of the Kcnma1 gene encoding the alpha subunit of the BK channel were performed in rat slow-twitch soleus (Sol) and fast-twitch flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) skeletal muscles. Five splicing products of the Kcnma1 gene were isolated from Sol and FDB: the e17, e22, +29 aa, Slo27 and Slo0 variants. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression of e22 and Slo0 were 80-90% higher in FDB than Sol, whereas the expression of Slo27 was 60% higher in Sol than FDB, and the +29 aa variant was equally expressed in both muscle types. No beta 1-4 subunits were detected. In Sol, a large BK current with low Ca(2+) sensitivity was recorded. The BK channel of Sol also showed a reduced response to BK channel openers, such as NS1619, acetazolamide and related drugs. In FDB, a reduced BK current with high Ca(2+) sensitivity and an enhanced drug response was recorded. The total BK RNA content, which was 200% higher in Sol than in FDB, correlated with the BK currents in both muscles. Drug responses primarily correlated with e22 and Slo0 expression levels in FDB and to Slo27 expression in Sol muscle. In conclusion, phenotype-dependent BK channel biophysical and pharmacological properties correlated with the expression levels of the variants in muscles. These findings may be relevant to conditions affecting postural muscles, such as prolonged bed-rest, and to diseases affecting fast-twitch muscles, such as periodic paralysis. Down-regulation or up-regulation of the variants associated with pathological conditions may affect channel composition and drug responses.",

        "abstract": "We determined if time to first remission predicts long-term antiepileptic drug response. We assessed time to first 1-year remission (1YR) as a determinant of entering future terminal 5-year remission (5YTR) in a population-based cohort of 144 children prospectively followed-up since their first unprovoked seizure before the age of 16 years up to the mean age of 48 years. The proportion of patients entering 5YTR was highly dependent on the length of time to first 1YR after starting adequate treatment. For 144 patients, the overall 5YTR rate decreased from 32% for those in remission at year 1 to 24% at year 2, to 5% after 3 and 4 years, to 2% after 5 years or longer. Patients who entered 1YR within the first 5 years of treatment had an 11-fold better chance to enter 5YTR (odds ratio = 11.4, 95% CI = 2.9-45.3, P = 0.0005) and a 9-fold chance for uninterrupted 5YTR off medications (OR = 9.0, 95% CI = 1.171.9, P = 0.0383) compared with those who did not enter 1YR within the first 5 years of treatment. Three additional independent prognostic factors for predicting terminal 5YTR were confirmed: etiology, seizure frequency prior to treatment, and seizure frequency during treatment. We conclude that delayed efficacy after starting drug treatment gradually diminishes chances for long-term seizure remission, whether on medication or not. Not entering remission within 5 years of starting treatment predicts failure to achieve long-term seizure freedom in the future for the vast majority of patients. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Herein we investigated HDL lipidomic profiles associated with fenofibrate treatment and the drug-induced Hcy levels in the FIELD substudy. We found that fenofibrate leads to complex HDL compositional changes including increased apoA-II, diminishment of lysophosphatidylcholines and increase of sphingomyelins. Ethanolamine plasmalogens were diminished only in a subgroup of fenofibrate-treated patients with elevated homocysteine levels. Finally we performed molecular dynamics simulations to qualitatively reconstitute HDL particles in silico. We found that increased number of apoA-II excludes neutral lipids from HDL surface and apoA-II is more deeply buried in the lipid matrix than apoA-I. In conclusion, a detailed molecular characterization of HDL may provide surrogates for predictors of drug response and thus help identify the patients who might benefit from fenofibrate treatment.",

        "abstract": "Because methylphenidate (MPH) is currently the most widely prescribed medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), several studies have used this as the touch-stone for evaluating the efficacy of a newer stimulant, Adderall. In a parallel-groups study of MPH (n = 20), Adderall (n = 20), and placebo (n = 18), Pliszka et al. (2000) reported that both medications were superior to placebo in improving parent, teacher, and clinician ratings of ADHD and associated behaviors. Compared with MPH, Adderall led to significantly more improvements in teacher and clinician ratings. The present study extends these results by addressing the issue of clinical significance using drug-placebo and drug-drug response curve analyses of the same data. The goal of this method is to answer the following questions about drug-placebo or drug-drug differences: Is the effect clinically meaningful? What does the effect tell us about individual responses? Is the effect due to symptom improvement, the prevention of worsening, or both? Our results show that the efficacy of Adderall to improve functioning is seen throughout the full range of improvement scores. In contrast, MPH showed a substantial effect for \"mildly\" and \"much improved\" but not for \"very much improved.\" Our analyses also show that both Adderall and MPH prevent worsening of symptoms. They further suggest that, compared with the Conners Teacher Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impressions scale may be more sensitive to improvements at the \"well end\" of the spectrum of functioning.",

An alternative strategy is to use a recently published 'Quantitative Systems Pharmacology' computer-based mechanistic disease model of cortical/subcortical and striatal circuits based upon preclinical physiology, human pathology and pharmacology. The physiology of 27 relevant dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate-mediated targets is calibrated using retrospective clinical data on 24 different antipsychotics. The model was challenged to predict quantitatively the clinical outcome in a blinded fashion of two experimental antipsychotic drugs; JNJ37822681, a highly selective low-affinity dopamine D(2) antagonist and ocaperidone, a very high affinity dopamine D(2) antagonist, using only pharmacology and human positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data. The model correctly predicted the lower performance of JNJ37822681 on the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) total score and the higher extra-pyramidal symptom (EPS) liability compared to olanzapine and the relative performance of ocaperidone against olanzapine, but did not predict the absolute PANSS total score outcome and EPS liability for ocaperidone, possibly due to placebo responses and EPS assessment methods. Because of its virtual nature, this modeling approach can support central nervous system research and development by accounting for unique human drug properties, such as human metabolites, exposure, genotypes and off-target effects and can be a helpful tool for drug discovery and development.",

        "abstract": "Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells, with over 54,000 new cases per year diagnosed worldwide and a 5-year survival rate below 60%. This highlights a need for research into the mechanisms behind its etiology and causes of therapy failure. The bone marrow microenvironment, in which adult stem cells are maintained in healthy individuals, has been implicated as a source of chemoresistance and disease relapse. Here the various ways that the microenvironment can contribute to the resistance and persistence of leukemia are discussed. The targeting of the microenvironment by leukemia cells to create an environment more suitable for cancer progression is described. The role of soluble factors, drug transporters, microvesicles, as well as the importance of direct cell\u2013cell contact, in addition to the effects of inflammation and immune surveillance in microenvironmentmediated drug resistance are discussed. An overview of the clinical potential of translating research findings to patients is also provided. Understanding of and further research into the role of the bone marrow microenvironment in leukemia progression and relapse are crucial towards developing more effective treatments and reduction in patient morbidity.",

        "abstract": "The conventional breast cancer diagnosis based mainly upon histopathology, hormone and HER-2 receptor status, will in the future be combined with information on genomic and epigenetic profiles of the individual patient. This will lead to an optimal personalized therapy, directed towards specific genomic aberrations, avoiding unnecessary toxicity, side effects and chemotherapeutic drugs for which the patient evolves resistance. Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous malignancy, expressing a considerable variation in genomic aberrations from deletions and amplifications comprising entire chromosomes to minor regions. A wide spectrum of differently expressed genes and mutations has been identified, adding information to the highly complex picture of the tumor genome. The vast majority of breast cancer incidents is of somatic origin and may be caused by a combination of the individual genetic profile and environmental exposure. A major contributor to the variation in genetic profile is the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are highly abundant throughout the genome, and both current and future methodologies have the potential to screen millions of SNP genotypes in one analysis. Identification of specific SNP genotypes affecting transcriptional activity and thereby the outcome for the patient, of genes involved in DNA repair, metabolizing of chemotherapeutic drugs and drug target genes will determine the outcome for the patient. This will be an essential part of the development of personalized treatment of cancer. In this review the focus is on clinically relevant SNPs in genes implicated in drug metabolism and disposition as well as their influence on breast cancer therapy toxicity and/or efficacy.  2009 Elsevier B.V.

In C. elegans RNAi can effectively be administrated via feeding the nematodes bacteria expressing double-stranded RNA targeting the gene of interest. Several commercial C. elegans RNAi libraries are available and hence gene inactivation using RNAi can relatively easily be performed in a genome-wide fashion.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment strategies blocking tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) have proven very successful in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, a significant subset of patients does not respond for unknown reasons. Currently, there are no means of identifying these patients before treatment. This study was aimed at identifying genetic factors predicting anti-TNF treatment outcome in patients with RA using a genome-wide association approach.\\n\\nMETHODS: We conducted a multistage, genome-wide association study with a primary analysis of 2 557 253 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 882 patients with RA receiving anti-TNF therapy included through the Dutch Rheumatoid Arthritis Monitoring (DREAM) registry and the database of Apotheekzorg. Linear regression analysis of changes in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints after 14 weeks of treatment was performed using an additive model. Markers with p<10(-3) were selected for replication in 1821 patients from three independent cohorts. Pathway analysis including all SNPs with p<10(-3) was performed using Ingenuity.\\n\\nRESULTS: 772 markers showed evidence of association with treatment outcome in the initial stage. Eight genetic loci showed improved p value in the overall meta-analysis compared with the first stage, three of which (rs1568885, rs1813443 and rs4411591) showed directional consistency over all four cohorts studied. We were unable to replicate markers previously reported to be associated with anti-TNF outcome. Network analysis indicated strong involvement of biological processes underlying inflammatory response and cell morphology.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Using a multistage strategy, we have identified eight genetic loci associated with response to anti-TNF treatment. Further studies are required to validate these findings in additional patient collections.",

The aim of the present article is to analyze the relationship between DI and DUI, and pharmacological response in the different psychiatric disorders with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative aspects. An updated review of the current literature was conducted through PubMed in order to compare different studies focused on DI and DUI, and treatment response in major psychoses and in depressive/anxiety disorders. A significant body of evidence shows that a prolonged DI and DUI is associated with brain abnormalities and poor treatment response, particularly in schizophrenia. Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies point toward a similar conclusion in mood and anxiety disorders as well, even though fewer studies have been published in this field. Given the relationship between a longer DI and DUI, and poor treatment response-not only in schizophrenia but also in mood and anxiety disorders-specific intervention programs aimed to reduce the latency to treatment are definitely envisaged. \u00a9 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Despite some success in the treatment of colorectal carcinomas, novel rational therapies targeting specific cancer-related molecules are under development and urgently needed. These approaches need careful preclinical evaluation in models that closely mirror the clinical situation. Therefore, we established a panel of 15 xenotransplantable tumours directly from fresh surgical material. We showed that both the histology and expression of tumour-associated markers (Epithelial Cell Adhesion molecule (EpCAM), E-cadherin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)) could be maintained during passaging in nude mice. Xenotransplanted tumours were characterised for chemosensitivity and revealed a response rate of 5/15 (33%) for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 15/15 (100%) for irinotecan and 8/14 (57%) for oxaliplatin. 5 patients out of 15 were treated with cytostatics because of synchronous metastases. The response to chemotherapy in these patients coincided very closely with the response of the individual xenografts. All of the xenografts expressed the proliferation marker Ki67 and the nuclear enzyme, Topoisomerase II?? (Topo II??) at the protein level. Most of the xenografts also expressed the tumour suppressor, p53 (9/14) and the nuclear enzyme Topoisomerase I?? (Topo I??) (13/14) at the protein level. Interestingly, the presence of a K-ras mutation in codon 12 (5/15 xenografts) coincided with a low response rate towards oxaliplatin. This observation needs further confirmation using a larger number of tumours. In conclusion, we were able to establish transplantable xenografts suitable to mimic the clinical situation. These well characterised models are useful tools for the preclinical development of novel therapeutic approaches and for investigating translational research aspects. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to disclose major mechanisms of antirheumatic drug action on human chondrocytes and to reveal marker and pharmacological target genes that are involved in cartilage dysfunction and regeneration. METHODS: An interactive in vitro cultivation system composed of human chondrocyte alginate cultures and conditioned supernatant of SV40 T-antigen immortalised human synovial fibroblasts was used. Chondrocyte alginate cultures were stimulated with supernatant of RA synovial fibroblasts, of healthy donor synovial fibroblasts, and of RA synovial fibroblasts that have been antirheumatically treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (azathioprine, gold sodium thiomalate, chloroquine phosphate, and methotrexate), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (piroxicam and diclofenac), or steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (SAIDs) (methylprednisolone and prednisolone). Chondrocyte gene expression profile was analysed using microarrays. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed for validation of microarray data. RESULTS: Genome-wide expression analysis revealed 110 RA-related genes in human chondrocytes: expression of catabolic mediators (inflammation, cytokines/chemokines, and matrix degradation) was induced, and expression of anabolic mediators (matrix synthesis and proliferation/differentiation) was repressed. Potential marker genes to define and influence cartilage/chondrocyte integrity and regeneration were determined and include already established genes (COX-2, CXCR-4, IL-1RN, IL-6/8, MMP-10/12, and TLR-2) and novel genes (ADORA2A, BCL2-A1, CTGF, CXCR-7, CYR-61, HSD11B-1, IL-23A, MARCKS, MXRA-5, NDUFA4L2, NR4A3, SMS, STS, TNFAIP-2, and TXNIP). Antirheumatic treatment with SAIDs showed complete and strong reversion of RA-related gene expression in human chondrocytes, whereas treatment with NSAIDs and the DMARD chloroquine phosphate had only moderate to minor effects. Treatment with the DMARDs azathioprine, gold sodium thiomalate, and methotrexate efficiently reverted chondrocyte RA-related gene expression toward the 'healthy' level. Pathways of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, transforming growth factor-beta/Toll-like receptor/Jak-STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) signalling and extracellular matrix receptor interaction were targeted by antirheumatics. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that RA-relevant stimuli result in the molecular activation of catabolic and inflammatory processes in human chondrocytes that are reverted by antirheumatic treatment. Candidate genes that evolved in this study for new therapeutic approaches include suppression of specific immune responses (COX-2, IL-23A, and IL-6) and activation of cartilage regeneration (CTGF and CYR-61).",

Utilizing the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) to longitudinally monitor proliferation and migration of melanoma cells in 3D culture and in vivo, we found that invading melanoma cells cycle actively, while G1-arrested cells showed decreased invasion. Melanoma cells in a hypoxic environment or treated with mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibitors remained G1-arrested for extended periods of time, with proliferation and invasion resuming after re-exposure to a more favorable environment. We challenge the idea that the invasive and proliferative capacity of melanoma cells are mutually exclusive and further demonstrate that a reversibly G1-arrested subpopulation survives in the presence of targeted therapies.",

We hypothesized that the two cell lines differ in their ability to activate the intrinsic death pathway and have, therefore, dissected the lysosome-mitochondrion signalling pathway by pharmacological inhibition or genetic manipulation of key regulators and executioners. Biochemical and morphological confocal fluorescence studies showed that: (1) In A2780 cells bcl-2 is expressed at an undetectable level, whereas Bax is expressed at a rather high level; by contrast, bcl-2 is highly expressed and Bax is expressed at extremely low levels in NIHOVCAR3 cells; (2) Chemotherapy treatment reduced the expression of bcl-2 in NIHOVCAR3 cells, yet these cells resisted to drug toxicity; (3) Cathepsin D (CD), not cathepsin B or L, mediates the activation of the mitochondrial intrinsic death pathway in A2780 cells; (4) Lysosome leakage and cytosolic relocation of CD occurs in the chemosensitive A2780 cells, not in the chemoresistant NIHOVCAR3 cells; (5) Bax is essential for the permeabilization of both lysosomes and mitochondria in A2780 cells exposed to chemotherapy drugs; (6) CD activity is mandatory for the oligomerization of Bax on both mitochondrial and lysosomal membranes; (7) Bax activation did not occur in the resistant NIHOVCAR3 cells despite their high content in CD. The present data are consistent with a model in which on treatment with a cytotoxic drug the activation of a CD-Bax loop leads to the generalized permeabilization of lysosomes and eventually of mitochondria, thus reaching the point of no return, and culminates with the activation of the caspase cascade. Our data also imply that dysfunctional permeabilization of lysosomes contributes to the development of chemoresistance.",

        "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer with incidence rate in USA and Europe of 3.5 cases per 100 000 children. The overall current cure rate is ~ 75% and around 25% of treated children die from resistant disease, relapse or treatment toxicities. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are known to be key determinators for interidividual differences in treatment resistance and toxic side effects [1]. Because childhood ALL treatment protocols include up to 13 different chemotherapeutic agents, it is hard to evaluate the impact of individual SNPs. So far focus has mainly been on the widely used glucocorticosteroids, methotrexate and thiopurines, or on metabolic pathways and transport mechanisms that are common to several drugs, such as the glutathione S-transferases. However, beyond the thiopurine methyltransferase polymorphisms, the candidate-gene approach has not established clear associations between polymorphisms and treatment response. Instead of single SNP or gene investigation, we have designed a high- throughput assay for ~ 20 000 targeted SNPs to explore combined gene- dosage effects. The assay applies multiplexed targeted sequencing as a costeffective technique for genotyping. Such a multiple-SNP assay will allow the investigation of effects mediated via pathways where one of several SNPs (in the same or different genes) may lead to very similar clinical phenotypes due to related molecular mechanisms. In selection of genes, we have included those involved in pharmacology, immunology, DNA-repair mechanisms, mitosis activity genes, and genes that affect apoptosis, neurotoxicity and thrombosis. We have also included binding partners of key proteins from protein-protein interaction data, and proteins known to interact with the 13 compounds commonly used for treatment. The selected SNPs target coding regions and known regulatory regions including predicted microRNA target sites. The study will include up to 2000 children with ALL, divided into a retrospective study (600-800 samples) and a prospective study. This poster will present current status and challenges of the project and demonstrate the multiplexed targeted sequencing as a cost-effective technique for genotyping.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the effect of dasatinib and sunitinib on tyrosine kinase (TK) signaling, caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression and secretion and proliferation of PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of both cell lines with either dasatinib or sunitinib reduced phosphorylation of PDGFR, VEGFR2, Akt, FAK, Src (dasatinib only) and Cav-1, and reduced cellular and secreted levels of Cav-1. Both agents dose-dependently inhibited proliferation of these cells. In PC-3 and DU145 subcutaneous xenografts, treatment with dasatinib, sunitinib or anti-Cav-1 antibody (Ab) alone produced significant tumor regression compared with that by vehicle or IgG alone. Combined dasatinib and anti-Cav-1 Ab treatment or sunitinib and anti-Cav-1 Ab produced greater tumor regression than either treatment alone. Serum Cav-1 levels were lower in dasatinib- and sunitinib-treated mice than they were in vehicle-treated mice, and correlated positively with tumor growth in dasatinib- and sunitinib-treated groups (r = 0.48, p = 0.031; r = 0.554, p = 0.0065, respectively), compared with vehicle controls. Cav-1 knockdown, in combination with dasatinib or sunitinib treatment in PC-3 cells, caused a greater reduction in the phosphorylation of PDGFR-\u03b2 and VEGFR2, and expression and secretion of PDGF-B and VEGF-A than that in PC-3 cells treated with dasatinib or sunitinib alone in control siRNA cells, suggesting that Cav-1 is involved in an autocrine pathway that is affected by these drugs. Overall, our results suggest a role for Cav-1 as a biomarker of response to both dasatinib and sunitinib treatment and as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The introduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) antagonists has substantially improved patient's clinical outcome in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, nearly 20% to 40% of RA patients do not respond to anti-TNF-\u03b1 treatment strategies. To identify valid predictors of TNF-\u03b1 antagonist response in RA, serum proteome profiles from responders (R) and non-responders (NR) to etanercept, a soluble recombinant TNF-\u03b1 receptor/IgG Fc fusion protein receptor, were compared in a prospective cohort study.\\n\\nMETHODS: In this clinical study 50 RA patients with inadequate response to conventional DMARDs were included and treated with etanercept. The primary efficacy endpoint was response according to the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) improvement criteria. Serum samples collected prior to initiation and after six months of etanercept therapy were cleared of the most abundant major proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography. After separation by two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and identification by mass spectrometry (MS) data were validated by Western blot analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS: After six months of etanercept treatment 62% (n=31) of RA patients achieved response. Haptoglobin-\u03b11 (Hp-\u03b11) and -\u03b12 (Hp-\u03b12) and vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) were found to be significantly upregulated in responder sera (P\u22640.02) at study entry. In contrast, apolipoprotein C-III (ApoC-III) showed significantly higher levels in non-responders (P=0.0162). At study end ApoA-II, Hp-\u03b11, Hp-\u03b12 and VDBP were identified to be expressed at significantly higher levels (P<0.05) in responder sera.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: By application of clinical proteomics in immunodepleted sera we could identify and validate for the first time Hp-\u03b11, -\u03b12, VDBP and ApoC-III as potential biomarkers for prediction of etanercept drug response in RA.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of hematopoietic cell differentiation and may contribute to altered growth of leukemic stem cells. Using microarray-based miRNA profiling, we found that miRNA 486 (miR-486) is significantly upregulated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) compared with normal CD34(+) cells, particularly in the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor population. miR-486-5p expression increased during erythroid differentiation of both CML and normal CD34(+) cells. Ectopic miR-486-5p expression enhanced in vitro erythroid differentiation of normal CD34(+) cells, whereas miR-486-5p inhibition suppressed normal CD34(+) cell growth in vitro and in vivo and inhibited erythroid differentiation and erythroid cell survival. The effects of miR-486-5p on hematopoietic cell growth and survival are mediated at least in part via regulation of AKT signaling and FOXO1 expression. Using gene expression and bioinformatics analysis, together with functional screening, we identified several novel miR-486-5p target genes that may modulate erythroid differentiation. We further show that increased miR-486-5p expression in CML progenitors is related to both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent mechanisms. Inhibition of miR-486-5p reduced CML progenitor growth and enhanced apoptosis following imatinib treatment. In conclusion, our studies reveal a novel role for miR-486-5p in regulating normal hematopoiesis and of BCR-ABL-induced miR-486-5p overexpression in modulating CML progenitor growth, survival, and drug sensitivity.",

ADP (6 ??M) and collagen (6 ??g/mL) induced platelet aggregation, as well as ADP (2 ??M) induced glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa activation and P-selectin expression were assessed at baseline and 4, 24, and 48 h following clopidogrel front-loading. A more intense and rapid inhibition of platelet activation (both GP IIb/IIIa activation and P-selectin expression) were achieved using a 600 mg, compared to a 300 mg, LD throughout the entire 48 hours (p < 0.001). Although there were no differences in platelet aggregation, overall a 600 mg LD increased the number of clopidogrel responders and this was also achieved earlier compared to a 300 mg LD. A 600 mg LD did not reduce interindividual variability of platelet response. The use of a 600 mg clopidogrel LD in patients undergoing coronary stenting optimises platelet inhibitory effects early after intervention and may provide a more effective protection against early thrombotic complications. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The European Society of Cardiology.",

        "abstract": "Caspases are proteases involved in cell death, where caspase-3 is the chief executioner that produces an irreversible cutting event in downstream protein substrates and whose activity is desired in the management of cancer. To determine such activity in clinically relevant samples with high signal-to-noise, plasmon rulers are ideal because they are sensitively affected by their interparticle separation without ambiguity from photobleaching or blinking effects. A plasmon ruler is a noble metal nanoparticle pair, tethered in close proximity to one another via a biomolecule, that acts through dipole\u2013dipole interactions and results in the light scattering to increase exponentially. In contrast, a sharp decrease in intensity is observed when the pair is confronted by a large interparticle distance. To align the mechanism of protease activity with building a sensor that can report a binary signal in the presence or absence of caspase-3, we present a caspase-3 selective plasmon ruler (C3SPR) composed of a pair of Zn0.4Fe2.6O4@SiO2@Au core\u2013shell nanoparticles connected by a caspase-3 cleavage sequence. The dielectric core (Zn0.4Fe2.6O4@SiO2)-shell (Au) geometry provided a brighter scattering intensity versus solid Au nanoparticles, and the magnetic core additionally acted as a purification handle during the plasmon ruler assembly. By monitoring the decrease in light scattering intensity per plasmon ruler, we detected caspase-3 activity at single molecule resolution across a broad dynamic range. This was observed to be as low as 100 fM of recombinant material or 10 ng of total protein from cellular lysate. By thorough analyses of single molecule trajectories, we show caspase-3 activation in a drug-treated chronic myeloid leukemia (K562) cancer system as early as 4 and 8 h with greater sensitivity (2- and 4-fold, respectively) than conventional reagents. This study provides future implications for monitoring caspase-3 as a biomarker and efficacy of drugs.",

        "abstract": "To identify genes involved in etoposide drug response, we used promoter trap mutagenesis to isolate an etoposide-resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. This resistant CHO-K1 line, named E91, showed cross-resistance to C(2)-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine). The promoter trap retrovirus was found integrated into intron 1-2 of the Dlc-2 (Stard13) RhoGap gene. The E91 cells showed elevated guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound RhoA levels compared with the parental line, suggesting that retrovirus integration had inactivated one of the Dlc-2 RhoGap alleles. To test whether E91 cells were impaired in an intracellular ceramide-regulated process not directly related to cell killing, we measured mitochondrial phosphatidylglycerolphosphate (PGP) synthase and phospholipase A2 enzyme activities in cells after C(2)-ceramide addition. Parental cells showed elevated enzyme activities after treatment with C(2)-ceramide or tumor necrosis factor alpha, but not the E91 cells. These results suggested that intracellular ceramide signaling was defective in E91 cells due to increased levels of active GTP-bound RhoA. RNA knockdown experiments of the Dlc2 RhoGap resulted in increased GTP-bound RhoA and reduced induction of PGP synthase after C(2)-ceramide addition compared with controls. Expression of a dominant-negative RhoA in the E91 cell line allowed induction of PGP synthase by ceramide. The RNA interference knockdown cell line also showed increased etoposide resistance. This study is the first report for the regulation of a phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme through RhoGap expression.",

Samples were analyzed using three technologies: targeted exon sequencing using Pacific Biosciences PacBio RS, multiplex somatic mutation genotyping using Sequenom MassARRAY and Sanger sequencing. An expert panel reviewed results prior to reporting to clinicians. A clinical laboratory verified actionable mutations. Fifty patients were recruited. Nineteen actionable mutations were identified in 16 (32%) patients. Across technologies, results were in agreement in 100% of biopsy specimens and 95% of archival specimens. Profiling results from paired archival/biopsy specimens were concordant in 30/34 (88%) patients. We demonstrated that the use of next generation sequencing for real-time genomic profiling in advanced cancer patients is feasible. Additionally, actionable mutations identified in this study were relatively stable between archival and biopsy samples, implying that cancer mutations that are good predictors of drug response may remain constant across clinical stages.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the authors investigated if CNS degenerative abnormalities could correlate with depressive symptoms in elderly patients, if the presence of mild/moderate cognitive impairment could be related to the response to treatment and the role of peculiar clinical features in influencing the response to treatment. Fifty-three patients (60-75 years) diagnosed as affected by late onset (after 60 years) Major Depressive Episodes according to DSM-IV criteria were studied. Brain vascular and degenerative markers were assessed by computed tomography (CT) through measurements of a lateralized version of the bifrontal index and a rating scale addressing subcortical disease. The presence of mild/moderate cognitive impairment [(24-28 total score at the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)], and of specific symptoms were assessed at baseline and evaluated with respect to the antidepressant response. Patients with CT abnormalities showed higher baseline scores on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) items \"late insomnia\" (t=-2.674, P=.002), \"somatic symptoms\" (t=-3.355 P=.002), and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) item \"emotional withdrawal\" (t=-3.355, P=.002). No significant correlation was found between the vascular index and baseline clinical symptoms, while the HAM-D \"depressed mood\" item was negatively correlated to the right frontal index (R=-0.692, P=.006). Patients with CT abnormalities showed a lower reduction of HAM-D total scores than patients with normal CT (time effect: F=29.277, P<.0001; group effect: F=5.154, P<.03), while a significant reduction of symptoms in time (time effect: F=33.33, P<.0001) but no differences between groups were found on Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A). Both patients with and without mild cognitive impairment improved on the HAM-D (time effect: F=19.668, P<.0001), BPRS (time effect: F=18.345, P<.0001), and HAM-A (time effect: F=17.959, P<.0001) total scores. Patients with emotional withdrawal showed lower improvement on BPRS total scores (time effect: F=26.946, P<.0001; group effect: F=5.121, P<.03). The results from this study showed that patients with baseline emotional withdrawal and CT abnormalities have poorer outcome.

Various tests have become clinically available to measure platelet function after antiplatelet treatment. A wide interpatient variability in the magnitude of platelet inhibition has been demonstrated in numerous studies, especially in response to clopidogrel. Several reasons including clinical, pharmacological and genetic factors have been identified. High on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity has been linked to adverse clinical outcome, in particular to stent thrombosis after percutaneous coronary interventions. New antiplatelet drugs including prasugrel and ticagrelor have been advocated to overcome the limitations of clopidogrel.

        "abstract": "The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study was a large clinical trial designed to address the question of the best treatment strategy once a standard first-line pharmaceutical treatment failed for a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD). For STAR*D, the initial treatment for all subjects was citalopram. The trial enrolled over 4,000 subjects, and 1,953 donated DNA for genetic analyses. The key clinical results of this study have been published and reviewed.1 In a series of ancillary studies to STAR*D, several research groups The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression have analyzed the available DNA samples and the corresponding out- come measures from the STAR*D trial in hopes of obtaining insight into the genetic susceptibility to treatment response, the mechanism of antidepressant action, and a number of other research interests. This brief 2-part review highlights the results related to the genetic findings of STAR*D, with focus on the phenotype of remission and adverse side effects including suicide and sexual dysfunction. The well-known serotonin transporter gene will be covered in the first part, and other candidate gene studies, studies of side effects, and future directions for genetic research in the STAR*D sample will be addressed in the second part.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have facilitated the profiling of large panels of cancer cell lines with responses measured for thousands of drugs. The computational challenge is now to realize the potential of these data in predicting patients responses to these drugs in the clinic. We address this issue by examining the spectrum of prediction models of patient response: models predicting directly from cell lines, those predicting directly from patients, and those trained on cell lines and patients at the same time. We tested 21 classification models on four drugs (bortezomib, erlotinib, docetaxel and epirubicin) for which clinical trial data were available. Our integrative models consistently outperform cell line-based predictors, indicating that there are limitations to the predictive potential of in vitro data alone. Furthermore, these integrative models achieve better predictive accuracy and require substantially fewer patients than would be the case if only patient data were available. Altogether our results support the relevance of preclinical data for therapy prediction in clinical trials, enabling more efficient and cost-effective trial design.",

The borderline depressed patients had earlier age of onset of their depressions, more chronic depressions, more alcohol and cannabis comorbidity, and were more likely to have histories of suicide attempts and of self-mutilation. On self-report, patients with BPD and OPD reported more phobic symptoms, greater interpersonal sensitivity, and more paranoid ideation. Uniquely, BPD patients were more angry than OPD patients. BPD patients had high novelty seeking, high harm avoidance, low self-directedness, and low cooperativeness. Depressed patients with BPD did poorly in the short term if treated with nortriptyline rather than fluoxetine. After 6 months, those with BPD had a favorable outcome in regard to depressive symptoms, social adjustment, and even improvement in the character measure of self-directedness. Those with the poorest outcome were those with OPD. Copyright 2003, Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.",

Novel therapies, particularly tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TKI) and agents that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), have improved the treatment. Both chemotherapy and targeted therapy have their molecular mechanisms. This study aimed to determine the mutation, amplification, or expression status and interrelationships of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), K-Ras proto-oncogene, excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), and VEGF genes as well as their correlations to prognosis of large cell lung carcinoma (LCLC) after EGFR-targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and anti-VEGF therapy. EGFR and K-Ras mutations in 60 specimens of LCLC were detected by direct DNA sequencing. EGFR, ERCC1, and VEGF protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). EGFR gene copy number was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). One (1.7%) patient had an EGFR L858M point mutation in exon 21, 3 (5.0%) had K-Ras mutations, and 10 (19.6%) had EGFR amplification (FISH positive). Positive rates of EGFR, ERCC1, and VEGF proteins were 38.3%, 56.7%, and 70.0%, respectively. EGFR amplification was positively correlated to EGFR protein expression (r = 0.390, P = 0.005). The positive rate of VEGF protein was significantly higher in patients with lymph node metastasis than in those without (84.6% vs. 58.8%, P = 0.046). No significant correlations were observed among the EGFR, K-Ras, ERCC1, and VEGF genes. EGFR gene amplification and the low rate of EGFR mutation suggest that patients with LCLC are likely to obtain little benefit from anti-EGFR therapies.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: To conduct a psychometric analysis to determine the adequacy of instruments that measure cognition in Alzheimer's disease trials. BACKGROUND: Both the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition (ADAS-Cog) and the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) are validated outcome measures for clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease and are approved also for regulatory purposes. However, it is not clear how comparable they are in measuring cognitive function. In fact, many recent trials in Alzheimer's disease patients have failed and it has been questioned if ADAS-Cog still is a sensitive measure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present paper examines the psychometric properties of ADAS-Cog and NTB, based on a post hoc analysis of data from a clinical trial (NCT01024660), which was conducted by AstraZeneca, in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, with a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Total score 16-24. Acceptability, reliability, different types of validity and ability to detect change were assessed using relevant statistical methods. Total scores of both tests, as well as separate domains of both tests, including the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Verbal Fluency Condition, were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, NTB performed well, with acceptable reliability and ability to detect change, while ADAS-Cog had insufficient psychometric properties, including ceiling effects in 8 out of a total of 11 ADAS-Cog items in mild AD patients, as well as low test-retest reliability in some of the items. DISCUSSION: Based on a direct comparison on the same patient sample, we see advantages of the NTB compared with the ADAS-Cog for the evaluation of cognitive function in the population of mild-to-moderate AD patients. The results suggest that not all of ADAS-Cog items are relevant for both mild and moderate AD population. CONCLUSIONS: This validation study demonstrates satisfactory psychometric properties of the NTB, while ADAS-Cog was found to be psychometrically inadequate.",

        "abstract": "The recent discovery of the direct oxidation of spermine via spermine oxidase (SMO) as a mechanism through which specific antitumor polyamine analogues exert their cytotoxic effects has fueled interest in the study of the polyamine catabolic pathway. A major byproduct of spermine oxidation is H2O2, a source of toxic reactive oxygen species. Recent targeted small interfering RNA studies have confirmed that SMO-produced reactive oxygen species are directly responsible for oxidative stress capable of inducing apoptosis and potentially mutagenic DNA damage. In the present study, we describe a second catalytically active splice variant protein of the human spermine oxidase gene, designated SMO5, which exhibits substrate specificities and affinities comparable to those of the originally identified human spermine oxidase-1, SMO/PAOh1, and, as such, is an additional source of H2O2. Importantly, overexpression of either of these SMO isoforms in NCI-H157 human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells resulted in significant localization of SMO protein in the nucleus, as determined by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, cell lines overexpressing either SMO/PAOh1 or SMO5 demonstrated increased spermine oxidation in the nucleus, with accompanying alterations in individual nuclear polyamine concentrations. This increased oxidation of spermine in the nucleus therefore increases the production of highly reactive H2O2 in close proximity to DNA, as well as decreases nuclear spermine levels, thus altering the protective roles of spermine in free radical scavenging and DNA shielding, and resulting in an overall increased potential for oxidative DNA damage in these cells. The results of these studies therefore have considerable significance both with respect to targeting polyamine oxidation as an antineoplastic strategy, and in regard to the potential role of spermine oxidase in inflammation-induced carcinogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Progress towards construction of a dense map of di-allelic markers across the human genome has generated considerable enthusiasm for pharmacogenomic applications. To date, however, nearly all of the effort on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) projects has been focused on marker identification and screening, not on how the SNP genotype data actually can be used in clinical trials to advance medical practice. Here, we explore how different properties of SNPs impact the size, scope and design of clinical trials using a simple trial design. We evaluate the clinical trial sampling requirements under different allele frequencies, gene action, gene effect size and number of markers in a genome screen. Power and sample size calculations suggest that allele frequency and type of gene action can have a dramatic impact on trial sample sizes, in that under some conditions the required sample sizes are too large to be applicable in a costly clinical trial setting. In other situations, however, pharmacogenomic clinical trials can yield significant sampling/cost savings over traditional trials. These properties are discussed with regard to the general usage of genetic information in clinical trial settings.",

        "abstract": "A number of phenomenologic studies have demonstrated the marked heterogeneity of unipolar depressive disorders. We have recently identified a subtype of depression characterized by the presence of irritability and anger attacks. These attacks are sudden spells of anger accompanied by symptoms of autonomic activation such as tachycardia, sweating, flushing, and tightness of the chest. They are experienced by depressed patients as uncharacteristic of them and inappropriate to the situations in which they occur. Approximately one third of depressed outpatients present with anger attacks. Patients with unipolar depression and anger attacks frequently experience significant anxiety and somatic symptoms, and are relatively more likely to meet criteria for avoidant, dependent, borderline, narcissistic, and antisocial personality disorders than depressed patients without these attacks. Anger attacks subside in 53% to 71% of depressed outpatients treated with antidepressants, and the degree of improvement in depressive symptoms after antidepressant treatment is comparable in depressed patients with and without anger attacks. In addition, the rate of emergence of anger attacks after treatment with antidepressants (6%-10%) appears to be lower than the rate with placebo (20%). Finally, antidepressants that affect serotonergic neurotransmission, known to be involved in the modulation of aggressive behavior in animals and humans, may be particularly effective in this subtype of depression, but further studies are needed to support this hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "The identification of genetic polymorphisms that influence the efficacy and safety of therapies for breast cancer may allow future treatments to be individualised based not only on tumour characteristics but also on host genetics. Genetic factors that affect the metabolism, efficacy and safety of tamoxifen, one of the most common drugs used for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer, have received particular attention. Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is crucial in the metabolism of tamoxifen to its active metabolite endoxifen. Women with genetic variants of CYP2D6 or who take drugs that inhibit the enzyme have low endoxifen plasma concentrations and may show reduced benefits to tamoxifen treatment. CYP2D6 polymorphisms and variants in other candidate genes may also influence secondary benefits and side effects of tamoxifen. Here, we summarise data suggesting that CYP2D6 status may be an important predictor of the benefits of tamoxifen to an individual; in addition, we briefly discuss the role of variants in other candidate genes. Whether CYP2D6 status should be determined prior to initiating tamoxifen therapy is currently under debate and may be appropriate only for select women who are candidates for tamoxifen alone but for whom alternative standard options are available.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) have been shown to be resistant to chemotherapy. However, the mechanisms underlying BCSC-mediated chemoresistance remain poorly understood. The hedgehog (Hh) pathway is important in the stemness maintenance of CSCs. Nonetheless, it is unknown whether the Hh pathway is involved in BCSC-mediated chemoresistance. In this study, we cultured breast cancer MCF-7 cells in suspension in serum-free medium to obtain BCSC-enriched MCF-7 mammosphere (MCF-7 MS). We showed that MCF-7 MS cells are sensitive to salinomycin but not paclitaxel, distinct from parent MCF-7 cells. The expression of the critical components of Hh pathway, PTCH, SMO, Gli1, and Gli2, was significantly up-regulated in MCF-7 MS cells; salinomycin not paclitaxel treatment caused a remarkable decrease of expression of those genes in MCF-7 MS cells but not in MCF-7 cells. Salinomycin not paclitaxel increased apoptosis,decreased migration capacity of MCF-7 MS cells, accompanied with decreased expression of C-myc, Bcl-2, and Snail, the target genes of Hh pathway. Salinomycin-induced cytotoxic effect could be blocked by Shh-mediated Hh signaling activation. Inhibition of the Hh pathway by cyclopamine could sensitize MCF-7 MS cells to paclitaxel. In addition, Salinomycin not paclitaxel significantly reduced the tumor growth, accompanied with decreased expression of PTCH, SMO, Gli1 and Gli2 in xenograft tumors. Furthermore, the expression of SMO and Gli1 was positively correlated with the expression of CD44(+)/CD24(-), and the expression of SMO and Gli1 in CD44(+)/CD24(-) tissues was associated with a significantly shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.",

One function of Srx is the reduction of cysteine sulfinic acid to sulfenic acid in proteins subject to oxidative stress. Other redox active protein families have multiple functions in regulating redox and controlling proliferation/death pathways; increased Srx has been linked with oncogenic transformation. To explore the biological functions of Srx in tumors, we established cell lines that overexpress Srx. Enhanced levels of Srx promoted cell proliferation and enhanced cell death following cisplatin. Srx overexpression triggered an alteration in expression and phosphorylation of cell cycle regulators p21, p27 and p53; stabilized the phosphatase PTEN and, importantly, interacted directly with, and enhanced the activity of, phosphatase PTP1B. In turn, this promoted Src kinase activity by dephosphorylating its inhibitory tyrosine residue (Y530). Srx expression was stimulated by cell exposure to certain growth factors. These data support a role for Srx in controlling the phosphorylation status of key regulatory kinases through effects upon phosphatase activity with an ultimate effect on pathways that influence cell proliferation.",

A panel of 74 SNPs in 25 genes involved in blood pressure regulation was selected from the SNP databases, and genotyped in DNA samples of 97 hypertensive patients. The patients had been randomized to double-blind treatment with either the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker irbesartan or the beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol. Genotyping was performed using a microarray based DNA polymerase assisted 'minisequencing' single nucleotide primer extension assay with fluorescence detection. The observed genotypes were related to the blood pressure reduction using stepwise multiple regression analysis. The allele frequencies of the selected SNPs were determined in the Swedish population. The established microarray-based genotyping system was validated and allowed unequivocal multiplex genotyping of the panel of 74 SNPs in every patient. Almost 7200 SNP genotypes were generated in the study. Profiles of four or five SNP-genotypes that may be useful as predictors of blood pressure reduction after antihypertensive treatment were identified. Our results highlight the potential of microarray-based technology for SNP genotyping in pharmacogenetics.",

        "abstract": "In order to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and analyze their characteristics in a set of 111 genes, we resequenced exons and flanking regions in an average of 170 chromosomes from individuals of European origin. Genetic variability was decreased in noncoding regions highly conserved between human and rodents, indicating functional relevance of these regions. Furthermore, diversity of coding nonsynonymous SNPs was found lower in regions encoding a known protein sequence motif. SNPs predicted to be of functional significance were more common amongst rare variants. Despite the significant recent growth of SNP numbers in public SNP databases, only a small fraction of these rare variants is represented. This may be relevant in the investigation of the genetic causes of severe side effects, for which rare variants are plausible candidates. Estimation of htSNPs reduces the genotyping effort required in capturing common haplotypes, for certain genes, however, this accounts for only a small fraction of haplotype diversity.",

        "abstract": "Despite an increasingly recognized relationship between depression and smoking, little is known about the degree to which treatment studies for depression consider the impact of smoking on outcomes. The aim of this study is to examine the extent to which smoking is considered in current antidepressant treatment research. We conducted a MEDLINE search of recent randomized clinical trials of pharmacotherapy for depression published between 1 January and 31 December 2007, and a search of current pharmacological intervention studies for depression using www.ClinicalTrials.gov. Only 5% of the 107 pharmacological trials for depression published in 2007 reported the smoking status of their samples. Two studies (1.9%) controlled for smoking in the analyses and no studies analyzed outcomes by smoking status. Excluding the eight studies of combined treatment for depression and nicotine dependence, no other study on www.ClinicalTrials.gov (total n = 920) reported an intention to analyze outcomes by smoking status. Emerging data link smoking and depression, however, little attention has been directed toward the effects of smoking on antidepressant treatment outcomes. Conducting research to understand how nicotine and smoking affect responsiveness to antidepressants would advance our understanding of the neurobiology of depression and the development of new and targeted treatments.",

        "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapies have been found to be particularly effective in tumors that harbor deleterious germline or somatic mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, the products of which contribute to the conservative homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Nonetheless, several setbacks in clinical trial settings have highlighted some of the issues surrounding the investigation of PARP inhibitors, especially the identification of patients who stand to benefit from such drugs. One potential approach to finding this patient subpopulation is to examine the tumor DNA for evidence of a homologous recombination defect. However, although the genomes of many breast and ovarian cancers are replete with aberrations, the presence of numerous factors able to shape the genomic landscape means that only some of the observed DNA abnormalities are the outcome of a cancer cell's inability to faithfully repair DNA double-strand breaks. Consequently, recently developed methods for comprehensively capturing the diverse ways in which homologous recombination deficiencies may arise beyond BRCA1/2 mutation have used DNA microarray and sequencing data to account for potentially confounding features in the genome. Scores capturing telomeric allelic imbalance, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and large scale transition score, as well as the total number of coding mutations are measures that summarize the total burden of certain forms of genomic abnormality. By contrast, other studies have comprehensively catalogued different types of mutational pattern and their relative contributions to a given tumor sample. Although at least one study to explore the use of the LOH scar in a prospective clinical trial of a PARP inhibitor in ovarian cancer is under way, limitations that result in a relatively low positive predictive value for these biomarkers remain. Tumors whose genome has undergone one or more events that restore high-fidelity homologous recombination are likely to be misclassified as double-strand break repair-deficient and thereby sensitive to PARP inhibitors and DNA damaging chemotherapies as a result of prior repair deficiency and its genomic scarring. Therefore, we propose that integration of a genomic scar-based biomarker with a marker of resistance in a high genomic scarring burden context may improve the performance of any companion diagnostic for PARP inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder responds almost only to potent serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Previous studies have suggested a relation between serotonergic function and clinical outcome in serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind trial, comparing clomipramine, paroxetine, and a placebo in obsessive-compulsive disorder, serotonin levels in whole blood (WB-5-HT) were measured at baseline, after 1 week, and after 4 weeks of treatment and related to clinical outcome in 36 patients. Results: In patients treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors there was a pronounced decrease of WB-5-HT, variable after 1 week and uniformly maximal after 4 weeks. The decrease of WB-5-HT after 1 week of serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment correlated negatively with clinical outcome after 12 weeks (r = -.61, p = .0006); hence, patients with slower WB-5-HT reactivity eventually responded better to treatment. Baseline WB-5-HT, but not WB-5-HT reactivity, was related to season. Depression, autistic traits, and previous serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment predicted nonresponse. Conclusions: A fast decrease of WB-5-HT was associated with poor clinical outcome. This may be related to faster serotonin efflux from platelets, which has previously been linked to autism. Further studies are necessary to identify the underlying mechanism and discern whether serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced WB-5-HT decrease is clinically useful. ?? 2001 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",

METHODS: We analyzed office, home, ambulatory daytime and nighttime BP responses in hypertensive adults randomized to atenolol (N = 242) or hydrochlorothiazide (N = 257) in the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses Study. Since different measured BP responses may have different predictors, we tested the \"same signal\" model by using linear regression methods to determine whether known predictors of BP response depend on the method of BP measurement. We estimated signal-to-noise ratios and compared power to identify a genetic polymorphism predicting BP response measured by each method separately and by weighted averages of multiple methods. RESULTS: After adjustment for pretreatment BP level, known predictors of BP response including plasma renin activity, race, and sex were independent of the method of BP measurement. Signal-to-noise ratios were more than 2-fold greater for home and ambulatory daytime BP responses than for office and ambulatory nighttime BP responses and up to 11-fold greater for weighted averages of all four methods. Power to identify a genetic polymorphism predicting BP response was directly related to the signal-to-noise ratio and, therefore, greatest with the weighted averages. CONCLUSION: Since different methods of measuring BP response to antihypertensive drug therapy measure the same signal, weighted averages of the BP responses measured by multiple methods minimize measurement error and optimize power to identify genetic predictors of BP response.",

        "title": "Boolean ErbB network reconstructions and perturbation simulations reveal individual drug response in different breast cancer cell lines.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite promising progress in targeted breast cancer therapy, drug resistance remains challenging. The monoclonal antibody drugs trastuzumab and pertuzumab as well as the small molecule inhibitor erlotinib were designed to prevent ErbB-2 and ErbB-1 receptor induced deregulated protein signalling, contributing to tumour progression. The oncogenic potential of ErbB receptors unfolds in case of overexpression or mutations. Dimerisation with other receptors allows to bypass pathway blockades. Our intention is to reconstruct the ErbB network to reveal resistance mechanisms. We used longitudinal proteomic data of ErbB receptors and downstream targets in the ErbB-2 amplified breast cancer cell lines BT474, SKBR3 and HCC1954 treated with erlotinib, trastuzumab or pertuzumab, alone or combined, up to 60 minutes and 30 hours, respectively. In a Boolean modelling approach, signalling networks were reconstructed based on these data in a cell line and time course specific manner, including prior literature knowledge. Finally, we simulated network response to inhibitor combinations to detect signalling nodes reflecting growth inhibition.\\n\\nRESULTS: The networks pointed to cell line specific activation patterns of the MAPK and PI3K pathway. In BT474, the PI3K signal route was favoured, while in SKBR3, novel edges highlighted MAPK signalling. In HCC1954, the inferred edges stimulated both pathways. For example, we uncovered feedback loops amplifying PI3K signalling, in line with the known trastuzumab resistance of this cell line. In the perturbation simulations on the short-term networks, we analysed ERK1/2, AKT and p70S6K. The results indicated a pathway specific drug response, driven by the type of growth factor stimulus. HCC1954 revealed an edgetic type of PIK3CA-mutation, contributing to trastuzumab inefficacy. Drug impact on the AKT and ERK1/2 signalling axes is mirrored by effects on RB and RPS6, relating to phenotypic events like cell growth or proliferation. Therefore, we additionally analysed RB and RPS6 in the long-term networks.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We derived protein interaction models for three breast cancer cell lines. Changes compared to the common reference network hint towards individual characteristics and potential drug resistance mechanisms. Simulation of perturbations were consistent with the experimental data, confirming our combined reverse and forward engineering approach as valuable for drug discovery and personalised medicine.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in the field of intrusion detection brought new requirements to intrusion prevention and response. Tra- ditionally, the response to the detected attack was selected and deployed manually, in the recent years the focus has shifted towards developing automated and semi-automated methodologies for responding to intrusions. In this context, the cost-sensitive intrusion response models have gained the most interest mainly due to their emphasis on the balance between potential damage incurred by the intrusion and cost of the response. However, one of the challenges in applying this approach is defining consistent and adaptable measure- ment of these cost factors on the basis of requirements and policy of the system being protected against intrusions. In this paper we present a structured methodology for eval- uating cost of responses based on three factors: the response operational cost associated with the dailymaintenance of the response, the response goodness that measures the applica- bility of the selected response for a detected intrusion and the response impact on the system that refers to the possible response effect on the system functionality. The proposed approach provides consistent basis for response evaluation across different systems while incorporating security policy and properties of specific system environment. We demon- strate the advantages of the proposed cost model and eval- uate it on the example of three systems.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the response to clopidogrel among aspirin-resistant versus aspirin-sensitive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Wide variability has been reported in response to aspirin and clopidogrel. There are limited data on the simultaneous responses to both drugs. METHODS: Elective PCI patients (n = 150) who received aspirin for <1 week but not clopidogrel were included. All patients received bivalirudin during PCI. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and 20 to 24 h after a 300-mg clopidogrel dose. Aspirin resistance was defined by ???2 of 3 criteria: rapid platelet function analyzer-ASA score ???550, 5 ??mol/l adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced aggregation ???70%, and 0.5 mg/ml arachidonic acid-induced aggregation ???20%. Clopidogrel resistance was defined as baseline minus post-treatment aggregation ???10% in response to 5 and 20 ??mol/l ADP. RESULTS: Nineteen (12.7%) patients were resistant to aspirin and 36 (24%) to clopidogrel. Nine (47.4%) of the aspirin-resistant patients were also clopidogrel resistant. Aspirin-resistant patients were more likely to be women and have diabetes than were aspirin-sensitive patients. They also had lower response to clopidogrel, assessed by platelet aggregation and activation markers (flow cytometry-determined PAC-1 binding and P-selectin expression). Elevation of creatine kinase-myocardial band after stenting occurred more frequently in aspirin-resistant versus aspirin-sensitive patients (38.9% vs. 18.3%; p = 0.04) and in clopidogrel-resistant versus clopidogrel-sensitive patients (32.4% vs. 17.3%; p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin-resistant patients as a group have reduced response to clopidogrel. Furthermore, we have identified a unique group of dual drug-resistant patients who may be at increased risk for thrombotic complications after PCI. ?? 2006 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.",

        "abstract": "Genotype-phenotype modeling problems are often overcomplete, or ill-posed, since the number of potential predictors-genes, proteins, mutations and their interactions-is large relative to the number of measured outcomes. Such datasets can still be used to train sparse parameter models that generalize accurately, by exerting a principle similar to Occam's Razor: When many possible theories can explain the observations, the most simple is most likely to be correct. We apply this philosophy to modeling the drug response of Type-1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1). Owing to the decreasing expense of genetic sequencing relative to in vitro phenotype testing, a statistical model that reliably predicts viral drug response from genetic data is an important tool in the selection of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The optimization techniques described will have application to many genotype-phenotype modeling problems for the purpose of enhancing clinical decisions.",

Treatment na\u00efve Scandinavian HIV-positive patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0242) were randomized to one of three study arms. Two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were administrated in combination with 400/100\u00a0mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily, 300/100\u00a0mg atazanavir/ritonavir once a day or 600\u00a0mg efavirenz once a day. The viral response was monitored at screening, baseline and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 24, 48, 96, 120, and 144\u00a0weeks after study initiation. Data up to 400\u00a0days was fitted using a viral dynamics non-linear mixed effects drug-disease model in NONMEM. HIV-RNA data below LOQ of 50\u00a0copies/ml plasma (39%) was omitted, replaced by LOQ/2 or included in the analysis using a likelihood-based method (M3 method). Including data below LOQ using the M3 method substantially improved the model fit. The drug response parameter expressing the fractional inhibition of viral replication was on average (95% CI) estimated to 0.787 (0.721-0.864) for lopinavir and atazanavir treatment arms and 0.868 (0.796-0.923) for the efavirenz containing regimen. At 400\u00a0days after treatment initiation 90% (76-100) of the lopinavir and atazanavir treated patients were predicted to have undetectable viral levels and 96% (89-100%) for the efavirenz containing treatment. Including viral data below the LOQ rather than omitting or replacing data provides advantages such as better model predictions and less biased parameter estimates which are of importance when quantifying antiretroviral drug response.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Since primary tumor cells from patients have been used as a model for assessment of drug response for individual patients, this study aims to evaluate the reliability of such a model in colorectal cancer (CRC) in predicting the response of tumor tissues through comparison of their expression profiles. METHODS: Establishment of primary cultures from tissues obtained surgically from CRC patients allowed us to study the gene expression differences between normal and tumor tissues as well as primary cultures derived from the tumor mass. The tissues comparison highlights the molecular characteristics of tumors, while the comparison between primary tumor cells versus normal and tumor tissues allowed us to identify alterations associated with the establishment of culture. Genes-drug association analyses allowed us to fine-tune our expectations while using primary culture as a model for drug assessment. RESULTS: Comparison between tumor cultures and original tissues through functional analyses showed the deregulations caused by culture establishment. Investigating the impact of such changes in genes-drug associations to identify the potential alterations in drug response, we found that primary cultures may have increased susceptibility toward paclitaxel, but reduced susceptibility toward analogues of fluorouracil compared with original tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Response of primary tumor cells toward different drugs is not linearly associated to tumor tissues. Our results highlight the importance to account for the discrepancy in responses between the primary tumor cells and original counterparts in order to provide clinicians with important insights to improve selection of drugs for individual patients based on in vitro assays.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objective: Many drugs, including proton pump inhibitors and certain antidepressants, are metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 enzyme. A significant portion of extensive metabolizers do not reach appropriate drug levels, and our objective was to investigate any genetic background. Methods: The 5???-flanking region of the CYP2C19 gene from subjects with rapid omeprazole metabolism was sequenced, and CYP2C19 phenotype-genotype associations were analyzed in Swedish (n = 107) and Ethiopian (n = 126) extensive metabolizers. The relationship of the metabolic ratio of omeprazole (omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole in plasma 3 hours after drug intake) with the area under the plasma concentration-time curve was used for prediction studies. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted by use of human nuclear protein extracts. Hepatic reporter vector transfections were carried out in CD1 mice. Results: We identified a novel allele (CYP2C19* (*)17) carrying -806C>T and -3402C>T, with a frequency of 18% in both Swedes and Ethiopians and 4% in Chinese subjects. In Swedes the metabolic ratio of omeprazole was higher in subjects homozygous for CYP2C19* (*)1 (median, 0.50 [interquartile range, 0.37-0.73]) than in those homozygous for CYP2C19* (*)17 (median, 0.25 [interquartile range, 0.15-0.33]) (P = .010). In Ethiopians a similar difference in the S/R-mephenytoin ratio was observed between individuals homozygous for CYP2C19* (*)1 (median, 0.20 [interquartile range, 0.12-0.37]) and those homozygous for CYP2C19* (*)17 (median, 0.05 [interquartile range, 0.03-0.06]) (P = .013). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed specific binding of human hepatic nuclear proteins to an element carrying -806T but not -806C. Reporter vector experiments showed an increased transcriptional activity of the CYP2C19* (*)17 allele in vivo in mice. Predictions revealed that CYP2C19* (*)17 homozygotes would attain 35% to 40% lower omeprazole area under the plasma concentration-time curve values than subjects homozygous for CYP2C19* (*)1 taking standard doses of omeprazole. Conclusion: CYP2C19* (*)17 is likely to cause therapeutic failures in drug treatment with, for example, proton pump inhibitors and antidepressants.

First, we discuss the need for a reliable method to compare the performance of cloud services among a number of various services being offered. Second, we develop a different type of metrics and propose a suitable methodology to measure the scalability using these types of metrics. We focus on the visualization resources such as CPU, storage disk, and network infrastructure. Finally, we compare well-known cloud providers using the proposed approach and conclude the recommendations. This type of research will help cloud consumers, before signing any official contract to use the desired services, to ascertain the ability and capacity of the cloud providers to deliver a particular service.",

There were no differences in drug concentrations between rejectors and non-rejectors. A pre-transplantation cut-off value of 55.80% for %CD8+-IFN-\u03b3+ identified patients at high risk of AR with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 82%. In the first week post-transplantation, patients with a % inhibition for soluble IFN-\u03b3, %CD8+-IFN-\u03b3+ and %CD8+-IL2+ lower than 40% developed AR, showing low susceptibility to immunosuppressive drugs.

        "abstract": "AIM: The identification of antidepressant drugs (ADs) response biomarkers in depression is of high clinical importance. We explored CHL1 and ITGB3 expression as tentative response biomarkers. MATERIALS & METHODS: In vitro sensitivity to ADs, as well as gene expression and genetic variants of the candidate genes CHL1, ITGB3 and SLC6A4 were measured in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of 58 depressed patients. RESULTS: An association between the clinical remission of depression and the basal expression of CHL1 and ITGB3 was discovered. Individuals whose LCLs expressed higher levels of CHL1 or ITGB3 showed a significantly better remission upon AD treatment. In addition individuals with the CHL1 rs1516338 TT genotype showed a significantly better remission after 5 weeks AD treatment than those carrying a CC genotype. No association between the in vitro sensitivity of LCLs toward AD and the clinical remission could be detected. CONCLUSION: CHL1 expression in patient-derived LCLs correlated with the clinical outcome. Thus, it could be a valid biomarker to predict the success of an antidepressant therapy.

A survey of behavioral and psychological research concerning human response to emergencies identified several factors which can significantly interfere with successfully coping with an emergency driving situation. These factors include driver expectancies of normal traffic flow, emotional arousal when confronted with a sudden and real threat of serious injury, the uncertain behavior of other involved drivers and the uncertain outcome of attempting to perform avoidance maneuvers well beyond a typical driver's routine experience. Once it is determined that a driver was confronted with a sudden emergency demanding extraordinary response, the outcome of the accident is dictated more by the chance of the circumstances than by the performance abilities of the driver and his vehicle.",

A growing body of research suggests that genetic variants within immune-related genes can influence the risk of developing the disease and affect drug response. Materials and methods: To test this hypothesis, we carried out a comprehensive two-stage case\u2013control study in a White population of 1239 White RA patients and 1229 healthy controls to investigate whether 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms within or near 17 immune-related genes modulate the risk of developing RA and antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drug response. Results: Logistic regression analyses showed that carriers of the IL4rs2070874T and IL4rs2243250T and IL8RBrs1126580A alleles or the IL8RBrs2230054C/C genotype had a significantly increased risk of developing RA [odds ratio (OR)=1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13\u20131.67, P=0.0016; OR=1.24, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.49, P=0.020; OR=1.23, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.41, P=0.002 and OR=1.19, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.36, P=0.01, respectively]. The association of the IL4 variants was further supported by a meta-analysis including 7150 individuals (P =0.0010), whereas the involvement of the IL8RB locus in determining the susceptibility to RA was also supported by gene\u2013gene interaction analyses that identified significant two-locus and three-locus interaction models including IL8RB variants that act synergistically to increase the risk of the disease (P=0.014 and 0.018). Interestingly, we also found that patients harbouring the IFNGrs2069705C allele showed a significantly better response to anti-TNF drugs than those patients carrying the wild-type allele (P=0.0075). Conclusions: Our data suggest that IL4 and IL8RB loci may have a small-effect genetic impact on the risk of developing RA, whereas IFNG might be involved in modulating the response to anti-TNF drugs.",

In face of the recurrence of major emergencies both inside and outside the EU borders, EU governments agreed in 2001 to set up a system which would allow them to pool their resources. The Council Decision of 2001 created the Community Civil Protection Mechanism (CCPM) relying on the so-called Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), as the crisis centre for civil protection located in Brussels at the European Commission. In 2005, another major step was made regarding EU emergency management, with the creation ofresearch. I address the question of their creation, adoption and implementation, developing a sociological neo-institutionalist approach based on the concept of divergent isomorphism. Incorporating an agency aspect, I demonstrate thanks to the use of the process-tracing method that new EU organizational structures emerged in an institutional context of fight for legitimacy: On the one hand, EU officials relying on input-legitimacy based on the isomorphically copied model; On the other hand, national officials relying on output-legitimacy drawn from their actions during crises. Thus, I contribute to the development of both EU integration theory in the field of security and organizational theory in the field of emergency management.

These arrangements, which are legally dealt with by the Council, were developed to share information, ensure coordination and collective decision-making at EU level in an emergency. It is dealt with by the Joint Situation Centre (SitCen). These two new organizational structures of EU emergency management, the MIC and the SitCen, and the two new organizational architectures of EU emergency management (commission- and council- based) are the object of my",

        "title": "Antiplatelet Drug Response Status Does Not Predict Recurrent Ischemic Events in Stable Cardiovascular Patients: Results of the ADRIE Study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The biological response to antiplatelet drugs has repeatedly been shown to predict the recurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). However, most studies involved coronary artery disease patients with recent vessel injury, shortly after the initiation of antiplatelet therapy. Data on stable cardiovascular (CV) patients are scarce, and the added predictive value of specific assays (the VASP assay for the clopidogrel response and serum thromboxane B2 for the aspirin response) and aggregation-based assays relative to common predictors has rarely been addressed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Stable CV outpatients participating in the ADRIE study (n=771) were tested twice, at two separate visits, with specific and aggregation-based assays. Follow-up lasted 3 years, and fewer than 1% of patients were lost to follow-up. MACE were adjudicated by an independent committee. Multivariate survival analyses included relevant variables identified in univariate analysis and platelet function test results. The C-index was used to express the prognostic value of various multivariate models. MACE, the primary endpoint, occurred in 16% of patients. Hypertension, smoking, older age and elevated LDL cholesterol were predictive of MACE recurrence, with a c-index of 0.63 (P<0.001). Neither the specific nor the aggregation-based assays added significant predictive value for the primary endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Biological antiplatelet drug responsiveness, measured with specific or aggregation-based assays, has no incremental predictive value over common CV risk factors for MACE recurrence in stable CV outpatients. These results do not support platelet function testing for MACE risk evaluation in stable CV patients. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: clinicaltrials.gov; Identifier: NCT00501423.",

Obtaining these global properties directly from the data of biomechanical tests is a challenging task due to nonlinearities of tissue-test setup systems.

Because this error is difficult to quantify, survey researchers seek high rates of return to signal legitimacy and reduce questions regarding nonresponse bias. Research on survey method indicates that the design of the survey research process has a measurable influence on the rate of survey returns. This article focuses on three aspects of research design that are expected to influence mail survey returns in surveys of nonprofit organizations: questionnaire complexity, use of Federal Express versus standard mail, and the use of monetary incentives. Using an experimental design, the research concludes that questionnaire complexity and the use of monetary incentives generate no difference in returns, whereas the use of Federal Express to deliver the survey to nonprofit executives has a measurable positive effect.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate both the correlation between abnormal Doppler ultrasonography (US) hepatic vein waveforms and the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and the response to drug treatment in patients with cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethics committee approval and informed consent of patients and control subjects were obtained. In 78 patients with cirrhosis (70 men, eight women; mean age, 49.4 years 9.7 standard deviation) and a history of variceal bleeding, both the hepatic vein waveform-as measured with Doppler US-and the HVPG were measured, and the relationship between them was analyzed. Hepatic vein Doppler waveforms were classified as triphasic, biphasic, or monophasic. Severe portal hypertension was defined as an HVPG of more than 15 mm Hg. In a subgroup of 21 patients, changes in hepatic vein waveform and HVPG were evaluated after intravenous administration of 2 mg of terlipressin. Statistical analyses were performed with Spearman rank correlation, logistic regression analysis, and cross tabulation. RESULTS: Abnormal hepatic vein waveforms were seen in 72 patients (92%). Forty-four patients (56%) had biphasic waveforms, 28 (36%) had monophasic waveforms, and six (8%) had triphasic waveforms. A positive correlation was found between the extent of abnormalities in hepatic vein waveforms and the increase in HVPG (P < .05). Monophasic waveforms were associated with severe portal hypertension, with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 95%. Twenty patients in the terlipressin subgroup had abnormal baseline waveforms; the baseline waveform improved in 18 patients in association with the HVPG reduction after injection of terlipressin. CONCLUSION: Doppler US hepatic vein waveform assessment is useful in the noninvasive evaluation of the severity of portal hypertension and the response to vasoactive drugs in patients with portal hypertension and variceal bleeding.",

        "abstract": "Stimulant medication has, for many years, been the pharmacological treatment of choice for children and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recently, several studies have documented the efficacy of a new stimulant, Adderall. Although these initial studies provide useful information for clinicians treating ADHD children, their method of data presentation has provided limited information about the clinical significance of drug effects. Thus, to address the issue of clinical significance, we completed drug-placebo response curve analyses of a blinded, placebo-controlled study of Adderall and methylphenidate (MPH). Our results show that the efficacy of Adderall and MPH to improve functioning is seen throughout the full range of improvement scores. Both drugs prevent worsening and, for a majority of patients, lead to improvements that are well into the normal range. The analyses also highlight an important subgroup of placebo responders, which suggests that future research should focus on how to predict robust placebo response in ADHD patients.",

        "abstract": "Microenvironment around tumor cells plays an important role in its malignancy or invasiveness. Hyaluronan (HA), a major component of extracellular matrix is found to be elevated in most of cancerous niche/microenvironment and performs regulatory role in the progression of tumors and metastasis. Overexpression of the hyaladherin, hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1) in the hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2) termed as HepR21 leads to enhanced cell proliferation with increased HA 'pool' associated with HA 'cables' indicating elevated tumorous potential under 2D culture conditions. For invitro experimentation, scaffold based three dimensional niche modeling may have greater acceptance than conventional 2D culture condition. Thus, we have examined the influence of intrinsic properties of non-mulberry tropical tasar silk fibroin on the HepR21 cells in order to develop a 3D hepatocarcinoma construction to act as model. The scaffold of tasar silk fibroin of Antheraea mylitta when efficiently loaded with transformed hepatocarcinoma cells, HepR21; exhibits enhanced adhesiveness, viability, metabolic activity, proliferation and enlarged cellular morphology in 3D compared to its parent cell line HepG2, supporting the earlier observation made in 2D system. In addition, formation of multicellular aggregates, the indicator of tumor progression is also revealed in silk based 3D culture conditions. Further, the use of 4-MU (a hyaluronan synthase inhibitor) on HepR21 cells reduces the HA level and downregulates the expression of growth promoting factors like pAKT and PKC; while upregulating the expression of the tumor suppressor p53. Thus, 4-MU efficiently reduces the tumor potency associated with increased HA pool as well as HA cables and the effect of 4-MU doubling up as an anticancer agent in 2D and 3D are also comparable. The invitro 3D multicellular model demonstrates the insight of hepatocarcinoma progression and offers the predictability of cellular response to transfection efficacy, drug treatment and therapeutic intervention. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects nearly 3% of the World's population, causing severe liver disease in many. Standard of care therapy is currently pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin (PegIFN/R), which is effective in less than half of those infected with the most common viral genotype. Two IL28B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs8099917 and rs12979860, predict response to (PegIFN/R) therapy in treatment of HCV infection. These SNPs were identified in genome wide analyses using Illumina genotyping chips. In people of European ancestry, there are 6 common (more than 1%) haplotypes for IL28B, one tagged by the rs8099917 minor allele, four tagged by rs12979860.\\n\\nMETHODS: We used massively parallel sequencing of the IL28B and IL28A gene regions generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from pooled DNA samples from 100 responders and 99 non-responders to therapy, to identify common variants. Variants that had high odds ratios and were validated were then genotyped in a cohort of 905 responders and non-responders. Their predictive power was assessed, alone and in combination with HLA-C.\\n\\nRESULTS: Only SNPs in the IL28B linkage disequilibrium block predicted drug response. Eighteen SNPs were identified with evidence for association with drug response, and with a high degree of confidence in the sequence call. We found that two SNPs, rs4803221 (homozygote minor allele positive predictive value (PPV) of 77%) and rs7248668 (PPV 78%), predicted failure to respond better than the current best, rs8099917 (PPV 73%) and rs12979860 (PPV 68%) in this cross-sectional cohort. The best SNPs tagged a single common haplotype, haplotype 2. Genotypes predicted lack of response better than alleles. However, combination of IL28B haplotype 2 carrier status with the HLA-C C2C2 genotype, which has previously been reported to improve prediction in combination with IL28B, provides the highest PPV (80%). The haplotypes present alternative putative transcription factor binding and methylation sites.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Massively parallel sequencing allowed identification and comparison of the best common SNPs for identifying treatment failure in therapy for HCV. SNPs tagging a single haplotype have the highest PPV, especially in combination with HLA-C. The functional basis for the association may be due to altered regulation of the gene. These approaches have utility in improving diagnostic testing and identifying causal haplotypes or SNPs.",

        "abstract": "The progression toward gigahertz data rates in magnetic recording has introduced considerable challenges to soft magnetic materials design. The difficulties lie in satisfying two sets of conflicting demands: 1) simultaneously achieving soft magnetic properties, high saturation magnetization, and a high resistivity, with the latter required to limit eddy-current losses and 2) balancing the inherent tradeoff between bandwidth and permeability imposed by the direct and inverse dependences, respectively, of these two parameters on the anisotropy field. This paper describes a new soft magnetic composite system that meets these requirements: a metal/native-oxide multilayer (MNOM) film consisting of nanogranular high-moment Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>100-x</sub> layers separated by ultrathin magnetic native oxide layers. The high-resistivity magnetic oxide layers isolate the metallic layers electrically, while coupling them magnetically and minimizing the decrease in volume-averaged saturation magnetization that exists in traditional metal/nonmagnetic oxide composites. In addition, the \"exchange-averaged\" soft magnetic properties of the MNOM composite include an ideal low-dispersion in-plane uniaxial anisotropy whose magnitude varies linearly with the fraction x of Co in the alloy. The resulting anisotropy control, together with the large saturation magnetization, permits the permeability and resonance frequency to be tuned over a wide range to meet specific application requirements.",

This endeavour is beginning to yield a complete catalogue of the cancer genes that are critical for tumourigenesis and amongst which we will find tomorrow's biomarkers and drug targets. The second 'experiment' has been the use of large-scale biological models such as cancer cell lines to correlate mutations in cancer genes with drug sensitivity, such that one could begin to develop rationale clinical trials to begin to test these hypotheses.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Post hoc analyses of clinical trials have shown that early improvement around day 14 is highly predictive for later response. More-over, evidence has been given that sufficiently high concentrations of antidepressant drugs in blood are required to attain response. In this study, we determined cut-off levels for citalopram serum concentrations and clinical improvement during the early phase of treatment to predict later response and the predictive power of these measures either alone or in combination.\\n\\nMETHODS: Inpatients with depressive disorder according to ICD-10 who received citalopram were included. Psychopathology was assessed by the 17-item Hamilton Depression (HAMD-17) rating scale, and serum concentrations of citalopram were measured in weekly intervals.\\n\\nRESULTS: The analysis included 55 inpatients. Receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed for citalopram a serum concentration of 53\u2009ng/ml on day 7 and a clinical improvement of 24% on the HAMD-17 scale on day 14 as significant cut-off values to predict response after 5 weeks of treatment. Both measures taken together predicted response on week 5 with 73% sensitivity and 85% specificity with an odds ratio of 14.6.\\n\\nDISCUSSION: It is concluded that treatment with citalopram should be guided by symptom rating at baseline and on day 14 and serum concentration determination on day 7.",

        "abstract": "Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in regulating neuroinflammatory and demyelinative responses in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). miRNAs have also been studied as biomarkers of disease pathology and drug-response in MS. However, no complete miRNA profiling at various stages of EAE disease has been examined, especially in the urine. We carried out a systematic analysis of miRNAs in the urine exosomes as well as in the plasma and spinal cord at pre-onset, onset and peak stages of EAE established in the chronic B6 mice model. For the first time, we provide evidence that urine exosomes can be a specific and sensitive source of miRNA biomarkers for all 3 stages of EAE disease. In a significant observation, we observed that miR-155-5p expression increased in urine exosomes, plasma and spinal cord 6 days before the onset of disease, suggesting its early involvement in the pathology of EAE disease. We also analyzed the effect of Glatiramer acetate (GA; copaxone) treatment, an approved treatment for MS patients, in modulating miRNA expression at the peak of EAE disease. We identified miR-155-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-9-5p and miR-350-5p as putative GA-treatment responsive miRNA biomarkers. Since, EAE is a mainly CD4 cells mediated disease, we also examined the above set of miRNAs and found to be significantly altered in T cells polarized to Th1 and Th17 phenotype, similar to urine exosomes. Thus, urine exosome miRNAs hold the potential to be defined as novel accessible stage-specific biomarkers of EAE (MS) disease as well as treatment response.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Catecholamine neurotransmission plays an important role in major depression. Variation in genes implicated in the synthesis and signal transduction of catecholamines (norepinephrine and dopamine) may interact with environmental factors to affect the outcome of antidepressant treatment. We aimed to determine how a range of polymorphisms in noradrenergic and dopaminergic genes influence this response to treatment and how they interact with childhood trauma and recent life stress in a Chinese sample. METHODS: In a sample of 308 Chinese Han patients with major depressive disorder, 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding regions of six genes (MAOA, SLC6A2, TH, COMT, DRD2, DRD3) with minor allele frequencies >5% were successfully genotyped from an initial series of 35 SNPs in 11 candidate genes associated with catecholamine neurotransmission. The responses to 6 weeks' treatment with antidepressant drugs was determined by changes in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) score, and previous stressful events were evaluated by the Life Events Scale (LES) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF). Single SNP and haplotype associations with treatment response were analysed by UNPHASED 3.0.13, gene-gene interactions were analysed by generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) and gene-environment interactions by logistic regression. RESULTS: A haplotype in MAOA (rs1137070 and rs6323) was significantly associated with antidepressant response in the total group, the nonSSRI subgroup and the female subgroup. Two haplotypes in COMT (involving rs4633, rs4818 and rs769224) were significantly associated with antidepressant response in the nonSSRI subgroup. The SLC6A2 SNPs interacted with childhood trauma to influence antidepressant response. CONCLUSIONS: A haplotype in MAOA and two haplotypes in COMT are found to be associated with antidepressant treatment response in this sample. Stressors in early life may interact with polymorphisms in SLC6A2 to influence response to antidepressant treatment. Copyright 2011. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

The goal of this study is to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are able to tag HLA-B alleles in the Chinese Han population. Twelve HLA-B alleles that are associated with drug adverse responses and disease risks were identified. They were sequenced initially in 880 Chinese Han subjects where high-density SNPs within the HLA-B gene were available. Performances of these SNPs to tag the HLA-B alleles were assessed primarily by sensitivity and specificity. Two HLA-B alleles can be reliably tagged by SNPs at 100% sensitivity and >95% specificity. For example, HLA-B*15:02 can be tagged by the 'C' allele of rs10484555, and HLA-B*58:01 can be tagged by the 'T' allele of rs9262570. These results were confirmed in 500 additional Chinese Han subjects. If confirmed in independent studies, these tag SNPs could be used as a reliable, simple and cost-effective alternative for genotyping a subset of HLA-B alleles.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 10 March 2015; doi:10.1038/tpj.2015.7.",

        "abstract": "The polymorphic P450 (CYP) enzyme superfamily is the most important system involved in the biotransformation of many endogenous and exogenous substances including drugs, toxins, and carcinogens. Genotyping for CYP polymorphisms provides important genetic information that help to understand the effects of xenobiotics on human body. For drug metabolism, the most important polymorphisms are those of the genes coding for CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5, which can result in therapeutic failure or severe adverse reactions. Genes coding for CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, and CYP2E1 are among the most responsible for the biotransformation of chemicals, especially for the metabolic activation of pre-carcinogens. There is evidence of association between gene polymorphism and cancer susceptibility. Pathways of carcinogen metabolism are complex, and are mediated by activities of multiple genes, while single genes have a limited impact on cancer risk. Multigenic approach in addition to environmental determinants in large sample studies is crucial for a reliable evaluation of any moderate gene effect. This article brings a review of current knowledge on the relations between the polymorphisms of some CYPs and drug activity/toxicity and cancer risk.",

Some genetic loci have been associated with CHL, and modulation of lipid-lowering treatment by genetic polymorphisms has been reported. We have investigated whether common polymorphisms in the hepatic lipase gene (LIPC) influence the baseline lipid concentration and the response to atorvastatin or bezafibrate in patients with CHL. Methods Two genetic polymorphisms in LIPC (-514C-->T and +651A-->G) were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction analysis in 118 subjects of the ATOMIX (Atorvastatin in Mixed dyslipidemia) study who were randomized to treatment with either atorvastatin or bezafibrate and in 114 normolipidemic controls. Results The -514T allele frequency was higher in the ATOMIX group (0.297) than in the control group (0.193) (P =.01). The -514T allele carriers in the control group showed higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations than the -514C homozygotes, 50.8 +/- 1.86 versus 45.9 +/- 1.40 mg/dL (P =.02). The +651G carriers in the ATOMIX group showed lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than the +651A homozygotes, 274 +/- 3.72 and 181 +/- 3.50 mg/dL versus 289 +/- 4.0 and 194 +/- 3.76 mg/dL, respectively (P <.01). Homozygotes for the -514C allele on bezafibrate treatment had greater decrease in triglycerides and greater increase in HDL-C than -514T allele carriers after 12 months of bezafibrate treatment, -39.4% and +35.8% versus -25.5% and +20.4%, respectively (P =.080 and P =.007, respectively). Conclusions A higher frequency of. the -514T allele of LIPC suggests a role of this locus in the pathogenesis of CHL. The -514T allele is associated with higher HDL-C concentration in normolipidemic population. The -514C-->T polymorphism modulates the lipid-lowering response to bezafibrate, with a better effect in homozygous CC subjects.",

To sustain a therapeutic drug level in the retina, VEGF inhibitors have to be delivered frequently, every 4-8 weeks, causing inconvenience for the patients and expenses for the healthcare system. The aim of this study was to investigate cell encapsulation as a delivery system for prolonged anti-angiogenic treatment of retinal neovascularization. Genetically engineered ARPE-19 cells secreting soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (sVEGFR1) were encapsulated in a hydrogel of cross-linked collagen and interpenetrating hyaluronic acid (HA). The system was optimized in terms of matrix composition and cell density, and long-term cell viability and protein secretion measurements were performed. sVEGFR1 ARPE-19 cells in the optimized hydrogel remained viable and secreted sVEGFR1 at a constant rate for at least 50 days. Based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling, delivery of sVEGFR1 from this cell encapsulation system is expected to lead only to modest VEGF inhibition, but improvements of the protein structure and/or secretion rate should result in strong and prolonged therapeutic effect. In conclusion, the hydrogel matrix herein supported the survival and protein secretion from the encapsulated cells. The PK/PD simulation is a convenient approach to predict the efficiency of the cell encapsulation system before in vivo experiments.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study was to evaluate the efficacy of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in colorectal cancer together with other established regimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemosensitivities of 114 colorectal cancer patients to established regimens (fluorouracil (5-FU with leucovorin (FL), capecitabine, FL with irinotecan (FLIRI), and FL with oxaliplatin (FLOX)) as well as five hydroxamic acid derivatives (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, PXD101, and three novel candidates of CG-1, CG-2, and CG-3) were comparatively evaluated using the histoculture drug response assay. RESULTS: The chemosensitivity with established regimens was between 34.2% and 52.6%, when the cutoff value of the inhibition ratio was set at 30%, and between 54.5% and 84.1% with HDAC inhibitors. All HDAC inhibitors displayed synergistic effects in combination with established regimens of FLOX and FLIRI (P < or = 0.0001-0.002). Advanced T- and N-category tumors and patients with synchronous adenoma displayed higher chemosensitivity to CG-3, CG-2, and CG-1, respectively, on a multivariate analysis (P = 0.023, 0.044, and 0.045, respectively). Tumors with mismatch repair defects were closely correlated with chemosensitivities to combined regimens of PDX101 with FLOX and FLIRI (P = 0.044 and 0.048, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings firstly demonstrated the chemo-responsiveness of colorectal cancers to HDAC inhibitors with therapeutic efficacy comparable to the established regimens. Additionally, tumor growth and heredity were significantly associated with specific regimens, supporting their possible role as chemosensitive predictors.",

        "abstract": "Gaining insight into normal cellular signaling and disease biology is a critical goal of proteomic analyses. The ability to perform these studies successfully to extract the maximum value and discovery of biologically relevant candidate biomarkers is therefore of primary importance. Many successful studies in the past have focused on total proteome analysis (changes at the protein level) combined with phosphorylation analysis by metal affinity enrichment (changes at the PTM level). Here, we use the gastric carcinoma cell line MKN-45 treated with the c-Met inhibitor SU11274 and PKC inhibitor staurosporine to investigate the most efficient and most comprehensive strategies for both total protein and PTM analysis. Under the conditions used, total protein analysis yielded few changes in response to either compound, while analysis of phosphorylation identified thousands of sites that changed differentially between the two treatments. Both metal affinity and antibody-based enrichments were used to assess phosphopeptide changes, and the data generated by the two methods was largely complementary (non-overlapping). Label-free quantitation of peptide peak abundances was used to accurately determine fold-changes between control and treated samples. Protein interaction network analysis allowed the data to be placed in a biologically relevant context, and follow-up validation of selected findings confirmed the accuracy of the proteomic data. Together, this study provides a framework for start-to-finish proteomic analysis of any experimental system under investigation to maximize the value of the proteomic study and yield the best chance for uncovering actionable target candidates.",

        "abstract": "Background The extent to which a genomic test will be used in practice is affected by factors such as ability of the test to correctly predict response to treatment (i.e. sensitivity and specificity of the test), invasiveness of the testing procedure, test cost, and the probability and severity of side effects associated with treatment. Methods Using discrete choice experimentation (DCE), we elicited preferences of the public (Sample 1, N = 533 and Sample 2, N = 525) and cancer patients (Sample 3, N = 38) for different attributes of a hypothetical genomic test for guiding cancer treatment. Samples 1 and 3 considered the test/treatment in the context of an aggressive curable cancer (scenario A) while the scenario for sample 2 was based on a non-aggressive incurable cancer (scenario B). Results In aggressive curable cancer (scenario A), everything else being equal, the odds ratio (OR) of choosing a test with 95% sensitivity was 1.41 (versus a test with 50% sensitivity) and willingness to pay (WTP) was $1331, on average, for this amount of improvement in test sensitivity. In this scenario, the OR of choosing a test with 95% specificity was 1.24 times that of a test with 50% specificity (WTP = $827). In non-aggressive incurable cancer (scenario B), the OR of choosing a test with 95% sensitivity was 1.65 (WTP = $1344), and the OR of choosing a test with 95% specificity was 1.50 (WTP = $1080). Reducing severity of treatment side effects from severe to mild was associated with large ORs in both scenarios (OR = 2.10 and 2.24 in scenario A and B, respectively). In contrast, patients had a very large preference for 95% sensitivity of the test (OR = 5.23). Conclusion The type and prognosis of cancer affected preferences for genomically-guided treatment. In aggressive curable cancer, individuals emphasized more on the sensitivity rather than the specificity of the test. In contrast, for a non-aggressive incurable cancer, individuals put similar emphasis on sensitivity and specificity of the test. While the public expressed strong preference toward lowering severity of side effects, improving sensitivity of the test had by far the largest influence on patients' decision to use genomic testing.

        "abstract": "Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells prepared from transgenic mice overexpressing a cancer-specific and growth-related cell surface NADH oxidase with protein disulfide-thiol interchange activity grew at rates approximately twice those of wild-type embryonic fibroblast cells. Growth of transgenic MEF cells overexpressing tNOX was inhibited by low concentrations of the green tea catechin (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg) or the synthetic isoflavene phenoxodiol. Both are putative tNOX-targeted inhibitors with anti-cancer activity. With both EGCg and phenoxodiol, growth inhibition was followed after about 48 h by apoptosis. Growth of wild-type mouse fibroblast cells from the same strain was unaffected by EGCg and phenoxodiol and neither compound induced apoptosis even at concentrations 100-1,000-fold higher than those that resulted in apoptotic death in the transgenic MEF cells. The findings validate earlier reports of evidence for tNOX presence as contributing to unregulated growth of cancer cells as well as the previous identification of the tNOX protein as the molecular target for the anti-cancer activities attributed to both EGCg and phenoxodiol. The expression of tNOX emerges as both necessary and sufficient to account for the cancer cell-specific growth inhibitions by both EGCg and phenoxodiol.",

        "abstract": "Cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae, results in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, including Thailand. Representative V. cholerae strains associated with endemic cholera (n = 32), including strains (n = 3) from surface water sources, in Khon Kaen, Thailand (2003-2011), were subjected to microbiological, molecular and phylogenetic analyses. According to phenotypic and related genetic data, all tested V. cholerae strains belonged to serogroup O1, biotype El Tor (ET), Inaba (IN) or Ogawa (OG). All of the strains were sensitive to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, while multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains showing resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin were predominant in 2007. V. cholerae strains isolated before and after 2007 were non-MDR. All except six diarrhoeal strains possessed ctxA and ctxB genes and were toxigenic altered ET, confirmed by MAMA-PCR and DNA sequencing. Year-wise data revealed that V. cholerae INET strains isolated between 2003 and 2004, plus one strain isolated in 2007, lacked the RS1 sequence (rstC) and toxin-linked cryptic plasmid (TLC)-specific genetic marker, but possessed CTX(CL) prophage genes ctxB(CL) and rstR(CL). A sharp genetic transition was noted, namely the majority of V. cholerae strains in 2007 and all in 2010 and 2011 were not repressor genotype rstR(CL) but instead were rstR(ET), and all ctx(+) strains possessed RS1 and TLC-specific genetic markers. DNA sequencing data revealed that strains isolated since 2007 had a mutation in the tcpA gene at amino acid position 64 (N\u2192S). Four clonal types, mostly of environmental origin, including subtypes, reflected genetic diversity, while distinct signatures were observed for clonally related, altered ET from Thailand, Vietnam and Bangladesh, confirmed by distinct subclustering patterns observed in the PFGE (NotI)-based dendrogram, suggesting that endemic cholera is caused by V. cholerae indigenous to Khon Kaen.",

This study was to evaluate the chemosensitivity of colorectal cancer tissues to therapeutic agents using histoculture drug response assay (HDRA), and explore the correlation of chemosensitivity to the expression levels of multidrug resistance (MDR) genes and proteins. METHODS: Twenty-two specimens of colorectal cancer were collected. The inhibition rates of single agents, including epirubicin, cisplatin (DDP), oxaliplatin, 5-FU, taxetere, irinotecan, and combinations of these agents, including 5-FU+epirubicin+DDP, 5-FU+irinotecan, 5-FU+oxaliplatin, 5-FU+taxetere+ DDP on colorectal cancer tissues were evaluated by HDRA. The agent whose inhibition rate was greater than 30% was considered sensitive, and the sensitivity was calculated. mRNA and protein levels of MDR genes and proteins in colorectal cancer tissues were measured by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Among the single agents, the inhibition rate of oxaliplatin (17.5%) and sensitivity of cancer tissues to 5-FU (36.4%) were the highest. In the combination groups of agents, the inhibition rate of 5-FU+ oxaliplatin (54.1%), and sensitivity of cancer tissues to 5-FU+epirubicin+DDP (71.4%) and to 5-FU+taxetere+DDP (71.4%) were the highest. The inhibition rates of and sensitivity of cancer tissues to combined agents were higher than those of single agents (P<0.05). Expressions of MDR1, multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP1), ABC-binding cassette transporter superfamily-G-2 (ABCG2) mRNA were detected in 88.9%, 55.6% and 55.6% of specimens respectively; while those of MDR1, MRP1 and ABCG2 proteins were detected in 55.6%, 33.3%, and 50.0% of specimens respectively. Expressions of mRNA and proteins had no correlation in MDR1, MRP1 and ABCG2 (P>0.05). High expression of ABCG2 protein was correlated to the resistance of colorectal cancer cells to epirubicin (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Expressions of MDR proteins are correlated to chemosensitivity of colorectal cancer to some extents. By combining HDRA with measurement of MDR genes and proteins, chemosensitivity of individual tumors may be predicted to guide selection of effective chemotherapeutic agents.",

The CBF transcription factors were the first transcriptional activators demonstrated to have a role in controlling the expression of cold-responsive genes with a role in cold acclimation. Here, we review what is known about the CBF cold-response pathway, including several recent developments, and we discuss emerging evidence in support of several additional transcription factors having roles in freezing tolerance pathways.",

        "abstract": "The ability to mount a successful response to threats is critical for an organism's survival. A key element of the stress response is its nonspecificity toward the stress source, with similar endocrine and behavioral changes expected under a variety of stressors. In this project we utilized an experimental design that accounts for multiple sources of variation to further understand the nature of stress responsivity and its relationship to the early rearing environment. A sample of baboons (n=73) was observed during the early phase of life in their social group, and then tested as juveniles in a challenging situation. Maternal cortisol levels were measured during the peripartum period. The challenging situation (individuals were isolated for a few minutes in a single cage) was designed to be a moderate source of psychological stress. Patterns in individual differences during the stress test were \"mapped\" by means of multidimensional scaling (MDS). After the observation was made, the subject was sedated and a blood sample was taken to measure cortisol levels. Our results indicate that when juvenile baboons are confronted with a source of psychological stress, they show a multidimensional behavioral response, probably mediated by the activation and synergic interaction among different neurohormonal systems that, ultimately, act on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Different components of the multidimensional, or nonspecific, behavioral response are associated with the quality and quantity of interactions with their mothers during early life. Juveniles whose mothers displayed higher levels of positive interaction were characterized by vigilant but less active reactions to the stress test, whereas juveniles of mothers that displayed high levels of stress-related behaviors had higher cortisol and locomotion levels.",

Thus, occupant restraint with a side airbag is critical and it is necessary to develop tools that can be utilized to help in design of side airbags. Though many papers on side impact safety have been published, only a few papers are related to MADYMO simulations of side airbags.This paper describes an improved injury prediction and optimization approach using a MADYMO model for side impact. This model consists of 3 parts: dummy, trim and airbag in FEM. In this study, a side impact with an ES-2, EuroSID-2, was simulated in MADYMO as follows:First, component tests were conducted for trim and airbag respectively to establish correlation. Second, these component models were then integrated into a MADYMO model, which has high correlation with a crash simulator that is capable of replicating physical vehicle tests. Key points were replication of chest deflections and sensitivity responses. Door intrusion and airbag vent hole size were main parameters used to evaluate the sensitivity. As a result, it was demonstrated that this model has a reasonable response and good correlation.The side airbag was optimized, from the robustness point of view, using an optimization Genetic Algorithm and Quality Engineering for the Euro NCAP mode. Then, results from those two approaches were compared.",

This enhancement is thought to depend on the difficulty of the task being performed, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms for this dependency remain largely unknown. We found that task difficulty modulates neuronal firing rate at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing (area V1) in monkey (Macaca mulatta). These modulations were spatially specific: increasing task difficulty enhanced V1 neuronal firing rate at the focus of attention and suppressed it in regions surrounding the focus. Moreover, we found that response enhancement and suppression are mediated by distinct populations of neurons that differ in direction selectivity, spike width, interspike-interval distribution and contrast sensitivity. Our results provide strong support for center-surround models of spatial attention and suggest that task difficulty modulates the activity of specific populations of neurons in the primary visual cortex.",

We show that mass sensitivity of the device in this region may exceed the upper bound imposed by thermomechanical noise upon the sensitivity when operating in the linear region.

However, the presence and physiological importance of this exquisite modulation in excitable tissues are unknown. Here, we employed minimally-invasive cell-attached patch-clamping, single-cell qPCR and specific siRNAs to unambiguously demonstrate that fast-inactivating Kv3.4 channels underlie a robust high voltage-activated A-type K+ current (I(AHV)) in nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons from 7-d old rats. We also show that PKC activation with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) causes a 4-fold slowing of Kv3.4 channel inactivation and, consequently, accelerates the repolarization of the action potential (AP) by 22%, which shortens the AP duration by 14%. G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists eliminate II(AHV) fast inactivation in a membrane-delimited manner, suggesting a Kv3.4 channel signaling complex. Preincubation of the neurons with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide II inhibits the effect of GPCR agonists and PDBu. Furthermore, activation of PKC via GPCR agonists recapitulates the effects of PDBu on the AP. Finally, transfection of the neurons with Kv3.4 siRNA prolongs the AP by 25% and abolishes the GPCR agonist-induced acceleration of the AP repolarization. These results show that Kv3.4 channels help shape the repolarization of the nociceptor AP, and that modulation of Kv3.4 channel N-type inactivation by PKC regulates AP repolarization and duration. We propose that the dramatic modulation of I(AHV) fast inactivation by PKC represents a novel mechanism of neural plasticity with potentially significant implications in the transition from acute to chronic pain.",

        "abstract": "We analyze the influence of errors on the implementation of the quantum Fourier transformation (QFT) on the Ising quantum computer (IQC). Two kinds of errors are studied: (i) due to spurious transitions caused by pulses and (ii) due to external perturbation. The scaling of errors with system parameters and number of qubits is explained. We use two different procedures to fight each of them. To suppress spurious transitions we use correcting pulses (generalized $2\\pi k$ method) while to suppress errors due to external perturbation we use an improved QFT algorithm. As a result, the fidelity of quantum computation is increased by several orders of magnitude and is thus stable in a much wider range of physical parameters.",

        "abstract": "An open question remains whether Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) really contain intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We carefully investigated the XMM-Newton EPIC spectra of the four ULXs that were claimed to be strong candidates of IMBHs by several authors. We first tried fitting by the standard spectral model of disk blackbody (DBB) + power-law (PL), finding good fits to all of the data, in agreement with others. We, however, found that the PL component dominates the DBB component at sim 0.3 to 10 keV. Thus, the black hole parameters derived solely from the minor DBB component are questionable. Next, we tried to fit the same data by the ``p-free disk model'' without the PL component, assuming the effective temperature profile of Trm eff propto r^-p where r is the disk radius. Interestingly, in spite of one less free model parameters, we obtained similarly good fits with much higher innermost disk temperatures, $1.8 < kTrm in < 3.2 keV. More importantly, we obtained p sim 0.5, just the value predicted by the slim (super-critical) disk theory, rather than p = 0.75 that is expected from the standard disk model. The estimated black hole masses from the p-free disk model are much smaller; Mltsim 40 Modot. Furthermore, we applied a more sophisticated slim disk model by Kawaguchi (2003, ApJ, 593,69), and obtained good fits with roughly consistent black hole masses. We thus conclude that the central engines of these ULXs are super-critical accretion flows to stellar-mass black holes.",

To improve patient outcomes, conventional anticancer therapies have to be replaced with specific approaches targeting CSCs. In this review we provide strong support that BMP4 is an innovative therapeutic approach to prevent colon cancer growth increasing differentiation markers expression and apoptosis. Recent data suggest that in colorectal CSCs, protection from apoptosis is achieved by interleukin-4 \\r\\n(IL-4) autocrine production through upregulation of antiapoptotic mediators, including survivin. Consequently, IL-4 neutralization could deregulate survivin expression and localization inducing chemosensitivity of the colon CSCs pool.",

Here we report that angiogenesis inhibitors targeting the VEGF pathway demonstrate antitumor effects in mouse models of pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma and glioblastoma but concomitantly elicit tumor adaptation and progression to stages of greater malignancy, with heightened invasiveness and in some cases increased lymphatic and distant metastasis. Increased invasiveness is also seen by genetic ablation of the Vegf-A gene in both models, substantiating the results of the pharmacological inhibitors. The realization that potent angiogenesis inhibition can alter the natural history of tumors by increasing invasion and metastasis warrants clinical investigation, as the prospect has important implications for the development of enduring antiangiogenic therapies.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent tutoring systems help students acquire cognitive skills by tracing students knowledge and providing relevant feedback. However, feedback that focuses only on the cognitive level might not be optimal - errors are often the result of inappropriate metacognitive decisions. We have developed two models which detect aspects of student faulty metacognitive behavior: A prescriptive rational model aimed at improving help-seeking behavior, and a descriptive machine-learned model aimed at eliminating attempts to game the tutor. In a comparison between the two models we found that while both successfully identify gaming behavior, one is better at characterizing the types of problems students game in, and the other captures a larger variety of faulty behaviors. An analysis of students' actions in two different tutors suggests that the help-seeking model is domain independent, and that students behavior is fairly consistent across classrooms, age groups, domains, and task elements.",

        "abstract": "The article describes the considerations and the results of the investigation on short-term voltage stability carried out on a large wind power network model that is similar to a part of the Danish power grid. In the investigated power network, around 50% of the electricity consumption is covered by wind turbines and local combined heat and power (CHP) units. A distinction is made between local wind turbines that may trip and those in a large wind farm subject to the Grid Specifications of the transmission system operator (TSO) that must ride through the grid faults. When a short-circuit fault occurs in the transmission network, the main concerns are: (i) a risk of uncontrollable voltage sags that may result in voltage instability, (ii) a risk of significant power loss due to tripping of local units and possibly (iii) a risk of over-voltage at the periphery of the transmission network. Significant presence of induction generator based wind turbines is the main reason of a risk of voltage instability manifesting itself by temporarily uncontrollable voltage decay in a part of the power grid and being caused by significant reactive power absorption of the induction generators. However, voltage instability does not necessarily develop to voltage collapse, because local wind turbines will trip at abnormal grid operation, for example, at registering excessive under-voltage. This \u2018eliminates\u2019 the problem of reactive power absorption in the power grid and leads to the voltage reestablishment. However, protective disconnection introduces the new issues such as (i) establishing power reserves and (ii) protecting the periphery of the transmission network from excessive over-voltage. q 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike EMG sensors, MMG sensors can be reliably placed distally over the patient's stump, by embedding them into the silicon socket. Our experiments focused on maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of silicon-embedded microphones for MMG. Optimal dimensions were obtained for the cylindrical air chamber enclosed within the embedding capsule (13mm diameter, 2mm height). Furthermore, shores 20A and 65A were identified as the optimal silicon hardness values for the embedding case and driving membrane, respectively. Embedded microphones provided, on average, a 6dB SNR enhancement over previously reported embedded accelerometers.",

        "abstract": "Biodiversity refers to the complex, interconnected community of living organisms in an ecosystem. The importance of preserving and promoting biodiversity has been recognized at the national, provincial and municipal level. Green roofs offer great potential to enhance the biodiversity of urban areas such as Toronto. In recent years, the City of Toronto has instituted a number of policies and initiatives to encourage the implementation of green roofs across the municipality. In 2009, Toronto became the first City in North America to adopt a bylaw to require and govern the construction of green roofs. Green roofs can be classified as either extensive or intensive, depending on the depth of substrate used and the level of maintenance required. It has been recognized that the design of both the substrate and vegetation layers of an installation can be focused to promote habitat creation. Variation in substrate topography and composition, as well as the addition of other materials such as logs and branches can create niche spaces for organisms. Vegetation diversity and structural complexity also contributes to the formation of microhabitats. Research in Europe and America has reported that a diverse abundance of bird and insect species can be supported on green roofs. Local studies have demonstrated similar findings, although the composition of species found on green roofs varies depending on geographic and climatic factors. Emerging biodiversity research from Toronto suggests that green roofs provide similar habitat potential to comparable ground-level urban habitats. This report suggests that green roofs can be used to connect fragmented habitats when installed in aggregation especially if located near fragmented ground-level habitats. Where technically feasible, green roofs should be designed to protect sensitive biological communities and avoid aggressive species. By designing green roof scapes that include important habitat forming and forage species into planting designs Toronto will encourage the proliferation of biodiversity across urban green roofs. In addition to strengthening existing green corridors, green roofs represent an opportunity to create new green space in areas that are otherwise unsuitable for natural restoration. Green roof habitats face several challenges that must be addressed in the creation of a biodiversity strategy for the City. The harsh, dry, and windy conditions present on a roof may support different community assemblages than those present on the ground and may alter the autecology of species that use green roof habitats. Invasive species also pose a threat to green roof communities both in the short and long term. These factors may be exacerbated by climate change and point to the value of ongoing green roof research and observation to further resolve and understand these challenges and opportunities for biodiversity planning on green roofs.",

The document explains how Passenger Focus, the rail watchdog, has undergone a successful corporate transformation from the previous federal network of regional committees into a new credible consumer body. The organisation has a new vision, and robust business planning processes have been introduced. However, there is a need to improve performance management through a new performance appraisal system. The overall purpose of the research is to assess the gaps between expectations and experiences in order to inform a new system. The literature review explains the background to the development of performance and its measurement in the public sector. It includes a detailed analysis of thinking on performance appraisal. The literature review concludes that performance appraisal can greatly benefit organisations, but appears to not be delivering in many cases. A conceptual model is developed to frame the empirical research. The research takes the form of a case study, and the findings are collated through qualitative interviews. A focus group was conducted, which framed the issues of concern, and these were explored in much more detail through semi-structured interviews. The findings revealed that there was a high level of understanding from staff of the need for performance appraisal. The largest gap between expectations and experiences lay in the current system, with respondents particularly concerned about the lack of training and over-simplistic documentation. Non-measurement of competencies was also a concern. Respondents were generally positive about recent experiences of appraisal. The findings suggest that motivated managers have made the system work for them, despite concerns about process, and respondents believe fairness is generally achieved. More attention is required to appraise team effort. There was little appetite for a system that links appraisal to financial reward. The conclusions of the research have informed the main recommendation, to develop a new system that is much more comprehensive, and incorporates training and guidelines. That new system should be developed through engagement with staff.",

While it is clear that surgery (if possible), and radiotherapy are beneficial for treatment, the role of chemotherapy for these tumors is still unclear. Therefore, we performed an in vitro drug screen on primary glioma cells, including three DIPG cultures, to determine drug sensitivity of these tumours, without the possible confounding effect of insufficient drug delivery. This screen revealed a high in vitro cytotoxicity for melphalan, doxorubicine, mitoxantrone, and BCNU, and for the novel, targeted agents vandetanib and bortezomib in pHGG and DIPG cells. We subsequently determined the expression of the drug efflux transporters P-gp, BCRP1, and MRP1 in glioma cultures and their corresponding tumor tissues. Results indicate the presence of P-gp, MRP1 and BCRP1 in the tumor vasculature, and expression of MRP1 in the glioma cells themselves. Our results show that pediatric glioma and DIPG tumors per se are not resistant to chemotherapy. Treatment failure observed in clinical trials, may rather be contributed to the presence of drug efflux transporters that constitute a first line of drug resistance located at the blood-brain barrier or other resistance mechanism. As such, we suggest that alternative ways of drug delivery may offer new possibilities for the treatment of pediatric high-grade glioma patients, and DIPG in particular.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could quantify a difference in clitoral response following administration of a vasoactive medication, in 12 women with female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD). Subjects were entered into a double-blind, randomized two-way crossover study of sildenafil 50 mg vs placebo administered 1 h prior to genital MRI. Each subject underwent two MR studies, performed while subjects viewed alternating segments of nonerotic and erotic video. MR images were analyzed for change in clitoral volume during each session. The mean change in clitoral volume for the entire group was higher in the sildenafil MRI session (1282 mm(3)) compared with placebo (849 mm(3)) but did not reach statistical significance (P=0.064). Comparison using analysis of variance between the two sessions for each individual subject revealed a significant increase in clitoral volume following sildenafil compared with placebo in 6 of 12 subjects, no significant change in either imaging session in three subjects and in three subjects, there was a robust clitoral response in both MR sessions. In conclusion, MR measurements of clitoral volume can provide an objective measure of engorgement change following a vasoactive medication in women with FSAD.",

        "abstract": "Developing proteomic biomarkers is valuable for evaluating therapeutic effects of drugs and generating better treatment strategies. However, conventional protein analysis is often challenging due to inadequate sample size of clinical specimens, lack of assay reproducibility, accuracy, and sensitivity. A novel capillary isoelectricfocusing (IEF) immunoassay system (NanoPro) was used to study the dynamic phosphorylation status of signaling molecules in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase and MEK inhibitors. NanoPro showed the same dynamic ERK phosphorylation as Western blotting with good assay reproducibility using 1,000 times less protein. The IEF separation in NanoPro system enables multiple protein phosphorylation isoforms to be resolved and detected simultaneously. With NanoPro, we identified a specific on-target mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) response pattern to MEK inhibitor PD325901, which was not detectable by Western blot analysis. We also revealed a MEK2 signal that may be associated with NSCLC cell sensitivity to the EGF receptor inhibitor erlotinib, and distinguished erlotinib-sensitive cells from intrinsic as well as acquired resistant cells to erlotinib. Moreover, NanoPro could differentiate human ERK1 isoforms from the mouse isoforms based on their isoelectric point differences and showed that erlotinib effectively inhibited ERK phosphorylation in targeted human xenograft cancer cells but not in surrounding mouse stromal cells. With 8 mu g of tumor aspirates, we precisely quantified the response of 18 signaling molecules to erlotinib and MEK1 inhibitor treatments in an NSCLC patient. NanoPro's higher sensitivity, better resolution of protein phosphorylation status, and reduced tissue requirement warrant NanoPro's investigation for future drug development and evaluation of drug effects of targeted therapies.

This paper argues that there is no such clear relation and that the dose-response curve provides only limited information about the drug effect. It is demonstrated that tolerance development during the measurement of the dose-response curve may cause major distortion of the curve and it is argued that the curve may only be used to indicate the response to the first administration of a drug, before tolerance has developed. The precise effect of a drug on an individual depends on the dynamic relation between several variables, particularly the level of tolerance, the dose anticipated by the organism and the actual drug dose. Simulations with a previously published mathematical model of drug tolerance demonstrate that the effect of a dose smaller than the dose the organism has developed tolerance to is difficult to predict and may be opposite to the action of the usual dose.",

Integration of large-scale molecular and pharmacological data from cancer cell lines promises to be effective in the discovery of new genetic markers of drug sensitivity and of clinically relevant anticancer compounds. To define novel pharmacogenomic dependencies in cancer, we created the Mutations and Drugs Portal (MDP, http://mdp.unimore.it), a web accessible database that combines the cell-based NCI60 screening of more than 50,000 compounds with genomic data extracted from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and the NCI60 DTP projects. MDP can be queried for drugs active in cancer cell lines carrying mutations in specific cancer genes or for genetic markers associated to sensitivity or resistance to a given compound. As proof of performance, we interrogated MDP to identify both known and novel pharmacogenomics associations and unveiled an unpredicted combination of two FDA-approved compounds, namely statins and Dasatinib, as an effective strategy to potently inhibit YAP/TAZ in cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "Warfarin exhibits significant interindividual variability in dosing requirements. Different drug responses are partly attributed to the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence either drug action or drug metabolism. Rapid genotyping of these SNPs helps clinicians to choose appropriate initial doses to quickly achieve anticoagulation effects and to prevent complications. We report a novel application of surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) in the rapid genotyping of SNPs that impact warfarin efficacy. The SNPs were first amplified by PCR and then underwent single base extension to generate the specific SNP product. Next, genetic variants displaying different masses were bound to Q10 anionic proteinChips and then genotyped by using SELDI-TOF MS in a multiplex fashion. SELDI-TOF MS offered unique properties of on-chip sample enrichment and clean-ups, which streamlined the testing procedures and eliminated many tedious experimental steps required by the conventional MS-based method. The turn-around time for genotyping three known warfarin-related SNPs, CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and VKORC1 3673G>A by SELDI-TOF MS was less than 5 hours. The analytical accuracy of this method was confirmed both by bidirectional DNA sequencing and by comparing the genotype results (n = 189) obtained by SELDI-TOF MS to reports from a clinical reference laboratory. This new multiplex genotyping method provides an excellent clinical laboratory platform to promote personalized medicine in warfarin therapy.",

A Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) based modeling framework was designed and implemented, using a special splitting strategy and canonical pathways to capture robust information for model building. Erlotinib and Sorafenib predictive models could be used to identify a sub-group of patients that respond better to the corresponding treatment, and these models are specific to the corresponding drugs. The model derived signature genes reflect each drug's known mechanism of action. Also, the models predict each drug's potential cancer indications consistent with clinical trial results from a selection of globally normalized GEO expression datasets.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of swollen to tender joint count ratio (STR) and other baseline characteristics on treatment response to a first course of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. METHODS: Patients with RA initiating their first course of anti-TNF treatment were included in a structured clinical followup protocol. Based on pragmatic thresholds and plausibility, patients were categorized as having low (STR <0.5), moderate (0.5 </= STR </= 1.0), or high (STR >1.0) joint count ratios. The data were collected and followed during the period of March 1999 through December 2010. RESULTS: A total of 2,507 patients were included in the study (median age 56 years, 78% women). Of these patients, 344 (14%) had a low STR, 1,180 (47%) had a moderate STR, and 983 (39%) had a high STR. According to these STR thresholds, 23% of patients (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 18-29%) with low, 39% (95% CI 35-43%) with moderate, and 40% (95% CI 36-44%) with high STR achieved the American College of Rheumatology criteria for 50% improvement (ACR50) response at 6 months after initiation. Correlation tests showed that STR was associated with ACR50 response independent of both swollen and tender joint counts. Logistic regression analysis consistently showed that moderate STR, high STR, not using prednisolone, high baseline Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, and low baseline Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were significantly associated with favorable ACR50 response with odds ratios of 1.93 (P < 0.01), 2.82 (P < 0.01), 0.65 (P < 0.01), 1.49 (P < 0.01), and 0.47 (P < 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: STR is a new and feasible predictor of treatment response in RA. RA patients with a moderate to high STR have a 2- to 3-fold increased likelihood of responding according to ACR50 criteria",

The development of non-invasive markers of responsiveness to thiopurines represents a major attempt in the clinical management of CD patients. Azathioprine is able to induce apoptosis of T cells. We studied the effect of thiopurines on \"in vitro\" T cell apoptosis, IFN-gamma and IL-10 production in a group of CD patients with known response to a previous treatment with AZA. METHODS: Heparinized blood samples were drawn from 25 CD patients showing or not a previous responsiveness to a conventional azathioprine treatment (n=17 and n=8, respectively). CD4+ T cells were stimulated \"in vitro\" with aCD3/28 mAbs in the presence or absence of azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine or 6-thioguanine. Apoptosis was assessed using Annexin V staining, and IFN-gamma and IL-10 production in cell culture supernatants was evaluated by ELISA. RESULTS: Apoptosis stimulation index (% of apoptotic cells in the presence of thiopurine/% of apoptotic cells in the absence of thiopurine) and IFN-gamma stimulation index (IFN-gamma production in the presence of thiopurine/IFN-gamma production in the absence of thiopurine) were, respectively, significantly lower and higher in non-responder when compared to responder patients. No variation was observed in IL-10 production. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of apoptosis and IFN-gamma stimulation index of peripheral CD4+ T cell may be useful for a proper selection of CD patients candidate to thiopurine treatment.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Two rat strains were selectively bred to be prone (Fast) or resistant (Slow) to amygdala kindling. The first objective of this experiment was to determine whether that selection was specific to kindling or was sensitive more broadly to another seizure induction agent, kainic acid (KA). Second, we investigated whether these strains exhibit distinct molecular responses to KA with respect to GABA(A) receptor subunit expression. METHODS: Development of status epilepticus (SE) was profiled in Fast and Slow rats injected with 20 mg/kg KA (i.p.). Two hours post-SE onset, rats received a sedative dose of sodium pentobarbital. Behavioral profiles included latency to SE, number of wet dog shakes (WDS), and number and duration of stage 3-5 generalized seizures. Rats were killed 24 h post-SE, and alpha(1) and alpha(4) mRNA levels were compared in the hippocampus and amygdala using QPCR. RESULTS: Slow rats exhibited a much greater latency to SE onset (p < 0.01) and many more WDS (p < 0.01) than Fast rats. During SE, Fast rats spent more time in and exhibited more repeated bouts of generalized stage 3-5 seizures (p < 0.01) than Slow rats. Constitutive levels of alpha1 and alpha4 were not different between the strains in either structure and equivalent reductions in alpha4 were evident 24 h post-SE. However, while Fast rats showed KA-induced reductions in alpha1 in both structures, Slow rats showed significant elevations. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic selection for temporal lobe excitability, manifested as differential amygdala kindling rates, is paralleled by vulnerability to KA-induced SE. Further, these strains exhibited at least one opposing molecular response to SE, namely alpha1 expression. This finding may offer a putative mechanism through which seemingly similar epilepsies can be intractable in some patients but treatable in others.",

        "abstract": "Background: Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum lengthens parasite clearance half-life during artemisinin monotherapy or artemisinin-based combination therapy. Absence of in-vitro and ex-vivo correlates of artemisinin resistance hinders study of this phenotype. We aimed to assess whether an in-vitro ring-stage survival assay (RSA) can identify culture-adapted P falciparum isolates from patients with slow-clearing or fast-clearing infections, to investigate the stage-dependent susceptibility of parasites to dihydroartemisinin in the in-vitro RSA, and to assess whether an ex-vivo RSA can identify artemisinin-resistant P falciparum infections. Methods: We culture-adapted parasites from patients with long and short parasite clearance half-lives from a study done in Pursat, Cambodia, in 2010 (registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00341003) and used novel in-vitro survival assays to explore the stage-dependent susceptibility of slow-clearing and fast-clearing parasites to dihydroartemisinin. In 2012, we implemented the RSA in prospective parasite clearance studies in Pursat, Preah Vihear, and Ratanakiri, Cambodia (NCT01736319), to measure the ex-vivo responses of parasites from patients with malaria. Continuous variables were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations were analysed with the Spearman correlation test. Findings: In-vitro survival rates of culture-adapted parasites from 13 slow-clearing and 13 fast-clearing infections differed significantly when assays were done on 0-3 h ring-stage parasites (10\u00b788% vs 0\u00b723%; p=0\u00b7007). Ex-vivo survival rates significantly correlated with in-vivo parasite clearance half-lives (n=30, r=0\u00b774, 95% CI 0\u00b750-0\u00b787; p<0\u00b70001). Interpretation: The in-vitro RSA of 0-3 h ring-stage parasites provides a platform for the molecular characterisation of artemisinin resistance. The ex-vivo RSA can be easily implemented where surveillance for artemisinin resistance is needed.

Understanding the contribution of these markers beyond readily available clinical biomarkers is particularly important in pharmacogenetics. We demonstrate the utility of genetic testing using the example of warfarin in a multi-ethnic setting comprising of three Asian populations that are broadly representative of the genetic diversity for half of the population in the world, especially as distinct interethnic differences in warfarin dose requirements have been previously established. We confirmed the roles of three well-established loci (CYP2C9, VKORC1 and CYP4F2) in explaining warfarin dosage variation in the three Asian populations. In addition, we assessed the relationship between ethnicity and the genotypes of these loci, observing strong correlations at VKORC1 and CYP4F2. Subsequently, we established the additional utility of these genetic factors in predicting warfarin dose beyond ethnicity and clinical biomarkers through performing a series of systematic cross-validation analyses of the relative predictive accuracies of various fixed-dose regimen, clinical and genetic models. Through a pharmacogenetics model for warfarin, we show the importance of genetic testing beyond readily available clinical biomarkers in predicting dose requirements, confirming the role of genetic profiling in personalized medicine.",

The cell-induced regeneration of tissues and organs is achieved by making use of the tissue engineering technology or methodology. Several genetic approaches with virus and non-viral vectors or genetically engineered cells have been attempted to enhance tissue regeneration. The basic idea is to promote the cell proliferation and differentiation as well as the secretion of biological signal molecules for tissue regeneration from cells by gene transfection. For successful gene transfection and expression, it is important to develop drug delivery system (DDS) which allows a therapeutic gene to be delivered specifically to the target cell at an appropriate timing for a certain time period. This paper overviews the recent development of gene-modified tissue engineering, briefly explaining delivery technologies necessary to modulate the efficiency of gene transfection.

        "title": "Guidance for industry: patient-reported outcome measures: use in medical product development to support labeling claims: draft guidance.",
        "abstract": "This guidance describes how the FDA evaluates patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments used as effectiveness endpoints in clinical trials. It also describes our current thinking on how sponsors can develop and use study results measured by PRO instruments to support claims in approved product labeling (see appendix point 1). It does not address the use of PRO instruments for purposes beyond evaluation of claims made about a drug or medical product in its labeling. By explicitly addressing the review issues identified in this guidance, sponsors can increase the efficiency of their endpoint discussions with the FDA during the product development process, streamline the FDA's review of PRO endpoint adequacy, and provide optimal information about the patient's perspective of treatment benefit at the time of product approval. A PRO is a measurement of any aspect of a patient's health status that comes directly from the patient (i.e., without the interpretation of the patient's responses by a physician or anyone else). In clinical trials, a PRO instrument can be used to measure the impact of an intervention on one or more aspects of patients' health status, hereafter referred to as PRO concepts, ranging from the purely symptomatic (response of a headache) to more complex concepts (e.g., ability to carry out activities of daily living), to extremely complex concepts such as quality of life, which is widely understood to be a multidomain concept with physical, psychological, and social components. Data generated by a PRO instrument can provide evidence of a treatment benefit from the patient perspective. For this data to be meaningful, however, there should be evidence that the PRO instrument effectively measures the particular concept that is studied. Generally, findings measured by PRO instruments may be used to support claims in approved product labeling if the claims are derived from adequate and well-controlled investigations that use PRO instruments that reliably and validly measure the specific concepts at issue. The glossary defines many of the terms used in this guidance. In particular, the term instrument refers to the actual questions or items contained in a questionnaire or interview schedule along with all the additional information and documentation that supports the use of these items in producing a PRO measure (e.g., interviewer training and instructions, scoring and interpretation manual). The term conceptual framework refers to how items are grouped according to subconcepts or domains (e.g., the item walking without help may be grouped with another item, walking with difficulty, within the domain of ambulation, and ambulation may be further grouped into the concept of physical ability). FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended but not required.

        "abstract": "There has been remarkable progress during the past decade in understanding of how genetic variations in drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters contribute to observed variation in drug responsiveness. Among drug transporters, the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) class of transporters have proven to be remarkably important to the cellular uptake disposition of a variety of clinically important drugs, particularly in organs such as the intestine and liver; we now know that altered OATP activity may confer reduced efficacy and potentially increased risk of drug-related toxicity. OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are widely recognized liver-specific members of the family known to modulate the hepatocellular uptake of drugs from the portal vein and thereby modulate systemic exposure and hepatic substrate drug extraction. On the other hand, OATP2B1 and OATP1A2 are expressed on the apical membrane of intestinal enterocytes and though to affect absorption of its drug substrates. Accordingly, genetic variations in these OATP transporters have clinically relevant functional consequences for drug absorption, distribution and excretion, as well as pharmacodynamics response in terms of drug efficacy and toxicity. This article addresses the present evidence of relevance to genetic variations in OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, and OATP1A2 in terms of drug response, efficacy and optimal therapeutics.",

The antibiotic was absorbed by plants and can be found in plant tissue. The plant response was organ-dependent: roots, cotyledons and cotyledon petioles, were always affected by a toxic effect, whilst internodes and leaves length, showed a variable dose-depending response, with an increased growth at the lower drug concentrations and toxic effects at the higher ones. This variable response was probably dependant on different levels of local contamination resulting from a balance between accumulation rate and drug dilution in the increasing plant biomass. As a consequence, drug toxicity or hormetic response varied according to concentration and were different in each of the examined plant organ/tissue. Thus, even if hormesis can be considered a general plant response, each plant organ/tissue responds differently, depending on the local drug concentration and exposure time.",

Second, characteristics of early and late respondents were compared. RESULTS: People with lowest income and less than high-school education and those who never married were under-represented in the CAS compared with the Census, but similar to the CCHS. Substance use was more prevalent in the CAS than the CCHS sample, but most of the CAS and CCHS estimates did not exceed +/-3% points. Late respondents were also significantly more likely to be male, young adult, highly educated, used, have high income, live in different provinces and report substance use. Multivariate logistic regression found significant non-response bias for lifetime, past 12 months, chronic risky, acute risky and heavy monthly alcohol use, lifetime and past year cannabis use, lifetime hallucinogen use, any illicit drug uses of lifetime and past year.

        "abstract": "Thienopyridine antiaggregating platelet agents (clopidogrel and prasugrel) act as irreversible P2Y12 receptor inhibitors. They are used with aspirin to prevent thrombotic complications after an acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention. A large interindividual variability in response to clopidogrel and to a lesser extent to prasugrel is observed and may be related to their metabolism. Clopidogrel and prasugrel are indeed prodrugs converted into their respective active metabolites by several cytochromes P450 (CYPs). Besides clopidogrel inactivation (85%) by esterases to the carboxylic acid, clopidogrel is metabolized by CYPs to 2-oxo-clopidogrel (15%) and further metabolized to an unstable but potent platelet-aggregating inhibitor. Prasugrel is more potent than clopidogrel with a better bioavailability and lower pharmacodynamic variability. Prasugrel is completely converted by esterases to an intermediate oxo-metabolite (R-95913) further bioactivated by CYPs. Numerous clinical studies have shown the influence of CYP2C19 polymorphism on clopidogrel antiplatelet activity. Moreover, unwanted drug-drug pharmacokinetic interactions influencing CYP2C19 activity and clopidogrel bioactivation such as with proton pump inhibitors remain a matter of intense controversy. Several studies have also demonstrated that CYP3A4/5 and CYP1A2 are important in clopidogrel bioactivation and should also be considered as potential targets for unwanted drug-drug interactions. Prasugrel bioactivation is mainly related to CYP3A4 and 2B6 activity and therefore the question of the effect of drug-drug interaction on its activity is open. The purpose of this review is to critically examine the current literature evaluating the influence of genetic and environmental factors such as unwanted drug-drug interaction affecting clopidogrel and prasugrel antiplatelet activity.",

Such features lower quality of life for both patients and carers, and often result in transfer to residential care and higher costs. Currently, no drugs are licensed in the UK specifically for behavioural changes and psychological symptoms in patients with dementia. Nevertheless, antipsychotic medications have been used in people with dementia, both for psychotic symptoms and also for less specific problems such as agitation and aggression. There have been long-standing concerns about the inappropriate use of these drugs in such settings. In 2004, following worries over an increased likelihood of stroke with risperidone and olanzapine, the former UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) advised that these drugs \"should not be used for the treatment of behavioural symptoms of dementia\". However, this led to reports of unsuitable interpretation of the guidance, with groups of patients having their medication withdrawn inappropriately or being switched to other, potentially more harmful, drugs. Here we assess the safety of antipsychotic medication in people with dementia.;",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Numerous effective oral pharmacologic therapies are available to treat type 2 diabetes. However, a substantial number of patients do not achieve the expected glucose-lowering response, or may be predisposed to adverse effects, from these agents. The application of pharmacogenetics to the field of type 2 diabetes is one step towards the goal of improved pharmacotherapeutic management of this progressive disease. METHODS: A PubMed literature search was conducted to identify clinical studies that have examined the extent to which drug-transporter gene polymorphisms influence interindividual variability in oral antidiabetic drug disposition and response in humans. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Available data suggest that drug transporters play an important role in the disposition of some oral antidiabetic drugs in the body, particularly the meglitinides and metformin. Moreover, polymorphisms in genes encoding drug transport proteins may alter the pharmacodynamic profile of these agents. Drug transporters, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and drug targets each play a distinct and important role in the disposition and action of many oral antidiabetic agents. Thus, future studies may need to take a pharmacogenomic (i.e., multiple gene) approach in order to comprehensively understand the extent to which genetic variation contributes to interindividual differences in oral antidiabetic drug clinical pharmacology.",

        "abstract": "Prior work has provided incremental phases to a microdosimetry modeling program to describe the dose response behavior of the radio-protective adaptive response effect. We have here consolidated these prior works (Leonard 2000, 2005, 2007a, 2007b, 2007c) to provide a composite, comprehensive Microdose Model that is also herein modified to include the bystander effect. The nomenclature for the model is also standardized for the benefit of the experimental cellular radio-biologist. It extends the prior work to explicitly encompass separately the analysis of experimental data that is 1.) only dose dependent and reflecting only adaptive response radio-protection, 2.) both dose and dose-rate dependent data and reflecting only adaptive response radio-protection for spontaneous and challenge dose damage, 3.) only dose dependent data and reflecting both bystander deleterious damage and adaptive response radio-protection (AR-BE model). The Appendix cites the various applications of the model. Here we have used the Microdose Model to analyze the, much more human risk significant, Elmore et al (2006) data for the dose and dose rate influence on the adaptive response radio-protective behavior of HeLa x Skin cells for naturally occurring, spontaneous chromosome damage from a Brachytherapy type 125I photon radiation source. We have also applied the AR-BE Microdose Model to the Chromosome inversion data of Hooker et al (2004) reflecting both low LET bystander and adaptive response effects. The micro-beam facility data of Miller et al (1999), Nagasawa and Little (1999) and Zhou et al (2003) is also examined. For the Zhou et al (2003) data, we use the AR-BE model to estimate the threshold for adaptive response reduction of the bystander effect. The mammogram and diagnostic X-ray induction of AR and protective BE are observed. We show that bystander damage is reduced in the similar manner as spontaneous and challenge dose damage as shown by the Azzam et al (1996) data. We cite primary unresolved questions regarding adaptive response behavior and bystander behavior. The five features of major significance provided by the Microdose Model so far are 1.) Single Specific Energy Hits initiate Adaptive Response, 2.) Mammogram and diagnostic X-rays induce a protective Bystander Effect as well as Adaptive Response radio-protection. 3.) For mammogram X-rays the Adaptive Response protection is retained at high primer dose levels. 4.) The dose range of the AR protection depends on the value of the Specific Energy per Hit, <z 1>. 5.) Alpha particle induced deleterious Bystander damage is modulated by low LET radiation.",

        "abstract": "Many diseases, including cancers, heart diseases, and lung diseases, can usefully be viewed as arising from disruption of feedback control systems that normally maintain homeostasis of tissues and cell populations. Excessive exposure can destabilize feedback control loops, leading to sustained elevation of variables to saturated levels and clinical consequences such as chronic unresolved inflammation, destruction of tissue (as in emphysema), proliferation of cell populations (as in lung cancer), and increases in reactive oxygen species and protease levels (as in coronary heart diseases and chronic obstructive lung disease). We propose a framework for understanding how exposure can destabilize normally homeostatic feedback control systems and create sustained imbalances and elevated levels of disease-related variables, by creating a new, locally stable, alternative equilibrium for the dynamic system, in addition to its normal (homeostatic) equilibrium. The resulting model, which we call alternative-equilibria (AE) theory, implies the existence of an exposure threshold below which transition to the alternative equilibrium (potential disease) state will not occur. Once this threshold is exceeded, progression to the alternative equilibrium continues spontaneously, even without further exposure. These predictions may help to explain patterns observed in experimental and epidemiological data for diseases such as COPD, silicosis, and inflammation-mediated lung cancer.",

Additionally, there is noticeable variation in the litter responses within dose groups that should be taken into account when modeling. Finally, the dose-response pattern in these studies exhibits a threshold effect. The threshold dose-response model is the default model for non-carcinogenic risk assessment, according to the USEPA, and is encouraged by the agency for the use in the risk assessment process. Two statistical models are proposed to estimate dose-response pattern of data from the developmental toxicity study: the threshold model and the spline model.

        "title": "Detecting causal nonlinear exposure-response relations in epidemiological data",
        "abstract": "The possibility of hormesis in individual dose-response relations undermines traditional epidemiological criteria and tests for causal relations between exposure and response variables. Non-monotonic exposure-response relations in a large population may lack aggregate consistency, strength, biological gradient, and other hallmarks of traditional causal relations. For example, a u-shaped or n-shaped curve may exhibit zero correlation between dose and response. Thus, possible hormesis requires new ways to detect potentially causal exposure-response relations. This paper introduces information-theoretic criteria for identifying potential causality in epidemiological data that may contain nonmonotonic or threshold dose-response nonlinearities. Roughly, exposure variable X is a potential cause of response variable Y if and only if: (a) X is INFORMATIVE about Y (i.e., the mutual information between X and Y, I(X; Y), measured in bits, is positive. This provides the required generalization of statistical association measures for monotonic relations); (b) UNCONFOUNDED: X provides information about Y that cannot be removed by conditioning on other variables. (c) PREDICTIVE: Past values of X are informative about future values of Y, even after conditioning on past values of Y; (d) CAUSAL ORDERING: Y is conditionally independent of the parents of X, given X. These criteria yield practical algorithms for detecting potential causation in cohort, case-control, and time series data sets. We illustrate them by identifying potential causes of campylobacteriosis, a foodborne bacterial infectious diarrheal illness, in a recent case-control data set. In contrast to previous analyses, our information-theoretic approach identifies a hitherto unnoticed, highly statistically significant, hormetic (U-shaped) relation between recent fast food consumption and women's risk of campylobacteriosis. We also discuss the application of the new information-theoretic criteria in resolving ambiguities and apparent contradictions due to confounding and information redundancy or overlap among variables in epidemiological data sets.",

However, animals treated with progressively increasing doses of METH over several weeks are protected against the toxic effects of the drug. In the present study, we tested the possibility that this pattern of METH injections might be associated with transcriptional changes in the rat striatum, an area of the brain which is known to be very sensitive to METH toxicity and which is protected by METH preconditioning. We found that the presence and absence of preconditioning followed by injection of large doses of METH caused differential expression in different sets of striatal genes. Quantitative PCR confirmed METH-induced changes in some genes of interest. These include small heat shock 27 kD proteins 1 and 2 (HspB1 and HspB2), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox-1). Our observations are consistent with previous studies which have reported that ischemic or pharmacological preconditioning can cause reprogramming of gene expression after lethal ischemic insults. These studies add to the growing literature on the effects of preconditioning on the brain transcriptome.",

A biphasic dose response has been frequently observed where low levels of light have a much better effect on stimulating and repairing tissues than higher levels of light. The so-called Arndt-Schulz curve is frequently used to describe this biphasic dose response.

One of the major challenges of systems biology today is to devise generally applicable methods of interpreting this data in a way that will shed light on the complex relationships between multiple genes and their products. The importance of such information is clear, not only as an aid to areas of research like drug design, but also as a contribution to our understanding of the mechanisms behind an organism's ability to react to its environment. RESULTS: We detail one computational approach for using gene expression data to identify response networks in an organism. The method is based on the construction of biological networks given different sets of interaction information and the reduction of the said networks to important response sub-networks via the integration of the gene expression data. As an application, the expression data of known stress responders and DNA repair genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is used to construct a generic stress response sub-network. This is compared to similar networks constructed from data obtained from subjecting M.tuberculosis to various drugs; we are thus able to distinguish between generic stress response and specific drug response. We anticipate that this approach will be able to accelerate target identification and drug development for tuberculosis in the future.

Most of the literature has described systems wherein added or over expressed SOD produced beneficial effects, yet in some circumstances SOD provided no benefit, or was clearly detrimental, exacerbating cell injury or death. When broad dose-response studies were finally possible in models of reperfusion injury in the isolated heart, hormesis became clear. We propose that the mechanisms underlying the hormesis are related to the paradoxical abilities of the superoxide radical to serve as both an initiator and a terminator of the free radical-mediated chain reaction that results in lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is a universal feature of oxidative stress, causing loss of cellular structure and function. Under any given conditions, the optimal concentration of SOD is that which decreases chain initiation without elimination of the chain termination properties of the radical, resulting in a minimum of net lipid peroxidation. Mathematical modeling of this hypothesis yields predictions fully consistent with observed laboratory data.",

        "abstract": "There is an increasing interest on self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) for oral delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. However, development of SNEDDS is often driven by empiric, pseudo-ternary diagrams and solubility of drugs, and it is lacking a systematic approach for evaluating impact of excipients on the performance of formulations as well as the fate of drug. The aim of this study was to rationalize the SNEDDS development procedure and to get a better understanding on the role of excipients on the SNEDDS. The formulations consist of soybean oil or rapeseed oil, Cremophor(\u00ae) RH40, Maisine\u2122 35-1 and ethanol. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used in the development of SNEDDS. Significant advantages of RSM were found in reducing the work load and determining the impact of excipients on formulation characteristics. The most significant factor in influencing droplet size was the co-surfactant Maisine\u2122 35-1, the droplet size increased with increasing concentration of Maisine\u2122 35-1. It suggests that Maisine\u2122 35-1 has double functions in the SNEDDS; it functions as co-surfactant to improve the emulsification of oil, meanwhile it also works as the oil phase and results in larger droplets. A significant reduction in droplet size was interestingly observed when fenofibrate was loaded in the vehicles, probably due to the surface activity of fenofibrate, promoting the self-emulsifying process. It was evident that drug precipitation during lipolysis was not affected by the level of co-solvent ethanol in the formulation, while it had pronounced impact on drug solubilization during the initial dispersion stage.",

        "abstract": "A re-interpretation of the 'dose-response' curve is given that accommodates homeostasis. The outcome, or overall effect, of toxicity is the consequence of toxicity that is moderated by homeodynamic responses. Equilibrium is achieved by a balance of opposing forces of toxic inhibition countered by a stimulatory response. A graphical model is given consisting of two linked curves (response vs concentration and effect vs concentration), which provide the basis for a re-interpretation of the 'dose-response' curve. The model indicates that such relationships are non-linear with a threshold, which is due to homeodynamic responses. Subthreshold concentrations in 'dose-response' curves provide the sum of toxic inhibition minus the homeodynamic response; the response itself is unseen in serving its purpose of neutralizing perturbation. This interpretation suggests why the alpha- and beta-curves are non-linear. The beta-curve indicates adaptive overcorrection to toxicity that confers greater resistance to subsequent toxic exposure, with hormesis as an epiphenomenon.",

        "abstract": "This paper reviews our current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the induction of bystander effects by low dose, low-LET ionizing radiation and discusses how they may be related to observed adaptive responses or other protective effects of low dose exposures. Bystander effects appear to be the result of a generalized stress response in tissues or cells. The signals may be produced by all exposed cells, but the response appears to require a quorum in order to be expressed. The major response involving low LET radiation exposure discussed in the existing literature is a death response. This has many characteristics of apoptosis but is p53 independent. While a death response might appear to be adverse, the position is argued in this paper that it is in fact protective and removes damaged cells from the population. Since many cell populations carry damaged cells without being exposed to radiation, so called \"background damage\", it is possible that low doses exposures cause removal of cells damaged by agents other than the test dose of radiation. This mechanism would lead to the production of \"U-shaped\" dose response curves. In this scenario, the level of \"adaptive\" or beneficial response will be related to the background damage carried by the cell population. This model may be important when attempting to predict the consequences of mixed exposures involving radiation and other environmental stressors.",

Our specific context is that of epidemiologic studies of exposure-outcome associations and we focus on threshold and J-effect dose response relationships.

        "abstract": "For much of the past century, scientists studying drug abuse labored in the shadows of powerful myths and misconceptions about the nature of addiction. When scientists began to study addictive behavior in the 1930s, people addicted to drugs were thought to be morally flawed and lacking in willpower. Those views shaped society\u2019s responses to drug abuse, treating it as a moral failing rather than a health problem, which led to an emphasis on punishment rather than prevention and treatment. Today, thanks to science, our views and our responses to addiction and other substance use disorders have changed dramatically. Groundbreaking discoveries about the brain have revolutionized our understanding of compulsive drug use, enabling us to respond effectively to the problem. As a result of scientific research, we know that addiction is a disease that affects both the brain and behavior. We have identified many of the biological and environmental factors and are beginning to search for the genetic variations that contribute to the development and progression of the disease. Scientists use this knowledge to develop effective prevention and treatment approaches that reduce the toll drug abuse takes on individuals, families, and communities. Despite these advances, many people today do not understand why people become addicted to drugs or how drugs change the brain to foster compulsive drug use. This booklet aims to fill that knowledge gap by providing scientific information about the disease of drug addiction, including the many harmful consequences of drug abuse and the basic approaches that have been developed to prevent and treat substance use disorders. At the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), we believe that increased understanding of the basics of addiction will empower people to make informed choices in their own lives, adopt science-based policies and programs that reduce drug abuse and addiction in their communities, and support scientific research that improves the Nation\u2019s well-being.",

A drug that proves to be pharmacologically effective in some patients at a given dose may be ineffective or even toxic in others. The interindividual variability in drug response represents a major challenge in drug therapy, particularly for drugs with narrow therapeutic index. The intensity and duration of a drug action are determined not only by pharmacokinetic processes, but also by pharmacodynamic processes. Therefore, the variability in drug response is a result of the variability in either pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic processes, or a combination of both. The purpose of this paper is to review the sources that contribute to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability. Although the main focus will be on the genetic variability, the impact of environmental factors on drug response will also be discussed.

In the present review, we have explored the complex effects of stress on cognition and propose that they are characterized by linear and non-linear dose-response functions, which together reveal a hormetic relationship between stress and learning. We suggest that stress initially enhances hippocampal function, resulting from amygdala-induced excitation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, as well as the excitatory effects of several neuromodulators, including corticosteroids, norepinephrine, corticotropin-releasing hormone, acetylcholine and dopamine. We propose that this rapid activation of the amygdala-hippocampus brain memory system results in a linear dose-response relation between emotional strength and memory formation. More prolonged stress, however, leads to an inhibition of hippocampal function, which can be attributed to compensatory cellular responses that protect hippocampal neurons from excitotoxicity. This inhibition of hippocampal functioning in response to prolonged stress is potentially relevant to the well-described curvilinear dose-response relationship between arousal and memory. Our emphasis on the temporal features of stress-brain interactions addresses how stress can activate, as well as impair, hippocampal functioning to produce a hormetic relationship between stress and learning.",

This default denies any positive benefit from any level of exposure. However, experimental observations and theoretical biology have found that both linear and J-shaped IR dose-response curves can exist at those very low doses. We develop low dose J-shaped dose-response, based on systems biology, and thus justify its use regarding exposure to IR. This approach incorporates detailed, molecular and cellular descriptions of biological/toxicological mechanisms to develop a dose-response model through a set of nonlinear, differential equations describing the signaling pathways and biochemical mechanisms of cell cycle checkpoint, apoptosis, and tumor incidence due to IR. This approach yields a J-shaped dose response curve while showing where LNT behaviors are likely to occur. The results confirm the hypothesis of the J-shaped dose response curve: the main reason is that, at low-doses of IR, cells stimulate protective systems through a longer cell arrest time per unit of IR dose. We suggest that the policy implications of this approach are an increasingly correct way to deal with precautionary measures in public health.",

It has been shown that GA can produce superoxide anions and increase the intracellular oxidative stress, which, in addition to the direct inhibition of Hsp90, might also contribute to the modifying effects of the inhibitor on the early response in human mononuclear cells exposed to ionizing radiation. The present study shows that GA antagonizes the radiation-induced suppression on MnSOD and catalase, key enzymes of the radical scavenging systems. By significantly up-regulating catalase levels over the entire range of doses from 0.5 to 4 Gy, the inhibitor of Hsp90 exerted adaptive protection and modified the early radiation response of the human blood cells.",

In this work, the ability of sub-inhibitory concentrations of Tetracycline to induce hormetic response in a model organism was investigated. To this aim a reference strain of Escherichia coli, MG1655, was exposed to six decreasing doses of Tetracycline (between 0.12 and 0.00375 \u03bcg/ml), much lower than the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (4 \u03bcg/ml). An hormetic increase was observed at the intermediate concentrations (0.015-0.03 \u03bcg/ml) of the tested range. The Colony Forming Unit number, indeed, rose up to 141% and 121% as compared to the control. At the highest (0.12 \u03bcg/ml) and lowest (0.00375 \u03bcg/ml) concentrations a slight decrease in CFU number was found. Results demonstrated that, in Escherichia coli, low concentrations of Tetracycline bias the bacterial numerical increase through a hormetic response; the dose-response curve describing this numerical increase is an U-inverted curve. Furthermore, these data confirm that hormesis is common to many - if not all - living systems, including bacteria; they underline the relevance of a deepened knowledge of both the effects and the possible consequences of exposure to low doses of contaminants.",

Previous approaches have leveraged advanced statistical and mathematical techniques to implement nonlinear least squares (NLS) for obtaining the parameters defining such a curve. These approaches, while mathematically rigorous, suffer from initial value sensitivity, computational intensity, and rely on complex and intricate computational and numerical techniques. However if there is a known mathematical model that can reliably predict the data, then nonlinear regression may be equally viewed as parameter optimization. In this context, one may utilize proven techniques from machine learning, such as evolutionary algorithms, which are robust, powerful, and require far less computational framework to optimize the defining parameters.

In this study we measured the ability sub-MIC concentrations of eight other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and six non-\u03b2-lactam antibiotics to induce LAC biofilm. All eight \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, but none of the non-\u03b2-lactam antibiotics, induced LAC biofilm. The dose-response effects of the eight \u03b2-lactam antibiotics on LAC biofilm varied from biphasic and bimodal to near-linear. We also found that sub-MIC methicillin induced biofilm in 33 out of 39 additional MRSA clinical isolates, which also exhibited biphasic, bimodal and linear dose-response curves. The amount of biofilm formation induced by sub-MIC methicillin was inversely proportional to the susceptibility of each strain to methicillin. Our results demonstrate that induction of biofilm by sub-MIC antibiotics is a common phenotype among MRSA clinical strains and is specific for \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.

We report the effect of differing Trp53 gene status on the dose response of ionizing radiation exposures (0.01-2 Gy), with the unique perspective of determining if effects of gene status remain at extended time points. Here we report no difference in the dose response for radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks in bone marrow and genomic instability (MN-RET levels) in peripheral blood, between wild-type (Trp53+/+) and heterozygous (Trp53+/-) mice. The dose response for Trp53+/+ mice showed higher initial levels of radiation-induced lymphocyte apoptosis relative to Trp53+/- between 0 and 1 Gy. Although this trend was observed up to 12 hours post-irradiation, both genotypes ultimately reached the same level of apoptosis at 14 hours, suggesting the importance of late-onset p53-independent apoptotic responses in this mouse model. Expected radiation-induced G1 cell cycle delay was observed in Trp53+/+ but not Trp53+/-.

(2001a) and found that the shape of the cellular response to alphas is relatively independent of cell species and LET of the alphas. The same alpha particle traversal dose response behavior should be true for human lung tissue exposure to radon progeny alpha particles. In the Bystander Damage Region of the alpha particle response, there is a variation of RBE from about 10 to 35. There is a transition region between the Bystander Damage Region and Direct Damage Region of between one and two microdose alpha particle traversals indicating that perhaps two alpha particle \"hits\" are necessary to produce the direct damage. Extrapolation of underground miners lung cancer risks to human risks at domestic and workplace levels may not be valid.",

        "abstract": "Both the linear (at low doses)-no-threshold (LNT) and the threshold models (S-shapes) dose-response lead to no benefit from low exposure. We propose three new models that allow and include, but do not require - unlike LNT and S-shaped models \u2014 this strong assumption. We also provide the means to calculate benefits associated with bi-phasic biological behaviors, when they occur and propose: 1. Three hormetic (phasic) models: the J-shaped, inverse J-shaped, the min-max, and 2. Method for calculating the direct benefits associated with the J and inverse J-shaped models. The J-shaped and min-max models for mutagens and carcinogenic agents include an experimentally justified repair stage for toxic and carcinogenic damage. We link these to stochastic transition models for cancer and show how abrupt transitions in cancer hazard rates, as functions of exposure concentrations and durations, can emerge naturally in large cell populations even when the rates of cell-level events increase smoothly (e.g., proportionally) with concentration. In this very general family of models, J-shaped dose-response curves emerge. These results are universal, i.e., independent of specific biological details represented by the stochastic transition networks. Thus, using them suggests a more complete and realistic way to assess risks at low doses or dose-rates.",

        "abstract": "Many so-called \"alternative medicine\" techniques such as Reiki and acupuncture produce very good outcomes for intractable pain and other chronic illnesses but the efficacy is often dismissed as being psychosomatic. However a plausible mechanism does exist i.e. that the treatments alter the electromagnetic fields in living organisms and thereby prevent or reduce activity of neurons which lead to the pain. Low doses of ionising radiation have similar effects on electromagnetic fields and are known to induce signaling cascades in tissues due to ion gradients. To test this hypothesis cell cultures were exposed to Reiki - like and to acupuncture - like treatments, both performed by qualified practitioners. The cells were exposed either before or after the treatment to x-rays and were monitored for production of direct damage or bystander signals. The data suggest that the alternative techniques altered the response of cells to direct irradiation and altered bystander signal mechanisms. We conclude that alternative medicine techniques involving electromagnetic perturbations may modify the response of cells to ionizing radiation. In addition to the obvious implications for mechanistic studies of low dose effects, this could provide a novel target to exploit in radiation protection and in optimizing therapeutic gain during radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Humans are continuously exposed to low-level ionizing radiation from natural sources. However, harsher radiation environments persisted during our planet's early years and mammals survived via an evolutionary gift--a system of radiation-induced natural protective measures (adaptive protection). This system includes antioxidants, DNA repair, apoptosis of severely damaged cells, epigenetically regulated apoptosis (epiapoptosis) pathways that selectively remove precancerous and other aberrant cells, and immunity against cancer. We propose a novel model in which the protective system is regulated at least in part via radiation-stress-stimulated epigenetic reprogramming (epireprogramming) of adaptive-response genes. High-dose radiation can promote epigenetically silencing of adaptive-response genes (episilencing), for example via promoter-associated DNA and/or histone methylation and/or histone deacetylation. Evidence is provided for low linear-energy-transfer (LET) radiation-activated natural protection (ANP) against high-LET alpha-radiation-induced lung cancer in plutonium-239 exposed rats and radon-progeny-exposed humans. Using a revised hormetic relative risk model for cancer induction that accounts for both epigenetic activation (epiactivation) and episilencing of genes, we demonstrate that, on average, >80% of alpha-radiation-induced rat lung cancers were prevented by chronic, low-rate gamma-ray ANP. Interestingly, lifetime exposure to residential radon at the Environmental Protection Agency's action level of 4 pCi L(-1) appears to be associated with on average a > 60% reduction in lung cancer cases, rather than an increase.

        "abstract": "Chronic exposure of mammals to low dose-rates of ionizing radiation affects proliferating cell systems as a function of both dose-rate and the total dose accumulated. The lower the dose-rate the higher needs to be the total dose for a deterministic effect, i.e., tissue reaction to appear. Stem cells provide for proliferating, maturing and functional cells. Stem cells usually are particularly radiosensitive and damage to them may propagate to cause failure of functional cells. The paper revisits 1) medical histories with emphasis on the hemopoietic system of the victims of ten accidental chronic radiation exposures, 2) published hematological findings of long-term chronically gamma-irradiated rodents, and 3) such findings in dogs chronically exposed in large life-span studies. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that hemopoietic stem and early progenitor cells have the capacity to tolerate and adapt to being repetitively hit by energy deposition events. The data are compatible with the \"injured stem cell hypothesis\", stating that radiation-injured stem cells, depending on dose-rate, may continue to deliver clones of functional cells that maintain homeostasis of hemopoiesis throughout life. Further studies perhaps on separated hemopoietic stem cells may unravel the molecular-biology mechanisms causing radiation tolerance and adaptation.",

        "abstract": "The multicellular signaling model (MULTISIG1) was recently introduced to simulate the kinetics of repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that were induced in confluent (non-dividing) cultured cells by a very low radiation dose where at most a single induced DSB would be expected in a given cell nucleus. The repair kinetics was modeled as representing what is now called an epigenetically-regulated (epiregulated) cell-community-wide (epicellcom) response to radiation stress. DSB repair initiation is assumed to require a threshold number of cells with DSBs participating in intercellular stress-response signaling. The MULTISIG1 model is extended in this study to apply to moderate doses where several DSBs can occur on the same DNA molecule. The repair of multiple breaks on the same molecule is treated as sequential stochastic events. For cells of differing genetic characteristics and epigenetic statuses, relationships are provided for evaluating the relative susceptibility (RS) for DSB induction, relative repair capacity (RRC) for DSB repair, and relative epiapoptosis capacity (REC), for epigenetically regulated apoptosis. The modified MULTISIG1 model is used to characterize the expected repair kinetics for confluent, human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 line) briefly exposed in vitro to 90-kV x-rays. Possible application of the model to biological dosimetry is also discussed.",

        "abstract": "The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a three-tiered phosphorylation cascade that is ubiquitously expressed among eukaryotic cells. Its primary function is to propagate signals from cell surface receptors to various cytosolic and nuclear targets. Recent studies have demonstrated that the MAPK cascade exhibits an all-or-none response to graded stimuli. This study quantitatively investigates MAPK activation in Xenopus oocytes using both empirical and biologically-based mechanistic models. Empirical models can represent overall tissue MAPK activation in the oocytes. However, these models lack description of key biological processes and therefore give no insight into whether the cellular response occurs in a graded or all-or-none fashion. To examine the propagation of cellular MAPK all-or-none activation to overall tissue response, mechanistic models in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations are employed. An adequate description of the dose response relationship of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocytes is achieved. Furthermore, application of these mechanistic models revealed that the initial receptor-ligand binding rate contributes to the cells' ability to exhibit an all-or-none MAPK activation response, while downstream activation parameters contribute more to the magnitude of activation. These mechanistic models enable us to identify key biological events which quantitatively impact the shape of the dose response curve, especially at low environmentally relevant doses.",

        "abstract": "Why do low-level exposures to environmental toxins often elicit over-compensating responses that reduce risk to an organism? Conversely, if these responses improve health, why wait for an environmental challenge to trigger them? This paper presents a mathematical modeling framework that addresses both questions using the principle that evolution favors tissues that hedge their bets against uncertain environmental challenges. We consider a tissue composed of differentiated cells performing essential functions (e.g., lung tissue, bone marrow, etc.). The tissue seeks to maintain adequate supplies of these cells, but many of them may occasionally be killed relatively quickly by cytotoxic challenges. The tissue can \"order replacements\" (e.g., via cytokine network signaling) from a deeper compartment of proliferative stem cells, but there is a delivery lag because these cells must undergo maturation, amplification via successive divisions, and terminal differentiation before they can replace the killed functional cells. Therefore, a \"rational\" tissue maintains an inventory of relatively mature cells (e.g., the bone marrow reserve for blood cells) for quick release when needed. This reservoir is replenished by stimulating proliferation in the stem cell compartment. Normally, stem cells have a very low risk of unrepaired carcinogenic (or other) damage, due to extensive checking and repair. But when production is rushed to meet extreme demands, error rates increase. We use a mathematical model of cell inventory management to show that decision rules that effectively manage the inventory of mature cells to maintain tissue function across a wide range of unpredictable cytotoxic challenges imply that increases in average levels of cytotoxic challenges can increase average inventory levels and reduce the average error rate in stem cell production. Thus, hormesis and related nonlinearities can emerge as a natural result of cell-inventory risk management by tissues.",

We exposed MTLn3 cells to various doses of inorganic Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) in combination with ionizing radiation. Cells were treated with a series of As2O3 concentrations ranging from 20 muM to 1.22 nM for 8 hour, 24 hour and 48 hour periods. Post-treated cell proliferation was quantified by measuring mitochondrial activity and DNA analysis. Cells exposed to radiation and As2O3 at concentration greater than 1.25 muM showed apoptosis and radiations alone treated cells were statistically not different from the control. Hormesis was observed for As2O3 concentrations in the range of 0.078 muM to 0.625 muM while the combined chemo and radiation treatments of the cells did not affect the hormetic effect. We have demonstrated that As2O3 (in the presence and absence of ionizing radiation) in specific low concentrations induced apoptosis in the otherwise chemoresistant cancer cells. This low concentration-mediated cell death is immediately followed by a surge in cell survival. Low dosing dosimetry is highly desirable in metronomic therapy however, it has a narrow window since necrosis, hormesis, apoptosis and other dose-dependent biological processes take place in this region. Further quantifiable dosimetry is highly desired for routine clinical practice.",

On August 8, the WHO declared the epidemic to be a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern.\u201d Methods : By September 14, 2014, a total of 4507 probable and confirmed cases, including 2296 deaths from EVD (Zaire species) had been reported from five countries in West Africa \u2014 Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. We analyzed a detailed subset of data on 3343 confirmed and 667 probable Ebola cases collected in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone as of September 14. Results : The majority of patients are 15 to 44 years of age (49.9% male), and we estimate that the case fatality rate is 70.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 73) among persons with known clinical outcome of infection. The course of infection, including signs and symptoms, incubation period (11.4 days), and serial interval (15.3 days), is similar to that reported in previous outbreaks of EVD. On the basis of the initial periods of exponential growth, the estimated basic reproduction numbers (R0) are 1.71 (95% CI, 1.44 to 2.01) for Guinea, 1.83 (95% CI, 1.72 to 1.94) for Liberia, and 2.02 (95% CI, 1.79 to 2.26) for Sierra Leone. The estimated current reproduction numbers (R) are 1.81 (95% CI, 1.60 to 2.03) for Guinea, 1.51 (95% CI, 1.41 to 1.60) for Liberia, and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.27 to 1.51) for Sierra Leone; the corresponding doubling times are 15.7 days (95% CI, 12.9 to 20.3) for Guinea, 23.6 days (95% CI, 20.2 to 28.2) for Liberia, and 30.2 days (95% CI, 23.6 to 42.3) for Sierra Leone. Assuming no change in the control measures for this epidemic, by November 2, 2014, the cumulative reported numbers of confirmed and probable cases are predicted to be 5740 in Guinea, 9890 in Liberia, and 5000 in Sierra Leone, exceeding 20,000 in total. Conclusions : These data indicate that without drastic improvements in control measures, the numbers of cases of and deaths from EVD are expected to continue increasing from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months.",

Method - The study involved a cross-sectional survey during a sub-regional pharmacovigilance training course in Zimbabwe. Eighteen participants from 10 African countries attended and were asked to complete self-administered pre-course and post-course questionnaires. A follow-up questionnaire was also posted to each participant 2 months after the workshop. Results - After the course, there was a marked difference in the perceived factors discouraging a participant from reporting an ADR with only a few respondents unsure how to report ADRs or worried about confidentiality and legal issues. Only 5.4% of responses were inappropriate after the training when asked what should be reported to a voluntary ADR reporting scheme compared to 19.8% before the course. Half of the respondents to the follow-up questionnaire expected a pharmacovigilance centre to be established in their countries as a result of the training.

Moreover, the elimination of numerous xenobiotic and endobiotic toxic chemicals also requires a concerted function of Phase I and II enzymes, as well as the membrane spanning drug transporters. The genes that encode these enzymes and transporters are inducible by numerous xenobiotics, yet the inducibility shows clear species specificity. In the last 3-4 years, orphan nuclear receptors (NRs) such as PXR, CAR, and FXR have been established as species-specific xeno-sensors that regulate the expression of Phase I and II enzymes, as well as selected drug transporters. This transcriptional regulation is achieved by binding of these xenobiotic receptors to the NR response elements found within the promoter regions of target genes. The identification of NRs as xenosensors represents a major step forward in understanding the genetic mechanisms controlling the expression of drug metabolizing enzymes. The establishment of NR-mediated and mechanism-guided xenobiotic screening systems by using cultured cells or genetically engineered mouse models has not only advanced our understanding of the molecular complexity of this drug-induced xenobiotic response, but has also provided in vitro and in vivo platforms to facilitate the development of safer drugs.",

The analysis clearly shows Bystander Effect radon lung cancer induction and Adaptive Response reduction in lung cancer in some geographical regions. It is estimated that for radon levels up to about 400 Bq m(-3) there is about a 30% probability that no human lung cancer risk from radon will be experienced and a 20% probability that the risk is below the zero-radon, endogenic spontaneous or perhaps even genetically inheritable lung cancer risk rate.

We discuss the current challenges in establishing biomarkers of antiangiogenic therapy, define systemic, circulating, tissue and imaging biomarkers and their advantages and disadvantages, and comment on the future opportunities for validating biomarkers of antiangiogenic therapy.",

        "title": "Physician response to patient reports of adverse drug effects: Implications for patient-targeted adverse effect surveillance",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Using a patient targeted survey, we sought to assess patient representations of how physicians responded when patients presented with possible adverse drug reactions (ADRs). As a demonstration case, we took one widely prescribed drug class, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins'). This information was used to assess whether a patient-targeted ADR surveillance approach may complement provider reporting, potentially fostering identification of additional patients with possible or probable ADRs. METHODS: A total of 650 adult patients taking statins with self-reported ADRs completed a survey. Depending on the problems reported, some patients completed additional surveys specific to the most commonly cited statin ADRs: muscle, cognitive or neuropathy related. Patients were asked to report drug, dose, ADR character, time course of onset with drug, recovery with discontinuation, recurrence with rechallenge, quality-of-life impact, and interactions with their physician in relation to the perceived ADR. This paper focuses on patients' representation of the doctor-patient interaction and physicians' attribution, when patients report perceived ADRs. RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of patients reportedly spoke to their physician about the possible connection between statin use and their symptom. Patients reported that they and not the doctor most commonly initiated the discussion regarding the possible connection of drug to symptom (98% vs 2% cognition survey, 96% vs 4% neuropathy survey, 86% vs 14% muscle survey; p < 10(-8) for each). Physicians were reportedly more likely to deny than affirm the possibility of a connection. Rejection of a possible connection was reported to occur even for symptoms with strong literature support for a drug connection, and even in patients for whom the symptom met presumptive literature-based criteria for probable or definite drug-adverse effect causality. Assuming that physicians would not likely report ADRs in these instances, these patient-submitted ADR reports suggest that targeting patients may boost the yield of ADR reporting systems. CONCLUSIONS: Since low reporting rates are considered to contribute to delays in identification of ADRs, findings from this study suggest that additional putative cases may be identified by targeting patients as reporters, potentially speeding recognition of ADRs.",

        "abstract": "In order to detect adverse drug reactions, large observational drug safety studies are necessary as randomized clinical trials rarely have enough power. However, in order to obtain reliable results the issue of confounding, especially confounding by indication, should be addressed. We proposed a multiple propensity score, which is an extension of the propensity score, to reduce the bias in a dose-response analysis in a drug safety study. The multiple propensity score has similar properties to the propensity score in Rosenbaum and Rubin.(1) Using the propensity score for bias reduction of the risk ratio was considered. We used the multiple propensity score in a study of the dose-response relationship between diclofenac prescriptions and hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation using a record linkage database. We found that the unadjusted risk ratios were biased downwards due to confounders and that this bias was reduced by using stratification based on the multiple propensity score.",

Drug transporters and metabolising enzymes play an important role in the xenobiotic cascade and are important regulators of drug disposition at the molecular level. The proposal of a dynamic interplay between drug metabolism and efflux has positioned drug transporters as important mediators of gender disparity in respect to drug disposition and therapeutic response. In examining the effects of gender on drug disposition and response we will specifically direct our focus on the role of the predominant drug transporter, P-glycoprotein. This review focuses on the role of the P-glycoprotein as a molecular mediator of gender differences in both drug exposure and response. Differences in transporter expression and function will be discussed together with the molecular basis for the observed difference in drug exposure between the sexes. Gender differences affecting transporter expression and function at the effect compartment and the effect of this on drug response will also be discussed.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a pathogenic mechanism of depression, and genetic polymorphisms in HPA axis genes have been described to influence response to antidepressant drugs. In particular, two polymorphisms in FKBP5, a co-chaperone of the glucocorticoid receptor, were strongly associated with response to therapy. We aimed to analyze whether these findings could be reproduced in a different sample of otherwise comparable inpatients with major depression. METHODS: Genotyping for the two variants within the FKBP5 gene was performed using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and Taqman real-time PCR in a cohort of 179 inpatients who were monitored for the first 3 weeks of antidepressant drug treatment. The early response to antidepressant drugs was assessed as percentage of decline in Hamilton depression score after 3 weeks, responders versus nonresponders were distinguished by a 50% decrease. RESULTS: The FKBP5 variants rs3800373 and rs1360780 were highly linked, and carriers of the FKBP5 variants had a trend towards a higher chance to respond (p = 0.04; odds ratio: 1.8; 95% CI: 0.98-3.3). When analyzing drug-specific subgroups, the effect was seen mainly in the subgroups of patients treated with antidepressant drug combinations or with venlafaxine. CONCLUSION: In this study, an effect of FKBP5 variants on antidepressant drug response was confirmed in an independent cohort of depressed patients; however, with an odds ratio of 1.8 the effect size was smaller than that described earlier.",

The nuclear power plans suffered failures that have had an almost immediate impact on the future of energy production and policies of countries that depend or consider on nuclear energy. Once again, the development and safety of nuclear power is questioned, in part because of the belief that very low exposure to the radionuclides emitted in those accidents causes cancers, regardless of dose. The question then is: Is there evidence\u2014rather than either dogma or assumption or both\u2014that low levels of exposure cause detriment to human health? Clearly, there is no argument that much larg-er exposures do cause cancer or can kill in very short order.",

        "abstract": "A flexible approach to response surface modeling for the study of the joint action of three active anticancer agents is used to model a complex pattern of synergism, additivity and antagonism in an in vitro cell growth assay. The method for determining a useful nonlinear response surface model depends upon a series of steps using appropriate scaling of drug concentrations and effects, raw data modeling, and hierarchical parameter modeling. The method is applied to a very large in vitro study of the combined effect of Trimetrexate (TMQ), LY309887 (LY), and Tomudex (TDX) on inhibition of cancer cell growth. The base model employed for modeling dose-response effect is the four parameter Hill equation [1]. In the hierarchical aspect of the final model, the base Hill model is treated as a function of the total amount of the three drug mixture and the Hill parameters, background B, dose for 50% effect D50, and slope m, are understood as functions of the three drug fractions. The parameters are modeled using the canonical mixture polynomials from the mixture experiment methodologies introduced by Scheff [2]. We label the model generated a Nonlinear Mixture Amount model with control observations, or zero amounts, an \"NLMAZ\" model. This modeling paradigm provides for the first time an effective statistical approach to modeling complex patterns of local synergism, additivity, and antagonism in the same data set, the possibility of including additional experimental components beyond those in the mixture, and the capability of modeling three or more drugs.",

Both critical illness and therapeutic hypothermia significantly affect drug disposition, potentially contributing to drug-therapy and drug-disease interactions. Currently, there is limited information on the known alterations in drug concentration and response during mild hypothermia treatment, and there is a limited understanding of the specific mechanisms that underlie alterations in drug concentrations and the potential clinical importance of these changes. AREAS COVERED: A systemic review of the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on drug metabolism, disposition and response is provided. Specifically, the clinical and preclinical evidence of the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on blood flow, specific hepatic metabolism pathways, transporter function, renal excretion, pharmacodynamics and the effects during rewarming are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Available evidence demonstrates that mild hypothermia decreases the clearance of a variety of drugs with apparently little change in drug-protein binding. Recent evidence suggests that the magnitude of the change is elimination route specific. Further research is needed to determine the impact of these alterations on both drug concentration and response in order to optimize the therapeutic hypothermia in this vulnerable patient population.",

Data were collected with multiple methods from multiple sources using the principles of triangulation and induction. A total of 100 IDUs were interviewed. These interviews were complemented by focus groups and observations. A community advisory board ensured community ownership and participation. Findings showed that heroin, buprenorphine, diazepam and avil were the drugs most commonly injected. The use of pharmaceutical preparations as a 'cocktail' was also prevalent. Drug injectors interviewed were males, and most (81%) were from low-income groups living in slums. Direct (69%) as well as indirect sharing (94%) was common. Such unhygienic injecting practices, and the lack of access to sterile water, contribute to the high incidence of adverse health consequences. Compared with the buprenorphine injectors, heroin injectors were more likely to share injecting equipment (P=0.0022), inject more frequently (P=0.0013), have more drug using network members (P=0.0104), frequent 'shooting' locations (P=0.002), use the dealer's place to inject (P=0.0317), and face threats of arrest (P=0.0023). Many buprenorphine injectors managed their life without serious crises, and seemed to adopt a 'natural' harm reduction response. Sexual risk behaviour was prevalent among opioid users, and a history of commercial sex was associated with daily alcohol use (P=0.0221). The assessment led to an action plan which was presented and endorsed in an advocacy meeting by key stake-holders and decision-makers. The critical importance of implementing quality, accessible, community-oriented, and effective HIV interventions with the capacity to reach the majority of IDUs is discussed. Public health responses to injecting drug use must target changes among individuals at-risk, as well as in the community and risk environment.",

        "abstract": "Anesthesiologists have been aware of the importance of optimal drug combination long ago and performed many investigations about the combined use of anesthetic agents. There are 3 classes of drug interaction: additive, synergistic, and antagonistic. These definitions of drug interaction suggest that a zero interaction model should exist to be used as a reference in classifying the interaction of drug combinations. The Loewe additivity has been used as a universal reference model for classifying drug interaction. Most anesthetic drugs follow the sigmoid E(max) model (Hill equation); this model will be used for modeling response surface. Among lots of models for drug interaction in the anesthetic area, the Greco model, Machado model, Plummer model, Carter model, Minto model, Fidler model, and Kong model are adequate to be applied to the data of anesthetic drug interaction. A model with a single interaction parameter does not accept an inconsistency in the classes of drug interactions. To solve this problem, some researchers proposed parametric models which have a polynomial interaction function to capture synergy, additivity, and antagonism scattered all over the surface of drug combinations. Inference about truth must be based on an optimal approximating model. Akaike information criterion (AIC) is the most popular approach to choosing the best model among the aforementioned models. Whatever the good qualities of a chosen model, it is uncertain whether the chosen model is the best model. A more robust inference can be extracted from averaging several models that are considered relevant.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anesthetic drug interactions traditionally have been characterized using isobolographic analysis or multiple logistic regression. Both approaches have significant limitations. The authors propose a model based on response-surface methodology. This model can characterize the entire dose-response relation between combinations of anesthetic drugs and is mathematically consistent with models of the concentration-response relation of single drugs. METHODS: The authors defined a parameter, theta, that describes the concentration ratio of two potentially interacting drugs. The classic sigmoid Emax model was extended by making the model parameters dependent on theta. A computer program was used to estimate response surfaces for the hypnotic interaction between midazolam, propofol, and alfentanil, based on previously published data. The predicted time course of effect was simulated after maximally synergistic bolus dose combinations. RESULTS: The parameters of the response surface were identifiable. With the test data, each of the paired combinations showed significant synergy. Computer simulations based on interactions at the effect site predicted that the maximally synergistic three-drug combination tripled the duration of effect compared with propofol alone. CONCLUSIONS: Response surfaces can describe anesthetic interactions, even those between agonists, partial agonists, competitive antagonists, and inverse agonists. Application of response-surface methodology permits characterization of the full concentration-response relation and therefore can be used to develop practical guidelines for optimal drug dosing.",

        "abstract": "Background: To date, there are estimates for the percentage of unknown cases of doping and illicit drug use in fitness sports, but not for elite sports. This can be attributed to the problem of implementing questionnaires and surveys to get reliable epidemiological estimates of deviant or illicit behaviour. Methods: All athletes questioned were subject to doping controls as members or junior members of the national teams. In order to estimate the prevalence of doping and illicit drug abuse, the athletes were either issued an anonymous standardized questionnaire (SQ; n = 1394) or were interviewed using randomized response technique (RRT; n = 480). We used a two-sided z-test to compare the SQ and RRT results with the respective official German NADA data on the prevalence of doping. Results: Official doping tests only reveal 0.81% (n = 25,437; 95% CI: 0.70-0.92%) of positive test results, while according to RRT 6.8% (n = 480; 95% CI: 2.7-10.9%) of our athletes confessed to having practiced doping (z = 2.91, p = 0.004). SQ and RRT both revealed a prevalence of about 7% for illicit drug use, but SQ failed to indicate a realistic prevalence of doping (0.20%; 95% CI: 0.02-0.74%). Conclusions: We demonstrate for the first time that data from official doping tests underestimate the true prevalence of doping in elite sports by more than a factor of eight. Our results indicate that implementing RRT before and after anti-doping measures could be a promising method for evaluating the effectiveness of anti-doping programs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "Summary The use of biological response modifiers or biologicals has rapidly expanded since the introduction of the first diagnostic antibodies; they are now widely employed in oncology, autoimmune disorders, inflammatory diseases and transplantation medicine. Their widespread use has resulted in an increase in adverse drug reactions. Adverse effects result from both direct pharmacological actions and immunological actions, as well as through induction of a specific immune response. The nomenclature, particularly of the monoclonal antibodies, identifies the target structure and organ as well as the species of origin, which then helps predict their effects and antigenic properties. Depending on the extent of foreign protein, anti-allotypic or anti-idiotypic antibodies with or without neutralizing properties may be induced. Adverse drug reactions from biologicals often depend on the target and may be explained by activation or inhibition of particular cytokine pathways. Adverse drug reactions are classified by their pathomechanism, which enhances understanding of the pathogenesis and facilitates both allergologic diagnostic measures and planning of premedication in future treatments. This review emphasizes immunostimulatory and hypersensitivity reactions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background: Recent research highlights the multiple steps to preparing and injecting drugs and the resultant viral threats faced by drug users. This research suggests that more sensitive measurement of injection drug HIV risk behavior is required. In addition, growing evidence suggests there are gender differences in injection risk behavior. However, the potential for differential item functioning between genders has not been explored. Objectives: To explore item response theory as an improved measurement modeling technique that provides empirically justified scaling of injection risk behavior and to examine for potential gender-based differential item functioning. Methods: Data is used from three studies in the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Studies. A two-parameter item response theory model was used to scale injection risk behavior and logistic regression was used to examine for differential item functioning. Results: Item fit statistics suggest that item response theory can be used to scale injection risk behavior and these models can provide more sensitive estimates of risk behavior. Additionally, gender-based differential item functioning is present in the current data. Conclusion: Improved measurement of injection risk behavior using item response theory should be encouraged as these models provide increased congruence between construct measurement and the complexity of injection-related HIV risk. Suggestions are made to further improve injection risk behavior measurement. Furthermore, results suggest direct comparisons of composite scores between males and females may be misleading and future work should account for differential item functioning before comparing levels of injection risk behavior.",

        "abstract": "Background: Drug overdose is a leading cause of mortality among illicit drug users. This study characterizes responses to overdose among injection drug users (IDUs) in Baltimore, Maryland, and identifies factors associated with medically inappropriate response. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was administered to 924 IDUs in an ongoing cohort study between August 2003 and September 2004. Self-reported experiences of witnessing overdose were obtained by structured interview. Multiple logistic regression identified associations between overdose information sources and medically inappropriate responses. Results: Most IDUs (69.7%) reported ever witnessing an overdose. The most common responses were walking the victim around (70.8%), shaking them (64.9%), and inflicting pain (62.6%). One in four (25.8%) injected the victim with salt water. Two thirds (63.4%) called 911, but more than half delayed the call by 5 or more minutes. The most common reason cited for delaying or foregoing the 911 call was the belief that they could revive the victim themselves, followed by fear of police involvement. Most IDUs had received information on how to prevent or respond to an overdose, but most (73.2%) received this information from friends or other drug users. IDUs who got overdose information solely from lay sources were less likely to call 911 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.46-0.94) and more likely to inject the victim with salt water (AOR=2.06, 95% CI=1.36-3.13) than IDUs who received no information at all. Injection drug users who received information from medical and social services providers only were less likely to delay the 911 call (AOR=0.35, 95% CI=0.22-0.72). Conclusions: Inappropriate overdose responses are widespread among IDUs in Baltimore. Interventions that provide overdose education and reduce police response to overdose events may improve witness response and reduce mortality associated with drug overdose. ?? 2006 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",

        "abstract": "Central thalamus regulates forebrain arousal, influencing activity in distributed neural networks that give rise to organized actions during alert, wakeful states. Central thalamus has been implicated in working memory by the effects of lesions and microinjected drugs in this part of the brain. Lesions and drugs that inhibit neural activity have been found to impair working memory. Drugs that increase activity have been found to enhance and impair memory depending on the dose tested. Electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) similarly enhances working memory at low stimulating currents and impairs it at higher currents. These effects are time dependent. They were observed when DBS was applied during the memory delay (retention) or choice response (retrieval) but not earlier in trials during the sample (acquisition) phase. The effects of microinjected drugs and DBS are consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson law, which describes an inverted-U relationship between arousal and behavioral performance. Alternatively these results may reflect desensitization associated with higher levels of stimulation, spread of drugs or current to adjacent structures, or activation of less sensitive neurons or receptors at higher DBS currents or drug doses.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Several lines of evidence suggest that antipsychotic drug efficacy is mediated by dopamine type 2 (D(2)) receptor blockade. Therefore, it seems plausible that variation in the DRD(2) gene is associated with clinical response to antipsychotic drug treatment. The authors conducted the first meta-analysis to examine the relationship between DRD2 polymorphisms and antipsychotic drug response. METHOD: A MEDLINE search of articles available up to December 31, 2008, yielded 18 prospective studies examining DRD2 gene variation and antipsychotic response in schizophrenia patients; of which, 10 independent studies met criteria for inclusion. Clinical response to antipsychotic treatment was defined as a 50% reduction of either the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score or Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score at approximately 8 weeks of follow-up evaluation. Odds ratio was the primary effect-size measure and computed for each polymorphism in each study. Sufficient data were available for two DRD2 polymorphisms: -141C Ins/Del and Taq1A. RESULTS: Six studies reported results for the -141C Ins/Del polymorphism (total sample size: N=687). The Del allele carrier was significantly associated with poorer antipsychotic drug response relative to the Ins/Ins genotype. Eight studies assessed the Taq1A polymorphism and antipsychotic response (total sample size: N=748). There was no significant difference in the response rate among A1 allele carriers relative to individuals with the A2/A2 genotype or A2 allele carriers relative to individuals with the A1/A1 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The DRD2 genetic variation is associated with clinical response to antipsychotic drug treatment. These data may provide proof-of-principle for pharmacogenetic studies in schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "HIV infection among injecting drug users (IDUs) is preventable, and in order to develop appropriate interventions, an assessment was carried out at Madras, South India using the Rapid Assessment and Response Guide on Injecting Drug Use developed by WHO. Data were collected with multiple methods from multiple sources using the principles of triangulation and induction. A total of 100 IDUs were interviewed. These interviews were complemented by focus groups and observations. A community advisory board ensured community ownership and participation. Findings showed that heroin, buprenorphine, diazepam and avil were the drugs most commonly injected. The use of pharmaceutical preparations as a 'cocktail' was also prevalent. Drug injectors interviewed were males, and most (81%) were from low-income groups living in slums. Direct (69%) as well as indirect sharing (94%) was common. Such unhygienic injecting practices, and the lack of access to sterile water, contribute to the high incidence of adverse health consequences. Compared with the buprenorphine injectors, heroin injectors were more likely to share injecting equipment (P = 0.0022), inject more frequently (P = 0.0013), have more drug using network members (P = 0.0104), frequent 'shooting' locations (P = 0.002), use the dealer's place to inject (P = 0.0317), and face threats of arrest (P = 0.0023). Many buprenorphine injectors managed their life without serious crises, and seemed to adopt a 'natural' harm reduction response. Sexual risk behaviour was prevalent among opioid users, and a history of commercial sex was associated with daily alcohol use (P = 0.0221). The assessment led to an action plan which was presented and endorsed in an advocacy meeting by key stake-holders and decision-makers. The critical importance of implementing quality, accessible, community-oriented, and effective HIV interventions with the capacity to reach the majority of IDUs is discussed. Public health responses to injecting drug use must target changes among individuals at-risk, as well as in the community and risk environment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Even we do not have any viable model to exploit nanotechnology in medicine. The most important arena of the nanotechnology is the development of nanoscale drugs for routine clinical practice. The current chemo protocols are based on maximum tolerable dose philosophy. Such a dose, when translated into active nanoscale clusters, quantitatively outnumbers the cells in an average human body. These nanoscale drug issues are discussed in this paper. A theoretical framework for commonly used drug aspirin has been considered as an example. The possible quantum physical effects have also been theoretically evaluated. Further, the amount of drug molecules in a standardized aspirin dose of 100 milligram has been computed into nanoclusters. The calculations show that the processing of nanoscale drug is a monumental task which requires new types of manufacturing facilities. Also there is a need to develop new protocols which will help realize the practical implementation of nanodosimetry in day to day drug administrations. These protocols will need to examine the implications of dose-responses such as necrosis, apoptosis and hormesis in medicine for routine clinical practice.",

The authors developed a sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to measure RIS and its metabolite in serum. Fifteen RIS-naive patients were admitted to an acute psychiatric care unit and treated with 4-6 mg/d oral RIS. At days 7 and 21 of hospital stay, serum levels were measured; clinical scales and serum prolactin were assessed. RIS and its metabolite were analyzed by a Q-Trap 2000 triple quadrupole/ion trap mass spectrometer in the multiple reaction-monitoring mode. Chromatographic separation was accomplished using a cyano column with an analytical run of 9 minutes. The calibration curve exhibited consistent linearity and reproducibility in the range 0-100 ng/mL for both analytes. Lower limit of quantification was 0.2 ng/mL; limit of detection, for a signal to noise ratio of 3, was 0.05 ng/mL for both analytes. Serum RIS and 9-OH-RIS levels increased at day 7, reaching a steady state, and remaining constant up to day 21. Scores on psychopathology rating scales decreased; serum prolactin and neurological rating scale for extrapyramidal effects rose at day 7 and remained stable thereafter. No correlation was found between serum concentration values, including sum and ratio of RIS and 9-OH-RIS, and any of the other clinical values (serum prolactin and clinical scales). These data indicate that clinical changes are related to the achievement of steady state levels of RIS and its metabolite and are maintained, but not continued, with continued RIS treatment. Therapeutic drug monitoring of RIS and its metabolites is not recommended as a routine procedure in patients with psychotic disorders.",

        "abstract": "High through-put studies commonly use automated systems with 96-well plates in which multiple chemicals are tested at multiple doses using log-2 dose increments after a suitable incubation period. There are typically multiple (ranging from five to eleven) doses on each chemical, and occasionally plate replications of the dose-response studies. The target endpoint for such studies is typically the LC50, but for some chemicals, there may be multiple doses below a benchmark dose where there is no apparent adverse response relative to control response. We show how an estimation approach can lead to clearly interpretable results about response in the low dose region using data from a high throughput study of 2189 chemicals on yeast. Accurate estimates can be obtained of response for study chemicals by using best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) in a mixed model, and summarized via plots with expected response (assuming no low-dose effect) with confidence intervals for response below the benchmark dose for each chemical, providing an informative summary of response at low doses. We conclude that this approach can provide valuable insights that would be missed if the observational data were only considered through the lens of statistical methods appropriate for experimental studies.",

Adaptive response contradicts the linear-non-threshold (LNT) dose-response model for ionizing radiation. We have previously reported that exposure of laboratory animals to radiofrequency radiation can induce a survival adaptive response. Furthermore, we have indicated that pre-exposure of mice to radiofrequency radiation emitted by a GSM mobile phone increased their resistance to a subsequent Escherichia coli infection. In this study, the survival rates in animals receiving both adapting (radiofrequency) and challenge dose (bacteria) and the animals receiving only the challenge dose (bacteria) were 56% and 20%, respectively. In this light, our findings contribute to the assumption that radiofrequency-induced adaptive response can be used as an efficient method for decreasing the risk of infection in immunosuppressed irradiated individuals.

This methodology is useful in screening assays that attempt to parse the observed toxicological dose-response data into categories based on the magnitude of hormesis in the evaluation of NPs.

        "abstract": "The pKZ1 mouse chromosomal inversion assay is the only assay that has detected modulation of a mutagenic endpoint after single whole body X-irradiation with doses lower than 1 mGy. A non-linear dose response for chromosomal inversion has been observed in spleen and prostate between 0.001 mGy and 10 mGy, with doses between 0.005-0.01 mGy causing an increase in inversions and doses between 1-10 mGy causing a reduction below spontaneous inversion frequency. An adaptive response is a decreased biological effect induced by a low radiation dose. Adaptive responses contradict the linear-no-threshold model of risk estimation. We demonstrated that very low (0.001 mGy, 0.01 mGy, 1 mGy and 10 mGy) doses of X-radiation induced a chromosomal inversion adaptive response as measured by a reduction in the frequency of subsequent high dose (1000 mGy) induced inversions in prostate. These are the lowest X-radiation doses reported to induce an adaptive response for any endpoint. Adaptive response experiments were also performed where the high dose was administered four hours prior to a low dose of 0.01 mGy or 10 mGy In both cases an adaptive response was observed. Identification of the modifying factors involved in the adaptive response may provide candidates for radioprotection.",

Its use in cancer radiotherapy has been discussed in a separate publication. This paper describes simple changes in scheduling that can make use of these beneficial adaptive effects for protection. No increase in total exposure is necessary, only a simple change in the timing of radiation exposure. A low dose of radiation at a sufficient dose rate will trigger the adaptive response. This in turn will offer a considerable protection against the damage from a subsequent high dose. A simple scenario is discussed as well as a brief review of the experimental basis of the adaptive response.",

        "abstract": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are unique genetic differences between individuals that contribute in significant ways to the determination of human variation including physical characteristics like height and appearance as well as less obvious traits such as personality, behaviour and disease susceptibility. SNPs can also significantly influence responses to pharmacotherapy and whether drugs will produce adverse reactions. The development of new drugs can be made far cheaper and more rapid by selecting participants in drug trials based on their genetically determined response to drugs. Technology that can rapidly and inexpensively genotype thousands of samples for thousands of SNPs at a time is therefore in high demand. With the completion of the human genome project, about 12 million true SNPs have been identified to date. However, most have not yet been associated with disease susceptibility or drug response. Testing for the appropriate drug response SNPs in a patient requiring treatment would enable individualised therapy with the right drug and dose administered correctly the first time. Many pharmaceutical companies are also interested in identifying SNPs associated with polygenic traits so novel therapeutic targets can be discovered. This review focuses on technologies that can be used for genotyping known SNPs as well as for the discovery of novel SNPs associated with drug response.",

        "abstract": "Two-component signal transduction (TCST) is the predominant signaling scheme used in bacteria to sense and respond to environmental changes in order to survive and thrive. A typical TCST system consists of a sensor histidine kinase to detect external signals and an effector response regulator to respond to external changes. In the signaling scheme, the histidine kinase phosphorylates and activates the response regulator, which functions as a transcription factor to modulate gene expression. One promising strategy toward antibacterial development is to target TCST regulatory systems, specifically the response regulators to disrupt the expression of genes important for virulence. In Salmonella enterica, the PhoQ/PhoP signal transduction system is used to sense and respond to low magnesium levels and regulates the expression for over 40 genes necessary for growth under these conditions, and more interestingly, genes that are important for virulence. In this study, a hybrid approach coupling computational and experimental methods was applied to identify drug-like compounds to target the PhoP response regulator. A computational approach of structure-based virtual screening combined with a series of biochemical and biophysical assays was used to test the predictability of the computational strategy and to characterize the mode of action of the compounds. Eight compounds from virtual screening inhibit the formation of the PhoP-DNA complex necessary for virulence gene regulation. This investigation served as an initial case study for targeting TCST response regulators to modulate the gene expression of a signal transduction pathway important for bacterial virulence. With the increasing resistance of pathogenic bacteria to current antibiotics, targeting TCST response regulators that control virulence is a viable strategy for the development of antimicrobial therapeutics with novel modes of action.",

We used logistic regression models that accounted for the clustered survey design to identify the determinants of care seeking outside the home and antibiotic use for 2914 cases of recent acute illness.\\n\\nRESULTS: Overall, 95% of individuals with acute illness took medicines, 90% sought care outside their homes and 36% took antibiotics. In multivariate analyses, illness severity was a strong predictor of seeking care outside the home. Among those who sought outside care, the strongest predictor of antibiotic use was the presence of upper respiratory symptoms (OR: 3.02, CI: 2.36-3.86, P<0.001), followed by gastrointestinal symptoms or difficulty breathing, and antibiotics use was less likely if they had fever. The odds of receiving antibiotics were higher when visiting a public hospital or more than one healthcare facility.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The nature and severity of symptoms and patterns of care seeking had the greatest influence on decisions to take antibiotics. Antibiotics were widely available and inappropriately used in all settings. Policies to regulate antibiotics distribution as well as interventions to educate prescribers, dispensers and consumers are needed to improve antibiotic use.",

This mAb is active in previously treated patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) refractory to alkylating agents and purine nucleoside analogs. Alemtuzumab is also investigated in previously untreated patients with this leukemia. The results of a prospective randomized Phase III study (CAM307 trial) comparing chlorambucil with alemtuzumab in the first-line treatment of progressive B-CLL were recently published. The overall response rate, complete remission rate, and progression-free survival were all superior for alemtuzumab. Moreover, elimination of minimal residual disease occurred in one third of complete responders to alemtuzumab and none to chlorambucil. Adverse events were similar in both arms with the exception of infusion-related reactions and cytomegalovirus infections. In 2001, alemtuzumab was approved in the USA and Europe as a third-line therapy for patients with B-CLL who had been treated with alkylating agents and failed fludarabine therapy. In September 2007, the US FDA, on the basis of CAM307 results, approved alemtuzumab for the treatment of previously untreated patients with B-CLL. Moreover, the European Commission recently granted marketing authorization to alemtuzumab for the treatment of patients with B-CLL for whom fludarabine combination monotherapy is not appropriate.",

A detailed insight into the underlying mechanism of hormesis was uncovered by applying whole genome DNA microarray experimentation over a range of quercetin (Q), tannic acid (TA), and humic substances (HuminFeed(\u00ae), HF) concentrations. The transcriptional response to all exposures followed a non-linear mode which highlighted differential signaling and metabolic pathways. While low Q concentrations regulated processes improving the health of the nematodes, higher concentrations extended lifespan and modulated substantially the global transcriptional response. Over-represented transcripts were notably part of the biotransformation process: enhanced catabolism of toxic intermediates possibly contributes to the lifespan extension. The regulation of transcription, Dauer entry, and nucleosome suggests the presence of distinct exposure dependent differences in transcription and signaling pathways. TA- and HF-mediated transcript expression patterns were overall similar to each other, but changed across the concentration range indicating that their transcriptional dynamics are complex and cannot be attributed to a simple adaptive response. In contrast, Q-mediated hormesis was well aligned to fit the definition of an adaptive response. Simple molecules are more likely to induce an adaptive response than more complex molecules.",

This dose response relationship can be influenced by built-in capabilities of cells that minimize the fixation of IR-mediated DNA damage as pro-carcinogenic mutations. Key capabilities include sensing of damage, activation of cell cycle checkpoint arrests that provide time needed for repair of the damage as well as apoptosis. Here we describe computational modeling of the signaling pathways that link sensing of DNA damage and checkpoint arrest activation/apoptosis to investigate how these molecular-level interactions influence the dose response relationship for IR induced cancer. The model provides qualitatively accurate descriptions of the IR-mediated activation of cell cycle checkpoints and the apoptotic pathway, and of time-course activities and dose response of relevant regulatory proteins (e.g. p53 and p21). Linking to a two-stage clonal growth cancer model, the model described here successfully captured a monotonically increasing to a J-shaped dose response curve and identified one potential mechanism leading to the J-shape: the cell cycle checkpoint arrest time saturates with the increase of the dose.",

Results. Substantial gains in knowledge and response capacity were reported at all of the study sites. Before RAR initiation, prevention and intervention programs had been absent or inadequate at most of the sites. The RARs resulted in many new or modified interventions; 7 sites reported 24 health-related interventions that were subsequently developed and influenced by the RARs. Conclusions. RARs, which require relatively little external funding, appear to be effective in linking assessment to development of appropriate interventions.

We analyzed the microbeam and broadbeam alpha particle data of Miller et al. (1995, 1999), Zhou et al. (2001, 2003, 2004), Nagasawa and Little (1999, 2002), Hei et al. (1999), Sawant et al.

In the Bystander Damage Region of the alpha particle response, there is a variation of RBE from about 10 to 35. There is a transition region between the Bystander Damage Region and Direct Damage Region of between one and two microdose alpha particle traversals indicating that perhaps two alpha particle \"hits\" are necessary to produce the direct damage. Extrapolation of underground miners lung cancer risks to human risks at domestic and workplace levels may not be valid.",

        "abstract": "Natural and synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) have been used for decades to suppress inflammation. In this paper, we re-examine the role of the endogenous GC, cortisol, as a primary homeostatic regulator of the human inflammatory response to injury. Our data show that cortisol regulation of innate immunity can be both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Using a human model of in vivo cortisol depletion, we first show that baseline (diurnal) cortisol concentrations do not exert an anti-inflammatory effect. This is the first clue that cortisol regulation of inflammation is not represented by a linear dose-response relationship. We next show in surgical patients that cortisol does exert an acute anti-inflammatory effect over a carefully regulated range of physiologic cortisol concentrations. Finally, transient pre-treatment of healthy humans with cortisol induces a bi-phasic response during a later, delayed systemic inflammatory response: an intermediate cortisol concentration augments inflammation while a high cortisol concentration is neither pro- nor anti-inflammatory. Based on these findings and the work of others, we propose a new paradigm that identifies cortisol regulation of human inflammation as both dualistic-it is pro- and anti-inflammatory-and dynamic, it evolves over time.",

        "abstract": "Erratic or unpredictable response to drugs remains a challenge of modern drug therapy. An important determinant of such interindividual differences in drug response is variability in the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and/or transporters at sites of absorption and/or tissue distribution. Variable drug-metabolizing enzyme and transporter expression can result in unpredictable exposure and tissue distribution of drugs and may manifest as adverse effects or therapeutic failure. In the past decade, important new insights have been made relating to the regulatory mechanisms governing the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters by ligand-activated nuclear receptors. Specifically, there is compelling evidence to demonstrate that PXR, CAR, FXR, LXR, VDR, HNF4alpha, and AhR form a battery of nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of many important drug-metabolizing enzyme and transporters. In this review, the authors focus on clinically important drug-metabolizing enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT1A1, SULT2A1, and glutathione S-transferases and their regulation by nuclear receptors. They also review the nuclear receptor-mediated regulation of drug transporters such as MDR1, MRP2, MRP4, BSEP, BCRP, NTCP, OATP1B3, and OATP1A2. Finally, they outline how the drug development process has been affected by the current understanding of the involvement of nuclear receptors in the regulation of drug disposition genes",

        "abstract": "Generally minute doses of drugs have been prescribed in biotherapies, homeopathy, immunization and vaccinations for centuries. Now the use of low doses of drugs is on the rise to combat serious diseases such as advanced cancers around the world. This new therapeutic approach to address solid tumors and other advanced diseases is a departure from the conventional use of maximum dose protocol. A small dose of the prescribed drug is frequently administered in a continuous fashion, at regular intervals, either as a standard treatment or as a maintenance therapy for a long time. However, this new treatment method lacks any standard for drug quantization, dose fractionation, repetition frequency and duration of a treatment course for an individual patient. This paper reviews literature about metronomic therapy and discusses hormesis: both phenomena occur in low dose ranges. Better mathematical models, computer simulations, process optimization and clinical trials are warranted to fully exploit the potential of low dose metronomic therapy to cure chronic and complicated diseases. New protocols to standardize metronomic dosimetry will answer the age old questions related to hormesis and homeopathy. It appears that this new low-dose metronomic therapy will have far reaching effects in curing chronic diseases throughout the world.",

This adaptive response can have important and positive consequences for radiotherapy. This paper describes a simple change in treatment procedures to make use of these beneficial effects. A low dose applied only to the healthy cells will probably produce some damage. However, it will also start the adaptive response which will yield increased protection when the large therapeutic dose is applied. The resultant immediate damage will be thereby reduced as well as the probability that the high dose therapy itself will induce a subsequent secondary cancer. After a brief historical review, the effects of a low radiation dose on a canine cancer cell line will be discussed as well as trials of the suggested pre-dose therapy on canine cancer patients undergoing standard radiation therapy.",

The soundness of this recommendation has been questioned, but I focus on its consequences if adopted, many of them apparently unintended. If most endpoints for most agents are assumed to have non-zero low-dose risks, then the critical-effect concept, choosing the one endpoint on which to calculate acceptable doses, loses its basis. All regulatory decisions, since they entail substituting some exposures (and their attendant risks) for others, become risk-risk trade-off decisions, and equity questions are raised since risk transfer is inevitably involved. A valid basis for estimating low-dose linear components is not evident, and upper-bound approaches fail to be reliably public health-protective owing to the risk trade-off decisions that need to be faced.",

Although nanotechnology-based products are generally thought to be at a pre-competitive stage, an increasing number of products and materials are becoming commercially available. Human exposure to nanoparticles is therefore inevitable as they become more widely used and, as a result, nanotoxicology research is now gaining attention. However, there are many uncertainties as to whether the unique properties of nanoparticles also pose occupational health risks. These uncertainties arise because of gaps in knowledge about the factors that are essential for predicting health risks such as routes of exposure, distribution, accumulation, excretion and dose-response relationship of the nanoparticles. In particular, uncertainty remains with regard to the nature of the dose-response curve at low level exposures below the toxic threshold. In fact, in the literature, some studies that investigated the biological effects of nanoparticles, observed a hormetic dose-response. However, currently available data regarding this topic are extremely limited and fragmentary. It therefore seems clear that future studies need to focus on this issue by studying the potential adverse health effects caused by low-level exposures to nanoparticles.",

Changes in gene expression accompanying this hormetic response have not been previously investigated. In this study, expression of stress response (Hsp60), dispersal (OSD, TOL and ANT), and developmental (FPPS I) genes were examined for two generations during imidacloprid-induced reproductive stimulation in M. persicae. Global DNA methylation was also measured to test the hypothesis that changes in gene expression are heritable. At hormetic concentrations, down-regulation of Hsp60 was followed by up-regulation of this gene in the subsequent generation. Likewise, expression of dispersal-related genes and FPPS I varied with concentration, life stage, and generation. These results indicate that reproductive hormesis in M. persicae is accompanied by a complex transgenerational pattern of up- and down-regulation of genes that likely reflects trade-offs in gene expression and related physiological processes during the phenotypic dose-response. Moreover, DNA methylation in second generation M. persicae occurred at higher doses than in first-generation aphids, suggesting that heritable adaptability to low doses of the stressor might have occurred.",

Culture medium was replaced twice a week to avoid suppression of viability due to nutrient competition and metabolic waste accumulation. There was no need to replace culture medium before adding AlamarBlue. Cell proliferation continued after irradiation and the suppression effect on cell viability was most evident on day 8. At this time point, by comparing measurements from irradiated vs. non-irradiated cells, for various dose levels, a viability dose response curve was plotted. Immediately after the 8(th) day (nadir), cells started to re-grow at a rate inversely related to the radiation dose. By comparing measurements at the time point of nadir vs. a convenient subsequent time point, re-growth dose response abilities were plotted, simulating clonogenic assays.",

Serial arterial blood samples were taken for evaluation of NiAc exposure in guinea pigs and NEFA in rats. The biophase kinetics of NiAc was assumed to impact on NEFA turnover with feedback incorporated via an inhibitory moderator compartment. The response acted linearly on the production of moderator, which then acted inversely on the turnover rate of response. The potency, expressed as the amount of NiAc in the biophase causing a 50 % inhibitory effect (ID(50)), was 6.5 nmol +/- 31 % and the half-life of response (t(1/2, kout)) 2 min +/- 18 %. The half-life of tolerance (t(1/2, ktol)) was 9 min +/- 27 %. The model can be used to provide information about factors that determine the time course of NEFA response following different rates and routes of administration of NiAc or NiAc analogues.",

In this article we demonstrate, through computer simulations, that the resulting asymptotic Wald confidence intervals cannot be trusted to achieve the desired confidence levels. Sometimes they could underestimate the true nominal level and are thus liberal. Hence one needs to be cautious in using the usual linearized standard errors of MLE and the associated confidence intervals.",

SNP related web resources can be invaluable in the search for SNPs relevant to drug response phenotypes as they represent relatively cheaper yet efficient ways of prioritizing relevant SNPs for further study. These resources serve as repositories of SNP information or contain in silico tools that can predict the functionality of a SNP. More sophisticated resources integrate the information repository function with the predictive function to create a one stop SNP resource for researchers. SNP related web resources can also aid researchers in planning and analyzing different types of genetic association studies by aiding in selecting SNPs for genotyping in these studies. The focus of this mini review is to outline the SNP related web resources that are available to researchers and how these resources may aid researchers studying SNP-drug response phenotype associations. Through efficient utilization of SNP related web resources, researchers will hopefully be able accelerate the pace of SNP related research in pharmacogenomics by identifying high risk SNP variants contributing to drug response as well as developing novel therapeutic targets based on understanding how SNPs alter drug response pathways.",

Dose/response studies showed that the occurrence and the magnitude of hormesis depended on climatic conditions and the parameter measured. Within the tested dose range, stimulatory responses were only observed under less-stressful conditions and were most pronounced for leaf area growth [138 % of control; 13 days after treatment (DAT)]. Temporal assessment of leaf area development showed that doses causing a stimulatory response at the end of the experiment (< 0.42 +/- 0.04 kg/ha; 13 DAT) were initially inhibitory up to ED(50) values (2 DAT). This clearly demonstrated an over-compensatory response. Inhibition of leaf area at 13 DAT reached ED(50) values on average at 0.62 +/-0.12 kg/ha, and S. arvensis was completely inhibited at doses exceeding 1.81 +/-0.56 kg/ha (ED(90)). Based on these findings, implications of parthenin hormesis are discussed with respect to allelopathy of P. hysterophorus and exploitation of growth stimulatory responses in agriculture.",

The preconditioned organ is then \"tolerant\" to injury from subsequent severe stress of the same or different etiology. Protection is substantial (70% reduction) but delayed in onset and is transient. Gene expression is unique between brains preconditioned, injured (stroke) or made tolerant. Thus, preconditioning reprograms the response to lethal ischemic stress (stroke), reprogrammed from an injury induction response to a neuroprotective processes. Postconditioning refers to attenuation of injurious processes occurring during reperfusion of ischemic brain. Transient mechanical interruption of reperfusion induces post-conditioning which can attenuate reperfusion injury. Post-conditioning protects ischemic brain by decreasing reperfusion induced oxygen free radical formation. The free radicals produce injury via mitochondrial damage which can be repaired experimentally. Post-conditioning produces neuroprotection as potent as experimental preconditioning. The recognition of broad based gene silencing (suppression of thousands of genes) as the phenotype of the preconditioned, ischemic tolerant brain, may explain failure of all single target drugs for stroke. As risks of reperfusion injury accompany treatment for acute stroke, endogenous neuroprotective and repair mechanisms offer translational stroke therapy.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between the dose of an effector and the biological response frequently is not described by a linear function and, moreover, in some cases the dose-response relationship may change from positive/adverse to adverse/positive with increasing dose. This complicated relationship is called \"hormesis\". This paper provides a short analysis of the concept along with a description of used approaches to characterize hormetic relationships. The whole hormetic curve can be divided into three zones: I - a lag-zone where no changes are observed with increasing dose; II - a zone where beneficial/adverse effects are observed, and III - a zone where the effects are opposite to those seen in zone II. Some approaches are proposed to analyze the molecular components involved in the development of the hormetic character of dose-response relationships with the use of specific genetic lines or inhibitors of regulatory pathways. The discussion is then extended to suggest a new parameter (half-width of the hormetic curve at zone II) for quantitative characterization of the hormetic curve. The problems limiting progress in the development of the hormesis concept such as low reproducibility and predictability may be solved, at least partly, by deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying the hormetic dose-effect relationship.",

        "abstract": "Hormetic dose response occurs for many endpoints associated with exposures of biological organisms to environmental stressors. Cell-based U- or inverted U-shaped responses may derive from common processes involved in activation of adaptive responses required to protect cells from stressful environments. These adaptive pathways extend the region of cellular homeostasis and are protective against ultimate cell, organ, and system toxicity. However, the activation of stress responses carries a significant energetic cost to the cell, leading to alterations of a variety of basal cellular functions in adapted or stressed cells. This tradeoff of resources between the unstressed and adapted states may lead to U-or inverted U-shaped dose response curves for some precursor endpoints. We examine this general hypothesis with chlorine, a prototype oxidative stressor, using a combination of cellular studies with gene expression analysis of response pathways and with computational modeling of activation of control networks. Discrete cellular states are expected as a function of exposure concentration and duration. These cellular states include normal functioning state, adaptive and stressed states at mild to intermediate exposures, and overt toxicity in the presence of an overwhelming concentration of stressors. These transitions can be used to refine default risk assessment practices that do not currently accommodate adaptive responses.",

Experience-driven adaptation requires that receptors, signal transduction pathways, transcription and translational mechanisms within neurons respond rapidly over its lifetime. Adaptive responses communicated through the rapid firing of neurons are dependent upon the integrity and function of synapses. These rapid responses via adaptation underlie the organism's ability to perceive, learn, remember, calculate and plan. Glutamate, the endogenous neurotransmitter required for physiological excitation in the brain, is critically involved in neuronal adaptive responses and in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Using neuronal experimental systems, we will discuss how compounds with low dose effects mediated via glutamate receptors can result either in a neuroprotective or neurotoxic response. Because the brain has evolved to respond rapidly to environmental cues, exposure of neurons to stressful stimuli can result in a pivotal response toward either synaptic adaptation or dysfunction and neuronal cell death. Understanding how neurons adapt to stressful stimuli will provide important clues toward the development of strategies to protect the brain against neurodegeneration.",

It has been an intriguing subject of researches covering a broad range of biological and medical disciplines, in which the underlying significance and molecular mechanisms are under intensive investigation. In the present study, we demonstrated that topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT), a potent anticancer agent, induced an obvious hormetic response in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Camptothecin inhibited PC12 cell growth at relative high doses as generally acknowledged while stimulated the cell growth by as much as 39% at low doses. Moreover, low doses of CPT protected the cells from hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2)-induced cell death. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathways were reported playing pivotal roles in protecting cells from oxidative stress. We observed that these 2 pathways were upre-gulated by low doses of CPT, as evidenced by increased levels of phosphorylated PI3K, phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin, Nrf2, and HO-1; and abolishment of the growth-promoting and neuroprotective effects of CPT by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. These results suggest that the hormetic and neuroprotective effects of CPT at low doses on PC12 cells were attributable, at least partially, to upregulated PI3K/Akt and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways.",

        "abstract": "The hypothesis of hormesis - that substances that harm health at high exposures can reduce risks below background at low exposures, e.g., if they activate defenses without overwhelming them - becomes important for practical policy making if it holds for regulated substances. Recently, the U.S. EPA concluded that reductions in ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in air caused trillions of dollars worth of human health benefits for a compliance cost of only about $65 billion per year. This conclusion depends on an unverified assumption of a positive, causal, straight-line relation between PM2.5 concentrations and mortality risks. We review empirical data on PM2.5 and mortality risks (and their precursors, inflammatory responses) and conclude that the PM2.5 concentration-response relation may be J-shaped, rather than linear. This possibility implies that the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment may well have produced no (or negative) human health benefits, rather than the trillions of dollars worth of reduced mortalities ascribed to it by EPA; and that attempts to achieve further risk-reduction benefits by further reducing PM2.5 concentrations may be counterproductive. This creates a very high value for scientific information that better reveals the true shape of the PM2.5 concentration-response function at and below current ambient levels.",

Nature selected and preserved those organisms and triggers that promote tolerance to stress. The induced tolerance can serve to resist that challenge and can repair previous age, disease, and trauma damage as well to provide a more youthful response to other stresses. The associated physiological conditioning may include youthful restoration of DNA repair, resistance to oxidizing pollutants, protein structure and function repair, improved immunity, tissue remodeling, adjustments in central and peripheral nervous systems, and altered metabolism. By elucidating common pathways activated by hormetic agent's mimetics, new strategies for intervention in aging, disease, and trauma emerge. Intervention potential in cancer, diabetes, age-related diseases, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and Alzheimer's disease are possible. Some hormetic mimetics exist in pathways in primitive organisms and are active or latent in humans. Peptides, oligonucleotides, and hormones are among the mimetics that activate latent resistance to radiation, physical endurance, strength, and immunity to physiological condition tolerance to stress. Co-activators may be required for expression of the desired physiological conditioning health and rejuvenation benefits.",

Previous analyses have shown that the responses below the toxic threshold were stimulatory and poorly predicted by a threshold dose-response model, while better explained by a hormetic dose-response model. We determined the quantitative features of the hormetic concentration-responses (n = 4,548) using previously published entry and evaluative criteria. The quantitative features that are described are: (1) the width of the concentration range showing stimulation above 10% of the control (mean of 5-fold), (2) the maximum stimulation of the concentration-responses (mean of 27% above the control), and (3) the width from the maximum stimulation to the toxicological threshold (mean of 3.7-fold). These results show that 52.5% of the 2,189 chemicals evaluated display hormetic concentration-responses in at least one of the 13 yeast strains. Many chemicals showed hormesis in multiple strains, and 24 agents showed hormesis in all 13 strains.

It describes the background for this fear and evidence in the first UNSCEAR report of a reduction in leukemia of the Hiroshima survivors in the low dose zone. The data are plotted and dose-response models are drawn. While UNSCEAR suggested the extra leukemia incidence is proportional to radiation dose, the data are consistent with a hormetic J-shape and a threshold at about 100 rem (1 Sv). UNSCEAR data on lifespan reduction of mammals exposed continuously to gamma rays indicate a 2 gray/year threshold. This contradicts the conceptual basis for radiation protection and risk determination established in 1956-58. In this paper, beneficial effects and thresholds for harmful effects are discussed, and the biological mechanism is explained. The key point: the rate of DNA damage (double-strand breaks) caused by background radiation is 1000 times less than the endogenous (spontaneous) rate. It is the effect of radiation on an organism's very powerful adaptive protection systems that determines the dose-response characteristic. Low radiation up-regulates the protection systems, while high radiation impairs these systems. The remedy for radiation fear is to expose and discard the politicized science.",

We show that cytotoxicity dose-response relationships for bone marrow cells and splenocytes are complex, involving negative curvature (decreasing slope as dose increases), presumably implicating a mixed cell population comprised of large numbers of hypersensitive, modestly radiosensitive, and resistant cells. The radiosensitive cells appear to respond with 50% being killed by a dose < 0.5 Gy. The X-ray relative biological effectiveness (RBE), relative to gamma rays, for destroying bone marrow cells in vivo is > 1, while for destroying splenocytes it is < 1. In contrast, dose-response relationships for reconstitution deficits in the bone marrow and spleen of C.B-17 mice at 6 weeks after radiation exposure were of the threshold type with gamma rays being more effective in causing reconstitution deficit.",

Autopsy studies have shown that the presence of cancer cells is not a decisive factor in the occurrence of clinical cancer. On the other hand, suppression of immune system more than doubles the cancer risk in organ transplant patients, indicating its key role in keeping occult cancers in check. Low dose radiation (LDR) elevates immune response, and so it may reduce rather than increase the risk of cancer. LNT model pays exclusive attention to DNA damage, which is not a decisive factor, and completely ignores immune system response, which is an important factor, and so is not scientifically justifiable. By not recognizing the importance of the immune system in cancer, and not exploring exercise intervention, the current paradigm may have missed an opportunity to reduce cancer deaths among atomic bomb survivors. Increased antioxidants from LDR may reduce aging-related non-cancer diseases since oxidative damage is implicated in these. A paradigm shift is warranted to reduce further casualties, reduce fear of LDR, and enable investigation of potential beneficial applications of LDR.",

However, the nonmonotonic dose-response dependences (hormesis and paradoxical effects) of these indices are insufficiently explored following exposure to different pollutants. In this experiment, we studied nonmonotonic changes in ChCar, LP, GP in wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum L.) upon exposure to lead, cadmium, copper, manganese, formaldehyde, the herbicide glyphosate, and sodium chloride in a wide range from sublethal concentration to 10(2)-10(5) times lower concentrations. 85.7% of dose-response dependences were nonmonotonic (of these, 5.5% were hormesis and paradoxical effects comprised 94.5%). Multiphasic dependences were the most widespread type of paradoxical effect. Hormesis was a part of some multiphasic responses (i.e. paradoxical effects), which indicates a relationship between these phenomena. Sublethal pollutant concentrations significantly increased LP (to 2.0-2.4 times, except for manganese and glyphosate) and decreased GP (to 2.1-36.6 times, except for glyphosate), while ChCar was reduced insignificantly, normalized or even increased. Lower pollutant concentrations caused a moderate deviation in all parameters from the control (not more than 62%) for hormesis and paradoxical effects. The seedling parameters could have different types of nonmonotonic responses upon exposure to the same pollutant.",

Recent work has focused on understanding the effects of anti-angiogenic agents on tumor biology and has revealed a number of new findings that may help to explain the limited efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors. Herein, I review the evidence that hormetic dose-responses (i.e. bell-shaped and U-shaped dose-response curves) are often observed with anti-angiogenic agents. Agents reported to exhibit these types of dose-response include: 5-fluorouracil, ATN-161, bortezomib, cisplatin, endostatin, enterostatin, integrin inhibitors, interferon-\u03b1, plasminogen activator-1 (PAI-1), rapamycin, rosiglitazone, statins, thrombospondin-1, TGF-\u03b11 and TGF-\u03b13. Hormesis may also be relevant for drugs that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathway and for metronomic chemotherapy. Here I argue that hormetic dose-responses present a challenge for the clinical translation of several anti-angiogenic agents and discuss how these problems might be circumvented.",

However, in order to address these aims it was important to, first, assess whether the test of delayed self-recognition (DSR) is a valid measure for the development of the TES, and, second, to propose and evaluate a theoretical model that describes what factors influence the development of the TES. The validity of the DSR test was verified by comparing the performance of 57 children on the DSR test to their performance on a meta-representational task (modified false belief task) and to a task that was essentially the same as the DSR test but was specifically designed to rely on the capacity to entertain secondary representations (i.e., surprise body task). Longitudinal testing of the children showed that at the mental age (MA) of 2.5 years they failed the DSR test, despite training them to understand the intended functions of the medium used in the DSR test; whereas, with training, children at the MA of 3.0 and 3.5 years exhibited DSR. Children at the MA of 4 years exhibited DSR without any training. Finally, results suggest that children's meta-representational ability was the only factor that contributed to the prediction of successful performance on the DSR test, and thus to the emergence of the TES. Furthermore, prospective longitudinal data revealed that caregiver conversational style was the only factor that contributed to the prediction of level of training required to pass the DSR test. That is, children of low-elaborative caregivers required significantly more training to pass the DSR test than children of high-elaborative caregivers, indicating that children who received more elaborative conversational input from their caregivers had a more advanced understanding of their TES.",

The new model is tested on two data sets that show a reduction of the transformation frequency below the spontaneous level after exposure of the human hybrid cell line CGL1 to low doses of \u03b3-radiation. Stronger protective effects are visible in the data for delayed plating while the data for immediate plating show more of an LNT- like dose-response curve. It is shown that the model can describe both data sets. The cal- culation of the time-dependent numerical solution of the model also allows to obtain information about the time-dependence of the protective apoptosis-mediated process after low dose exposures. These findings are compared with experimental observations after high dose exposures.",

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) shoaling was studied in adult fish exposed to one of five different EtOH concentrations (v/v): 0.0% control, 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0%. Digital photographs of groups of four fish were taken every 2 min, with each trial lasting a total of 12 min. The median nearest neighbor distance and shoal area were calculated for each photograph. Exposure to 1.0% EtOH inhibited shoaling. In contrast, as predicted from hormesis, shoaling was significantly tighter (as measured by nearest neighbor distance) at low concentrations (0.125%, 0.25%) compared to the control, and a J-shaped dose-response curve was present. A similar pattern occurred for shoal area, but in this case the only statistically significant differences were between the high concentration and all others.",

The growth stimulation at low PPT concentrations is a result of activation of chloroplastic isoform GS2, while the growth suppression is caused by inhibition of both cytosolic GS1 and GS2 at higher PPT concentrations. Since the results are obtained in cell-free system (e.g. protein extracts), to which the principles of homeostasis are not applicable, this PPT effect is an unambiguous example of direct stimulation hormesis. A detailed molecular mechanism of concentration-dependent interaction of both PPT and a related GS inhibitor, methionine sulfoximine, with GS holoenzymes is proposed.

In this article, we report a simple prediction framework based on the genome-wide and quantitative profiling of cellular responses to individual drugs. By exploring the differential expression profiles, our correlation-based strategy can reveal the synergistic effects of drug combinations. The comparison with gold-standard experimental results demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses in relation to prediction based only on cellular response to individual drugs. Specifically, the prediction strategy may work for a drug combination whose individual drugs show related transcriptomic mechanisms but not for others.",

As toxicology usually tests at higher levels than the populace routinely is exposed to, it reverts to mostly linear extrapolative models that express the risks of exposure, irrespective of dosages, only. However, as we will explicate in two examples, depending on dosages, it is less easy to separate risks and benefits than current toxicological research and regulatory efforts suggest. The same chemical compound, in the final analysis, is represented within the boundaries of both amplitudes, that is, show a biphasic, hormetic, dose-response. This is notable, as low-level exposures from the food-matrix are progressively more under scrutiny as a result of increasing analytical capabilities. Presence of low-level concentrations of a chemical in food is a regulatory proxy for human health, but in light of this hormetic dose-response objectionable. Moreover, given that an ecological threshold probably holds for most, if not all, man-made (bio)organic chemicals, these will be found to be naturally present in the food matrix. Both aspects require toxicology to close the gap between reductionist models and its extrapolative deficiencies and real-life scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Research is being conducted world-wide related to chemoprevention of future lung cancer among smokers. The fact that low doses and dose rates of some sparsely ionizing forms of radiation (e.g., x rays, gamma rays, and beta radiation) stimulate transient natural chemical and biological protection against cancer in high-risk individuals is little known. The cancer preventative properties relate to radiation adaptive response (radiation hormesis) and involve stimulated protective biological signaling (a mild stress response). The biological processes associated with the protective signaling are now better understood and include: increased availability of efficient DNA double-strand break repair (p53-related and in competition with normal apoptosis), stimulated auxiliary apoptosis of aberrant cells (presumed p53-independent), and stimulated protective immune functions. This system of low-dose radiation activated natural protection (ANP) requires an individual-specific threshold level of mild stress and when invoked can efficiently prevent the occurrence of cancers as well as other genomic-instability-associated diseases. In this paper, low, essentially harmless doses of gamma rays spread over an extended period are shown via use of a biological-based, hormetic relative risk (HRR) model to be highly efficient in preventing lung cancer induction by alpha radiation from inhaled plutonium.",

With the LNT model even a very small dose could cause cancer and the model is used in establishing guidelines for limiting radiation exposure of humans. A slope change at low doses and dose rates is implemented using an empirical dose and dose rate effectiveness factor (DDREF). This imposes usually unacknowledged nonlinearity but not a threshold in the dose-response curve for cancer induction. In contrast, with the hormetic model, low doses of radiation reduce the cancer incidence while it is elevated after high doses. Based on a review of epidemiological and other data for exposure to low radiation doses and dose rates, it was found that the LNT model fails badly. Cancer risk after ordinarily encountered radiation exposure (medical X-rays, natural background radiation, etc.) is much lower than projections based on the LNT model and is often less than the risk for spontaneous cancer (a hormetic response). Understanding the mechanistic basis for hormetic responses will provide new insights about both risks and benefits from low-dose radiation exposure.",

The focus is on the engineered insoluble MENAP which represent a significant breakthrough in the design and development of new products for consumers, industry, and medicine. Increased production is rapidly occurring and may cause currently unrecognized health effects (e.g., nervous system dysfunction, heart disease, cancer); thus, dose-response models for MENAP-induced biological effects are needed to facilitate health risk assessment. The stochasticthresholdmicrodose (STM) model presented introduces novel stochastic microdose metrics for use in constructing dose-response relationships for the frequency of specific cellular (e.g., cell killing, mutations, neoplastic transformation) or subcellular (e.g., mitochondria dysfunction) effects. A key metric is the exposure-time-dependent, specific burden (MENAP count) for a given critical target (e.g., mitochondria, nucleus). Exceeding a stochastic threshold specific burden triggers cell death. For critical targets in the cytoplasm, the autophagic mode of death is triggered. For the nuclear target, the apoptotic mode of death is triggered. Overall cell survival is evaluated for the indicated competing modes of death when both apply. The STM model can be applied to cytotoxicity data using Bayesian methods implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo.",

Health benefit or damage can be induced as a consequence of an adaptive cellular stress response. A consequence of hormetic amplification is an increase in the homeodynamic space of a living system in terms of an increased defense capacity and a reduced load of damaged macromolecules. Ozone, when used at appropriate doses, promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides allows them to become late and long-lasting messengers. Healthy aging may be achieved by hormesis through mild and periodic, but not severe or chronic, physical and mental challenges, and by the use of nutritional hormesis incorporating mild stress-inducing molecules called hormetins. The paradoxical concept that ozone eventually induces an antioxidant response capable of reversing a chronic oxidative stress is common in the animal and vegetal kingdom; it is already supported by findings of an increased level of antioxidant enzymes during ozone therapy. Those facts can include ozone as a hormetin. The established scientific foundations of hormesis are ready to pave the way for new and effective approaches in redox-related disease research and intervention; ozone therapy can be a good candidate.",

The radius of irradiated areas differs by a factor of 2, and the non-irradiated areas were optimally designed to have the same number of cells. Our results show evidence for bystander effects occurring in cells far away from the irradiated ones, meaning that bystander signals can easily spread throughout the cell culture. Additionally, our study highlights that the damage caused by radiation on the surrounding of irradiated areas could be different according to the number of irradiated cells, i.e., for the same dose value; the overall cellular damage could be different.",

These contradictory conclusions may stem in part from an emphasis on epidemiological data (a \"top down\" approach) versus an emphasis on biological mechanisms (a \"bottom up\" approach). In this paper, the strengths and limitations of the top down and bottom up approaches are discussed, and proposals for strengthening and reconciling them are suggested. The past seven years since these two reports were published have yielded increasing evidence of nonlinear responses of biological systems to low radiation doses delivered at low dose-rates. This growing body of evidence is casting ever more doubt on the extrapolation of risks observed at high doses and dose-rates to estimate risks associated with typical environmental and occupational exposures. This paper compares current evidence on low dose, low dose-rate effects against objective criteria of causation. Finally, some questions for a post-LNT world are posed.",

Regulatory law should not crowd out the actual beneficial effects from low dose exposures-when demonstrable-that are inevitably lost when it adopts the linear non-threshold (LNT) as its causal model. Because regulating exposures requires planning and developing protective measures for future acute and chronic exposures, public management decisions should be based on minimizing costs and harmful exposures. We address the direct and indirect effects of causation when the danger consists of exposure to very low levels of carcinogens and toxicants. The societal consequences of a policy can be deleterious when that policy is based on a risk assumed by the LNT, in cases where low exposures are actually beneficial. Our work develops the science and the law of causal risk modeling: both are interwoven. We suggest how their relevant characteristics differ, but do not attempt to keep them separated; as we demonstrate, this union, however unsatisfactory, cannot be severed.",

Nevertheless, relatively little attention has been given to assessment of conditioning's dose-response characteristics. Specifically, the consequences of multiple conditioning episodes, what we will term \"hyperconditioning\", have seldom been examined. We propose that hyperconditioning warrants investigation because it; (1) may be of clinical importance, (2) could provide insight into conditioning mechanisms, and (3) might result in development of novel models of human disease. The prevalence of angina pectoris and intermittent claudication is sufficiently high and the potential for daily ischemia-reperfu-sion episodes sufficiently large that hyperconditioning is a clinically relevant phenomenon. In basic science, attenuation of conditioning-mediated infarct size reduction found in some studies after hyperconditioning offers a possible means to facilitate further discernment of cardioprotective signaling pathways. Moreover, hyperconditioning's impact extends beyond cytoprotection to tissue structural elements. Several studies demonstrate that hyperconditioning produces collagen injury (primarily fiber breakage). Such structural impairment could have adverse clinical consequences; however, in laboratory studies, selective collagen damage could provide the basis for models of cardiac rupture and dilated cardiomyopathy. Accordingly, we propose that hyperconditioning represents the dark, but potentially illuminating, side of ischemic conditioning - a paradigm that merits attention and prospective evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Ionizing radiation-induced formation of genomic DNA damage can be modulated by nearby chemical species such as heavy metal ions, which can lead to non-linear dose response. To investigate this phenomenon, we studied cell survival and formation of 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OHG) base modifications and double strand breaks (DSB) caused by combined action of cadmium (Cd) and gamma radiation in cultured medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) fibroblast cells. Our data show that the introduction of Cd leads to a significant decrease in the fraction of surviving cells and to increased sensitivity of cells to ionizing radiation (IR). Cd also appears to cause non-linear increases in radiation-induced yields of 8-OHG and DSB as dose-yield plots of these lesions exhibit non-linear S-shaped curves with a sharp increase in the yields of lesions in the 10-20 microM range of Cd concentrations. The combined action of ionizing radiation and Cd leads to increased DNA damage formation compared to the effects of the individual stressors. These results are consistent with a hypothesis that the presence of Cd modulates the efficiency of DNA repair systems thus causing increases in radiation-induced DNA damage formation and decreases in cell survival.",

        "abstract": "Some recent discussions of adverse human health effects of active and passive smoking have suggested that low levels of exposure are disproportionately dangerous, so that \"The effects of even brief (minutes to hours) passive smoking are often nearly as large (averaging 80% to 90%) as chronic active smoking\" (Barnoya and Glantz, 2005). Recent epidemiological evidence (Teo et al., 2006) suggests a more linear relation. This paper reexamines the empirical relation between self-reported low levels of active smoking and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in public-domain data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Consistent with biological evidence on J-shaped and U-shaped relations between smoking-associated risk factors and CHD risks, we find that low levels of active smoking do not appear to be associated with increased CHD risk. Several methodological challenges in epidemiology may explain how model-derived estimates can predict low-dose linear or concave dose-response estimates, even if the empirical (i.e., data-based) relation does not show a clear increased risk at the lowest doses.",

        "abstract": "Various organisms (i.e., bacteria, fungi, plants and animals) within an ecosystem can synthesize and release into the environment certain longevity-extending small molecules. Here we hypothesize that these interspecies chemical signals can create xenohormetic, hormetic and cytostatic selective forces driving the ecosystemic evolution of longevity regulation mechanisms. In our hypothesis, following their release into the environment by one species of the organisms composing an ecosystem, such small molecules can activate anti-aging processes and/or inhibit pro-aging processes in other species within the ecosystem. The organisms that possess the most effective (as compared to their counterparts of the same species) mechanisms for sensing the chemical signals produced and released by other species and for responding to such signals by undergoing certain hormetic and/or cytostatic life-extending changes to their metabolism and physiology are expected to live longer then their counterparts within the ecosystem. Thus, the ability of a species of the organisms composing an ecosystem to undergo life-extending metabolic or physiological changes in response to hormetic or cytostatic chemical compounds released to the ecosystem by other species: 1) increases its chances of survival; 2) creates selective forces aimed at maintaining such ability; and 3) enables the evolution of longevity regulation mechanisms.",

Its occurrence has been documented across a broad range of biological models and diverse type of exposure. Since hormesis appears to be a relatively common phenomenon in many areas, the objective of this review is to explore its occurrence related to dermatology and its public health and risk assessment implication. Hormesis appears to be a common phenomenon in in-vitro skin biology. However, in vivo data are lacking and the clinical relevance of hormesis has yet to be determined. Better understanding of this phenomenon will likely lead to different strategies for risk assessment process employed in the fields of dermatologic toxicology and pharmacology. We believe that hormesis is a common phenomenon and should be given detailed consideration to its concept and its risk assessment implications, and how these may be incorporated into the experimental and regulatory processes in dermatology. The skin, with its unique characteristics, its accessibility, and the availability of non-invasive bioengineering and DNA microarray technology, will be a good candidate to extend the biology of hormesis.",

Biphasic responses on cellular stress responses in myotube cultures were investigated by exposing them to various concentrations of falcarinol and falcarindiol for 24 h before testing effects of 100 microM H(2)O(2) on the intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), transcription of the antioxidative enzyme cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (cGPx), and the heat shock proteins (HSP) HSP70 and HO1. At low concentrations (1.6 to 25 microM) polyacetylenes caused a slightly accelerated intra-cellular ROS formation, increased cGPx transcription and decreased HSP70 and HO1 transcription. The increased cGPx transcription may be interpreted as an adaptive response to the increased ROS formation and may have caused a reduced demand for the protective functions of the HSPs. ROS formation, however, was substantially decreased after pre-incubation with both polyacetylenes at 50 and 100 microM, the cGPx transcription was reduced and the HSP70 and HO1 transcription increased, indicating a need for the protective and repairing functions of the HSPs. In conclusion, pre-incubation with low concentrations of both polyacetylenes prior to H(2)O(2) exposure induced a cytoprotective effect whereas higher concentrations had adverse effects.",

        "abstract": "Whole-body exposure to large radiation doses can cause severe loss of hematopoietic tissue cells and threaten life if the lost cells are not replaced in a timely manner through natural repopulation (a homeostatic mechanism). Repopulation to the baseline level N 0 is called reconstitution and a reconstitution deficit (repopulation shortfall) can occur in a dose-related and organ-specific manner. Scott et al. (2013) previously introduced a deterministic version of a threshold exponential (TE) model of tissue-reconstitution deficit at a given follow-up time that was applied to bone marrow and spleen cellularity (number of constituent cells) data obtained 6 weeks after whole-body gamma-ray exposure of female C.B-17 mice. In this paper a more realistic, stochastic version of the TE model is provided that allows radiation response to vary between different individuals. The Stochastic TE model is applied to post gamma-ray-exposure cellularity data previously reported and also to more limited X-ray cellularity data for whole-body irradiated female C.B-17 mice. Results indicate that the population average threshold for a tissue reconstitution deficit appears to be similar for bone marrow and spleen and for 320-kV-spectrum X-rays and Cs-137 gamma rays. This means that 320-kV spectrum X-rays could successfully be used in conducting such studies.",

This study compares cellular effects modelled for low absorbed doses against high absorbed doses. The authors hypothesized that low and high absorbed doses would contribute to cell killing via different mechanisms, potentially impacting on targeted tumour radiotherapy outcomes. Cellular kinetics following irradiation with selective low- and high-linear energy transfer (LET) particles were investigated using the Virtual Cell (VC) radiobiology algorithm. Two different cell types were assessed using the VC radiobiology algorithm: human fibroblasts and human crypt cells. The results showed that at lower doses (0.01 to 0.2 Gy), all radiation sources used were equally able to induce cell death (p>0.05, ANOVA). On the other hand, at higher doses (1.0 to 8.0 Gy), the radiation response was LET and dose dependent (p<0.05, ANOVA). The data obtained suggests that the computational methods used might provide some insight into the cellular effects following irradiation. The results also suggest that it may be necessary to re-evaluate cellular radiation-induced effects, particularly at low doses that could affect therapeutic effectiveness.",

Bladder explants established from these mice were incubated in culture medium, which was used to measure death responses in a keratinocyte reporter system. The study revealed that the medium harvested from bladder tissues' (ITCM) from acutely irradiated C57BL6 but not Balb/c mice, was able to induce clonogenic death. Administration of a priming dose(s) before a challenge dose to both C57BL6 and Balb/c mice stimulated reporter cell survival irrespective of the time interval between dose(s) delivery. When ITCM corresponding to both strains of mice was measured for its calcium mobilization inducing ability, results showed an elevation in intracellular calcium levels that was strain dependent. This indicates that genotype determined the type of bystander signal/response that was produced after exposure to low and acute doses of radiation.

        "abstract": "Our work in dogs has revealed a U-shaped dose response between selenium status and prostatic DNA damage that remarkably parallels the relationship between dietary selenium and prostate cancer risk in men, suggesting that more selenium is not necessarily better. Herein, we extend this canine work to show that the selenium dose that minimizes prostatic DNA damage also maximizes apoptosis-a cancer-suppressing death switch used by prostatic epithelial cells. These provocative findings suggest a new line of thinking about how selenium can reduce cancer risk. Mid-range selenium status (.67-.92 ppm in toenails) favors a process we call \"homeostatic housecleaning\"-an upregulated apoptosis that preferentially purges damaged prostatic cells. Also, the U-shaped relationship provides valuable insight into stratifying individuals as selenium-responsive or selenium-refractory, based upon the likelihood of reducing their cancer risk by additional selenium. By studying elderly dogs, the only non-human animal model of spontaneous prostate cancer, we have established a robust experimental approach bridging the gap between laboratory and human studies that can help to define the optimal doses of cancer preventives for large-scale human trials. Moreover, our observations bring much needed clarity to the null results of the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) and set a new research priority: testing whether men with low, suboptimal selenium levels less than 0.8 ppm in toenails can achieve cancer risk reduction through daily supplementation.",

Mild stress-induced hormesis can be an effective way for reducing the accumulation of molecular damage, and thus slowing down aging from within. We have shown that repeated mild heat stress (RMHS) has anti-aging effects on growth and various other cellular and biochemical characteristics of normal human skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes undergoing aging in vitro. RMHS given to human cells increased the basal levels of various chaperones, reduced the accumulation of damaged proteins, stimulated proteasomal activities, increased the cellular resistance to other stresses, enhanced the levels of various antioxidant enzymes, enhanced the activity and amounts of sodium-potassium pump, and increased the phosphorylation-mediated activities of various stress kinases. We have now observed novel hormetic effects of mild heat stress on improving the wound healing capacity of skin fibroblasts and on enhancing the angiogenic ability of endothelial cells. We have also tested potential hormetins, such as curcumin and rosmarinic acid in bringing about their beneficial effects in human cells by inducing stress response pathways involving heat shock proteins and hemeoxygenase HO-1. These data further support the view that mild stress-induced hormesis can be applied for the modulation, intervention and prevention of aging and age-related impairments.",

In this context, the aim of this work was to employ Flow Cytometry (FC) for simultaneously assessing of p53 protein expression levels together with cellular proliferation rate of irradiated human lymphocytes. From in vitro irradiated human blood samples, mononuclear cells were isolated and labeled with Carboxylfluorescein Diacetate Succinimidyl Ester (CFSE) prior to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation in culture for 96 hours. Cells were also labeled with anti-p53 monoclonal antibody PE-conjugated in order to analyze either proliferation rate or p53 expression levels by FC. It was verified a reduction in the proliferation rate of irradiated lymphocytes and, in parallel, a rise in the p53 expression levels, similar for quiescent and proliferating lymphocytes. The results emphasize the importance of the use of CFSE-stained lymphocytes in assays associated to proliferation rate and the use of this methodology in several studies, such as for evaluating individual radiosensitivity.",

We previously conducted a hypothesis-based weight-of-evidence analysis and found that a proposed causal association between chlorpyrifos exposure and neurodevelopmental effects in the absence of AChE inhibition does not have a substantial basis in existing animal or in vitro studies, and there is no plausible basis for invoking such effects in humans at their far lower exposure levels. The epidemiology studies fail to show consistent patterns; the few associations are likely attributable to alternative explanations. Human data are inappropriate for a dose-response assessment because biomarkers were only measured at one time point, may reflect exposure to other pesticides, and many values are at or below limits of quantification. When considered with pharmacokinetic data, however, these biomarkers provide information on exposure levels relative to those in experimental studies and indicate a margin of exposure of at least 1,000. Because animal data take into account the most sensitive lifestages, the use of AChE inhibition as a regulatory endpoint is protective of adverse effects in sensitive populations.",

A variety of applications for hormesis in risk assessment processes, anti-ageing strategies and clinical therapies have been proposed. The molecular mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of hormesis, however, are not yet fully understood. A possible mechanism that has been proposed for hormesis, the homoeostasis overshoot hypothesis, assumes that an overshoot of repair- and self-recovery mechanisms in response to mild damage can be held responsible for the beneficial effects of hormesis. The present paper proposes 'cellular quality control' as a further explanation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the benefits observed after exposure to mild stress. The most important quality control mechanisms are outlined and their known and hypothesised actions in hormesis are discussed. As an example, different aspects of protein quality control will be described in more detail, which includes the reaction of the cell upon stress-induced protein damage and -aggregation. The regulation of Heat Shock Proteins and components from the ubiquitin proteasome system as part of cellular quality control is described in relation to its beneficial role in hormesis.",

        "abstract": "There is considerable interest in revisiting LNT theory as the basis for the system of radiation protection in the US and worldwide. Arguing the scientific merits of policy options is not likely to be fruitful because the science is not robust enough to support one theory to the exclusion of others. Current science cannot determine the existence of a dose threshold, a key piece to resolving the matter scientifically. The nature of the scientific evidence is such that risk assessment at small effective doses (defined as <100 mSv) is highly uncertain, and several policy alternatives, including threshold and non-linear dose-response functions, are scientifically defensible. This paper argues for an alternative approach by looking at the LNT debate as a policy question and analyzes the problem from a social and economic perspective. In other words, risk assessment and a strictly scientific perspective are insufficiently broad enough to resolve the issue completely. A wider perspective encompassing social and economic impacts in a risk management context is necessary, but moving the debate to the policy and risk management arena necessarily marginalizes the role of scientists.",

However, these thresholds for protection are not a fixed function of total dose, but also vary with dose rate, additional radiation or non-radiation stressors, tissue type and p53 functional status.

There have been very few studies where these fields overlap, thus it is not possible to ascertain whether common or distinct mechanisms underlie both phenomena but this is certainly an interesting question and relevant to our understanding of high and low dose radiobiology. This paper presents data for three human cell lines with varying p53 status and radiation responses, treated at a range of times between first and second dose and for 3 different first doses (0.1, 0.5 and 2Gy). The data show that time between doses is critical. Protective (adaptive) effects were seen in each cell line but most prominently in the malignant HT 29 cell line. Surprisingly none of the cell lines showed pronounced split dose recovery. This suggests different mechanisms may underlie the two phenomena.",

        "abstract": "Non-monotonic dose response curves (NMDRCs) have been demonstrated for natural hormones and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in a variety of biological systems including cultured cells, whole organ cultures, laboratory animals and human populations. The mechanisms responsible for these NMDRCs are well known, typically related to the interactions between the ligand (hormone or EDC) and a hormone receptor. Although there are hundreds of examples of NMDRCs in the EDC literature, there are claims that they are not 'common enough' to influence the use of high-to-low dose extrapolations in risk assessments. Here, we chose bisphenol A (BPA), a well-studied EDC, to assess the frequency of non-monotonic responses. Our results indicate that NMDRCs are common in the BPA literature, occurring in greater than 20% of all experiments and in at least one endpoint in more than 30% of all studies we examined. We also analyzed the types of endpoints that produce NMDRCs in vitro and factors related to study design that influence the ability to detect these kinds of responses. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for NMDRCs in the EDC literature, specifically for BPA, and question the current risk assessment practice where 'safe' low doses are predicted from high dose exposures.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic oleanane triterpenoids are multifunctional drugs being developed for the prevention and treatment of a variety of chronic diseases driven by inflammation and oxidative stress. Low nanomolar concentrations of triterpenoids inhibit the induction of inflammatory cytokines, and these drugs are potent activators of the Nrf2 cytoprotective pathway. In contrast, low micromolar concentrations of triterpenoids increased the production of ROS and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in malignant MCF10 CA1a breast cancer cells. Because cancer cells respond differently to ROS than normal cells, it should be possible to exploit these differences therapeutically. In an experimental model of lung cancer, the triterpenoids activated the Nrf2 pathway, as seen by induction of the cytoprotective enzyme NQO1, and reduced the toxicity of carboplatin and paclitaxel. The induction of the Nrf2 pathway in the lung did not suppress the efficacy of treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel, as the average tumor burden in the group treated with the combination of CDDO-Me and carboplatin/paclitaxel decreased by 90% (P < 0.05 vs. the controls and both single treatment groups). Understanding the dose response of triterpenoids and related drugs will help provide the proper context for optimizing their potential clinical utility.",

At the same time, low toxicant doses of metal salts have been observed to inhibit the growth of the most vigorous seedlings of a population in vitro, although mean plant size has remained unaffected. We hypothesized that this kind of selective low-dose toxicity is not restricted to inorganic contaminants. We exposed annual plants (baby's breath Gypsophila elegans, purslane Portulaca oleracea, and duckweed Lemna minor) to 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta-\u03b3-2-benzopyran (HHCB) and 4-tert-octylphenol and lead acetate. As compared to unexposed G. elegans roots, 4-tert-octylphenol did not affect the mean root size of all seedlings, but it reduced the average length of roots longer than the 98(th) percentile. A comparable response was found in case of G. elegans roots treated with lead acetate beyond the 90(th) percentile. The average size of roots beyond the 90(th) percentile was decreased also when L. minor was exposed to lead acetate though the means of all roots were constant. P. oleracea seemed to be insensitive to selective toxicity. We conclude that selective toxicity at low doses should be considered in parallel with hormesis.",

The damage caused by surgery, heart attack, or stroke can be mitigated by pre-treating the local or distant tissue with low levels of a stress-inducing stimulus, that can induce a protective response against subsequent major damage. Low-level laser (light) therapy (LLLT) has been used for nearly 50 years to enhance tissue healing and to relieve pain, inflammation and swelling. The photons are absorbed in cytochrome(c) oxidase (unit four in the mitochondrial respiratory chain), and this enzyme activation increases electron transport, respiration, oxygen consumption and ATP production. A complex signaling cascade is initiated leading to activation of transcription factors and up- and down-regulation of numerous genes. Recently it has become apparent that LLLT can also be effective if delivered to normal cells or tissue before the actual insult or trauma, in a pre-conditioning mode. Muscles are protected, nerves feel less pain, and LLLT can protect against a subsequent heart attack. These examples point the way to wider use of LLLT as a pre-conditioning modality to prevent pain and increase healing after surgical/medical procedures and possibly to increase athletic performance.",

        "abstract": "Environmental risk assessment is an essential step in the development of solutions for pollution problems and new environmental regulations. An assessment system for environmental risks has been developed in China in recent decades. However, many of the Chinese technical guidelines, standards, and regulations were directly adapted from those of developed countries, and were not based on the Chinese environmental and socioeconomic context. Although existing environmental regulations for pollutants are usually obtained by extrapolations from high-dose toxicological data to low-dose scenarios using linear-non-threshold (LNT) models, toxicologists have argued that J-shaped or inverse Jshaped curves may dominate the dose-response relationships for environmental pollutants at low doses because low exposures stimulate biological protective mechanisms that are ineffective at higher doses. The costs of regulations based on LNT and J-shaped models could therefore be dramatically different. Since economic factors strongly affect the decision-making process, particularly for developing countries, it is time to strengthen basic research to provide more scientific support for Chinese environmental regulations. In this paper, we summarize current Chinese environmental policies and standards and the application of environmental risk assessment in China, and recommend a more scientific approach to the development of Chinese regulations. \u00a9 2012 University of Massachusetts.",

        "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated as a potential modulator of the bystander effect in cell cultures. To assess the relevance of serotonin in vivo experiments were done with the zebrafish (Danio rerio). This species, when irradiated, transmits bystander signals to non-irradiated fish. The animals were injected with reserpine, an inhibitor of serotonin at a dose of 80mg/kg of body mass. The results show that reserpine treated fish had only 27% of the serotonin in non-treated fish. Skin tissue samples were collected from the fish and assayed for bystander signal production using a reporter bioassay. Reserpine prevented the production and communication of signals between fish. Intracellular calcium flux, identified as a bystander response in the reporter cells confirmed this. Medium harvested from tissues of X-rayed fish and their bystanders, showed an oscillating pattern of calcium flux. Samples from X-rayed fish pretreated with reserpine produced a chaotic pattern of random fluctuations in the reporter cells, while their bystander fish led to increased calcium, but no oscillations. These results suggest that 5-HT is involved in bystander signalling in zebrafish, and by decreasing the amount of available 5-HT the bystander effect can be blocked.",

Nanoparticles (NPs, e.g., 1-100 nm diameter) are small forms of natural or manufactured source material whose properties differ markedly from those of the respective bulk forms of the \"same\" material. Certain NPs have diagnostic and therapeutic uses; some NPs exhibit low-dose toxicity; other NPs show ability to stimulate low-dose adaptive responses (hormesis). Beyond dose, size, shape, and surface charge variations of NPs evoke nonlinear responses in complex adaptive systems. NPs acquire unique size-dependent biological, chemical, thermal, optical, electromagnetic, and atom-like quantum properties. Nanoparticles exhibit high surface adsorptive capacity for other substances, enhanced bioavailability, and ability to cross otherwise impermeable cell membranes including the blood-brain barrier. With super-potent effects, nano-forms can evoke cellular stress responses or therapeutic effects not only at lower doses than their bulk forms, but also for longer periods of time. Interactions of initial effects and compensatory systemic responses can alter the impact of NPs over time. Taken together, the data suggest the need to downshift the dose-response curve of NPs from that for bulk forms in order to identify the necessarily decreased no-observed-adverse-effect-level and hormetic dose range for nanoparticles.",

Significantly increased lung cancer risk from ionizing radiation at lung doses < 1 Gy is not observed in never smokers exposed to ionizing radiations.

The risk of lung cancer found in many epidemiological studies was less than the expected risk (hormetic effect) for nuclear weapons and power plant workers, shipyard workers, fluoroscopy patients, and inhabitants of high-dose background radiation. The protective effect was noted for low- and mixed high- and low-linear energy transfer (LET) radiations in both genders. Many studies showed a protection factor (PROFAC) > 0.40 (40% avoided) against the occurrence of lung cancer. The ubiquitous nature of the radiation hormesis response in cellular, animal, and epidemio-logical studies negates the healthy worker effect as an explanation for radiation hormesis.

Based on this idea that any dose, no matter how small, will increase risk, radiation protection regulations generally attempt to reduce any exposure to \"as low as reasonably achievable\" (ALARA). We know however, that these regulatory assumptions are inconsistent with the known biological effects of low doses. Low doses induce protective effects, and these adaptive responses are part of a general response to low stress. Adaptive responses have been tightly conserved during evolution, from single celled organisms up to humans, indicating their importance. Here we examine cellular and animal studies that show the influence of radiation induced protective effects on diverse diseases, and examine the radiation dose range that is effective for different tissues in the same animal. The concept of a dose window, with upper and lower effective doses, as well as the effect of multiple stressors and the influence of genetics will also be examined. The effect of the biological variables on low dose responses will be considered from the point of view of the limitations they may impose on any revised radiation protection regulations.",

METHODS: Using the Vynckier - Wambersie dose point kernel, a model for dose rate evaluation was created allowing for calculation of absorbed dose values to two cell lines transfected with the noradrenaline transporter (NAT) gene and treated with [(131)I]MIBG. RESULTS: The mean doses required to decrease surviving fractions of UVW/NAT and EJ138/NAT cells, which received medium from [(131)I]MIBG-treated cells, to 25 - 30% were 1.6 and 1.7 Gy respectively. The maximum mean dose rates achieved during [(131)I]MIBG treatment were 0.09 - 0.75 Gy/h for UVW/NAT and 0.07 - 0.78 Gy/h for EJ138/NAT. These were significantly lower than the external beam gamma radiation dose rate of 15 Gy/h. In the case of control lines which were incapable of [(131)I]MIBG uptake the mean absorbed doses following radiopharmaceutical were 0.03 - 0.23 Gy for UVW and 0.03 - 0.32 Gy for EJ138.

The risk is hypothesized to increase linearly as the total dose increases. While this model is the basis for radiation safety regulations, its scientific validity has been questioned and debated for many decades. The recent memorandum of the International Commission on Radiological Protection admits that the LNT-model predictions at low doses are \"speculative, unproven, undetectable and 'phantom'.\" Moreover, numerous experimental, ecological, and epidemiological studies show that low doses of sparsely-ionizing or sparsely-ionizing plus highly-ionizing radiation may be beneficial to human health (hormesis/adaptive response). The present LNT-model-based regulations impose excessive costs on the society. For example, the median-cost medical program is 5000 times more cost-efficient in saving lives than controlling radiation emissions. There are also lives lost: e.g., following Fukushima accident, more than 1000 disaster-related yet non-radiogenic premature deaths were officially registered among the population evacuated due to radiation concerns. Additional negative impacts of LNT-model-inspired radiophobia include: refusal of some patients to undergo potentially life-saving medical imaging; discouragement of the study of low-dose radiation therapies; motivation for radiological terrorism and promotion of nuclear proliferation.",

GSH contents and GSH/GSSG were also significantly enhanced by rotenone at 12.5 nmol/L and decreased by rotenone at >12.5 nmol/L. Except for ROS production and SIRT1 protein expression, all concentration-response relationships showed a typical inverted-U shape.

Among the 33 studies, 9 allowed quantitative estimates of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA). Individuals who engaged in the equivalent of 150 min/week of moderate-intensity LTPA (minimum amount, 2008 US federal guidelines) had a 14% lower CHD risk (relative risk (RR) = 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77\u20130.96), compared with those reporting no LTPA. Those engaging in the equivalent of 300 min/week of moderate-intensity LTPA (2008 US federal guidelines for additional benefits) had a 20% (RR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74\u20130.88) lower risk. At higher levels of physical activity, relative risks were modestly lower. Persons who were physically active at levels lower than the minimum amount recommended also had significantly lower risk of CHD. There was a significant interaction by gender (p=0.03); the association was stronger among women than men. Conclusions\u2014 These findings provide quantitative data supporting US physical activity guidelines that stipulate \u201csome physical activity is better than none\u201d and \u201cadditional benefits occur with more physical activity\u201d",

        "title": "Human health and the biological effects of tritium in drinking water: Prudent policy through science - Addressing the ODWAC new recommendation",
        "abstract": "Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen and is a by-product of energy production in Canadian Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactors. The release of this radioisotope into the environment is carefully managed at CANDU facilities in order to minimize radiation exposure to the public. However, under some circumstances, small accidental releases to the environment can occur. The radiation doses to humans and non-human biota from these releases are low and orders of magnitude less than doses received from naturally occurring radioisotopes or from manmade activities, such as medical imaging and air travel. There is however a renewed interest in the biological consequences of low dose tritium exposures and a new limit for tritium levels in Ontario drinking water has been proposed. The Ontario Drinking Water Advisory Council (ODWAC) issued a formal report in May 2009 in response to a request by the Minister of the Environment, concluding that the Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standard for tritium should be revised from the current 7,000 Bq/L level to a new, lower 20 Bq/L level. In response to this recommendation, an international scientific symposium was held at McMaster University to address the issues surrounding this change in direction and the validity of a new policy. Scientists, regulators, government officials, and industrial stakeholders were present to discuss the potential health risks associated with low level radiation exposure from tritium. The regulatory, economic, and social implications of the new proposed limit were also considered.The new recommendation assumed a linear-no-threshold model to calculate carcinogenic risk associated with tritium exposure, and considered tritium as a non-threshold chemical carcinogen. Both of these assumptions are highly controversial given that recent research suggests that low dose exposures have thresholds below which there are no observable detrimental effects. Furthermore, mutagenic and carcinogenic risk calculated from tritium exposure at 20 Bq/L would be orders of magnitude less than that from exposure to natural background sources of radiation. The new proposed standard would set the radiation dose limit for drinking water to 0.0003 mSv/year, which is equivalent to approximately three times the dose from naturally occurring tritium in drinking water. This new standard is incongruent with national and international standards for safe levels of radiation exposure, currently set at 1 mSv/year for the general public. Scientific research from leading authorities on the carcinogenic health effects of tritium exposure supports the notion that the current standard of 7,000 Bq/L (annual dose of 0.1 mSv) is a safe standard for human health.Policy-making for the purpose of regulating tritium levels in drinking water is a dynamic multi-stage process that is influenced by more than science alone. Ethics, economics, and public perception also play important roles in policy development; however, these factors sometimes undermine the scientific evidence that should form the basis of informed decision making. Consequently, implementing a new standard without a scientific basis may lead the public to perceive that risks from tritium have been historically underestimated. It was concluded that the new recommendation is not supported by any new scientific insight regarding negative consequences of low dose effects, and may be contrary to new data on the potential benefits of low dose effects. Given the lack of cost versus benefit analysis, this type of dramatic policy change could have detrimental effects to society from an ethical, economical, and public perception perspective.",

        "abstract": "Application of hormesis in aging research and interventions is becoming increasingly attractive and successful. The reason for this is the realization that mild stress-induced activation of one or more stress response (SR) pathways, and its consequent stimulation of repair mechanisms, is effective in reducing the age-related accumulation of molecular damage. For example, repeated heat stress-induced synthesis of heat shock proteins has been shown to have a variety of anti-aging effects on growth and other cellular and biochemical characteristics of normal human skin fibroblasts, keratinocytes and endothelial cells undergoing aging in vitro. Therefore, searching for potential hormetins - conditions and compounds eliciting SR-mediated hormesis - is drawing attention of not only the researchers but also the industry involved in developing healthcare products, including nutriceuticals, functional foods and cosmeceuticals. Here we present the example of a skin care cosmetic as one of the first successful product developments incorporating the ideas of hormesis. This was based on the studies to analyse the molecular effects of active ingredients extracted from the roots of the Chinese herb Sanchi (Panax notoginseng) on gene expression at the level of mRNAs and proteins in human skin cells. The results showed that the ginsenosides extracted from Sanchi induced the transcription of stress genes and increased the synthesis of stress proteins, especially the heat shock protein HSP1A1 or Hsp70, in normal human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, this extract also has significant positive effects against facial wrinkles and other symptoms of facial skin aging as tested clinically, which may be due to its hormetic mode of action by stress-induced synthesis of chaperones involved in protein repair and removal of abnormal proteins. Acceptance of such a hormesis-based product by the wider public could be instrumental in the social recognition of the concept of hormesis as the beneficial effects of mild stress of choice, and will encourage the development of novel health care products with physical, nutritional and mental hormetins.",

        "abstract": "One hundred and thirty-five drug users in contact with treatment services in Scotland and England were interviewed about their experiences of witnessing overdoses - both overdoses resolved successfully and those leading to death - and actions taken to effect resuscitation. One hundred and four (77%) had witnessed a mean of 11.5 overdoses, of whom 41 (30.4% of the study sample) had witnessed an average of 4.2 fatal overdoses. A wide range of actions was reported at the most recent witnessed overdose, the most common being slapping or shaking the victim (an average of 2.5 minutes after overdose was first recognised) or walking the person around the room (3.2 minutes after recognizing overdose). There was no consistent relationship between the time taken to acting and the number of actions taken. Successful resolution of last witnessed overdose was associated more strongly with immediate onset of overdose, while those that led to death were more often those that involved slow onset of overdose. There is clear evidence of the opportunity and willingness of witnesses to intervene, particularly when overdose onset is immediate, with a wide range of strategies adopted to encourage recovery, although these may often be inappropriate and wrongly prioritized.",

This paper poses the question as to why part of the discipline turned its back on public policy and particularly issues of poverty and inequality. The aim of the paper is to encourage students and advocates of geography to think a little about what they are involved in (and to think about the role of academia more generally). Recent publications in a number of geography journals have revealed much angst among prominent geographers concerning the state of human geography and, in particular, its links to contemporary policy debate. However, while geographers discuss the debate, we argue that they are not a significant part of it. We take a critical turn and look at the debate that two geographers - Ron Martin and Doreen Massey - have raised within the light of wider debates on public policy, politics, quantification, academia and the policy agenda. We conclude that for many reasons there is unlikely to be a large shift towards policy-orientated research within human geography.",

While most efforts are directed at inferring drug response phenotype based on genotype, there is very focused and useful phenotypic information to be gained from directly perturbing the patient's living cancer cell with the drug(s) in question. To satisfy this unmet need, we developed the Dynamic BH3 Profiling technique to measure early changes in net pro-apoptotic signaling at the mitochondrion (\"priming\") induced by chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cells, not requiring prolonged ex vivo culture. We find in cell line and clinical experiments that early drug-induced death signaling measured by Dynamic BH3 Profiling predicts chemotherapy response across many cancer types and many agents, including combinations of chemotherapies. We propose that Dynamic BH3 Profiling can be used as a broadly applicable predictive biomarker to predict cytotoxic response of cancers to chemotherapeutics in vivo.",

If the study of a competing hypothesis is prevented because of the faith in an unverified one, scientific progress is stalled. This has happened in the study of low dose radiation. Though radiation hormesis was hypothesized to reduce cancers in 1980, it could not be studied in humans because of the faith in the unverified linear no-threshold model hypothesis, likely resulting in over 15 million preventable cancer deaths worldwide during the past two decades, since evidence has accumulated supporting the validity of the phenomenon of radiation hormesis. Since our society has been guided by scientific advisory committees that ostensibly follow the scientific method, the long duration of such large casualties is indicative of systemic deficiencies in the infrastructure that has evolved in our society for the application of science.

Taking ionizing radiation and caloric restriction as examples, environmental variation from benign to extreme gives a fitness-stress continuum where energetic efficiency, a measure of fitness, is inversely related to stress level. Hormesis occurs in benign regions for these examples. In contrast aging emphasizes survival towards the limits of survival under accumulating stress from Reactive Oxygen Species, ROS. An energetic evolutionary approach underlies an ecological aging theory based principally upon survival, which incorporates hormesis. Multiple environmental agents contributing to hormesis should be considered by those attempting to improve the quality of life by delaying the onset of senescence, so enhancing survival. Caloric restriction has wider acceptance in this process than ionizing radiation.",

The results presented also suggest the possibility of using low-level X- and gamma-ray exposures to cure cancer and to prevent cancer metastases.

Although QDs hold great potential in a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications, the environmental implications of these particles is largely unexplored. The nanocrystal core of many types of QDs contains the toxic metal cadmium (Cd), so possible release of Cd from the QD core is cause for concern. Because many types of QDs are miscible in water, QD interactions with aquatic organisms and their environment require more attention. In the present study we used fluorometry to measure time and dose dependent uptake, accumulation, and post-exposure clearance of accumulated QDs in the gut tract by the aquatic vertebrate Pimephales promelas.

Because cigarette smoke is a confounding factor, we also account for smoking effects. Here we present a new empirical mathematical model that was introduced for simultaneous assessment of radiation and cigarette-smoking-related damage to the respiratory system. The model incorporates absolute thresholds for smoking- and radiation-induced respiratory system dysfunction. As the alpha radiation dose to the lung increased from 0 to 4.36 Gy, respiratory function indices studied decreased, although remaining in the normal range. The data were consistent with the view that alpha radiation doses to the lung above a relatively small threshold (0.15 to 0.39 Gy) cause some respiratory system dysfunction. Respiratory function indices were not found to be influenced by total-body gamma radiation doses in the range 0-3.8 Gy when delivered at low rates over years. However, significant decreases in airway conductance were found to be associated with cigarette smoking.

Splenocytes adhesion to the native endothelium, expression of CD18 and shedding of CD62L and PSGL-1 augmented in 12 months old mice (P<0.05): only 3-month catechin fully normalized adhesion and prevented the expression of adhesion molecules on splenocytes (P<0.05).

Using binucleated cells with micronuclei (micronucleated cells) among in vitro monoenergetic-neutron-irradiated human lymphocytes as a measure of residual damage, we investigated the influence of the small gamma-ray contribution to the dose on suppressing residual damage. We used residual damage data from previous experiments that involved neutrons with five different energies (0.22-, 0.44-, 1.5-, 5.9-, and 13.7-million electron volts [MeV]). Corresponding gamma-ray contributions to the dose were approximately 1%, 1%, 2%, 6%, and 6%, respectively. Total absorbed radiation doses were 0, 10, 50, and 100 mGy for each neutron source. We demonstrate for the first time a protective effect (reduced residual damage) of the small gamma-ray contribution to the neutron dose. Using similar data for exposure to gamma rays only, we also demonstrate a protective effect of 10 mGy (but not 50 or 100 mGy) related to reducing the frequency of micronucleated cells to below the spontaneous level.",

Within the past 60 years there has been a precipitous diminution of such challenges in modern societies because of the development of technologies that provide a continuous supply of energy-dense processed foods and that largely eliminate the need for physical exertion.

Physical-static defenses precede metabolic-dynamic defenses acting immediately: scavenging of toxins; - molecular repair, especially of DNA; - removal of damaged cells either by apoptosis, necrosis, phagocytosis, cell differentiation-senescence, or by immune responses, - followed by replacement of lost elements. Another metabolic-dynamic defense arises delayed by up-regulating immediately operating defense mechanisms. Some of these adaptive protections may last beyond a year and all create temporary protection against renewed potentially toxic impacts also from non-radiogenic endogenous sources. Adaptive protections have a maximum after single tissue absorbed doses around 100 to 200 mSv and disappear with higher doses. Low dose rates initiate maximum protection likely at lower cell doses delivered repetitively at certain time intervals. Adaptive protection preventing only about 2 - 3 % of endogenous life-time cancer risk would fully balance a calculated induced cancer risk at about 100 mSv, in agreement with epidemiological data and concordant with an hormetic effect.

        "abstract": "This study aims to explore the expression of GRP78, a marker of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, in the cortex of rat brains acutely exposed to methylmercury (MeHg). Thirty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into six groups, and decapitated 6 hours (h) after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of MeHg (2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 mg/kg body weight) or normal saline. Protein and mRNA expression of Grp78 were detected by western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively. The results showed that a gradual increase in GRP78 protein expression was observed in the cortex of rats acutely exposed to MeHg (2, 4 or 6 mg/kg). Protein levels peaked in the 6 mg/kg group (p < 0.05 vs. controls), decreased in the 8 mg/kg group, and bottomed below the control level in the 10 mg/kg group. Parallel changes were noted for Grp78 mRNA expression. It may be implied that acute exposure to MeHg induced hormetic dose-dependent changes in Grp78 mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that activation of ER stress is involved in MeHg-induced neurotoxicity. Low level MeHg exposure may induce GRP78 protein expression to stimulate endogenous cytoprotective mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Traditional risk-assessment theory assumes the existence of a threshold for non-cancer health effects. However, a recent trend in environmental regulation rejects this assumption in favor of non-threshold linearity for these endpoints. This trend is driven largely by two related concepts: (1) a theoretical assumption of wide-ranging human sensitivity, and (2) inability to detect thresholds in epidemiologic models. Wide-ranging sensitivity assumes a subpopulation with extreme background vulnerability, so that even trivial environmental exposures are hazardous to someone somewhere. We use examples from the real world of clinical medicine to show that this theoretical assumption is inconsistent with the biology of mammalian systems and the realities of patient care. Using examples from particulate-matter air-pollution research, we further show that failure to reject linearity is usually driven by statistical rather than biological considerations, and that nonlinear/threshold models often have a similar or better fit than their linear counterparts. This evidence suggests the existence of practical, real-world thresholds for most chemical exposures.",

        "abstract": "A tightly reasoned justification is presented for the procedures used in our test of the linear-no threshold theory of radiation carcinogenesis by comparing lung cancer rates with average radon exposure in U.S. counties. A key point is its dependence on ecological variables rather than on characteristics of individuals and the principal problems involve treatment of potential confounding factors (CF). The method of stratification is introduced and shown to be preferable to multiple regression for evaluating effects of confounding. Utilizing numerous available CF reduces the problem of representing a complex confounding relationship by the average value of a single CF. The requirements on a CF for affecting the results are quantified in terms of its correlations with lung cancer rates and radon levels and it is shown that the existence of an unknown confounder satisfying these requirements is highly implausible. Effects of combinations of confounding factors are treated and shown not to be important. The problem of confounding factors on the level of individuals is resolved. Consideration of plausibility of correlations is used in several applications, including treatments of uncertainty in smoking prevalence, within county differences in radon exposure between smokers and non-smokers, variations in intensity of smoking, differences between measured radon levels and actual exposures, etc. Examples are presented for all applications. The differences between our study and case-control studies, and the advantages of each for testing the linear-no threshold theory, are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 160,000 people evacuated the area around the Fukushima Dai-ichi NPP shortly after it was damage by the earthquake and tsunami. The evacuation order applied to 70,000 of them, while the other 90,000 left voluntarily and returned soon afterward. After more than two years, most of the 70,000 are still not allowed to return to their homes. The 1100 disaster-related deaths caused by the evacuation order show that this pre-cautionary action, taken to minimize cancer risks, was not \"conservative.\" In this paper, recent studies are reviewed on the consequences of the radioactive releases and on the benefits of many medical treatments with low doses of radiation that were carried out until the 1950s, before the radiation scare was created. Recent research has shed light on the high rate of spontaneous double-strand breaks in DNA and the adaptive protections in cells, tissues and humans that are up-regulated by low radiation. These defences prevent, repair, remove and replace damage, from all causes including external agents. Cancer mortality is reduced. The ICRP's concept of radiation risk is wrong. It should revert to its 1934 concept, which was a tolerance dose of 0.2 roentgen (r) per day based on more than 35 years of medical experience.",

Oxidative stress, on the other hand, has been used as a marker for the toxicity of dioxin and its congeners. We have focused this review on the connection between oxidative stress induction and the toxic effects of fetal and adult dioxin exposure, with emphasis on the large species difference in sensitivity to this agent. We examine the roles that the dioxin-inducible cytochromes P450s play in the cellular and toxicological consequences of dioxin exposure with emphasis on oxidative stress involvement. Many components of the health consequences resulting from dioxin exposure may be attributable to epigenetic mechanisms arising from prolonged reactive oxygen generation.",

High dose homogenous field irradiation and the use of irradiation in the microbeam radiation therapy mode at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) at Grenoble was tested by giving high doses to the right brain hemisphere of the rat. The right and left cerebral hemispheres and the urinary bladder were later removed to determine whether abscopal effects could be produced in the animals and also whether effects occurred in cage mates housed with them. The results show strong bystander signal production in the contra-lateral brain hemisphere and weaker effects in the distant bladder of the irradiated rats. Signal strength was similar or greater in each tissue in the cage mates housed for 48hrs with the irradiated rats. Our results support the hypothesis that proximity to an irradiated animal induces signalling changes in an unirradiated partner. If similar signaling occurs between humans, the results could have implications for caregivers and hospital staff treating radiotherapy patients.",

        "abstract": "The current system of radiation protection for humans is based on the linear-no-threshold (LNT) risk-assessment paradigm. Perceived harm to irradiated nuclear workers and the public is mainly reflected through calculated hypothetical increased cancers. The LNT-based system of protection employs easy-to-implement measures of radiation exposure. Such measures include the equivalent dose (a biological-damage-potential-weighted measure) and the effective dose (equivalent dose multiplied by a tissue-specific relative sensitivity factor for stochastic effects). These weighted doses have special units such as the sievert (Sv) and millisievert (mSv, one thousandth of a sievert). Radiation-induced harm is controlled via enforcing exposure limits expressed as effective dose. Expected cancer cases can be easily computed based on the summed effective dose (person-sievert) for an irradiated group or population. Yet the current system of radiation protection needs revision because radiation-induced natural protection (hormesis) has been neglected. A novel, nonlinear, hormetic relative risk model for radiation-induced cancers is discussed in the context of establishing new radiation exposure limits for nuclear workers and the public.",

This is not clearly recognizable from the literature because comparisons of the high incidence figures 4 years after the accident and later have been made with those from the first years after the accident, when the registered incidence had already started to increase. Considering the low pre-accident registered incidence, there was an accumulated pool of undiagnosed thyroid tumors before the accident. The percentage of more advanced cancers, larger in size and less differentiated, was higher after the accident, when the pool of neglected cancers was diagnosed due to the screening and improved diagnostics. Some of these advanced tumors found by screening were interpreted as aggressive radiogenic cancers. The same tendency might be true also for other cancers, e.g. renal cell carcinoma. Furthermore, the screening-effect, false-positivity and registration of non-exposed patients as Chernobyl victims has obviously contributed to the registered incidence increase of malignancy.",

Statistically significant decreases in mortality, with very large effect sizes, were observed in high land elevation for three of the four outcomes, including cancer. One possible explanation for the decreased mortality in high elevation jurisdictions is radiation hormesis. Another possible explanation, at least in the case of heart disease mortality, is the physiologic responses that accompany higher elevations regarding decreased oxygen levels. Since this is an ecological study, no causal inferences can be made, particularly when viewpoints on possible effects of low level radiation are diametrically opposed.

Cell injury was assessed by measuring cell viability and proliferation, and gap junction function was assessed by Parachute dye-coupling assay. Connexin 43 protein was assessed by Western blotting.\\n\\nRESULTS: At doses from 17.1 to 513\u03bcmol/L, bilirubin dose-dependently enhanced cell viability and colony-formation rates when cells were seeded at either high- or low- densities (all p<0.05 vs. solvent group) accompanied with enhanced intercellular fluorescence transmission and increased Cx43 protein expression in high-density cells. However, the above effects of BR were gradually reversed when its concentration increased from 684 to 1026\u03bcmol/L. In high-density cells, gap junction inhibitor 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate attenuated bilirubin-induced enhancement of colony-formation and fluorescence transmission. However, in the presence of high concentration bilirubin (1026\u03bcmol/L), activation of gap junction with retinoid acid decreased colony-formation rates.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Bilirubin can confer biphasic effects on renal NRK52E cell proliferation potentially by differentially affecting gap junction functions.",

Theoretically, radial concentration gradients of a hormetic morphogen can form hollow (vessels) or solid (Carota) tubular structures. In arteries, blood flow and pressure can shape mural gradients and determine wall curvature and thereby vessel diameter. As Anlagen grow they form a temporary common wall that is subsequently removed, which results in fusion of the Anlagen lumina and an aorta with a lumen diameter that accommodates the combined blood flow to the iliac arteries. Carota seedlings grown close together exhibited proximally fused root cones, serial cross-sections of which exhibited coaxial fusion patterns that closely resembled the predicted vascular fusion patterns, thus validating a role for hormesis and hormetic morphogens in the morphogenesis of the aorta and possibly the morphogenesis of other human midline structures.",

Lung cancer risk was estimated using conditional logistic regression models that controlled for demographic, smoking, and occupational exposure covariates. Preliminary exploratory analyses using lowess smoothing revealed a non-linear association between exposure and the log odds of lung cancer. Radon exposure was considered by using linear spline terms in order to model this nonlinearity. The best fit of this linear spline model to these data predicted a shift from a positive to a negative slope in the log-odds of lung cancer at a radon concentration of 70 Bq m(-3). A statistically significant decrease in cancer risk with increased exposure was found for values \u2264 157 Bq m(-3) normalized to the reference exposure of 4.4 Bq m(-3), the lowest radon concentration measured(adjusted odds ratio (AOR) [95% CI] = 0.42 [0.180, 1.00], p = 0.049). This result is consistent with those reported elsewhere that considered radon exposure with cubic spline terms (Thompson, RE et al. 2008).

        "abstract": "Engineered metallic nanomaterial particles (MENAP) represent a significant breakthrough in developing new products for use by consumers and industry. Skin application (e.g., via creams and sprays containing nanoparticles) may provide a key route of potential intake of MENAP and can lead to retrograde transport from nerve endings in the skin to the somatosensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). This paper uses a novel theoretical model (stochastic threshold microdose [STM] model) to characterize survival of DRG neurons exposed in cell culture replicates to copper nanoparticles, based on published data. Cell death via autophagy is assumed here to occur as a result of the uptake (called hits) of the nanoparticles by mitochondria. Theoretical results are presented for the existence of a hypersensitive fraction (about 20%) of neurons that are killed in significant numbers when on average > 1 hit to the at-risk mitochondria occurs. Further, most hypersensitive neurons appear to be killed by a cumulative exposure of about 2,000 micromolar-hours and the remaining resistant cells may have dysfunctional mitochondria. Based on these theoretical findings, it is predicted that repeated exposure (e.g., over years) of the skin of humans to MENAP could lead to significant nervous system damage and related morbidity.",

Understanding the limitations of the current regulation in regard to nanomaterials is a starting point in a democratic and transparent process towards adapting existing laws and facilitating an informed discussion about which kind of regulatory options best address the identified limitations. In the following we will introduce key pieces of European legislation affecting nanomaterials, analyze their limitations, and provide a number of recommendations on how these can be overcome. We find that, although nanomaterials are in principle covered by the scope of many of the existing legislative frameworks, it is often unclear, if current regulations are actually applicable when it comes to specific nanomaterials and their diverse applications. Main limitations seem to be: that requirements to do safety evaluations are triggered by production volumes by tonnage not tailored to the nanoscale, the profound lack of (eco)toxicological data, and that thresholds values and occupational exposure limits cannot be established with existing methodologies.",

        "abstract": "A low-dose protective apoptosis-mediated (PAM) process is discussed that appears to be turned on by low-dose gamma and X rays but not by low-dose alpha radiation. PAM is a bystander effect that involves cross-talk between genomically compromised [e.g., mutants, neoplastically transformed, micronucleated] cells and nongenomically compromised cells. A novel neoplastic cell transformation model, NEOTRANS3, is discussed that includes PAM. With NEOTRANS3, PAM is activated by low doses and inhibited by moderate or high doses and is, therefore, a hormetic process. A low-dose region of suppression of the transformation frequency below the spontaneous frequency relates to the hormetic zone over which PAM is presumed to operate. The magnitude of suppression relates to what is called the hormetic intensity. Both the hormetic intensity and width of the hormetic zone are expected to depend on dose rate, being more pronounced after low dose rates. It is expected that PAM likely had a significant role in the following observations after chronic irradiation: (1) what appears to be a tremendous reduction in the cancer incidence below the spontaneous level for Taiwanese citizens residing for years in cobalt-60 contaminated apartments; and (2) the published reductions in the lung cancer incidence below the spontaneous level in humans after protracted X irradiation and after chronic gamma plus alpha irradiation. Implications of PAM for cancer prevention and low-dose cancer therapy are briefly discussed.",

Nuclear reactors could supply much of the energy demand in a safe, sustainable manner were it not for fear of potential releases of radioactivity. Such releases would likely deliver a low dose or dose rate of radiation, within the range of naturally occurring radiation, to which life is already accustomed. The key areas of concern are discussed. Studies of actual health effects, especially thyroid cancers, following exposures are assessed. Radiation hormesis is explained, pointing out that beneficial effects are expected following a low dose or dose rate because protective responses against stresses are stimulated. The notions that no amount of radiation is small enough to be harmless and that a nuclear accident could kill hundreds of thousands are challenged in light of experience: more than a century with radiation and six decades with reactors. If nuclear energy is to play a significant role in meeting future needs, regulatory authorities must examine the scientific evidence and communicate the real health effects of nuclear radiation. Negative images and implications of health risks derived by unscientific extrapolations of harmful effects of high doses must be dispelled.",

Nanomaterials are regulated under different statutory programs depending on whether they are drugs, pesticides or other commercial chemicals. Recent developments in the regulation of nanomaterials that are not drugs or pesticides have demonstrated a trend towards application of the precautionary principle. This is a paradigm shift away from the requirement built into past interpretations of the Toxic Substances Control Act (\"TSCA\") that manufacturing, processing and use of chemical substances cannot be restricted unless the regulatory authority proves an unreasonable risk.

        "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to establish the emission of UV photons when HPV-G cells and associated materials (such as the cell substrate and cell growth media) are exposed to low LET radiation. The potential role of UV photons in the secondary triggering of biological processes led us to hypothesize that the emission and absorption of photons at this wavelength explain some radiation induced \"bystander effects\" that have previously been thought to be chemically mediated. Cells were plated in Petri-dishes of two different sizes, having different thicknesses of polystyrene (PS) substrate, and were exposed to \u03b2-radiation from (90)Y produced by the McMaster Nuclear Reactor. UV measurements were performed using a single photon counting system employing an interference-type filter for selection of a narrow wavelength range, 340\u00b15 nm, of photons. Exposure of the cell substrates (which were made of polystyrene) determined that UV photons were being emitted as a consequence of \u03b2 particle irradiation of the Petri-dishes. For a tightly collimated \u03b2-particle beam exposure, we observed 167 photons in the detector per unit \u03bcCi in the shielded source for a 1.76 mm thick substrate and 158 photons/\u03bcCi for a 0.878 mm thick substrate. A unit \u03bcCi source activity was equivalent to an exposure to the substrate of 18 \u03b2-particles/cm(2) in this case. The presence of cells and medium in a Petri-dish was found to significantly increase (up to a maximum of 250%) the measured number of photons in a narrow band of wavelengths of 340\u00b15 nm (i.e. UVA) as compared to the signal from an empty control Petri-dish. When coloured growth medium was added to the cells, it reduced the measured count rate, while the addition of transparent medium in equal volume increased the count rate, compared to cells alone. We attribute this to the fact that emission, scattering and absorption of light by cells and media are all variables in the experiment. Under collimated irradiation conditions, it was observed that increasing cell density in medium of fixed volume resulted in a decrease in the observed light output. This followed a roughly exponential decline. We suggest that this may be due to increased scattering at the cell boundary and absorption of the UV in the cells. We conclude that we have measured UVA emitted by cells, cell medium and cell substrates as a consequence of their irradiation by low LET \u03b2-particle radiation. We suggest that these secondary UV photons could lead to effects in non-targetted cells. Some effects that had previously been attributed to a chemically mediated \"bystander effect\" may in fact be due to secondary UV emission. Some radiation bystander effect studies may require re-interpretation as this phenomenon of UV emission is further investigated.",

The use of LNT for radiation protection purposes has been repeatedly endorsed by authoritative scientific advisory bodies, including the National Academy of Sciences' BEIR Committees, whose recommendations form a primary basis of EPA's risk assessment methodology. Although recent radiobiological findings indicate novel damage and repair processes at low doses, LNT is supported by data from both epidemiology and radiobiology. Given the current state of the science, the consensus positions of key scientific and governmental bodies, as well as the conservatism and calculational convenience of the LNT assumption, it is unlikely that EPA will modify this approach in the near future.",

Recent studies on fruit flies have demonstrated that the original basis for the LNT notion is invalid. The Puskin article omits any mention of important reports from UNSCEAR, the NCRP and the French Academies of Science and Medicine, while citing an assessment of the Canadian breast cancer study that manipulated the data to obscure evidence of reduced breast cancer mortality following a low total dose.

News media misinformation related to the emergency triggered enormous social fear worldwide of the radioactivity that is being released from damaged fuel rods. The heroic recovery workers are a major concern because they are being exposed to mostly gamma radiation during their work shifts and life-threatening damage to the radiosensitive bone marrow could occur over time. This paper presents a way in which the bone marrow equivalent dose (in millisieverts), as estimated per work shift, could be used along with the hazard function model previously developed for radiological risk assessment to repeatedly check for potential life-threatening harm (hematopoietic system damage) to workers. Three categories of radiation hazard indication are proposed: 1, life-threatening damage unlikely; 2, life-threatening damage possible; 3, life-threatening damage likely. Categories 2 and 3 would be avoided if the whole body effective dose did not exceed the annual effective dose limit of 250 mSv. For down-wind populations, hormetic effects (activated natural protective processes) are much more likely than are deleterious effects.",

Antioxidant capacity of the extract was determined using free radicalscavenging method. The treatment of lymphocytes with the extract showed a significant decrease in the incidence of micronuclei binucleated cells, as compared with similarly irradiated lymphocytes without any extract treatment. The maximum protection and decrease in frequency of micronuclei were observed at 200 mg/mL of ACM extract which completely protected genotoxicity induced by IR in human lymphocytes. Achillea millefolium extract exhibited concentration-dependent radical-scavenging activity on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl free radicals.

As a result, complex adaptive systems are continuously refashioning themselves at ever-higher levels of complexity and integration - not just in spite of \"stressful\" input from the outside but by way of it. Stressful input is therefore inherently neither bad (\"poison\") nor good (\"medication\"). Rather, it will be how well the system (be it sandpile or living system) is able to process, integrate, and adapt to the stressful input that will make of it either a growth-disrupting (sandpile-destabilizing) event or a growth-promoting (sandpile-restabilizing) opportunity. Too much stress - \"traumatic stress\" - will be too overwhelming for the system to manage, triggering instead devastating breakdown. Too little stress will provide too little impetus for transformation and growth, serving instead simply to reinforce the system's status quo.

Suppressor gene episilencing is assumed to arise as a Poisson process characterized with and exponential distribution of episilencing doses with mean dj . In addition to providing mathematical functions for evaluating the single-target-gene episilencing probability, functions are also provided for the multi-target-gene episilencing probability for simultaneously silencing of multiple tumor-suppressor-miRNA genes.

We tested this causal hypothesis in 100 United States cities using the publicly available NMMAPS database. Although a significant, approximately linear, statistical C-R association exists in simple statistical models, closer analysis suggests that it is not causal. Surprisingly, conditioning on other variables that have been extensively considered in previous analyses (usually using splines or other smoothers to approximate their effects), such as month of the year and mean daily temperature, suggests that they create strong, nonlinear confounding that explains the statistical association between PM2.5 and mortality rates in this data set. As this finding disagrees with conventional wisdom, we apply several different techniques to examine it. Conditional independence tests for potential causation, non-parametric classification tree analysis, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), and Granger-Sims causality testing, show no evidence that PM2.5 concentrations have any causal impact on increasing mortality rates. This apparent absence of a causal C-R relation, despite their statistical association, has potentially important implications for managing and communicating the uncertain health risks associated with, but not necessarily caused by, PM2.5 exposures.",

We propose that redox chemistry, specifically the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, in their absence, reduction of molecular oxygen by the identical secondary metabolite, is an important component of the hormetic effects caused by these compounds. This is illustrated for selected phenols, terpenoids, and alkaloids. The redox reactions are modulated by the variable availability of transition metals that serve as donors of electrons in a Fenton reaction mode. Low levels of ROS stimulate growth, cell differentiation, and stress resistance; high levels induce programmed cell death. We propose that provision of molecules that can participate in this redox chemistry is the raison d'\u00eatre for secondary metabolites. In this context, the presence or absence of functional groups in the molecule is more essential than the whole structure. Accordingly, there exist no constraints that limit structural diversity.

        "abstract": "Abstinence prior to entering treatment is common among individuals seeking substance abuse treatment. The current study examined the relationship between abstinence at a pretreatment intake assessment and treatment response during outpatient treatment for marijuana dependence. At the intake assessment, 142 marijuana-dependent individuals completed past 30 day calendars of daily drug use. Forty-four (31%) participants were pretreatment abstainers, as defined by reports of one or more consecutive days of marijuana abstinence prior to the day of the intake assessment. Non-abstainers (69%) reported marijuana use the day prior or the day of the assessment. Pretreatment abstainers were more likely to enter treatment (P < 0.05) and showed better treatment response than non-abstainers. Abstainers provided 50% more marijuana-negative urine screens during treatment (P < 0.05), and more than three times as many abstainers reported no marijuana use (P < 0.01). The groups did not differ on treatment completion. Marijuana abstinence at the time of initial clinic contact appears to be a strong predictor of success during treatment. Pretreatment abstinence may prove useful as a pretreatment matching strategy that could improve outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Clinical trials might consider including pretreatment abstinence status as a stratification variable during participant assignment or as a covariate in outcome analyses.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: A Prescription Event Monitoring (PEM) study was carried out by the Drug Safety Research Unit (DSRU) to monitor the safety of irbesartan, an angiotensin II antagonist, immediately after launch in the United Kingdom in September 1997. The DSRU 'green form' questionnaire response rate was lower than expected. The manufacturer was conducting a concurrent postmarketing surveillance study. The aim of this cross-sectional study, was to identify reasons for non-response by general practitioners in England. METHODS: In PEM, questionnaires are posted to the prescribing general practitioner approximately 6 months after the date of the first prescription for each patient, requesting details of clinical events recorded in the patients' notes since starting treatment. Those that failed to respond were sent a second questionnaire, including tick box questions to elucidate reasons for non-response. RESULTS: A total of 21.3% (3088/14502) second send forms were returned. There were 1747 tick box responses. The most common reason specified for non-response was 'I was too busy' (31.2%) followed by 'no payment included' (13.4%). Participation in another study accounted for only 3.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The concurrent postmarketing surveillance study was not a significant factor. The general practitioner's workload appeared to have a far larger impact. While research remains a non-core activity and receives no payment, participation is likely to fall. Researchers need to find means of benefiting the general practitioner if participation is to continue.",

All patients received aspirin (325 mg). Clopidogrel (300 mg) was administered in the catheterization laboratory and followed by 75 mg daily. There was marked interindividual variability in drug response as measured by all markers that showed a normal distribution. Resistance, defined as baseline aggregation (%) minus posttreatment aggregation (%) < or =10% by 5 micromol/L ADP, was present in 31% and 15% of patients at 5 and 30 days, respectively. Patients with the highest pretreatment platelet reactivity remained the most reactive at 24 hours after treatment (P<0.0001).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Interindividual variability in the platelet inhibitory response from clopidogrel occurs in patients undergoing elective coronary stenting.

Toxicity of single and binary mixtures was measured by quantifying the decrease in light emission from the Photobacterium phosphoreum for 15 min. The joint effects of binary mixtures (TU sum) can thus be obtained. The results showed that the relationships between toxic ratios of the individual chemicals and their joint effects can be described by normal distribution function. Based on normal distribution equations, the joint effects of binary mixtures at non-equitoxic ratios ( [Formula: see text]) can be predicted quantitatively using the joint effects at equitoxic ratios ( [Formula: see text]). Combined with a QSAR model of [Formula: see text]in our previous work, a novel QSAR model can be proposed to predict the joint effects of mixtures at non-equitoxic ratios ( [Formula: see text]). The proposed model has been validated using additional mixtures other than the one used for the development of the model. Predicted and observed results were similar (p>0.05). This study provides an approach to the prediction of joint effects for binary mixtures at non-equitoxic ratios.",

Immunochemical staining was performed to detect renal 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) accumulation, metallothionein (MT) expression, cell proliferation and global DNA methylation. Results showed that renal Cd concentration and MT expression along with 3-NT accumulation were significantly higher in the Cd group than that in the control. Histopathologically renal tubule damage at the early stage and hyperplasia at the late stage were observed in the Cd group. Renal fibrosis in glomeruli was evident in the Cd group, particularly at the late stage of the study. Immunoreactivity of global DNA methylation was markedly diminished in the Cd group at both 20(th) and 52(nd) weeks.

Firstly, USN is not a perceptual deficit, secondly, USN is not necessarily accompanied by a visual deficit and finally, USN can be observed in non-visual modalities as well as in mental spatial imagery. This apparent supramodality of USN stands in sharp contrast to the fact that neglect signs are often more severe and more durable in the visual than in other sensory modalities (Chokron et al., 2002). The influence of vision on spatial representation has rarely been studied. In the present study we assessed six right brain-damaged patients suffering from left USN on two tasks involving spatial representations: a clock-drawing task and a drawing from memory task in two experimental conditions, with and without visual control. We confirm that even in mental imagery, the absence of visual feedback may decrease and even suppress left neglect signs (Bartolomeo and Chokron, 2001b; 2002). Since vision is largely involved in the orientation of attention in space, suppressing visual control could reduce the magnetic attraction towards the right ipsilesional hemispace and in this way could allow a re-orientation of attention towards the left neglected hemispace. We discuss the theoretical and therapeutic implications of these findings",

A major flaw in the standard ERR formalism for estimating cancer risk from radiation (and other carcinogens) is that it ignores the potential for a large systematic bias in the measured baseline cancer mortality rate, which can have a major effect on the ERR values. Cancer rates are highly variable from year to year and between adjacent regions and so the likelihood of such a bias is high. Calculations show that a correction for such a bias can lower the ERRs in the atomic bomb survivor data to negative values for intermediate doses. This is consistent with the phenomenon of radiation hormesis, providing a rational explanation for the decreased risk of cancer observed at intermediate doses for which there is no explanation based on the LNT model. The recent atomic bomb survivor data provides additional evidence for radiation hormesis in humans.",

        "abstract": "Residential radon has been found to be associated with lung cancer in epidemiological/ecological studies and the researchers have inappropriately concluded that residential radon causes lung cancer. Their conclusion relates to the linear-no-threshold (LNT) hypothesis-based, risk-assessment paradigm; however, the LNT hypothesis has been invalidated in numerous studies. It is shown in this paper that our hormetic relative risk (HRR) model is consistent with lung cancer data where detailed measurements of radon in each home were carried out. Based on the HRR model, low-level radon radioactive progeny is credited for activated natural protection (ANP) against lung cancer including smoking-related lung cancer. The proportion B(x) (benefit function) of ANP beneficiaries increases as the average radon level x increases to near the Environmental Protection Agency's action level of 4 picocuries/L (approximately 150 Bq m(-3)). As the average level of radon increases to somewhat above the action level, ANP beneficiaries progressively decrease to zero (B(x) decreases to 0), facilitating the occurrence of smoking-related lung cancers as well as those related to other less important risk factors. Thus, residential radon does not appear to cause lung cancer but rather to protect, in an exposure-level-dependent manner, from its induction by other agents (e.g., cigarette-smoke-related carcinogens).",

The results suggested that pretreatment of the tested insects at 30 \u00b0C for 2, 4 and 8h could somewhat decrease the toxicity of fipronil at all set concentrations. The LC(50) values of fipronil increased after heat pretreatment and c.f. values in all these treatments were below zero.

Pretreatment of the tested insects at 35 \u00b0C for 2, 4, 8 and 12h was found to increase the toxicity of fipronil at all set concentrations which resulted in the decrease of LC(50) values of fipronil and c.f. above zero in all treatments with only one exception.

Unlike TTW, CTE showed a monotonic toxicity increase from the lowest tested level (0.1%) and CTE toxicity at higher levels was significantly more severe than TTW-induced toxicity.

There is some evidence that the anti-aging benefits of lifestyle factors, such as diet, exercise or engaging in activities may be achieved via hormetic regulation. This supports the validity of the concept in human. There are, however, gaps in knowledge and ethical barriers that need to be addressed to establish the suitability of the approach to the clinical context or the general geriatric population. In particular, we need to find out which stressors are safe for use as anti-aging interventions, when they have to be applied to achieve maximal benefits, how their therapeutic potential is altered by changes in the stress system induced by age and pathological conditions, and the extent to which the occurrence of adverse versus positive effects depends on interacting genetic and experiential factors.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies showed that low dose radiation (LDR) could stimulate the immune system in both animal and human populations. This paper reviews the present status of relevant research as support to the use of LDR in clinical practice for cancer prevention and treatment. It has been demonstrated that radiation-induced changes in immune activity follows an inverse J-shaped curve, i.e., low dose stimulation and high dose suppression. The stimulation of immunity by LDR concerns most anticancer parameters, including antibody formation, natural killer activity, secretion of interferon and other cytokines as well as other cellular changes. Animal studies have revealed that LDR retards tumor growth, decreases cancer metastasis, and inhibits carcinogenesis induced by high dose radiation. These effects of LDR on cancer control were found to be related to its stimulation on immunity. The experimental data may well explain the efficacy of the clinical trial of LDR in the treatment of cancer.",

However, these observations reflect paradoxical features of GCs, since these adrenal stress hormones are heavily involved in both neurodegenerative and neuroprotective processes.

In the present short review we aim to show the importance of concentration dependent action of GCs on neuronal cell viability and cell survival in the brain. Additionally, we will summarize the possible GC-induced cellular mechanisms at different GC concentrations providing a background for their effect on the fate of nerve cells in conditions that are a challenge to their survival.",

The average threshold for acute exposures to atomic bombs is about 100 cSv. Conclusions from these studies of atomic bomb survivors are: One burst of low dose irradiation elicits a lifetime of improved health.Improved health from low dose irradiation negates the LNT paradigm.Effective triage should include radiation hormesis for survivor treatment.",

The orientation state of a set of fibers is described by a second order tensor. Its evolution is given by the Folgar and Tucker tensorial hyperbolic equation. Even if this equation contains a fourth order term, it may be expressed as a function of the second order tensor using a closure approximation. The resolution of Folgar and Tucker's equation is carried out by a continuous approach based on the Standard Galerkin method, with stabilisation. The results are compared with experimental orientation measurements on an injected plate. Once the part solidifies it is considered as a biphasic material, composed by the fibers and the polymer matrix, where each phase has a linear elastic behaviour. The fhermo-elastic properties of the composite material are linked to the fiber orientation and the properties of each phase using a homogenisation technique. Finally, to validate the previous study on the prediction of the thermo-elastic properties at the solid state, a three-dimensional industrial case is deeply analysed.",

This article reports identification of key proteomic changes in a bystander reporter cell line (HaCaT) grown in low-dose irradiated tissue-conditioned media (ITCM) from rainbow trout fish. In vitro explant cultures were generated from the skin of fish previously exposed to low doses (0.1 and 0.5 Gy) of X-ray radiation in vivo. The ITCM was harvested from all donor explant cultures and placed on recipient HaCaT cells to observe any change in protein expression caused by the bystander signals. Proteomic methods using 2-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy were employed to screen for novel proteins expressed. The proteomic changes measured in HaCaT cells receiving the ITCM revealed that exposure to 0.5 Gy induced an upregulation of annexin A2 and cingulin and a downregulation of Rho-GDI2, F-actin-capping protein subunit beta, microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member, and 14-3-3 proteins. The 0.1 Gy dose also induced a downregulation of Rho-GDI2, hMMS19, F-actin-capping protein subunit beta, and microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member proteins. The proteins reported may influence apoptotic signaling, as the results were suggestive of an induction of cell communication, repair mechanisms, and dysregulation of growth signals.",

        "abstract": "Although the adult human brain has a small number of neural stem cells, they are insufficient to repair the damaged brain to achieve significant functional recovery for neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. Stem cell therapy, by either enhancing endogenous neurogenesis, or transplanting stem cells, has been regarded as a promising solution. However, the harsh environment of the diseased brain posts a severe threat to the survival and correct differentiation of those new stem cells. Hormesis (or preconditioning, stress adaptation) is an adaptation mechanism by which cells or organisms are potentiated to survive an otherwise lethal condition, such as the harsh oxidative stress in the stroke brain. Stem cells treated by low levels of chemical, physical, or pharmacological stimuli have been shown to survive better in the neurodegenerative brain. Thus combining hormesis and stem cell therapy might improve the outcome for treatment of these diseases. In addition, since the cell death patterns and their underlying molecular mechanism may vary in different neurodegenerative diseases, even in different progression stages of the same disease, it is essential to design a suitable and optimum hormetic strategy that is tailored to the individual patient.",

Among the six predictors considered appropriate for multiple linear regression, three were found to be statistically significant; from strongest to weakest, these three were: smoking, land elevation, and educational attainment. The predictors of smoking and educational attainment have long been considered associated with cancer mortality. The finding that the predictor of land elevation / natural background radiation is inversely related to cancer mortality is another piece of evidence supporting the theory of radiation hormesis.

The most prominent fractions of iridium were retained in kidney and spleen; smaller amounts were found in lungs, liver and brain. Iridium brain levels were lower than those observed in other tissues but this finding can support the hypothesis of iridium capability to cross the blood brain barrier. The iridium kidney levels rose significantly with the administered dose. At the highest dose, important amounts of the metal were found in serum, urine and feces. Iridium was predominantly excreted via feces with a significant linear correlation with the ingested dose, which is likely due to low intestinal absorption of the metal. However, at the higher doses iridium was also eliminated through urine. These findings may be useful to help in the understanding of the adverse health effects, particularly on the immune system, of iridium dispersed in the environment as well as in identifying appropriate biological indices of iridium exposure.",

The hormetic morphogen theory of curvature proposes that in vivo tissue gradients of such morphogens secreted by source cells determine the fate of cells within their gradient fields (field cells) and that morphogen-induced amplitude modulation of field cell mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation controls field cell growth along the morphogen gradients: At the high concentration end of gradients, field cell ATP generation and field cell growth is reduced. With declining concentrations along the rest of the gradients field cell ATP and growth is progressively less reduced until an equidyne point is reached, beyond which ATP generation and growth gradually increases. Thus, the differential growth rates along the gradients curve the tissue. Apoptosis at very high morphogen concentrations enables lumen and cavity formation of tubular, spherical, cystic, domed, and other curved biological structures. The morphogen concentration, the gradient slope and the hormesis responses of field cells determine the curvature of such structures during developmental morphogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair of injury.

As typically applied, BMDS also ignores the possibility of reduced risk at low doses (\"hormesis\"). A simpler, proposed Generic Hockey-Stick (GHS) model also estimates benchmark dose and potency, and additionally characterizes and tests objectively for hormetic trend. Using 100 simulated dichotomous-data sets (5 dose groups, 50 animals/group), sampled from each of seven risk functions, GHS estimators performed about as well or better than BMDS estimators, and a surprising observation was that BMDS mis-specified all of six non-hormetic sampled risk functions most or all of the time. When applied to data on rodent tumors induced by the genotoxic chemical carcinogen anthraquinone (AQ), the GHS model yielded significantly negative estimates of net potency exhibited by the combined rodent data, suggesting that-consistent with the anti-leukemogenic properties of AQ and structurally similar quinones-environmental AQ exposures do not likely increase net cancer risk. In addition to its simplicity and flexibility, the GHS approach offers a unified, consistent approach to quantifying environmental chemical risk.",

The objective was to evaluate performance of the DCFH assay for measuring ENM-induced free radicals. A series of diverse and well-characterized ENM were tested in the acellular DCFH assay. We investigated the effect of sonication conditions, dispersion media, ENM concentration, and the use of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) on the DCFH results. The acellular DCFH assay suffers from high background signals resulting from dye auto-oxidation and lacks sensitivity and robustness. DCFH oxidation is further enhanced by HRP. The number of positive ENM in the assay and their relative ranking changed as a function of experimental conditions. An inverse dose relationship was observed for several Carbon-based ENM. Overall, these findings indicate the importance of having standardized assays for evaluating ENM toxicity and highlights limitations of the DCFH assay for measuring ENM-induced free radicals.",

        "abstract": "To understand the potential impact on risk from exposure to low-level ionizing radiation, we have investigated the modulation of gene expression, induction of DNA damage and of neoplastic transformation in human or rodent cells derived from cultures exposed in vitro to low dose gamma-rays (a low linear energy transfer radiation) or very low fluences of alpha-particles (a high linear energy transfer radiation). Pre-exposure of cells to a low gamma-ray dose protected cells from the DNA damaging and killing effects induced by a subsequent acute challenge exposure to gamma-rays. Furthermore, a low dose chronic exposure to gamma-rays decreased the frequency of micronucleus formation and neoplastic transformation to a level below the spontaneous rate in human and rodent cells respectively. In contrast, when cell cultures were exposed to low fluences of alpha-particles, wherein a small fraction of cells were irradiated, stressful effects were transmitted from the irradiated to adjoining nonirradiated bystander cells. The mechanisms underlying these effects and their relative contribution to the overall risk to ionizing radiation is discussed.",

        "abstract": "A previous study compared cancer mortality in the six lowest versus six highest elevations in the U.S. for all races. This study looks at a single race since death rates tend to vary by race. In this ecological study, cancer mortality rates were compared between low and high states for a race that had sufficient number of counties reporting mortality data, that is, the white race. The average cancer mortality rate for low elevation counties was 73.47 + 18.35 compared to 53.90 + 13.76 for high elevation counties, a difference that was statistically significant (p < 0.0001), with a very large effect size (of 1.2). Higher elevation counties showed less cancer mortality rates for a single race compared to lower elevation counties, suggesting the presence of radiation hormesis. Further rigorous research is indicated to verify or refute these findings.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides theoretical health-risk-assessment tools that are designed to facilitate planning for and managing radiological terrorism incidents that involve ingestion exposure to bone-seeking radionuclides (e.g., radiostrontium nuclides). The focus is on evaluating lethality risk avoidance (RAV; i.e., the decrease in risk) that is associated with radionuclide decorporation countermeasures employed to remove ingested bone-seeking beta and/or gamma-emitting radionuclides from the body. To illustrate the application of tools presented, hypothetical radiostrontium decorporation scenarios were considered that involved evaluating the hematopoietic-mode-lethality RAV. For evaluating the efficacy of specific decorporation countermeasures, the lethality risk avoidance proportion (RAP; which is the RAV divided by the total lethality risk in the absence of protective countermeasures) is introduced. The lethality RAP is expected to be a useful tool for designing optimal radionuclide decorporation schemes and for identifying green, yellow and red dose-rate zones. For the green zone, essentially all of the lethality risk is expected to be avoided (RAP = 1) as a consequence of the radionuclide decorporation scheme used. For the yellow zone, some but not all of the lethality risk is expected to be avoided. For the red zone, none of the lethality risk (which equals 1) is expected to be avoided.",

Results indicate that exposure to Cd(2+), Ni(2+) or Co(2+) lead to an increase in toxicity and teratogenicity in embryos, whereas Mg(2+), Zn(2+), or a combination of them reduced the toxic and teratogenic effects of these divalent cations. Modulation of Cd(2+), Ni(2+) or Co(2+) toxicity and teratogenicity by Mg(2+) and Zn(2+), varied with the metal. Zn(2+) was observed to be a better suppressor of Co(2+) toxicity and teratogenicity than Mg(2+). In contrast, Ni(2+), and Cd(2+) teratogenicity was reduced more prominently by Mg(2+). On the other hand, combination of Mg(2+) and Zn(2+) showed potentialization effect on all divalent cation toxicity and teratogenicity.

This is due to dual (harmful as well as essential) roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to a body. Regular moderate exercise provides benefits upregulating defense against oxidative stress in good balance between the opposing dual roles. Sources of ROS in exercise appear to be not only mitochondria as often claimed but also enzymatic reactions catalyzed by NADPH oxidase and other oxidases. It may, therefore, be possible to mimic this aspect of exercise to promote the defense for healthspan extension by other means such as modest alcohol consumption that could upregulate activity of enzymes against oxidative stress.",

DC and MD concentrations (per 10,000 population) were separately compared to 2008 hypertension death rates using Spearman correlation analysis and linear regression (where appropriate). DC concentrations revealed a stronger beneficial association with hypertension death rates (r = -0.430, p = 0.0020) compared to MD concentrations (r = -0.029 with an observed outlier, and r = -0.085 without the outlier; both coefficients not statistically significant). Linear regression revealed that an average national decrease of approximately one hypertension death per 100,000 population (95% CI = -1.4 to -0.4) would be expected with an increase of one DC per 10,000 population within the range in this study (1.0 to 5.2 DCs per 10,000 population).

This issue is of increasing interest in the field of diabetes research and has become a matter of concern for regulatory agencies and food industries. Recently, the number of studies involving BPA has increased exponentially, but there are still many gaps in the knowledge of the relationship between actual BPA exposure and cardiometabolic risk and of the modalities of food intake exposure, all of which prevents sound judgments concerning the risks to human health. This review focuses on the association between human exposure to BPA and obesity, thyroid function, diabetes, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, and BPA content in food. Many cross-sectional studies support, sometimes contradictorily, an adverse effect of BPA exposure on obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Few prospective studies support an adverse effect of BPA exposure on such pathologies. Moreover, no intervention studies have been conducted to evaluate the causality of such associations. This is mainly due to lack of an appropriate database of BPA content in foods, thus hindering any estimation of the usual dietary BPA intake. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

The mechanisms for this effect remain incompletely defined, but evidence shows tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) is involved. TNF-\u03b1, at acutely high levels, possesses the intrinsic capacity to enhance injury associated with neurological disease. Conversely, the effect of TNF-\u03b1 at low-levels is nutritive over time, consistent with physiological conditioning hormesis. Evidence shows that neural activity triggers low-level pro-inflammatory signaling involving TNF-\u03b1. This low-level TNF-\u03b1 signaling alters gene expression, resulting in an enhanced resilience to disease. Brain-immune signaling may become maladaptive when increased activity is chronic without sufficient periods of reduced activity necessary for nutritive adaptation. Such tonically increased activity may explain, for example, the transformation of episodic to chronic migraine with related increased susceptibility to spreading depression, the most likely underlying cause of this malady. Thus, TNF-\u03b1, whose function is to alter gene expression, and its principal cellular source, microglia, seem powerfully positioned to orchestrate hormetic immune signaling that establishes the phenotype of neurological health and disease from brain activity.",

This concentrated attention on fear of miniscule doses of radiation. Soon the linear no threshold (LNT) paradigm was converted into laws. Scientifically valid information about the health benefits from low dose irradiation was ignored. Here are studies which show increased health in Japanese survivors of atomic bombs. Parameters include decreased mutation, leukemia and solid tissue cancer mortality rates, and increased average lifespan. Each study exhibits a threshold that repudiates the LNT dogma. The average threshold for acute exposures to atomic bombs is about 100 cSv. Conclusions from these studies of atomic bomb survivors are: One burst of low dose irradiation elicits a lifetime of improved health. Improved health from low dose irradiation negates the LNT paradigm. Effective triage should include radiation hormesis for survivor treatment.",

Here, I propose that the ATP gradients modulate export of H+ by vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) located on the surface of field cells and generate extracellular ion concentration gradients, ion currents and electrical fields along the paths of morphogen gradients. In vitro, electrical fields can induce directional migration and elongation of vascular cells and align the cells with their long axis perpendicular to electrical field vectors (Bai et al. 2004). I suggest that likewise, in vivo vascular transmural electrical fields induced by hormetic morphogen concentration gradients can modulate cell shape i.e. cell elongation and cell curvature, and determine cell orientation. Moreover, I suggest that the electrical fields can modulate bidirectional cell migration and cell sorting via dynamic hormetic galvanotaxis analogous to in vitro isoelectric focusing in proton gradients, thus, hormetic morphogen gradients can determine the curvature of vessel walls and their histological patterns.",

Its enormous political, economic, social and psychological impact was mainly due to deeply rooted fear of radiation induced by the linear non-threshold hypothesis (LNT) assumption. It was a historic event that provided invaluable lessons for nuclear industry and risk philosophy. One of them is demonstration that counted per electricity units produced, early Chernobyl fatalities amounted to 0.86 death/GWe-year), and they were 47 times lower than from hydroelectric stations ( approximately 40 deaths/GWe-year). The accident demonstrated that using the LNT assumption as a basis for protection measures and radiation dose limitations was counterproductive, and lead to sufferings and pauperization of millions of inhabitants of contaminated areas.

Here we review the literature on stress-induced adaptations versus stress sensitization in models of neurodegenerative diseases. We also describe our recent findings that chronic proteotoxic stress can elicit adaptations if the dose is low but that high-dose proteotoxic stress sensitizes cells to subsequent challenges. In these experiments, long-term, low-dose proteasome inhibition elicited protection in a superoxide dismutase-dependent manner. In contrast, acute, high-dose proteotoxic stress sensitized cells to subsequent proteotoxic challenges by eliciting catastrophic loss of glutathione. However, even in the latter model of synergistic toxicity, several defensive proteins were upregulated by severe proteotoxicity. This led us to wonder whether high-dose proteotoxic stress can elicit protection against subsequent challenges in astrocytes, a cell type well known for their resilience. In support of this new hypothesis, we found that the astrocytes that survived severe proteotoxicity became harder to kill. The adaptive mechanism was glutathione dependent. If these findings can be generalized to the human brain, similar endogenous adaptations may help explain why neurodegenerative diseases are so delayed in appearance and so slow to progress. In contrast, sensitization to severe stress may explain why defenses eventually collapse in vulnerable neurons.",

First, is the nanomaterial a hazardous waste, toxic substance, or hazardous substance as defined under the environmental laws? A compound that may be defined as hazardous or toxic could have properties at the nano level that are distinctly non-hazardous.

Typically, release reporting is based upon the weight of the hazardous substance that is released, but for nanomaterials a weight threshold might be meaningless.

Rocks from an abandoned uranium mine in Utah were considered for therapeutic application and were examined by \u03b3-ray and laser-induced breakdown fluorescence spectroscopy.

Methods: We evaluated an overdose prevention and response training programme for IDUs run by a community-based organisation in Los Angeles, CA. During a 1-h training session participants learned skills to prevent, recognise, and respond to opioid overdoses, including: calling for emergency services, performing rescue breathing, and administering an intramuscular injection of naloxone (an opioid antagonist). Between September 2006 and January 2008, 93 IDUs were trained. Of those, 66 (71%) enrolled in the evaluation study and 47 participants (71%) completed an interview at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Results: Twenty-one percent of participants were female, 42% were white, 29% African American, and 18% Latino. Most were homeless or lived in temporary accommodation (73%). We found significant increases in knowledge about overdose, in particular about the use of naloxone. Twenty-two participants responded to 35 overdoses during the follow-up period. Twenty-six overdose victims recovered, four died, and the outcome of five cases was unknown. Response techniques included: staying with the victim (85%), administering naloxone (80%), providing rescue breathing (66%), and calling emergency services (60%). The average number of appropriate response techniques used by participants increased significantly from baseline to follow-up (p<0.05). Half (53%) of programme participants reported decreased drug use at follow-up. Conclusion: Overdose prevention and response training programmes may be associated with improved overdose response behaviour, with few adverse consequences and some unforeseen benefits, such as reductions in personal drug use. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to design and optimize a novel drug nanoparticles-loaded oral fast dissolving film (NP-OFDF) using Box-Behnken design-response surface methodology.\\n\\nMETHODS: Drug nanosuspensions produced from high pressure homogenization were transformed into oral fast dissolving film containing drug nanoparticles by casting methods. Herpetrione (HPE), a novel and potent antiviral agent with poor water solubility that was extracted from Herpetospermum caudigerum, was studied as the model drug. The formulations of oral fast dissolving film containing HPE nanoparticles (HPE-NP-OFDF) were optimized by employing Box-Behnken design-response surface methodology and then systematically characterized.\\n\\nRESULTS: The optimized HPE-NP-OFDF was disintegrated in water within 20\u2009s with reconstituted nanosuspensions particle size of 299.31\u2009nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that well-dispersed HPE nanoparticles with slight adhesion to each other were exposed on the surface of film or embedded in film. The X-ray diffractogram (XRD) analysis suggested that HPE in the HPE-NP-OFDF was in the amorphous state. In-vitro release study, approximate 77.23% of HPE was released from the HPE-NP-OFDF within 5\u2009min, which was more than eight times compared with that of HPE raw materials (9.57%).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The optimized HPE-NP-OFDF exhibits much faster drug release rates compared to HPE raw material, which indicated that this novel NP-OFDF may provide a potential opportunity for oral delivery of drugs with poor water solubility.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review: Club drugs are a phenomenon that emerged during the past decade, and knowledge about them continues to evolve. The present review summarizes research published in the past year on 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine ('ecstasy'), (gamma)-hydroxybutyrate, ketamine, and Rohypnol. These substances are described and the latest epidemiologic information is provided, and reports of patterns of use, adverse effects, pharmacology, toxicology, and management in the acute care setting are reviewed. Recent studies on the presence or absence of neurologic, psychiatric, and psychologic problems related to use of these drugs are also reported. Recent findings: An examination of the literature has shown that each of the club drugs has different properties and often different users. Each drug has different adverse effects and requires different acute care protocols. Although club drugs were identified early, scientific information about these drugs is still evolving. There are increasing numbers of studies on the short-term and long-term effects of these drugs in humans, but because of limitations on research in humans they may not always be as rigorous as desired, and can be cited by club drug users to discredit findings of harm. This has led to reliance on web-based sites that may or may not provide accurate data. Evaluated protocols for use in chemical dependency treatment for each of these drugs are still missing. Summary: The evolving club drug phenomenon must continue to be monitored. Additional research is needed to document effects on humans and to educate clinicians on the unique properties of each drug. Research-based treatment for dependence on club drugs is needed.",

        "abstract": "Expression and activity of several key drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and transporters are altered in various pathophysiological conditions, leading to altered drug metabolism and disposition. This can have profound impact on the pharmacotherapy of widely used clinically relevant medications in terms of safety and efficacy by causing inter-individual variabilities in drug responses. This review article highlights altered drug disposition in inflammation and infectious diseases, and commonly encountered disorders such as cancer, obesity/diabetes, fatty liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. Many of the clinically relevant drugs have a narrow therapeutic index. Thus any changes in the disposition of these drugs may lead to reduced efficacy and increased toxicity. The implications of changes in DMEs and transporters on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of clinically-relevant medications are also discussed. Inflammation-mediated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) are known to play a major role in down-regulation of DMEs and transporters. Although the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear, several studies have shown that inflammation-associated cell-signaling pathway and its interaction with basal transcription factors and nuclear receptors in regulation of DMEs and transporters play a significant role in altered drug metabolism. Altered regulation of DMEs and transporters in a multitude of disease states will contribute towards future development of powerful in vitro and in vivo tools in predicting the drug response and opt for better drug design and development. The goal is to facilitate a better understanding of the mechanistic details underlying the regulation of DMEs and transporters in pathophysiological conditions.",

Both types of responses are pro-inflammatory and are probably primary players in the perpetuation of the chronic inflammatory reaction characteristic of atherosclerosis. The immunologic response to modified LDL can be directed to MHC-II-associated peptides in the case of T helper cells, and to a variety of epitopes-modified lysine groups, modified phospholipids, proteins that become associated with oxidized LDL (such as beta2GP1)-in the case of B cell responses. T cell activation is likely to play a major role through cross-activation of macrophages. Humoral responses to modified LDL are pathogenic as a consequence of the formation of antigen-antibody complexes containing modified LDL and IgG antibodies. Those immune complexes induce cholesterol ester accumulation in macrophages and macrophage-like cells, and induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, oxygen active radicals, and matrix metalloproteinases from those cells. There is no conclusive evidence supporting a protective role for IgM antibodies in humans, possibly because autoantibodies to modified lipoproteins are predominantly of the IgG isotype.",

Yet the dose-response curves generated by those assays, usually approximated by four-parameter logistic (4PL) models, are oftentimes difficult to interpret, with no clear indication of which metric should be used to compare them. Here, five commonly used metrics, absolute and relative half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)), area under the dose-response curve (AUC) based on trapezoidal rule and a parametric approach, and the effect at the maximal concentrations (E(max)), were compared in both simulations and real-life scenarios to evaluate their use with 4PL curves. Despite the fact that IC(50) is the most widely used metric to analyze dose-response curves, this study demonstrated that it was not the most reliable of the metrics tested. Fitted AUC showed the best overall performance in both the simulation and real-life scenarios; trapezoidal AUC showed similar performance to fitted AUC in most cases.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacogenetics investigates the influence of genetic variants on physiological phenotypes related to drug response and disease, while pharmacogenomics takes a genome-wide approach to advancing this knowledge. Both play an important role in identifying responders and nonresponders to medication, avoiding adverse drug reactions, and optimizing drug dose for the individual. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the primary target of therapeutic drugs and have been the focus of these studies. With the advance of genomic technologies, there has been a substantial increase in the inventory of naturally occurring rare and common GPCR variants. These variants include single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion or deletions that have potential to alter GPCR expression of function. In vivo and in vitro studies have determined functional roles for many GPCR variants, but genetic association studies that define the physiological impact of the majority of these common variants are still limited. Despite the breadth of pharmacogenetic data available, GPCR variants have not been included in drug labeling and are only occasionally considered in optimizing clinical use of GPCR-targeted agents. In this chapter, pharmacogenetic and genomic studies on GPCR variants are reviewed with respect to a subset of GPCR systems, including the adrenergic, calcium sensing, cysteinyl leukotriene, cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, and the de-orphanized receptors such as GPR55. The nature of the disruption to receptor function is discussed with respect to regulation of gene expression, expression on the cell surface (affected by receptor trafficking, dimerization, desensitization/downregulation), or perturbation of receptor function (altered ligand binding, G protein coupling, constitutive activity). The large body of experimental data generated on structure and function relationships and receptor-ligand interactions are being harnessed for the in silico functional prediction of naturally occurring GPCR variants. We provide information on online resources dedicated to GPCRs and present applications of publically available computational tools for pharmacogenetic studies of GPCRs. As the breadth of GPCR pharmacogenomic data becomes clearer, the opportunity for routine assessment of GPCR variants to predict disease risk, drug response, and potential adverse drug effects will become possible.",

        "abstract": "Emergency readiness has become a public health priority for United States communities after the 9/11 attacks. Communities that have a less developed public health infrastructure are challenged to organize preparedness and response efforts and to ensure that health care providers are capable of caring for victims of terrorist acts. A survey was used to assess non-urban physicians' prior experience with and self-confidence in treating, and preferred training needs for responding to chemical, biologic, radiologic, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) cases. Data were collected through a mailed and Web-based survey. Although the response rate was calculated at 30%, approximately one third of the surveys were not able to be delivered. Most respondents reported never having seen or treated CBRNE-inflicted cases and were not confident in their ability to diagnose or treat CBRNE cases, but many were willing to participate in a state-led response plan. Almost half of the individuals had not participated in any related training but expressed interest in receiving training in small group workshops or through CD-ROM. These results provide potential direction for strategic preparedness planning for non-urban health care providers. Copyright ?? 2005 by the Emergency Nurses Association.",

Many of the systems designed for this task have been incompletely analysed and have unknown frequency responses themselves. We analyse aspects of systems employed previously and show that substantial amplitude and phase errors may have occurred. We describe a plethysmograph-based system which operates in any available gas mixture. A mathematical model of the acoustic microphone used as reference transducer, the microphone preamplifier, and the thermal behaviour of the plethysmograph, is developed to quantify the frequency response of the system. Maximum deviation from a perfect response is less than 1% in amplitude and 1 degree in phase for both pressure and flow measurements over the range 1-100 Hz. Measurements using a pressure transducer mounted on the tip of a catheter indicate that the error due to amplitude and phase variation in the plethysmograph is less than 0.1 dB and 0.4 degrees at 100 Hz.",

        "abstract": "No wholly successful weight-control drugs have been developed to date, despite the tremendous demand. We present an exposure-response model of sibutramine mesylate that can be applied during clinical development of other weight-control drugs. Additionally, we provide a model-based evaluation of sibutramine efficacy. Data from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study were used (N=120). Subjects in the treatment arm were initially given 8.37 mg sibutramine base daily, and those who lost <2 kg after 4 weeks' treatment were escalated to 12.55 mg. The duration of treatment was 24 weeks. Drug concentration and body weight were measured predose and at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 24 weeks after treatment initiation. Exposure and response to sibutramine, including the placebo effect, were modeled using NONMEM 7.2. An asymptotic model approaching the final body weight was chosen to describe the time course of weight loss. Extent of weight loss was described successfully using a sigmoidal exposure-response relationship of the drug with a constant placebo effect in each individual. The placebo effect was influenced by subjects' sex and baseline body mass index. Maximal weight loss was predicted to occur around 1 year after treatment initiation. The difference in mean weight loss between the sibutramine (daily 12.55 mg) and placebo groups was predicted to be 4.5% in a simulation of 1 year of treatment, with considerable overlap of prediction intervals. Our exposure-response model, which included the placebo effect, is the first example of a quantitative model that can be used to predict the efficacy of weight-control drugs. Similar approaches can help decision-making during clinical development of novel weight-loss drugs.",

        "abstract": "Background: The wide accessibility of computer-based technologies like the Internet and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems raises the question of whether population survey data could be collected more easily and cheaply compared to using paper questionnaires. In the area of possibly stigmatized behaviors such as problematic alcohol and drug use, the question extends to whether the prevalence of such behaviors in the general population could be surveyed without compromising the quality of the data. Aims: This study compares Internet and IVR versions of the AUDIT and DUDIT with respect to: (1) response rate, (2) problematic alcohol and drug use and (3) reliability. Method: 5000 individuals, randomly selected from the Swedish general population, were contacted via postal mail and invited to complete the AUDIT and DUDIT questionnaires via Internet or IVR. In total, 1861 (37.8%) participated in the study, 1089 via Internet and 772 via IVR. Results: The Internet administration mode yielded a higher response rate (38.1%) compared to the IVR mode (33.9%). When respondents were given a choice between Internet and IVR, a higher response rate resulted (43.2-46.6%). Problematic alcohol and drug use occurred among 21.1% and 2.8% of the sample, respectively, with no significant differences by administration mode. Both the AUDIT and DUDIT exhibited satisfactory reliability across administration modes, Cronbach's ?? 0.76/0.86. Conclusions: Data quality does not deteriorate with computerized administration methods for the AUDIT and DUDIT in population studies but paper questionnaires should also be made available to respondents in order to maximize response rates. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

This later rise was mainly a result of increases in resistance to nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (from 5.4% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2009, P=0.24) and protease inhibitors (1.5% to 2.1%, P=0.12). Thymidine analogue mutations, including T215 revertants, remained the most frequent mutations associated with nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, despite a considerable fall in stavudine and zidovudine use between 2002 and 2009 (from 29.4% of drug regimens in 2002 to 0.8% in 2009, from 47.9% to 8.8%, respectively).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The previously observed decline in the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in HIV-1 infections probably acquired in the UK seems to have stabilised. The continued high prevalence of thymidine analogue mutations suggests that the source of this resistance may be increasingly from patients who have not undergone antiretroviral therapy and who harbour resistant viruses. Testing of all newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive people should be continued.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a family of short non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Rapidly growing evidence indicates that miRNAs play a key role in drug (xenobiotic) metabolism. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the current knowledge of the role of miRNAs in the regulation of drug (xenobiotic) metabolizing genes and the cellular responses to exposure to exogenous toxicants. The literature search was performed using the PubMed database (up to March 2012). EXPERT OPINION: miRNAs play a major role in control of the proper functioning of the cellular drug metabolizing system. Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to environmental and occupational toxicants and therapeutic drugs may alter the expression of miRNAs, including those that regulate the expression of drug metabolizing genes. This suggests that drug-induced (xenobiotic-induced) miRNA abnormalities may be one of the underlying mechanisms in the pathogenesis of exposure-related pathologies, and that miRNAs may be potential non-invasive biomarkers of exposure and indicators of the severity of tissue injury induced by toxicants. Also, the evaluation of the expression of miRNAs may be applied for the chemical and drug safety assessment. Additionally, differences in the expression of miRNAs that target drug metabolizing genes may be important determinants for inter-individual differences in sensitivity to toxicants and can serve as critical biomarkers for identifying subpopulations sensitive to exposure.",

Drug interactions were assessed isobolographically. Activity of efflux pumps was tested using specific fluorochromes. Antitretroviral concentrations were quantitated by HPLC. Results indicated that: (1) the antimalarials (mefloquine > chloroquine) inhibited the replication of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant HIV-1 at therapeutically achievable concentrations and specifically impaired the formation of fusion-competent viral glycoproteins; (2) anti-HIV-1 effects were additive to those of zidovudine and nevirapine, and synergistic to those of lopinavir; (3) the antimalarials (mefloquine > chloroquine) inhibited the P-glycoprotein, multidrug-resistance-associated proteins, and breast-cancer resistance-associated protein; (4) Chloroquine, but not mefloquine, increased lopinavir concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by approximately 5 (five)-fold. Thus quinoline antimalarials inhibited HIV-1 replication by a novel mechanism, resulting in additive or synergistic effects in combination with known antiretrovirals. These drugs may also have an impact on the cellular pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals. \u00a9 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The ability to use vitro inactivation kinetic parameters in scaling to in vivo drug-drug interactions (DDIs) for mechanism-based inactivators of human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes was examined using eight human P450-selective marker activities in pooled human liver microsomes. These data were combined with other parameters (systemic C(max), estimated hepatic inlet C(max), fraction unbound, in vivo P450 enzyme degradation rate constants estimated from clinical pharmacokinetic data, and fraction of the affected drug cleared by the inhibited enzyme) to predict increases in exposure to drugs, and the predictions were compared with in vivo DDIs gathered from clinical studies reported in the scientific literature. In general, the use of unbound systemic C(max) as the inactivator concentration in vivo yielded the most accurate predictions of DDI with a mean -fold error of 1.64. Abbreviated in vitro approaches to identifying mechanism-based inactivators were developed. Testing potential inactivators at a single concentration (IC(25)) in a 30-min preincubation with human liver microsomes in the absence and presence of NADPH followed by assessment of P450 marker activities readily identified those compounds known to be mechanism-based inactivators and represents an approach that can be used with greater throughput. Measurement of decreases in IC(50) occurring with a 30-min preincubation with liver microsomes and NADPH was also useful in identifying mechanism-based inactivators, and the IC(50) measured after such a preincubation was highly correlated with the k(inact)/K(I) ratio measured after a full characterization of inactivation. Overall, these findings support the conclusion that P450 in vitro inactivation data are valuable in predicting clinical DDIs that can occur via this mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Pattern analysis has identified two types of response patterns to antidepressants: \"true drug\" response (TDR) and \"placebo pattern\" response (PPR). This study examines the relationship between cognitive factors and TDR and PPR to fluoxetine., Methods: We assessed 310 outpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) who were enrolled in an 8-week open trial of fluoxetine 20 mg/day. Response patterns were determined using the clinical global impressions-improvement (CGI-I). We administered the following self-rated scales to all patients at the baseline visit and at endpoint: perceived stress scale (PSS), cognitions questionnaire (CQ), Beck hopelessness scale (BHS) and dysfunctional attitudes scale (DAS)., Results: One hundred and thirty-four patients had TDR, 66 patients had PPR, and 110 patients were non-responders (NR)., Demographic variables and severity of depression at baseline (HAMD-17) were not significantly different between the two response pattern groups. We compared cognitive factors before and after treatment across patients with TDR and PPR, and there were no significant differences at baseline in CQ, PSS, BHS, and DAS scores. At endpoint, outpatients with PPR had significantly lower scores on the PSS (p < 0.001) compared to the patients with TDR, even after adjusting for multiple comparisons and severity of depression at endpoint., Conclusions: Significant differences in cognitive/psychological factors, specifically lower post-treatment perceived stress, accompany \"placebo\" pattern of response to antidepressant treatment and differentiate it from \"true drug\" response pattern, as defined by pattern analysis.

        "abstract": "Recent experimental and clinical studies suggested that apart from playing an essential role in blood pressure homeostasis, aldosterone is involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and renal diseases by inducing structural changes in the heart, kidney, and vessel wall. The interindividual variation of aldosterone response to antihypertensive treatment is considerable, and is at least partially explained by genetic variation. In this study, we investigated aldosterone response to two antihypertensive drugs-a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Genetic variations in 50 candidate genes were tested for association with aldosterone response in four independent samples: African American (AA) responders to a diuretic (n = 289), AA responders to an ARB (n = 252), European American (EA) responders to a diuretic (n = 295) and EA responders to an ARB (n = 300). Linear regression was used to test the association with inclusion of age, sex, and body mass index as covariates. The results indicated the existence of one or more variants in the kininogen gene (KNG) that influence interindividual variation in aldosterone response. The significant association was replicated in three of four studied groups. The single nucleotide polymorphism rs4686799 was associated in AA and EA responders to the diuretic (P = 0.04 and P = 0.07, respectively), and rs5030062 and rs698078 were significantly associated in EA responders to the diuretic (P = 0.05 and P = 0.01) and EA responders to the ARB (P = 0.04 and P = 0.02). Although the clinical implication of KNG gene variation to antihypertensive drug response is yet to be determined, this novel candidate locus provides important new insights into drug response physiology.",

        "abstract": "When exposed to drug conditioned cues (stimuli associated with the drug), addicted individuals experience an intense desire for the drug, which is associated with increased dopamine cell firing. We hypothesized that drug-related words can trigger activation in the mesencephalon, where dopaminergic cells are located. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 15 individuals with cocaine use disorders and 15 demographically matched healthy control subjects pressed buttons for color of drug-related versus neutral words. Results showed that the drug words, but not neutral words, activated the mesencephalon in the cocaine users only. Further, in the cocaine users only, these increased drug-related mesencephalic responses were associated with enhanced verbal fluency specifically for drug words. Our results for the first time demonstrate fMRI response to drug words in cocaine-addicted individuals in mesencephalic regions as possibly associated with dopaminergic mechanisms and with conditioning to language (in this case drug words). The correlation between the brief verbal fluency test, which can be easily administered (crucial for clinical studies), and fMRI cue reactivity could be used as a biomarker of neurobiological changes in addiction.",

Nonetheless, challenges persist in the use of immunosuppressive medications. Marked interindividual variability remains in drug concentrations and drug response. As medications with narrow therapeutic indices, variations in immunosuppressant concentrations can result in acute toxicity or transplant rejection. Recent studies have begun to identify factors that contribute to this variability with the promise of tailoring immunosuppressive regimens to the individual patient. These advances have uncovered differences in genetic composition in drug-metabolising enzymes, drug transporters and drug targets. This review focuses on commonly used maintenance immunosuppressants (including cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, azathioprine and corticosteroids), examines current studies on pharmacogenetic differences in drug-metabolising enzymes, drug transporters and drug targets and addresses common drug-drug interactions with immunosuppressant therapies. The potential role of drug-metabolising enzymes in contributing to these drug-drug interactions is briefly considered.",

Methods: Multiple search strategies: (a) peer-reviewed literature searches (1990-2008) using methods recommended by the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group; (b) systematic searches of online databases; (c) Internet searches to find other published evidence of drug use; (d) repeated consultation and feedback from experts around the globe; (e) a viral email sent to lists of researchers in the illicit drug and HIV fields. Data were extracted and graded according to predefined variables reflecting quality of data source. Results: Qualitative evidence of illicit drug use and dependence was found for most countries, which hold over 98% of the world's population aged 15-64 years. Countries where use was identified but prevalence estimates had not been made (evidence of drug supply, trafficking, reports of use, treatment data) were mainly from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Oceania. Estimates of the prevalence of use were located in 77 countries for meth/amphetamine, 95 for cannabis, 86 for cocaine and 89 for opioids. Dependence prevalence estimates existed in very few countries; 9 meth/amphetamine dependence estimates, 7 cannabis dependence estimates, 5 cocaine dependence estimates, and 25 opioid dependence estimates were located. Conclusions: Data on the extent of meth/amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and opioid use and dependence must be improved in quality and coverage. Dependence estimates are lacking even in high income countries that have required resources. Responses to illicit drug dependence require better estimates of its scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: Adolescents with substance use disorders (SUD, n= 15) and comparison youth (CON, n= 17) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during anticipation or reception of a positively valenced \"Soft Touch\" consisting of MR-CF stimulation to the palm or forearm. Visual analog scales (VAS) indexed subjective interoceptive experience (e.g., pleasantness, intensity). Results: Across all conditions, SUD displayed attenuated left posterior insula activation compared to CON. Greater left anterior insula and right lentiform nucleus activation was evident during the application of soft touch for SUD but not for CON. Whereas for CON, greater left anterior insula activation was associated with higher pleasantness ratings, pleasantness was linked to less anterior insula activation in SUD. Finally, within SUD, attenuated posterior insula activation was related to more recent cannabis use. Conclusions: SUD adolescents exhibit blunted somatovisceral processing of pleasant stimulation, heightened sensitivity in regions responsible for processing reward value, and altered relationships between interoceptive processing and subjective experience. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

The incorporation of drugs into Pluronic micelles results in increased solubility and stability of drugs. Consequently, the micelles are used for delivery of drugs in the body. Pluronic unimers sensitize multidrug-resistant cells by inhibiting drug efflux transporters. This allows for the development of formulations for the treatment of multidrug-resistant and metastatic tumors. Furthermore, these formulations can be used to enhance brain and oral bioavailability of various drugs. Finally, Pluronic formulations were shown to enhance transgene expression in the body. This opens new possibilities for the use of Pluronic in gene therapies.",

        "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury is a frequent cause of hepatic dysfunction. Reliably establishing whether the liver disease was caused by a drug requires the exclusion of other plausible causes and the search for a clinical drug signature. The drug signature consists of the pattern of liver test abnormality, the duration of latency to symptomatic presentation, the presence or absence of immune-mediated hypersensitivity and the response to drug withdrawal. Determination of causality also includes an evaluation of individual susceptibility to drug-induced liver injury. This susceptibility is governed by both genetic and environmental factors. Components of the drug signature in conjunction with certain risk factors have been incorporated into formal scoring systems that are predictive of the likelihood of drug-induced liver injury. The most validated scoring system is the Roussel-Uclaf causality assessment method, which nonetheless retains certain imperfections. Mitigating the potential for drug-induced liver injury is achieved by the identification of toxicity signals during clinical trials and the monitoring of liver tests in clinical practice. There are three signals of liver toxicity in clinical trials: (i) a statistically significant doubling (or more) in the incidence of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation >3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); (ii) any incidence of serum ALT elevation >8-10 x ULN; and (iii) any incidence of serum ALT elevation >3 x ULN accompanied by a serum bilirubin elevation >2 x ULN. Monitoring of liver tests in clinical practice has shown unconvincing efficacy, but where a benefit-risk analysis would favour continued therapy, monthly monitoring may have some benefit compared with no monitoring at all. With rare exception, treatment of drug-induced liver injury is principally supportive. Drug toxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure, defined as a prolonged prothrombin time (international normalised ratio (greater-than or equal to)1.5) and any degree of mental alteration occurring <26 weeks after the onset of illness in a patient without pre-existing cirrhosis. A patient who meets these criteria must be evaluated for liver transplantation. The pathogenesis of drug-induced liver injury can be examined on the basis of the two principal patterns of injury. The hepatocellular pattern is characterised by a predominant rise in the level of transaminases and results from the demise of hepatocytes by means of either apoptosis or necrosis. The cholestatic pattern is characterised by a predominant rise of the serum alkaline phosphatase level and usually results from injury to the bile ductular cells either directly by the drug or its metabolite, or indirectly by an adaptive immune response.

Despite this, valid and systematic data on the extent and nature of injecting drug use are rare, and only a limited number of HIV prevention interventions currently operate in the city. In response, the Universidad Nacional de Rosario have used the Spanish translation of the Rapid Assessment and Response Guide on Injecting Drug Use (IDU-RAR) developed by the World Health Organization (WHO. The Rapid Assessment and Response Guide on Injecting Drug Use (draft for field testing). Geneva: WHO, 1998) as a first step in producing more detailed research data, identifying urgently needed interventions, and designing a long-term harm reduction strategy for Rosario. This paper describes this process and the outcomes of the assessment where key findings indicate that: 65% of those sampled were HIV positive; 70% shared injecting equipment; the majority were not in contact with drug treatment services; 13% were under the age of 20; and 62% of those injecting drug users with HIV had neither medical care or treatment for their condition.

Four nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily members, including pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2), constitutive androstane receptor (NR1I3), farnesoid X receptor (NR1H4), and vitamin D receptor (NR1I1), play pivotal roles in drug- and bile-acid-activated programs of gene expression to coordinately regulate drug- and bile-acid transport activity in the intestine and liver.

The prevalence of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolism varies widely with ethnicity, and marked differences in the distribution of allelic variants of genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes have been documented in populations of different racial origin. This review aimed to summarize the available studies on genetic polymorphisms associated with drug metabolism conducted in Italian populations and to compare the frequency of the various metabolizer phenotypes and most common variant alleles (and resulting genotypes) with corresponding values from other populations.

        "abstract": "Why do seemingly identical cells respond differently to a drug? To address this, we studied the dynamics and variability of the protein response of human cancer cells to a chemotherapy drug, camptothecin. We present a dynamic-proteomics approach that measures the levels and locations of nearly 1000 different endogenously tagged proteins in individual living cells at high temporal resolution. All cells show rapid translocation of proteins specific to the drug mechanism, including the drug target (topoisomerase-1), and slower, wide-ranging temporal waves of protein degradation and accumulation. However, the cells differ in the behavior of a subset of proteins. We identify proteins whose dynamics differ widely between cells, in a way that corresponds to the outcomes-cell death or survival. This opens the way to understanding molecular responses to drugs in individual cells.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated significant associations between several candidate genes (DRD2, DRD3, 5HTR2A and 5HTR2C, COMT and MTHFR) and antipsychotic drug response. The present study investigates the effect of nine polymorphisms in these genes for an association with antipsychotic treatment response. 329 Caucasian patients with a non-affective psychotic disorder using antipsychotics were included. All patients participated in the longitudinal GROUP-study in The Netherlands. We genotyped 9 SNPs in 6 candidate genes (DRD2: TaqI_A, -141C; DRD3: Ser9Gly; HTR2A: 102-T/C, His452Tyr; HTR2C: Cys23Ser; COMT: Val158Met; MTHFR: 677-C/T) using standard protocols. Polymorphisms were based on previous studies showing associations with positive symptoms treatment response. The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale was used to assess improvement in positive psychotic symptoms since the start of current antipsychotic treatment. Ordinal regression was used for association analyses. Ninety percent of the patients used second generation antipsychotics, with olanzapine (28%) and risperidone (29%) being the most prescribed drugs. Ser9Gly of the dopamine D3 receptor gene (P value 0.034) and 677-C/T of MTHFR (P value 0.019) were tested statistically significant. Gly-carriers and T-carriers, respectively, showed more clinical improvement on the CGI-I. The other polymorphisms did not show a statistically significant association (P values>0.10). In conclusion, we replicated two out of nine of the previously reported associations between polymorphisms and treatment response. The direction and magnitude of the associations presented here in DRD3 (Ser9Gly) and MTHFR (677-C/T) are in line with previous association studies in Caucasian patients. These polymorphisms may be of value for predicting clinical response.",

        "abstract": "The assessment of drug interactions for a simple turnover system when the basic pharmacodynamic response is governed by indirect mechanisms was explored. This report describes a diverse array of possible in vivo pharmacodynamic effects from a combination of two drugs acting by similar or different indirect mechanisms. Various conditions of pharmacodynamic drug combinations were explored mathematically and by simulation: (a) interactions of two drugs acting simultaneously either on the production (k(in)) or on the dissipation (k(out)) processes controlling the in vivo response by competitive (four cases) or non-competitive interaction (six cases); and (b) combinations of two drugs acting on separate k(in) and k(out) processes simultaneously (four cases). A range of different combinations of drug doses was used. Plasma concentration time profiles were generated according to monoexponential disposition. Pharmacodynamic response profiles were simulated using the above conditions and characterized by descriptors such as Area Between Effect (and Baseline) Curve (ABEC) values. The interaction of agents by competitive mechanisms produced net responses that were additive in nature. Response profiles for non-competitive interactions on the same process were both antagonistic (for two drugs with effects that oppose each other) and synergistic (for two drugs that produce the same response). On the other hand, response signatures for agents acting non-competitively on the production and dissipation factors by opposing mechanisms (e.g. inhibiting k(in) plus stimulating k(out)) showed dramatic changes in net effects and produced apparent drug synergy. Net indirect response profiles for joint use of two or more drugs measured by ABEC values may look \"additive\", \"antagonistic\", or \"synergistic\" depending on doses, their intrinsic potencies, the nature of interaction (competitive or non-competitive) as well as their mechanisms of action. These models may help explain changes in pharmacologic responses to two agents in a more rational and mechanistic fashion than older empirical methods.",

In the present study, a two-component drug delivery system is presented consisting of degradable particles loaded with fluorescein isothiocyanate and a separate protease formulation for degradation. The particles were applied alone, 30 minutes previous to the protease application and simultaneously with the protease onto porcine skin. Subsequently, biopsies were removed and the penetration depths of the particles were analysed using laser scanning microscopy. The obtained results demonstrate that the particles alone achieved a penetration depth of around 900 \u03bcm. Similar results were obtained for the successive application of particles and protease, whereas a release of the fluorescent dye was only observed in the upper 250 \u03bcm corresponding to the penetration depth of the protease. In the case of the simultaneous application, the particles were partly dissolved before application, leading to a reduced particle size and diminished penetration depth. The results revealed that degradable particles are a promising tool for drug delivery into the skin.",

        "abstract": "Placebo response impacts the development of treatments for central nervous system disorders. Despite significant attention in scientific literature, the magnitude of placebo response continues to increase. The present work reviews empirical and theoretical literature on associations of trial design features, patient selection, and investigative site selection with signal detection and placebo response. Trials with greater percentages of patients randomized to placebo had smaller average placebo responses and larger average drug-placebo differences in comprehensive meta-analyses of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Excluding patients with large responses during double-blind placebo lead-ins reduced placebo response and increased drug-placebo differences, but that advantage was nearly offset by the decrease in sample size. Core factor subscales of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) yielded larger drug-placebo differences than the HAMD total score. Theoretical considerations suggest that the number of sites and number of patients per site can influence power, with the optimal combination of the two being influenced by the correlation structure and therefore being situation dependent. Similar considerations apply to the number of countries and number of sites per country. Sequential parallel comparison and randomized withdrawal designs hold promise for improved signal detection. Patient selection and assessment of changes in illness severity may benefit from remote and independent evaluation as well as patient self-reports. Given the complexities of signal detection and placebo response, no single strategy will solve all the problems and combinations of approaches may be most useful. \u00a9 2014 Springer International Publishing.",

        "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions are very common during a systemic drug therapy. Most of these are fortunately mild or moderate and transient. Serious adverse drug reactions often lead to hospitalisation. Drug-drug interactions can also contribute substantially to differences in drug response. Drug-induced inhibition of drug metabolising enzymes is usually competitive and causes an increased exposure of the drug whose metabolism is inhibited. This usually results in a higher incidence of adverse drug reactions and an increased severity. Conversely enzyme induction increases the metabolic capacity thereby reducing the exposure of a drug with sometimes loss of drug effects (nonresponse). Detailed knowledge of the causative mechanisms will help detecting and avoiding severe adverse drug reactions.",

        "abstract": "Interpatient variability in drug response can be widely explained by genetically determined differences in metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and drug targets, leading to different pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic behaviors of drugs. Genetic variations affect or do not affect drug responses depending on their influence on protein activity and the relevance of such proteins in the pathway of the drug. Also, the frequency of such genetic variations differs among populations, so the clinical relevance of a specific variation is not the same in all of them. In this study, a panel of 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 14 different genes (ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, MTHFR, NOD2/CARD15, SLCO1A2, SLCO1B1, TPMT, and UGT1A9), encoding for the most relevant metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters relating to immunosuppressant agents, was analyzed to determine the genotype profile and allele frequencies in comparison with HapMap data. A total of 570 Spanish white recipients and donors of solid organ transplants were included. In 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms, statistically significant differences in allele frequency were observed. The largest differences (>100%) occurred in ABCB1 rs2229109, ABCG2 rs2231137, CYP3A5 rs776746, NOD2/CARD15 rs2066844, TPMT rs1800462, and UGT1A9 rs72551330. In conclusion, differences were recorded between the Spanish and other white populations in terms of allele frequency and genotypic distribution. Such differences may have implications in relation to dose requirements and drug-induced toxicity. These data are important for further research to help explain interindividual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability in response to drug therapy.",

Using whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays, we have examined the kinetics of gene expression changes in a cisplatin-sensitive cell line, A2780, and its cisplatin-resistant derivative, ACRP. Both sensitive and resistant cell lines exhibited a very similar response of p53-inducible genes as early as 16 h after treatment. This p53 response was further increased at the 24-h time point.

        "abstract": "When multiple drugs are administered simultaneously, investigators are often interested in assessing whether the drug combinations are synergistic, additive, or antagonistic. Existing response surface models are not adequate to capture the complex patterns of drug interactions. We propose a two-component semiparametric response surface model with a parametric function to describe the additive effect of a combination dose and a nonparametric function to capture the departure from the additive effect. The nonparametric function is estimated using the technique developed in thin plate splines, and the pointwise bootstrap confidence interval for this function is constructed. The proposed semiparametric model offers an effective way of formulating the additive effect while allowing the flexibility of modeling a departure from additivity. Example and simulations are given to illustrate that the proposed model provides an excellent estimation for different patterns of interactions between two drugs.",

        "abstract": "Although Akt is known to be associated with drug resistance, its role in cyclic AMP (cAMP)-related inhibition of cell proliferation is not clear. Here, we report that Akt modulates the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to cAMP. Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG(2) and Bel-7402) with cAMP inhibited proliferation, with HepG(2) cells showing lower sensitivity to cAMP. Biochemical studies showed that cAMP increased FBS-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in HepG(2) cells, but completely inhibited FBS-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in Bel-7402 cells, suggesting that the differential response of Akt to cAMP in these two cell lines might contribute to their differential sensitivity. LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor that inhibits FBS-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, restored the sensitivity of HepG(2) cells to cAMP and API-2 (Akt/protein kinase B signaling inhibitor-2) also showed similar effect. These results collectively indicate that the response level of Akt to cAMP may play a critical role in determining drug sensitivity.",

Electronic cigarettes, also called \u201ce-cigarettes,\u201d are battery-operated devices that generally contain cartridges filled with nicotine, flavor and other chemicals. The electronic cigarette turns nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. These products are marketed and sold to young people and are readily available online and in shopping malls. They are also available in different flavors, such as chocolate and mint, which may appeal to young people. The FDA\u2019s Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of electronic cigarettes. In one sample, the FDA\u2019s analyses detected diethylene glycol, a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans, and in several other samples, the FDA analyses detected carcinogens, including nitrosamines. These products do not contain any health warnings comparable to FDA-approved nicotine replacement products or conventional cigarettes. Because these products have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, at this time the agency has no way of knowing, except for the limited testing it has performed, the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user.

METHODS: The visco-elastic properties of blank organogels were measured by rheometer. The E2 organogel formulations were optimized using a central composite design. Also, the effect of gelator structure and composition of the gel formulations on release behavior (in vitro and in vivo) had been studied. RESULTS: The change of the gelator structure could affect significantly the stiffness of the implants. The release behavior of gel without N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) was controlled by gel corrosion only. While the drug release of the gel with NMP was controlled by both corrosion and diffusion. The high initial release problems of the organogels were improved by optimizing the formulations. The system consisting by N-Lauroyl L-lysine methyl ester (LLM) derivative in the oil indicated the lowest initial drug release, showed a much lower blood drug level and maintained a steady state for nearly 1 month.

        "title": "Influence of Antisocial Personality Subtypes on Drug Abuse Treatment Response",
        "abstract": "This methodological study examined the impact of antisocial personality disorder (APD) and other psychiatric comorbidity on drug use and treatment retention in 513 new admissions to methadone maintenance treatment. Patients were classified into one of four groups: APD ONLY, APD plus other psychiatric disorder (APD MIXED), other psychiatric disorder, and no psychiatric disorder. Patients completed research assessments and were then followed for 1 year of treatment. Patients with APD had longer histories of heroin and cocaine use than non-APD patients and were more likely to meet criteria for cocaine dependence. Distinct clinical profiles emerged that differentiated APD ONLY from APD MIXED. APD ONLY patients exhibited higher rates of cocaine and heroin use, whereas those with APD MIXED exhibited higher rates of benzodiazepine use. Self-report measures supported urinalysis results, but group differences did not affect treatment retention. These differences in clinical profiles should be considered when evaluating treatment performance in substance abusers with APD. Antisocial personality disorder (APD) is one of the most prevalent comorbid psychiatric diagnoses in drug abusers (Brooner et al., 1997, 1998; Khantzian and Treece, 1985; Rounsaville et al., 1982). Retrospective studies have consistently shown that treatment-seeking drug abusers with APD have more extensive and severe drug use problems compared with those without the APD diagnosis (Brooner et al., 1997; Woody et al., 1985). Despite these well-documented differences, retrospective and prospective studies evaluating the impact of APD on drug abuse treatment response have produced less consistent findings. Although results from several studies provide empirical evidence that conduct disorder and APD are associated with poorer response to treatment (Alterman et al., 1996; Carroll et al., 1993; Crowley et al., 1998; Woody et al., 1985), other studies have not replicated this association (e.g.,Cacciola et al., 1995; Darke et al., 1994; Gill et al., 1992). The lack of more consistent findings across studies raises questions about the influence of APD on treatment response in drug abusers. One possible explanation is that the presence of additional psychiatric disorders in patients with APD moderates the effects of the APD diagnosis on treatment response (Alterman and Cacciola, 1991). This perspective can be systematically evaluated because a substantial proportion of drug abusers with APD also satisfy criteria for other axis I and II disorders (Brooner et al., 1997; Rounsaville et al., 1982; Woody et al., 1985). Previous studies have shown that the presence of other axis I and II psychiatric diagnoses in APD drug abusers (APD mixed) is associated with increased neuroticism and psychiatric distress compared with drug abusers with APD only (Brooner et al., 1993, 1997; Rousar et al., 1994). Similar findings have also been observed in drug abusers without the APD diagnosis. A substantial proportion of these patients have axis I and II diagnoses excluding APD (e.g.,Brooner et al., 1997; Rounsaville et al., 1982). They also have higher scores on neuroticism and general psychiatric distress when compared with substance abusers without additional psychiatric diagnoses (Brooner et al., 1993; Rousar et al., 1994; Woody et al., 1985). These findings may have clinical significance because substance abusers with a history of major depression (Rounsaville et al., 1986, 1987) or with high psychiatric severity ratings (McLellan et al., 1983) have been found to have poorer response to treatment. In addition, specific vulnerability to benzodiazepine abuse has been found in methadone maintenance patients who report high psychiatric distress (Darke et al., 1993). Collapsing across these distinct subgroups of drug abusers might confound evaluations of the impact of APD on treatment response. This fact was demonstrated in a study by Woody et al. (1985) comparing response to routine drug abuse counseling with and without the addition of expertly delivered cognitive-behavioral or interpersonal psychotherapy. Patients had been stabilized on methadone an average of 4 months before study participation. Although the methadone treated patients with APD in that study showed less improvement from either treatment condition than patients without the APD diagnosis, further analyses revealed that APD patients with a lifetime history of mood disorder responded significantly better across several measures than patients with the APD diagnosis only. A more recent study by Alterman et al. (1996) compared the treatment response of new admissions to standard methadone maintenance treatment who were assigned to one of four diagnostic subgroups: APD only, APD plus depression, depression only, and no other psychiatric disorder. They found modest evidence of poorer treatment responding in the APD only versus APD plus depression subgroup on drug use and on Addiction Severity Index legal, employment, and family/social composite severity scores. Taken together, these studies suggest that the APD mixed versus APD only distinction may help clarify the influence of APD on response to drug abuse treatment interventions. The present methodological study was conducted to further evaluate the implications of this diagnostic distinction. Research participants were new admissions to a long-term opioid agonist treatment program in Baltimore, Maryland. They were categorized using lifetime nonsubstance use psychiatric diagnoses into one of four mutually exclusive subgroups: a) APD without other psychiatric diagnoses-APD ONLY, b) APD plus other lifetime axis I or II psychiatric diagnoses-APD MIXED, c) lifetime psychiatric disorder(s) other than APD-OTHER, or d) no psychiatric diagnoses beyond substance use disorders-NONE. The four groups were compared on baseline demographics and both lifetime and current rates of substance use diagnoses. Drug abuse treatment response was assessed by comparing the groups on the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) administered about 1 month after admission to treatment, urine specimens collected over the first year of treatment, and 12-month treatment survival rates. The first set of analyses covering patterns of drug use and other psychiatric diagnoses and demographics were exploratory in nature. Specific hypotheses were tested in subsequent analyses comparing treatment response of the two subgroups of APD patients to each other and to the remaining two diagnostic subgroups. We hypothesized that the APD ONLY patients would be less responsive to routine treatment than the other three groups, so patients classified with APD ONLY were expected to report more legal problems, more family/social problems, more drug use, and poorer treatment retention compared with patients assigned to the OTHER and NONE diagnostic subgroups. The presence of additional psychiatric diagnoses in the APD MIXED group was hypothesized to alter the influence of the antisocial diagnosis on treatment response. Therefore, the APD MIXED group was expected to have legal problems, family/social problems, and rates of opioid and cocaine use falling between those displayed by the APD ONLY and the remaining two subgroups. Because benzodiazepine abuse is associated with increased psychiatric distress in methadone maintenance patients, we hypothesized that the APD MIXED group would have a higher rate of benzodiazepine use and greater psychiatric distress than the APD ONLY and NONE groups. No group differences were expected on employment or medical problems because all of the patients had extensive histories of severe drug dependence, which is strongly associated with the type of employment and health problems covered by the ASI interview.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacogenomics is a field aimed at understanding the genetic contribution to variability in drug efficacy and toxicity. The goal is to be able to select the drugs with the greatest likelihood of benefit and the least likelihood of harm in individual patients, based on their genetic make-up. Pharmacogenetics has historically been a field focused primarily on genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes and their impact on drug efficacy and toxicity. More recently, investigators have begun to study the relationship between drug target polymorphisms and drug efficacy and toxicity. There are now numerous examples in the literature of associations between drug target polymorphisms and drug effect. Drug targets can be broken into three main categories: the direct protein target of the drug, signal transduction cascades or downstream proteins, and disease pathogenesis proteins. While the drug target pharmacogenetics literature provides 'proof of concept' that genetic variability contributes to the variability in drug response, the data are not to the point of being clinically useful in most cases. Specific problems to date include the inability of a single polymorphism to be highly predictive of response, and inconsistencies across studies of the same polymorphism. It seems likely that an important factor in the above limitations is the approach of focusing on a single polymorphism in a single gene. Given that most drug responses involve a large number of proteins, all of whose genes could have several polymorphisms, it seems unlikely that a single polymorphism in a single gene would explain a high degree of drug response variability in a consistent fashion. Thus, it seems that a polygenic, or genomic approach will be more appropriate. Candidate gene and genome scanning approaches to pharmacogenomics have shown promise in relating drug target polymorphisms to response or toxicity, and pharmacogenomic strategies for drug discovery and drug development are now being implemented by most major pharmaceutical companies. Pharmacogenomics has the potential to significantly enhance the ability of clinicians to use medications in a safe and effective manner and, as such, represents an exciting field with tremendous clinical potential.",

Although activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) now appears to play a role in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF), it remains to be determined if ACE genotype impacts response to conventional AAD therapy in patients with AF. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether response to antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy in patients with AF is modulated by the ACE I/D polymorphism. Methods: We studied 213 patients (147 men, 66 women; ages 52 ?? 15 years) prospectively enrolled in the Vanderbilt AF Registry. AAD therapy outcome was defined prospectively as response if there was a ???75% reduction in symptomatic AF burden or nonresponse if AF burden was unchanged, necessitating a change in drugs or therapy. Results: Lone AF (age <65 years, no identifiable cause) was present in 72 (34%) patients, whereas hypertension was the most common underlying disease in the remaining 141 (41%). AF was paroxysmal in 170 (80%) and persistent in 43 (20%). The frequencies of the DD, ID, and II genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Lone AF and DD/ID genotypes were highly significant predictors of failure of drug therapy (P <.005). In patients with lone AF, failure of drug response was 5%, 41%, and 47% in patients with II, ID, and DD genotypes, respectively, (P <.005, II vs. ID/DD). Conclusions: These results provide further evidence for a role of RAAS activation in the pathophysiology of AF and point to a potential role for stratification of therapeutic approaches by ACE genotype. ?? 2007 Heart Rhythm Society.",

        "abstract": "The oncologist's challenges, particularly with advanced cancers, are (a) how to predict tumor response to a given drug or regimen; (b) how to predict which tumors of identical histology will remain indolent and which will be likely to progress; and (c) how to determine the appropriate timing of the emergence of drug-resistant cancer cells and hence switch to appropriate therapy. These issues are still unresolved; current clinical practice is hampered by the complexity and heterogeneity of anti-tumor drug resistance where multiple cellular, tumor microenvironment and host factors operate simultaneously. The rapid accumulation of genomic and proteomic databases for complex biological systems, such as cancer, together with advances in technology platforms, have paved the way to an increased molecular understanding and prediction of antitumor drug response. The complex phenotype of drug resistance can now be dissected and specific, clinically relevant markers pinpointed. Several microarray studies of genetic patterns from untreated and pre-treated cancers have provided \"fingerprints\" that can predict response to therapeutics. Nevertheless, such approaches require further validation in experimental models and in large clinical trials before their routine clinical use. Moreover, comparative transcriptional profiling alone is unlikely to predict drug sensitivity/resistance, a dynamic process where protein phosphorylation, protein trafficking, and protein-protein interactions with secondary effectors play key roles in the fate of cancer cells following therapeutic stress. Functional proteomics is potentially more predictive, but still faces technical challenges with regards to sampling, tumor heterogeneity, and lack of standardized methodologies. These obstacles are surmountable with current concerted research efforts and availability of powerful high-throughput genomic and proteomic instrumentations, and thus approaches to predict and overcome drug resistance could be rationalized.",

        "abstract": "PROBLEM: The Ishinomaki Red Cross Hospital is the only designated disaster hospital in the Ishinomaki Medical Zone, Japan that was undamaged from the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. The tsunami completely destroyed a large part of the Ishinomaki Medical Zone. CONTEXT: The Ishinomaki Red Cross Hospital was designed with the capability to respond to disasters. An instruction manual for responding to disasters had been developed and was exercised through drills. ACTION: In accordance with the manual, the hospital disaster task force was established. The Ishinomaki Zone Joint Relief Team coordinated medical support from organizations such as physicians associations, dental associations, self-defence forces medical teams, pharmacists associations, the Japanese Red Cross and relief teams from hospitals all over the country. In three days, the joint relief team directly visited all emergency shelters to make an initial assessment and to collect information about the number and state of health of evacuees, provision of food and drinking-water and the availability of electricity, water and sewerage. OUTCOME: Initial assessment revealed that 35 emergency shelters lacked a sufficient food supply and that 100 shelters had unsanitary conditions. The joint relief team provided the Miyagi Prefecture government and the Ishinomaki municipal government with information about emergency shelters that did not have sufficient food supply. As of 30 September, the activities of the joint relief team were completed, and there was no outbreak of communicable diseases in the Ishinomaki Medical Zone. A total of 328 shelters with 46 480 evacuees were managed by the Ishinomaki Zone Joint Relief Team. DISCUSSION: Advanced preparation to quickly establish an initial response system, expertise, and decision-making ability and the ability to get things done are required for disaster response management.",

        "abstract": "Skeletal tissues have recently been investigated for use in post-mortem toxicology. Variables affecting drug concentration in these tissues, however, are still poorly characterized. In this work, the relative effects of burial on the response of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) assays were examined. Rats were acutely exposed to ketamine or diazepam, euthanized and buried outdoors. After one month, the remains were exhumed and skeletal tissue drug levels were compared those of non-buried rats. A climate-controlled burial was also undertaken using defleshed bones to approximate an extended decomposition. Long bones (femora, tibiae) were isolated and separated into tissue type (diaphyseal bone, epiphyseal bone, and marrow), and according to treatment (i.e. buried or non-buried). Following methanolic extraction (bone) or simple homogenization (marrow), samples were analyzed with ELISA. Samples were then pooled according to treatment, extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and confirmed with GC-MS. Under the conditions examined, the effects of burial appear to be drug and tissue dependent. Ketamine-exposed tissues demonstrated the greatest differences, especially in bone marrow. In diazepam-exposed tissues, burial did not seem to greatly affect drug response and some gave greater assay response compared to the non-buried set. Overall, the data suggest that fresh tissue samples may not be representative of decomposed samples in terms of skeletal tissue drug levels.",

        "abstract": "These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug-induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents. Apomorphine, a nonselective dopamine agonist, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce hypothermia, and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain. From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine-induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed. In rats, detection of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions. Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug-induced hypothermia. In mice, apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage. Drug-induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only, while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both. By contrast, apomorphine-induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box. Dopamine turnover ratios (DOPAC:DA and HVA:DA) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts. However, apomorphine-induced reductions in striatal dopamine turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environments. The implications of these findings are discussed with particular emphasis upon conducting psychopharmacological challenge tests in rodents. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

        "abstract": "A paradoxical drug reaction constitutes an outcome that is opposite from the outcome that would be expected from the drug's known actions. There are three types: 1. A paradoxical response in a condition for which the drug is being explicitly prescribed. 2. Paradoxical precipitation of a condition for which the drug is indicated, when the drug is being used for an alternative indication. 3. Effects that are paradoxical in relation to an aspect of the pharmacology of the drug but unrelated to the usual indication. In bidirectional drug reactions, a drug may produce opposite effects, either in the same or different individuals, the effects usually being different from the expected beneficial effect. Paradoxical and bidirectional drug effects can sometimes be harnessed for benefit; some may be adverse. Such reactions arise in a wide variety of drug classes. Some are common; others are reported in single case reports. Paradoxical effects are often adverse, since they are opposite the direction of the expected effect. They may complicate the assessment of adverse drug reactions, pharmacovigilance, and clinical management. Bidirectional effects may be clinically useful or adverse. From a clinical toxicological perspective, altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics in overdose may exacerbate paradoxical and bidirectional effects. Certain antidotes have paradoxical attributes, complicating management. Apparent clinical paradoxical or bidirectional effects and reactions ensue when conflicts arise at different levels in self-regulating biological systems, as complexity increases from subcellular components, such as receptors, to cells, tissues, organs, and the whole individual. These may be incompletely understood. Mechanisms of such effects include different actions at the same receptor, owing to changes with time and downstream effects; stereochemical effects; multiple receptor targets with or without associated temporal effects; antibody-mediated reactions; three-dimensional architectural constraints; pharmacokinetic competing compartment effects; disruption and non-linear effects in oscillating systems, systemic overcompensation, and other higher-level feedback mechanisms and feedback response loops at multiple levels. Here we review and provide a compendium of multiple class effects and individual reactions, relevant mechanisms, and specific clinical toxicological considerations of antibiotics, immune modulators, antineoplastic drugs, and cardiovascular, CNS, dermal, endocrine, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, haematological, respiratory, and psychotropic agents.",

We deduce that drugs based on inhibiting parasite production are more effective than those based on inhibiting merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. We extend the model to incorporate, in addition to immune response, drug therapy, following treatment with antimalarial drugs. Using stability analysis of the model, it is shown that infection can be eradicated within the host if the drug efficacy level exceeds a certain threshold value. It will persist if the efficacy is below this threshold. Numerical simulations are done to verify the analytic results and illustrate possible behaviour of the models.",

Most of the major forms of CYP are affected in this manner and this leads to a decrease in the capacity of the liver and other organs to handle drugs, chemicals and some endogenous compounds. The loss in drug metabolism is predominantly an effect resulting from the production of cytokines and the modulation of the transcription factors that control the expression of specific CYP forms. In clinical medicine numerous examples have been reported indicating the occurrence of compromised drug clearance and changes to pharmacokinetics during disease states with an inflammatory component or during infections. For any drug that is metabolised by CYP and has a narrow therapeutic index, there is a significant risk in placing patients in a position where an infection or inflammatory response might lead to aberrant drug handling and an adverse drug response.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Computerised drug interaction surveillance systems (CIS) may be helpful in detecting clinically significant drug interactions. Experience with CIS reveals that they often yield alerts with questionable clinical significance, fail to provide relevant information on risk factors for the adverse reaction of the interaction and fail to detect all significant drug interactions. These problems highlight the importance of transparency and selectivity in choosing the drug interactions to be included in CIS. In The Netherlands, the Working Group on Pharmacotherapy and Drug Information is responsible for maintenance of the CIS of the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy (KNMP). Methods: The Working Group developed an evidence-based procedure for structured assessment of drug-drug interactions and revised all drug interactions in the CIS accordingly. Results: For every drug interaction four core parameters were assessed: (i) evidence on the interaction; (ii) clinical relevance of the potential adverse reaction resulting from the interaction; (iii) risk factors identifying patient, medication or disease characteristics for which the interaction is of special importance; and (iv) the incidence of the adverse reaction. On the basis of this assessment the drug-drug interactions for inclusion in the CIS were selected. After revision of the drug combinations in the KNMP-CIS, the Working Group judged 22% of the combinations to be not interacting and another 12% to be interacting but not requiring action. On the basis of this assessment the subset of drug combinations for which interaction alerts are generated and the information on management of a drug interaction alert for users of the CIS were adapted. When an alert is generated by the CIS, the user of the system is supplied with comprehensive information on the four core parameters, the mechanism of the interaction and critical information for management of the interaction for the individual patient. Discussion: This structured procedure offers the possibility for transparent and reproducible assessment of the clinical relevance of drug interactions. Conclusion: A CIS selectively generating interaction alerts based on this assessment may help in realising the goal of good clinical practice and may offer a methodology to further increase drug safety. 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

Although previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that craving is mediated by increased prefrontal cortex activity, it remains unknown how heroin administration modulates the prefrontal cortex response. This study examines the acute effects of heroin on brain function in heroin-maintained patients. Using a crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 27 heroin-maintained patients performed functional magnetic resonance imaging 20 minutes after the administration of heroin or placebo (saline) while drug-related and neutral stimuli were presented. Images were processed and analysed with statistical parametric mapping. Plasma concentrations of heroin and its main metabolites were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Region of interest analyses showed a drug-related cue-associated blood-oxygen-level-dependent activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in heroin-dependent patients during both treatment conditions (heroin and placebo). This activation of the OFC was significantly higher after heroin than after placebo administration. These findings may indicate the importance of OFC activity for impulse control and decision-making after regular heroin administration and may emphasize the benefit of the heroin-assisted treatment in heroin dependence.",

The objective of our study was to synthesize information on seasonal influenza vaccination policies, recommendations and practices in place in 2011 for all countries and areas in the Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization (WHO). METHODS: Data were collected via a questionnaire on seasonal influenza vaccination policies, recommendations and practices in place in 2011. RESULTS: Thirty-six of the 37 countries and areas (97%) responded to the survey. Eighteen (50%) reported having established seasonal influenza vaccination policies, an additional seven (19%) reported having recommendations for risk groups for seasonal influenza vaccination only and 11 (30%) reported having no policies or recommendations in place. Of the 25 countries and areas with policies or recommendations, health-care workers and the elderly were most frequently recommended for vaccination; 24 (96%) countries and areas recommended vaccinating these groups, followed by pregnant women (19 [76%]), people with chronic illness (18 [72%]) and children (15 [60%]). Twenty-six (72%) countries and areas reported having seasonal influenza vaccines available through public funding, private market purchase or both. Most of these countries and areas purchased only enough vaccine to cover 25% or less of their populations. DISCUSSION: In light of the new WHO position paper on influenza vaccines published in 2012 and the increasing availability of country-specific data, countries and areas should consider reviewing or developing their seasonal influenza vaccination policies to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with annual epidemics and as part of ongoing efforts for pandemic preparedness.",

Unlike standard sigmoidal curves, bell-shaped concentration-response curves suggest more complex biological effects, such as multiple-binding sites or multiple targets. Here, we investigate a physical property-based mechanism for bell-shaped curves. Beginning with the observation that some drugs form colloidal aggregates at relevant concentrations, we determined concentration-response curves for three aggregating anticancer drugs, formulated both as colloids and as free monomer. Colloidal formulations exhibited bell-shaped curves, losing activity at higher concentrations, while monomeric formulations gave typical sigmoidal curves, sustaining a plateau of maximum activity. Inverting the question, we next asked if molecules with bell-shaped curves, reported in the literature, form colloidal aggregates at relevant concentrations. We selected 12 molecules reported to have bell-shaped concentration-response curves and found that five of these formed colloids. To understand the mechanism behind the loss of activity at concentrations where colloids are present, we investigated the diffusion of colloid-forming dye Evans blue into cells. We found that colloidal species are excluded from cells, which may explain the mechanism behind toxicological screens that use Evans blue, Trypan blue, and related dyes.",

Results: Patients and controls were genotyped for detection of the 3435C>T polymorphism, but the analysis showed no significant association between the CC genotype and the risk of drug-resistant epilepsy. Conclusion: These findings rule out the MDR1 c.3435C>T polymorphism having a major role or increasing the risk of drug-resistance suggesting a revision is required to determine the contribution of this polymorphism in predicting drug response in epilepsy.",

A major gap that limits our ability to utilize pharmacogenomic information in drug discovery, drug development or clinical practice is that we often do not know the genetic variants responsible for inter-individual differences in drug metabolism or drug response. We examine emerging genomic methods that can fill this gap; these methods can be used to generate new information about drug metabolism or mechanism of action, or to identify predictors of drug response. Although they have not yet had their full impact, a wider application of these emerging genomic technologies has the potential to significantly improve the safety of drugs, the quality of patient care and the efficiency of clinical drug development.",

The present study examined the potential for therapeutic drug monitoring and symptom rating to predict venlafaxine treatment efficacy (measured by overall patient response and remission). Methods: \u200288 patients were uptitrated homogenously to 225\u2009mg/day venlafaxine. Serum concentrations of venlafaxine (VEN) and its active metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) were measured at week 2. Continuous psychopathometric ratings were measured for up to 6 weeks by independent study raters. Results: \u2002An early improvement was significantly more common in venlafaxine responders than non-responders (\u03c7(2); p=0.007). While ODV serum levels were significantly higher in responders (t test; p=0.006), VEN serum levels, sum level of VEN+ODV and the ratio of ODV/VEN levels were not. Moreover, patients who showed an early response combined with an ODV serum level above the median of 222\u2009ng/mL were significantly more likely to achieve full response (binary logistic model; p<0.01). Sensitivity (84% for early response) and specificity (81% for combination of early response and therapeutic drug monitoring) were sufficient to qualify as a reasonable screening instrument. Conclusion: \u2002Our results indicate that early improvement and ODV serum concentration are predictive of therapeutic outcome and can thus be used to guide use of the antidepressant venlafaxine.",

METHODS: We analysed routine data reported by countries to WHO from 2007 to 2013, focusing on data from the following: surveillance and surveys of drug resistance, management of drug-resistant TB and financing related to multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) management. RESULTS: In the Western Pacific Region, 4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3-6) of new and 22% (95% CI: 18-26) of previously treated TB cases were estimated to have MDR-TB; this means that in 2013, there were an estimated 71,000 (95% CI: 47,000-94,000) MDR-TB cases among notified pulmonary TB cases in this Region. The coverage of drug susceptibility testing (DST) among new and previously treated TB cases was 3% and 20%, respectively. In 2013, 11,153 cases were notified--16% of the estimated MDR-TB cases. Among the notified cases, 6926 or 62% were enrolled in treatment. Among all enrolled MDR-TB cases, 34% had second-line DST and of these, 13% were resistant to fluoroquinolones (FQ) and/or second-line injectable agents. The 2011 cohort of MDR-TB showed a 52% treatment success. Over the last five years, case notification and enrolment have increased more than five times, but the gap between notification and enrolment widened. DISCUSSION: The increasing trend in detection and enrolment of MDR-TB cases demonstrates readiness to scale up programmatic management of drug-resistant TB at the country level.

        "abstract": "A quantitative understanding of the advantages of nanoparticle-based drug delivery vis-\u00e0-vis conventional free drug chemotherapy has yet to be established for cancer or other diseases despite numerous investigations. Here, we employ first-principles cell biophysics, drug pharmaco-kinetics, and drug pharmaco-dynamics to model the delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor cells and predict the resultant experimental cytotoxicity data. The fundamental, mechanistic hypothesis of our mathematical model is that the integrated history of drug uptake by the cells over time of exposure, which sets the cell death rate parameter, and the uptake rate are the sole determinants of the dose response relationship. A universal solution of the model equations is capable of predicting the entire, nonlinear dose response of the cells to any drug concentration based on just two separate measurements of these cellular parameters. This analysis reveals that nanocarrier-mediated delivery overcomes resistance to the free drug because of improved cellular uptake rates, and that dose response curves to nanocarrier mediated drug delivery are equivalent to those for free-drug, but \"shifted to the left;\" that is, lower amounts of drug achieve the same cell kill. We then demonstrate the model's general applicability to different tumor and drug types, and cell-exposure time courses by investigating HCC cells exposed to cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, breast cancer MCF-7 cells exposed to DOX, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma PANC-1 cells exposed to gemcitabine. The model will help in the optimal design of nanocarriers for clinical applications and improve the current, largely empirical understanding of in vivo drug transport and tumor response.",

        "abstract": "Induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) is highly species-specific and can lead to drug-drug interaction and toxicities. In this series of studies we tested the species specificity of the antidiabetic drug development candidate and mixed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/gamma agonist (S)-4-O-tolylsulfanyl-2-(4-trifluormethyl-phenoxy)-butyric acid (EMD 392949, EMD) with regard to the induction of gene expression and activities of DMEs, their regulators, and typical PPAR target genes. EMD clearly induced PPARalpha target genes in rats in vivo and in rat hepatocytes but lacked significant induction of DMEs, except for cytochrome P450 (P450) 4A. CYP2C and CYP3A were consistently induced in livers of EMD-treated monkeys. Interestingly, classic rodent peroxisomal proliferation markers were induced in monkeys after 17 weeks but not after a 4-week treatment, a fact also observed in human hepatocytes after 72 h but not 24 h of EMD treatment. In human hepatocyte cultures, EMD showed similar gene expression profiles and induction of P450 activities as in monkeys, indicating that the monkey is predictive for human P450 induction by EMD. In addition, EMD induced a similar gene expression pattern as the PPARalpha agonist fenofibrate in primary rat and human hepatocyte cultures. In conclusion, these data showed an excellent correlation of in vivo data on DME gene expression and activity levels with results generated in hepatocyte monolayer cultures, enabling a solid estimation of human P450 induction. This study also clearly highlighted major differences between primates and rodents in the regulation of major inducible P450s, with evidence of CYP3A and CYP2C inducibility by PPARalpha agonists in monkeys and humans.",

        "abstract": "Nonopioid agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are the most commonly used class of analgesics. Increasing evidence suggests that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition at both peripheral and central sites can contribute to the antihyperalgesic effects of NSAIDs, with the predominant clinical effect being mediated centrally. In this study, we examined the cerebral response to ibuprofen in presurgical and postsurgical states and looked at the analgesic interaction between surgical state and treatment. We used an established clinical pain model involving third molar extraction, and quantitative arterial spin labelling (ASL) imaging to measure changes in tonic/ongoing neural activity. Concurrent to the ASL scans, we presented visual analogue scales inside the scanner to evaluate the subjective experience of pain. This novel methodology was incorporated into a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design, with an open method of drug administration. We found that independent of its antinociceptive action, ibuprofen has no effect on regional cerebral blood flow under pain-free conditions (presurgery). However, in the postsurgical state, we observed increased activation of top-down modulatory circuits, which was accompanied by decreases in the areas engaged because of ongoing pain. Our findings demonstrate that ibuprofen has a measurable analgesic response in the human brain, with the subjective effects of pain relief reflected in two distinct brain networks. The observed activation of descending modulatory circuits warrants further investigation, as this may provide new insights into the inhibitory mechanisms of analgesia that might be exploited to improve safety and efficacy in pain management.",

In addition to inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation, DES greatly inhibits the local inflammatory response in the acute phase after implantation, leading to prevention of restenosis. However, a unique issue in DES implantation is an impairment of reendothelialization, which may result in abnormal wound healing. Consequently, a late-phase inflammatory relapse could appear in the long term after DES implantation. In this study, we measured serum levels of inflammatory markers, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and myeloperoxidase, as well as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein at follow-up coronary angiography (mean 9 months) in 54 patients who received DES stenting who did not experience restenosis, and compared them with 51 patients receiving bare-metal stents (BMS) without restenosis. The level of IL-6 was over the measurement threshold (>/=2.22 pg/ml) in 12 patients (21 %) in the DES group, but in only 2 patients (4 %) in the BMS group (P = 0.003). IL-8 was significantly higher in the DES group than in the BMS group (4.51 +/- 2.40 vs 3.84 +/- 1.34 pg/ml, P = 0.015). The levels of other biomarkers were similar between the two groups. DES showed an increase in inflammatory cytokines in the late phase after implantation in comparison with patients who received BMS, suggesting late-stage inflammation. Therefore, the wound-healing response after DES implantation might be different from that after BMS.",

The objective of our study was to measure the frequency, nature and management of drug-drug interaction alerts as these occur in daily practice of Dutch community pharmacies. METHODS: In total, 63 Dutch pharmacies collected all drug-drug interaction alerts during 153 research days (on average 2.4 days/pharmacy), as well as variables related to these alerts, such as involved medicines, first time or recurrent drug-drug interaction, same or different prescribers, patient data (age, sex) and information about the management of drug-drug interactions by the pharmacy. The latter was discriminated into internal procedures only and external action, such as communication with the patient, the prescriber or the anticoagulation clinic and prescription modification. All drug-drug interactions were classified into categories of clinical relevance (A-F) and available evidence (0-4). RESULTS: A total of 43,129 prescription-only medicines were dispensed during the study period. On average, 16.8 interaction alerts per day per pharmacy were collected. Approximately 6% of all prescriptions generated a drug-drug interaction alert. Of all alerts (n = 2572), 31.1% occurred for the first time and with 21% two different prescribers were involved. The 20 most frequently occurring drug-drug interaction alerts accounted for approximately 76% of all alerts. Cardiovascular drugs, NSAIDs, oral contraceptives and antibacterials were most frequently involved. External action was taken in response to 27.3% of the alerts, meaning either a modification of one of the concerned prescriptions (n = 65; 9.3%), communication with the prescriber or anticoagulation clinic (n = 90; 12.8%) or communication with the patient or a relative (n = 547; 77.9%). Where there was no external action (n = 1860; 72.3%), pharmacists concluded in about two-thirds of cases that the drug-drug interaction had been managed in the past. Other reasons not to intervene externally were for instance: incorrect alert; acceptable drug-drug interaction; or outcome of the interaction considered irrelevant. Adjusted for several variables, a first alert was found to be a main determinant for external action. After stratifying for first alerts no other significant determinants were found. CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of drug-drug interaction alerts was found. Most concerned recurrent alerts, which were the main reason not to act externally. Concerning the assessment phase in the risk-management process, drug-drug interactions with no or low evidence/relevance should be reconsidered. Concerning the management of drug-drug interactions in pharmacies, the opportunity to actively suppress alerts for a certain period of time should be studied in more detail. There are indicators that the management of patient-orientated advice could be improved and a greater degree of consistency developed for the management of first and recurrent interaction alerts.",

        "abstract": "Diseases are a major cause of variation in drug response. Although many different diseases are known that have an effect on the pharmacokinetics or sometimes the pharmacodynamics of a drug, disorders associated with a so-called acute phase response (APR) are the most important in this respect. During APR, for example caused by tissue damage or invasion of a pathogen, a group of symptoms can be observed that often include fever, lassitude, inhibition of gastric function and synthesis of acute phase proteins. All phases that together determine the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, can be affected during APR. From a clinical point of view however, the effects on absorption and metabolism are the most relevant. For drugs that are given orally, a slower absorption rate is often observed during APR due to a delayed gastric emptying. Even more important from a clinical point of view is the depression of biotransformation capacity in the liver during APR, especially affecting the enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) complex. Although much has become known about the mechanism of this effect, a number of questions remain. Cytokines, nitric oxide and possibly the enzyme heme oxygenase are playing a role in a complex process that depends on a mutual interaction between Kupffer cells (macrophages) and hepatocytes in the liver. The clinician should be aware of unexpected changes in drug effects or residue levels due to cumulation of the compound during disease or after vaccination. In these situations, drugs that are excreted unchanged may be better alternatives.",

        "abstract": "Our objective was to prospectively assess whether early (ie, 2 weeks) response to an antipsychotic predicts later (12-week) response and whether 'switching' early non-responders to another antipsychotic is a better strategy than 'staying'. This randomized, double-blind, flexible-dosed, 12-week study enrolled 628 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. All initiated treatment with risperidone. Early response was defined as > or =20% improvement on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score following 2 weeks of treatment. Early responders (ERs) continued on risperidone, whereas early non-responders (ENRs) were randomized (1 : 1) to continue on risperidone 2-6 mg/day or switch to olanzapine 10-20 mg/day for 10 additional weeks. Compared with ENRs, risperidone ERs showed significantly greater reduction in PANSS total score (end point; p<001). Early response/non-response was highly predictive of subsequent clinical outcomes. Switching risperidone ENRs to olanzapine at week 2 resulted in a small but significantly greater reduction in PANSS total score (end point; p=0.020) and in depressive symptoms (end point; p=0.004); the reduction in PANSS was greater among those who were still moderately ill at 2 weeks. Switching risperidone ENRs to olanzapine also resulted in significantly greater increases in triglycerides, a significantly greater decrease in prolactin, and significantly less treatment-emergent dyskinesia. This is the first study to prospectively show that early response/non-response to an antipsychotic (risperidone) is a reliable clinical marker of subsequent clinical outcomes and that a 'switching' strategy based on this information may lead to greater clinical improvement than staying on a drug for a longer period in some patients.",

        "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are an important cause of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Many studies have recently considered this issue, but most of them focus only on potential interactions and are often related to the hospital setting. A spontaneous reporting database could be a valuable resource for detection of ADRs associated with DDIs; however, data in the literature are limited.\\n                To detect those patients treated with potentially interacting drugs and the cases where reported adverse reactions are a possible consequence of DDIs, using an Italian spontaneous reporting database.\\n                The data were obtained from a database containing all reports of suspected ADRs from five Italian regions (January 1990 to December 2007) that are the main contributors to the Italian spontaneous reporting system. All reports containing at least two drugs, reported as being suspected of causing the ADR or as concomitant medication, were selected and a list of drug pairs was drawn up. We performed a search to verify which drug pairs are considered a potential DDI, using the Internet version of the DRUGDEX(R) system. For each report containing a potential DDI, we verified whether the description of the adverse reaction corresponded to the interaction effect.\\n                The database contained 45 315 reports, of which 17 700 (39.1%) had at least two reported drugs. We identified 5345 (30.2%) reports with potential DDIs, and in 1159 (21.7%) of these reports a related ADR was reported. The percentage of reports with potential DDIs increased in relation to the number of concomitantly administered drugs, ranging from 9.8% for two drugs to 88.3% for eight or more drugs. The percentages of serious or fatal reports of ADRs associated with a DDI were significantly higher than other reports analysed. The mean age, percentage of male patients and the mean number of drugs were also significantly higher in reports with DDIs than in other reports. In 235 of 1159 reports (20.3%), both interacting drugs were recognized as suspect by the reporter. This percentage varies in relation to the drugs involved, ranging from 2% to about 65%. The most frequently reported interaction was digoxin and diuretics, but no fatal ADRs were reported with this combination. The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents was responsible for the greatest number of serious reactions and deaths.\\n                This study validates that spontaneous reporting, despite its limitations, can be an important resource for detecting ADRs associated with the concomitant use of interacting drugs. Moreover, our data confirm that DDIs could be a real problem in clinical practice, showing that more than one in five patients exposed to a potential DDI experienced a related ADR.",

        "abstract": "Sirolimus (rapamycin, RAPAMUNE, RAPA) is an immunosuppressive agent used for the prophylaxis of renal allograft rejection and exhibits an immunosuppressive mechanism that is distinct from that for cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The purpose of this manuscript is to discuss the exposure-response relationships and drug interactions of sirolimus. The various factors affecting sirolimus whole blood exposure included first-pass extraction, formulation, food, demographics, liver disease, assay method, and interacting drugs. Clinically significant effects caused by food, pediatric age, hepatic impairment, and interacting drugs require recommendations for the safe and efficacious use of sirolimus in renal allograft patients. An exposure-response model based on multivariate logistic regression was developed using the interstudy data from 1832 renal allograft patients. The analysis revealed an increased probability of acute rejection for sirolimus troughs <5 ng/mL, cyclosporine troughs <150 ng/mL, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches > or =4, and females. The outcomes suggested that individualization of sirolimus doses immediately after transplantation, based on HLA mismatch and sex, would likely decrease the probability of acute rejections in renal allograft recipients who receive concomitant sirolimus, cyclosporine (full-dose), and corticosteroid therapy. Sirolimus is a substrate for both Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and undergoes extensive first-pass extraction. Drugs that are known to inhibit or induce these proteins may potentially affect sirolimus whole blood exposure. In healthy volunteers, cyclosporine, diltiazem, erythromycin, ketoconazole, and verapamil significantly increased sirolimus whole blood exposure, and rifampin significantly decreased sirolimus exposure. However, sirolimus whole blood exposure was not affected by acyclovir, atorvastatin, digoxin, ethinyl estradiol/norgestrel, glyburide, nifedipine, or tacrolimus. Among the 15 drugs studied, sirolimus significantly increased the exposures of only erythromycin and S-(-)verapamil.",

        "abstract": "Lean manufacturing is a leading manufacturing paradigm being applied in many sectors of the U.S. economy, where improving product quality, reducing production costs, and being first to market and quick to respond to customer needs are critical to competitiveness and success. Lean principles and methods focus on creating a continual improvement culture that engages employees in reducing the intensity of time, materials, and capital necessary for meetinga customers needs. While lean productions fundamental focus is on the systematic elimination of non-value added activity and waste from the production process, the implementation of lean principles and methods also results in improved environmental performance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sponsored a study on lean manufacturing in 2000 that included a series of case studies with the Boeing Company to explore the relationship between lean production and environmental performance.1 The study found that lean implementation at the Boeing Company resulted in significant resource productivity improvements with important environmental improvement implications. The Boeing case studies also found evidence that some environmentally sensitive processes, such as painting and chemical treatment, can be more difficult to lean, leaving potential resource productivity and environmental improvements unrealized. These findings led EPAs Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER), in partnership with the Office of Policy, Economics, and Innovation (OPEI), to pursue new research to examine further the relationship between lean manufacturing and environmental performance and the regulatory framework. The goal of this effort is to help public environmental agencies understand ways to better leverage lean manufacturing, existing government environmental management programs and initiatives, and regulatory requirements in the hope that even greater environmental and economic benefits will result.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Prediction of in vivo drug-drug interactions (DDIs) from in vitro and in vivo data, also named in vitro in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), is of interest to scientists involved in the discovery and development of drugs. To avoid detrimental DDIs in humans, new drug candidates should be evaluated for their possible interaction with other drugs as soon as possible, not only as an inhibitor or inducer (perpetrator) but also as a substrate (victim). DDI risk assessment is addressed along the drug development program through an iterative process as the features of the new compound entity are revealed. Both in vitro and preclinical/clinical outcomes are taken into account to better understand the behavior of the developed compound and to refine DDI predictions. During the last decades, several equations have been proposed in the literature to predict DDIs, from a quantitative point of view, showing a substantial improvement in the ability to predict metabolism-based in vivo DDIs. Mechanistic and dynamic approaches have been proposed to predict the magnitude of metabolic-based DDIs. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current equations and methods, the pros and cons of each method, the required input data for each of them, as well as the mechanisms (i.e., reversible inhibition, mechanism-based inhibition, induction) underlying metabolic-based DDIs. In particular, this review outlines how the methods (static and dynamic) can be used in a complementary manner during drug development. The discussion of the limitations and advantages associated with the various approaches, as well as regulatory requirements in that field, can give the reader a helpful overview of this growing area.",

Although many types of drug information have been used to repurpose drugs, drug-drug interaction data, which imply possible physiological effects or targets of drugs, remain unexploited. In this work, similarity of drug interaction was employed to infer similarity of the physiological effects or targets for the drugs. We collected 10\u00a0835 drug-drug interactions concerning 1074 drugs, and for 700 of them, drug similarity scores based on drug interaction profiles were computed and rendered using a drug association network with 589 nodes (drugs) and 2375 edges (drug similarity scores). The 589 drugs were clustered into 98 groups with Markov Clustering Algorithm, most of which were significantly correlated with certain drug functions. This indicates that the network can be used to infer the physiological effects of drugs. Furthermore, we evaluated the ability of this drug association network to predict drug targets. The results show that the method is effective for 317 of 561 drugs that have known targets. Comparison of this method with the structure-based approach shows that they are complementary. In summary, this study demonstrates the feasibility of drug repurposing based on drug-drug interaction data.",

Macromolecular therapeutics encompasses a variety of approaches including recombinant proteins, genes, antisense, and small interfering RNAs, all of which have larger molecular dimensions than conventional drugs. These macromolecules have emerged as a powerful class of drugs for a wide range of therapeutic indications mainly on the basis of their site-specific activity and reduced side effects. However, these drugs present an enormous challenge for noninvasive delivery as they are poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized in the body. To surmount these obstacles, either the other aspects of the drug may be exploited or novel delivery systems may be developed. Cost-effectiveness suggests that developing an improved delivery system for an existing drug is a better alternative than modifying the chemical structure of the drug or discovering new drug entities. This chapter focuses on macromolecular drugs and their delivery systems including liposomes, polymers, peptides, and nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "In the last decades, advances in molecular biology have led to modern pharmacogenetics, which started as a science that focused on investigating drug metabolising enzymes and genetic determinants of pharmacokinetic variability. As more evidence has become available on the structure of drug targets and the genes coding for them, increasing attention has been directed towards pharmacodynamic explanations of variability in therapeutic response as well as in the risk for adverse drug reactions. Traditionally, genetic drug safety research has focused on variations in single genes whose functions are known to be related to given adverse drug reactions. A few such examples, malignant hyperthermia, the long QT syndrome, venous thromboembolic disease, tardive dyskinesia, and drug addiction, are presented in this article. In the future, results from the Human Genome Project together with tools such as DNA microarray technology, high-output screening systems and advanced bioinformatics, will permit a more thorough elucidation than is currently possible of the genetic components of adverse drug reactions. By screening for a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SNP patterns associated with adverse drug reactions can be discovered even though the functions of the SNPs as such are completely unknown. On the basis of these findings, it can be expected that pharmacogenetic research will identify situations where a drug should be avoided in certain individuals in order to reduce the risk for adverse drug reactions. If so, it will be feasible to use molecular diagnostics to select drugs that are safe for the individual patient",

The results showed the sizes of both blank nanoparticles and drug-loaded nanoparticles in pH 7.4 were smaller than those of nanoparticles in pH 5.0, and the mean diameter of drug-loaded nanoparticles was much bigger than that of blank nanoparticles. The PEG-PH-PLLA nanoparticles were nontoxic to both NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HepG2 cells. The release profile showed that the release of DOX in pH 5.0 was much faster than that in pH 7.4. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that the anti-tumor effect of drug-loaded nanoparticles was preferable to free doxorubicin.

This National Inst on Drug Abuse funded paper reviews the literature describing the growth, operations, and evaluations of drug courts. It concludes that, contrary to most \"models,\" drug courts emphasize punishment (e.g., graduated sanctions) and make limited positive, or at least inconsistent, use of reinforcement to promote behavior change and abstinence from drug use.

The success of this model in promoting pro-social behavior and abstinence from illicit drug use suggests that drug courts could benefit substantially from the integration of contingency management-based interventions.

        "abstract": "The pharmacogenetics literature of drug receptors and effector proteins is in its relative infancy compared to that of drug metabolism pharmacogenetics. Nonetheless, in a short time period, numerous studies have demonstrated that receptor/effector polymorphisms contribute to variable drug response. We review the current status, and list challenges that confront drug target pharmacogenetics before we can use genetic information in drug-therapy decision-making. We focus our review on G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which represent over 50% of all drug targets, and use specific examples from the beta-adrenergic receptor pharmacogenetic literature to illustrate important issues. Recent resequencing efforts of GPCR genes suggest that they have more coding region and nonsynonymous polymorphisms than non-GPCR genes, thus making GPCRs important foci for pharmacogenetic investigation. Our inability to use drug target genetic information to guide in the selection of drug therapy is due to several factors, including (i) the relatively subtle functional effects of the single gene polymorphisms, which do not account for enough of the drug response variability to accurately predict response and (ii) inconsistencies between studies. The latter may be due to some studies having inadequate sample sizes, studying different drug response phenotypes and patient populations, difficulties in identifying and measuring a valid drug response phenotype, and focusing on single polymorphisms in single genes, rather than haplotypes or multiple genes. To move the field to the point of clinical application, future studies will need to be larger, and will have to consider the complexity of the drug response, either by inclusion of polymorphisms from signal transduction proteins and other proteins relevant to the drug response, or through a genomics approach. Finally, the literature suggests that, for those drugs with multiple pharmacologic effects, or effects in multiple organs, the genetic contribution to each drug response phenotype will have to be considered separately. The knowledge necessary to move forward on all these fronts is not yet available, but will be increasingly accessible over the next few years.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacogenomic analysis is being increasingly investigated for its potential to personalize drug therapy. However, accumulating evidence indi-cates that factors such as underlying disease, nutrition and gut microbial activity, also have an important role in modulating drug metabolism and response. Now, writing in PNAS, Clayton and colleagues at Imperial College and Pfizer show for the first time that a 'pharmacometabonomic' approach can be used in humans to predict an aspect of paracetamol (acetaminophen) metabolism, indicating the potential application of this technology to aid drug develop-ment and personalize drug therapy. Pharmacometabonomics \u2014 the prediction of response to a drug in an individual based on analysis of pre-intervention metabolite signatures \u2014 is an attractive new approach, given the availability and ease of analysis of biofluid samples. However, until now, there had been no convincing pharmacometabonomic demonstra-tion in humans. Here, Clayton and colleagues selected paracetamol for their human study, largely on the basis of its low toxicity at therapeutic doses, its common usage and its predominant and rapid urinary excretion, which varies considerably between subjects. The study recruited 99 non-smoking, healthy male volunteers of 18\u201364 years of age, who had not taken any medication in the preceding week. Each individual provided a pre-dose urine sample. Then, after taking a standard therapeutic oral dose of two 500 mg paracetamol tablets, each volunteer collected all of their post-dose urine over 2 consecutive 3-hour periods. Using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Clayton and colleagues visually and statisti-cally analysed the pre-dose urine metabolite spectra of each individual in relation to the main post-dose drug excretion metabolites, paraceta-mol sulphate (S) and paracetamol glucuronide (G). Their most striking finding was that subjects who had high pre-dose levels of the gut micro-bial metabolite p-cresol sulphate, which is produced from protein-derived tyrosine, had significantly lower S/G ratios. Given that p-cresol and paracetamol are both substrates of the human cytosolic sulphotrans-ferase 1A1 (SULT1A1) \u2014 one of the most important sulphotransferases in the body \u2014 this indicates that they will compete for enzyme binding sites as well as for availability of the universal sulphate donor 3'-phospho-adenosine 5'-phosphosulphate for their O-sulphonation. Therefore, Clayton and colleagues concluded that individuals who produce high levels of p-cresol can be predicted to have a low systemic capacity to sulphonate paracetamol. The authors went on to suggest that depleting the body of such sulphona-tion capacity, by continual exposure to p-cresol, could leave the liver more vulnerable to paracetamol-induced damage. High p-cresol production was also associated with lower levels of cysteine and N-acetyl cysteine adducts in the urine, indicating reduced glutathione conjugation and suggesting that these findings might have implications for drug detoxifica-tion processes in general. In summary, these findings highlight the potential importance of the diet and gut microbiome activity in determining an individual's drug response. As many drugs and endog-enous compounds are substrates for sulphation, sulphur-containing glutathione is important in redox balance, and a number of diseases involve abnormalities in sulphur metabolism, this may have wider implications for drug develop-ment, disease treatment and future approaches to personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anticancer therapies that target single signal transduction pathways often fail to prevent proliferation of cancer cells because of overlapping functions and cross-talk between different signaling pathways. Recent research has identified that balanced multi-component therapies might be more efficacious than highly specific single component therapies in certain cases. Ideally, synergistic combinations can provide 1) increased efficacy of the therapeutic effect 2) reduced toxicity as a result of decreased dosage providing equivalent or increased efficacy 3) the avoidance or delayed onset of drug resistance. Therefore, the interest in combinatorial drug discovery based on systems-oriented approaches has been increasing steadily in recent years.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY: Here we describe the development of Combinatorial Drug Assembler (CDA), a genomics and bioinformatics system, whereby using gene expression profiling, multiple signaling pathways are targeted for combinatorial drug discovery. CDA performs expression pattern matching of signaling pathway components to compare genes expressed in an input cell line (or patient sample data), with expression patterns in cell lines treated with different small molecules. Then it detects best pattern matching combinatorial drug pairs across the input gene set-related signaling pathways to detect where gene expression patterns overlap and those predicted drug pairs could likely be applied as combination therapy. We carried out in vitro validations on non-small cell lung cancer cells and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We found two combinatorial drug pairs that showed synergistic effect on lung cancer cells. Furthermore, we also observed that halofantrine and vinblastine were synergistic on TNBC cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: CDA provides a new way for rational drug combination. Together with phExplorer, CDA also provides functional insights into combinatorial drugs. CDA is freely available at http://cda.i-pharm.org.",

        "abstract": "Malaria, caused mostly by Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. Antimalarial drug toxicity is one side of the risk-benefit equation and is viewed differently depending upon whether the clinical indication for drug administration is malaria treatment or prophylaxis. Drug toxicity must be acceptable to patients and cause less harm than the disease itself. Research that leads to drug registration tends to omit two important groups who are particularly vulnerable to malaria - very young children and pregnant women. Prescribing in pregnancy is a particular problem for clinicians because the risk-benefit ratio is often very unclear. The number of antimalarial drugs in use is very small. Despite its decreasing efficacy against P. falciparum, chloroquine continues to be used widely because of its low cost and good tolerability. It remains the drug of first choice for treating P. vivax malaria. Pruritus is a common adverse effect in African patients. As prophylaxis, chloroquine is usually combined with proguanil. This combination has good overall tolerability but mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal upset are more common than with other prophylactic regimens. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is well tolerated as treatment and when used as intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant African women. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is no longer used as prophylaxis because it may cause toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens Johnson syndrome. Mefloquine remains a valuable drug for prophylaxis and treatment. Tolerability is acceptable to most patients and travellers despite the impression given by the lay press. Dose-related serious neuropsychiatric toxicity can occur; mefloquine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of epilepsy or psychiatric disease. Quinine is the mainstay for treating severe malaria in many countries. Cardiovascular or CNS toxicity is rare, but hypoglycaemia may be problematic and blood glucose levels should be monitored. Halofantrine is unsuitable for widespread use because of its potential for cardiotoxicity. There is renewed interest in two old drugs, primaquine and amodiaquine. Primaquine is being developed as prophylaxis, and amodiaquine, which was withdrawn from prophylactic use because of neutropenia and hepatitis, is a potentially good partner drug for artesunate against falciparum malaria. Atovaquone/proguanil is a new antimalarial combination with good efficacy and tolerability as prophylaxis and treatment. The most important class of drugs that could have a major impact on malaria control is the artemisinin derivatives. They have remarkable efficacy and an excellent safety record. They have no identifiable dose-related adverse effects in humans and only very rarely produce allergic reactions. Combining an artemisinin derivative with another efficacious antimalarial drug is increasingly being viewed as the optimal therapeutic strategy for malaria.",

Consequently, it has become necessary for a diabetic patient to take multiple medications at the same time to delay progression of the disease.

Hence, managing drug-drug interactions is the cornerstone of anti-diabetic therapy. Most of the clinically important drug-drug interactions of anti-diabetic agents are related to their metabolic pathways, but drugs that compete for renal excretion or impair renal status can also play an important role. In this review, we have examined the clinical implications and underlying mechanisms of drugs that are likely to alter the pharmacologic response of or cause adverse events with antidiabetic drugs, and we have outlined safe and efficacious treatment modalities.",

P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) is known to regulate the concentration of antipsychotic drugs in the brain. Variable expressivity based on polymorphism in the gene ABCB1 may reflect on the drug response and its relationship to dosage.\\n\\nMATERIALS & METHODS: All antipsychotic dosages administered to patients were converted to common chlorpromazine equivalents.

Using a case-control study design, ABCB1 polymorphisms were screened in 192 individuals grouped into responders and nonresponders.\\n\\nRESULTS: A strong allelic, genotypic and haplotypic association, was observed, which was predictive of good response to antipsychotics. Individuals carrying the favorable homozygous genotypes of rs1045642 and rs2032582 displayed better response with increased dosage while those carrying risk genotype manifested refractoriness on increased dosage.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The study suggests that a priori knowledge of ABCB1 genotypes can provide a significant input into evaluating the patient's response to medication, and minimizing redundant dosing and refractoriness.",

The problem is that such studies have a poor signal-to- noise ratio. In such studies, approximately one third of participants receiving drug respond specifically because of the drug, one third of participants receiving drug respond not because of the drug but rather because of the \"placebo\" effect inherent in participating in such a study, and one third of participants on drug do not respond sufficiently to be counted as responders. In analyzing the results of such studies, the data from these last two groups make it impossible to identify whether there is any relationship between drug concentration and antidepressant response. The next column in this series will discuss how TDM can be used as a \"personalized medicine\" tool to evaluate patients who are at risk for less than optimum response either because they may have much more rapid or much slower clearance of a drug than is usual as well as to identify adherence problems.",

        "abstract": "Urinary retention is a condition in which impaired emptying of the bladder results in postvoidal residual urine. It is generally classified into 'acute' or 'chronic' urinary retention. Because of the complex mechanism of micturition, many drugs can interact with the micturition pathway, all via different modes of action. Although the incidence of urinary retention, in particular acute urinary retention, has been well studied in observational studies and randomized controlled trials, data on the incidence of drug-induced urinary retention are scarce. Data from observational studies suggest that up to 10% of episodes might be attributable to the use of concomitant medication. Urinary retention has been described with the use of drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g. antipsychotic drugs, antidepressant agents and anticholinergic respiratory agents), opioids and anaesthetics, \u03b1-adrenoceptor agonists, benzodiazepines, NSAIDs, detrusor relaxants and calcium channel antagonists. Elderly patients are at higher risk for developing drug-induced urinary retention, because of existing co-morbidities such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and the use of other concomitant medication that could reinforce the impairing effect on micturition. Drug-induced urinary retention is generally treated by urinary catheterization, especially if acute, in combination with discontinuation or a reduction in dose of the causal drug. Studies have been carried out examining the effects of preventive measures for anaesthesia-related urinary retention, both during and after surgery, particularly into the effect of using opioids in combination with non-opioid analgesic drugs on the incidence of postoperative urinary retention. Although combination therapy reduces the opioid-related adverse events, the effect on urinary retention yields contradictory results. This article reviews the literature on drug-induced urinary retention and focuses on its incidence, the different classes of drugs that have been associated with it, and options for its management and prevention. \u00a9 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

        "abstract": "Suppressive drug interactions, in which one antibiotic can actually help bacterial cells to grow faster in the presence of another, occur between protein and DNA synthesis inhibitors. Here, we show that this suppression results from nonoptimal regulation of ribosomal genes in the presence of DNA stress. Using GFP-tagged transcription reporters in Escherichia coli, we find that ribosomal genes are not directly regulated by DNA stress, leading to an imbalance between cellular DNA and protein content. To test whether ribosomal gene expression under DNA stress is nonoptimal for growth rate, we sequentially deleted up to six of the seven ribosomal RNA operons. These synthetic manipulations of ribosomal gene expression correct the protein-DNA imbalance, lead to improved survival and growth, and??completely remove the suppressive drug interaction. A simple mathematical model explains the nonoptimal regulation in different nutrient environments. These results reveal the genetic mechanism underlying an important class of suppressive drug interactions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Because of the desire to speed research and decrease costs, there is increasing interest in moving new drugs into clinical trials in potentially active combinations based on preclinical testing data. Different mathematical models have been proposed for evaluating drug interactions, which can be classified as synergistic (combinations demonstrating greater than the additive activity expected from each agent alone), additive, or antagonistic (drugs showing less activity in combination than expected from the sum of each agent alone). Here, we briefly review some of the principles for testing cytotoxic drug interactions. We focus this review on application of the Combination Index method (as developed by Chou and colleagues) in the evaluation of drug interactions in cell culture assays.",

        "abstract": "Background: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a major public health concern, with death as the ultimate adverse drug outcome. Despite the relevance of this, the frequency of fatal ADRs (FADRs) is to a large extent unknown. Although spontaneous reporting data cannot give an exact estimate of the magnitude of drug-related mortality, it may highlight the importance and large dimensions of this public health problem. Objective: To describe the types and pattern of reported FADRs by analysing data from the national spontaneous reporting system in Italy. Methods: The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) runs a pharmacovigilance database where all the individual case safety reports (since January 2001) are stored. We selected and then analysed in detail all the case reports (to the end of December 2006) in which death was reported as the outcome. We included in the study only FADR case reports with a probable or possible causality assessment, according to the criteria established by the WHO. In line with the Italian reporting form, we divided FADR reports into two groups: (i) suspected ADRs that caused death; and (ii) suspected ADRs that contributed to death. Results: In the AIFA database 38 507 suspected ADR case reports were collected, of which 641 (1.66%) had a fatal outcome. We analysed 450 case reports (1.17% of total reports), 159 (35.33%) of them causing the patient's death and 291 (64.67%) contributing to death. The annual percentage of FADR reports followed a constant trend during the 6-year period. The majority of fatal reports (79%) were sent by hospital doctors. In total, 222 different drugs were suspected as causes of FADRs. 'Systemic anti-infective drugs' was the drug category associated with the highest percentage of FADRs (21.9%), followed by antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (18.8%), and then by nervous system drugs (14.8%). Other drug categories involved in the fatal case reports were antithrombotic agents, NSAIDs and contrast media. Conclusions: The drugs most frequently involved in FADRs were drugs of wide usage with a narrow therapeutic range or those that caused serious skin or systemic allergic reactions. Ceftriaxone, ticlopidine and nimesulide were associated with the highest number of fatal case reports; the related FADRs were already known and recognized for each of these drugs. We highlight some cases reflecting probable inappropriate drug use by Italian physicians. This suggests a need for continued clinical pharmacology training and that many FADRs might be preventable through better medical and prescribing practice. \u00a9 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

An influx of emergency preparedness funding has created new and expanding responsibilities for LPHAs. Concern that funding for emergency response is diverting attention and resources away from other core public health responsibilities is increasing. In order to determine the impact of emergency preparedness funding on public health infrastructure, qualitative interviews with 27 LPHAs in the metro-Boston area were conducted as part of an on-going evaluation of preparedness planning in Massachusetts. Feedback on the benefits and challenges of recent emergency preparedness planning mandates was obtained. Benefits include opportunities to develop relationships within and across public health departments and increases in communication between local and state authorities. Challenges include budget constraints, staffing shortages, and competing public responsibilities. Policy recommendations for improving planning for emergency response at the local level are provided. ?? 2006 Emergency Nurses Association.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Understanding variability in the response to asthma medications is  essential to ensure appropriate prescribing. Given that there are increased asthma treatment failures observed in ethnic minorities receiving asthma therapeutics, it is fundamental to understand the factors related to ethnicity that can modify the response to asthma therapy. AREAS COVERED: Race/ethnicity is an important determinant of drug response and therefore contributes to interindividual variability. It is generally recognized that its effects on drug response are determined by both genetic and environmental factors to a varying extent, depending on the ethnic groups and probe drugs studied. Also, adherence to therapy can influence pharmacological response to asthma therapeutics. EXPERT OPINION: Health-care professionals might never use the treatment in their patients irrespective of their ethnicity and thus inadvertently increase ethnic health inequality. However, our understanding of whether and/or how ethnicity influences pharmacological response to asthma therapeutics is still very scarce. A holistic, integrative systems biology approach that combines large-scale molecular profiling traits (e.g., transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic traits) and genetic variants could help to personalize the treatment of asthmatic patients regardless of race/ethnicity.",

        "abstract": "Dopamine is critical for reward-based decision making, yet dopaminergic drugs can have opposite effects in different individuals. This apparent discrepancy can be accounted for by hypothesizing an 'inverted-U' relationship, whereby the effect of dopamine agents depends on baseline dopamine system functioning. Here, we used functional MRI to test the hypothesis that genetic variation in the expression of dopamine D2 receptors in the human brain predicts opposing dopaminergic drug effects during reversal learning. We scanned 22 subjects while they engaged in a feedback-based reversal learning task. Ten subjects had an allele on the Taq1A DRD2 gene, which is associated with reduced dopamine receptor concentration and decreased neural responses to rewards (A1+ subjects). Subjects were scanned twice, once on placebo and once on cabergoline, a D2 receptor agonist. Consistent with an inverted-U relationship between the DRD2 polymorphism and drug effects, cabergoline increased neural reward responses in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and striatum for A1+ subjects but decreased reward responses in these regions for A1- subjects. In contrast, cabergoline decreased task performance and fronto-striatal connectivity in A1+ subjects but had the opposite effect in A1- subjects. Further, the drug effect on functional connectivity predicted the drug effect on feedback-guided learning. Thus, individual variability in how dopaminergic drugs affect the brain reflects genetic disposition. These findings may help to explain the link between genetic disposition and risk for addictive disorders.",

        "title": "Drug-induced ocular disorders",
        "abstract": "While beneficial therapeutically, almost all medications have untoward effects on various body tissues and functions, including the eye in which organ toxic reactions are readily detectable. Every part of the eye and all ocular functions could be affected adversely. In this review, we describe the most commonly recognized drug-induced ocular disorders, their specific clinical features, the medications that can cause the problem, the differential diagnosis and possible mechanisms of action, as well as guidelines for the management of the adverse reactions. The eyelids are most frequently involved in drug toxicity that commonly manifests as inflammation, hypersensitivity reaction or dermatitis. Drug-induced keratoconjunctival disorders present mainly as conjunctival hyperaemia (red eye), with or without superficial corneal involvement. Frequently, drug preservatives in topical ocular medications induce these adverse effects. Treatment of blepharospasm with Botox may lead to drooping of the eyelids and corneal exposure. Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome is a drug-induced reaction in patients treated with tamsulosin and who undergo cataract surgery. Certain sulfa-based drugs can cause swelling of the ciliary body and lead to the development of angle-closure glaucoma. In addition, adrenergic agents, certain beta(2)-adrenergic agonists and anticholinergic agents may induce pupillary dilation and precipitate angle-closure glaucoma in susceptible patients. Glucocorticoids administered systemically, topically or intravitreally are known to increase intraocular pressure, which can lead to the development of open-angle glaucoma in susceptible patients. This painless form of glaucoma has also been associated with the use of the anticancer agents docetaxel and paclitaxel. The toxic effects of systemic and topically applied drugs may manifest as cloudiness of the lens. Long-term use of glucocorticoids produces a characteristic posterior subcapsular cataract and, although the opacities may remain stationary or progress, they rarely regress upon drug withdrawal. Systemic administration of phenothiazines or busulfan induce cataractous changes in the anterior or posterior cortex, respectively. Many systemic drugs reach the retina through the vascular supply. Aminoquinolines induce a characteristic bull's eye maculopathy. Phenothiazines bind to melanin granules and can cause a severe phototoxic retinopathy. Typical tamoxifen retinopathy manifests as crystalline deposits in the inner retina. Some patients treated with retinoids have decreased night vision and abnormal dark-adaptation. Patients on long-term treatment with linezolid may develop an optic neuropathy (swollen or pale optic disc), symmetric painless decrease of visual acuity and colour vision, and bilateral visual field defects. A probable link exists between amiodarone and a bilateral optic neuropathy that is very similar to nonarteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION). The most common adverse effects of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (erectile dysfunction drugs) are changes in colour perception, blurry vision and increased light sensitivity; recently these drugs have been also implicated in the development of NAION. A bilateral, retrobulbar optic neuropathy that manifests as loss of visual acuity or colour vision and visual field defect is associated with the use of ethambutol. Many different kinds of medications can cause similar ocular adverse reactions. Conversely, a single medication may affect more than one ocular structure and cause multiple, clinically recognizable disorders. Clinicians should be mindful of drug-induced ocular disorders, whether or not listed in product package inserts, and, if in doubt, consult with an ophthalmologist.",

In this paper, we used a new microfluidic system to monitor the responses of sensitive and drug-resistant strains of E. coli in different \u03b2-lactam ceftriaxone concentrations at the single cell level and traced each individual cell's states such as cell length, GFP protein expression and growth rate. The \u03b2-lactamase production of the drug-resistant strain is quantified by fluorescence intensity, as the GFP gene co-transcribes with the enzyme expression gene. Our results show that the drug-resistant strain can endure a much higher concentration of antibiotics than the sensitive strain and has an antibiotic concentration ratio from the cell death state to the cell elongation state that is much larger than that of the sensitive strain. The single cell data and simulation suggest that bacteria with slower growth rates have higher drug resistance both in the sensitive and drug-resistant strains. The drug-resistant strain shows adaptation behavior, but no adaptation is found in the sensitive strain after changing to a high antibiotic concentration. A mathematical model of cell growth can qualitatively explain the observed behavior. The quantitative measurement of single-cell phenotype changes and dynamic analysis presented in this study should shed light on the antibiotic process of different bacteria.",

The ??-?? stacking interaction, simplified as a non-covalent type of functionalization, enables high drug loading and subsequent controlled release of the drug. The encapsulated graphene oxide enhanced the stability of the nanocarrier system in aqueous medium because of the hydrophilicity and cationic nature of chitosan. The loading and release of DOX indicated strong pH dependence and imply hydrogen-bonding interaction between graphene oxide and DOX. The proposed strategy is advantageous in terms of targeted drug delivery and has high potential to address the current challenges in drug delivery.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Drug-induced cholestasis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and viral hepatitis are acquired forms of liver disease. Cholestasis is a pathophysiologic state with impaired bile formation and subsequent accumulation of bile salts in hepatocytes. The bile salt export pump (BSEP) (ABCB11) is the key export system for bile salts from hepatocytes. AREAS COVERED: This article provides an introduction into the physiology of bile formation followed by a summary of the current knowledge on the key bile salt transporters, namely, the sodium-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide NTCP, the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs), BSEP and the multi-drug resistance protein 3. The pathophysiologic consequences of altered functions of these transporters, with an emphasis on molecular and genetic aspects, are then discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Knowledge of the role of hepatocellullar transporters, especially BSEP, in acquired cholestasis is continuously increasing. A common variant of BSEP (p.V444A) is now a well-established susceptibility factor for acquired cholestasis and recent evidence suggests that the same variant also influences the therapeutic response and disease progression of viral hepatitis C. Studies in large independent cohorts are now needed to confirm the relevance of p.V444A. Genome-wide association studies should lead to the identification of additional genetic factors underlying cholestatic liver disease.",

        "abstract": "Background: To date, no systematic examination of the preparedness of individual health care providers and their response capabilities during a large-scale disaster has been conducted. As a result, very little is known about what knowledge, skills and abilities, or professional competencies are needed, or how professional competency requirements may change depending on the circumstances of a disaster. The objective of this pilot study was to collect, explore, and describe background data on professional competencies from health care providers who were involved in the Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita disaster responses. Methods: Utilizing an anonymous survey of a convenience sample, 200 health care providers attending 2 disaster conferences were asked to respond to open-ended questions about the competencies they needed and performed during their disaster response. Results: Of the 200 respondents, registered nurses (37%) and physicians (24%) were the largest categories of providers. Basic clinical care (39%) and triage (26%) were the most frequent response skills reported; the areas wherein respondents felt least prepared were disaster-specific response skills (22%) and systems issues (34%). Only 22% of respondents reported that they did not know a specific skill. The 200 respondents made 495 individual recommendations for future responders, including actions to improve the respondent's personal preparedness (23%) and the need for training (25%). However, only 3% of the recommendations (n = 15) actually identified a specific type of training such as Advanced Cardiac Life Support or triage. Conclusion: Few respondents reported knowledge deficits. Rather, what they described was an abrupt change or transition from their everyday practice worlds that required accommodation in order to practice effectively. Current training programs generally focus on providing skills information. Further research is required to determine if training programs should address facilitating the transition process.",

        "abstract": "Background: Fires that result in a large number of deaths and injuries are quite common in India, presenting many complex emergency management challenges. While significant improvement in disaster management has been noted in recent years, full integration of government emergency management initiatives at the provincial level is still in its infancy. This article presents the findings of a study of a school fire in India that resulted in the deaths of 93??children. The effective provincial level management of this fire, in the absence of a well-defined disaster management plan, was quite encouraging and provides guidance for other disaster managers in the country. Methods: The purpose of the study was to analyze the factors leading to the tragedy, the response of the stakeholders, the relief and rehabilitation support provided to the affected families, and the perceptions of the affected parents regarding their level of satisfaction with the management of this disaster. Extensive visits were made to the damaged school, schools where the rescued and evacuated children were relocated, affected households, injured children, various stakeholders and institutions playing a significant role in managing the incident, and nongovernment organizations working in the field. The study methodology included structured interviews to determine the parents' level of satisfaction with the different elements of the response, participant observations, intensive interaction with the members of the affected families, and focused group discussion with different relevant government officials. Results: The findings indicate a high level of parent and stakeholder satisfaction in the majority of response and relief efforts associated with the disaster. Also reinforced were the importance of adherence to school safety regulations; the role of effective relief and rehabilitation; public-private partnership in disaster management; and the importance of media management, humanitarian assistance during crisis management and response, gender sensitivity in relief and rehabilitation, and services provided to reduce mental health risks for the injured children and families who lost their children in the incident. Conclusions: While the participants in the study perceived the management of the disaster as highly satisfactory, several disaster management elements, particularly disaster mental health services, require further attention at all levels. ?? 2007 Emergency Nurses Association.",

        "title": "Immunological Principles of Adverse Drug Reactions",
        "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions account for between 2 to 5% of all hospital admissions and can prevent the administration of an otherwise effective therapeutic agent. Hypersensitivity or immune-mediated reactions, although less common, tend to be proportionately more serious. There is convincing evidence to implicate the immune system in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions. Our understanding of the way in which the immune system recognises drugs is based on the hapten hypothesis; the onset of hypersensitivity involves drug bioactivation, covalent binding to proteins, followed by uptake, antigen processing and T cell proliferation. Central to this hypothesis is the critical role of drug metabolism, with the balance between metabolic bioactivation and detoxification being one important component of individual susceptibility. The purpose of this review is to classify drug hypersensitivity reactions in terms of their clinical presentation, and also to consider recent advances in our understanding of the chemical, biochemical and, in particular, cellular immunological mechanisms of hypersensitivity. The following topics are reviewed: (i) drug disposition and cellular metabolism; (ii) mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation; (iii) the role of cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules in the induction and maintenance of a polarised immune response; and (iv) the application of the hapten hypothesis, danger hypothesis and serial triggering model to drug hypersensitivity. A greater understanding of the mechanism(s) of hypersensitivity may identify novel therapeutic strategies and help to combat one of the more severe forms of adverse reactions to drugs.

The expression in human placenta and fetal tissues of the proteins most commonly participating in pharmaco/toxicokinetics is reviewed. In case human data are not available, relevant animal data are included. Among transporter proteins ABC transporters, monoamine transporters and organic anion transporters are pharmacologically and toxicologically of main interest. From xenobiotic enzymes, both CYP enzymes and transferases are expressed in fetal liver already during pregnancy. In the placenta, the variety of enzymes is much more restricted. During development dynamic changes occur in both xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. Although the knowledge has increased substantially over the past years it is apparent from the literature that there are uncharacterized areas, especially regarding developmental expression patterns and regulation of transporters in fetal tissues and placenta. Knowledge about tissue-specific distribution and functional significance will aid our understanding of the differences in drug response and risks for adverse events during fetal development.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Smoking has been associated with higher disease activity and poor response to anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We wanted to study the effect of smoking on response to therapy, disease activity measures, and drug survival in RA patients starting their first anti-TNF drug.\\n\\nMETHODS: In 2005, RA patients in a voluntary rheumatology biologics register in Southern Sweden answered a questionnaire that included smoking habits. The primary endpoint comprised the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria at 3, 6, and 12 months. Secondary endpoints were the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) response criteria, and drug survival.\\n\\nRESULTS: Between 1999 and 2005, 23% of RA patients (216/934) in Southern Sweden were current smokers at the start of anti-TNF therapy. Smoking did not influence disease activity at baseline. Heavy smokers had the poorest drug survival. Current smoking was a negative predictive factor for EULAR response at the 3-month follow-up [odds ratio (OR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32-0.87, p = 0.012], and for SDAI response at 3 months (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.77, p = 0.003) and 6 months (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.25-0.88, p = 0.02). A pack-year history of 11-20 was a negative predictive factor for SDAI response at 12 months (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13-0.70, p = 0.005). Smokers had higher visual analogue scale (VAS) global scores, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 3 months.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Current smoking was predictive of poor response to anti-TNF treatment for up to 12 months and heavy smokers had the poorest drug survival.",

The original prototypes of most neuroactive medicines were discovered in humans, rodents and other model organisms. Most of these discoveries were made by chance, but the process of behavior based drug discovery can be made more systematic and efficient. Fully automated platforms for analyzing the behavior of embryonic zebrafish capture digital video recordings of animals in each individual well of a 96-well plate before, during, and after a series of stimuli. To analyze systematically the thousands of behavioral recordings obtained from a large-scale chemical screen, we transform these behavioral recordings into numerical barcodes, providing a concise and interpretable summary of the observed phenotypes in each well. Systems-level analysis of these behavioral phenotypes generate testable hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms of poorly understood drugs and behaviors. By combining the in vivo relevance of behavior-based phenotyping with the scale and automation of modern drug screening technologies, systematic behavioral barcoding represents a means of discovering psychotropic drugs and provides a powerful, systematic approach for unraveling the complexities of vertebrate behavior. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Drug resistance, de novo and acquired, pervades cellular signaling networks (SNs) from one signaling motif to another as a result of cancer progression and/or drug intervention. This resistance is one of the key determinants of efficacy in targeted anti-cancer drug therapy. Although poorly understood, drug resistance is already being addressed in combination therapy by selecting drug targets where SN sensitivity increases due to combination components or as a result of de novo or acquired mutations. Additionally, successive drug combinations have shown low resistance potential. To promote a rational, systematic development of combination therapies, it is necessary to establish the underlying mechanisms that drive the advantages of combination therapies, and design methods to determine drug targets for combination regimens. Based on a joint systems analysis of cellular SN response and its sensitivity to drug action and oncogenic mutations, we describe an in silico method to analyze the targets of drug combinations. Our method explores mechanisms of sensitizing the SN through a combination of two drugs targeting vertical signaling pathways. We propose a paradigm of SN response customization by one drug to both maximize the effect of another drug in combination and promote a robust therapeutic response against oncogenic mutations. The method was applied to customize the response of the ErbB/PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway by combination of drugs targeting HER2 receptors and proteins in the down-stream pathway. The results of a computational experiment showed that the modification of the SN response from hyperbolic to smooth sigmoid response by manipulation of two drugs in combination leads to greater robustness in therapeutic response against oncogenic mutations determining cancer heterogeneity. The application of this method in drug combination co-development suggests a combined evaluation of inhibition effects together with the capability of drug combinations to suppress resistance mechanisms before they become clinically manifest.",

The carrier is characterized by functionalized magnetite (Fe3O4) and conjugated therapeutic agent doxorubicin, which is encapsulated with the thermosensitive polymer, dextran-g-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N,N-dimethylacrylamide) [dextran-g-poly(NIPAAm-co-DMAAm)]. The surface of magnetite nanoparticles was functionalized by chemical bonding with 3-mercaptopropionic acid hydrazide (HSCH2CH2CONHNH2) via Fe-S covalent bonds. The anticancer therapeutic drug, doxorubicin, was attached to the surface of the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles through an acid-labile hydrazone-bond, formed by the reaction of hydrazide group of HSCH2CH2CONHNH2 with the carbonyl group of doxorubicin. The dextran-g-poly(NIPAAm-co-DMAAm) smart polymer exhibits a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of ???38 ??C, which is representative of a phase transition behavior. This behavior allows for an on-off trigger mechanism. At an experimental temperature lower than LCST, the drug release was very low. However, at a temperature greater than LCST, there was an initially rapid drug release followed by a controlled released in the second stage, especially, in the mild acidic buffer solution of pH 5.3. The release of drug is envisaged to occur by the collapse of the encapsulated thermosensitive polymer and cleavage of the acid-labile hydrazone linkage. The proposed carrier is appropriately suitable for magnetic targeting drug delivery system with longer circulation time, reduced side effects and controlled drug release in response to the change in external temperature. ?? 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes moves towards the coordination of efforts to respond to the worsening drug abuse situation in Pakistan which affects all segments of society. The efforts reported seek to rectify inconsistencies in treatment policy resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes. Examples of collaborative strategies with encouraging results need further underpinning and expansion. There is, however, a lack of realization at the policy level of the need to effect changes in treatment formulated on a consistent and evidence-based approach. Policy has therefore been reviewed and proposals made for a comprehensive treatment strategy in line with international best practices to deal with this problem effectively and efficiently. Establishment of an addiction study centre at university level to continue professional and academic development is suggested.",

        "abstract": "Individual risk of toxicity or cancer reflects the amount of exposure to environmental agents, combined with one's underlying genetic predisposition. More than six dozen human ecogenetic polymorphisms have been described; whereas some of these have been demonstrated to be associated with altered risks of toxicity or cancer, others presently remain equivocal and require further study. Thus, genetic differences in the regulation, expression and activity of \"environmental susceptibility genes\" can be decisive in defining susceptibility to toxicity or cancer. \"Drug-metabolizing enzymes\" (DMEs) are regarded as one class of environmental susceptibility genes. DME genes have actually existed on this planet for more than 2.5 billion years, and might more appropriately be named \"effector-metabolizing enzymes.\" Receptors controlling DME levels have been called \"DME receptors.\" DMEs have functioned in many critical life processes in prokaryotes and, more recently, in countless basic functions in plants and animals - events that evolved long before the existence of pharmaceutical companies and apothecaries. DME genes exist in every eukaryotic cell and probably in all prokaryotes. Virtually all environmental agents act as either agonists or antagonists - in competing with endogenous ligands that bind to DME receptors and/or competing as substrates for the DMEs. Over the past decade it has become clear that each of us has our own \"individual fingerprint\" of unique alleles coding for DMEs. The underlying genetic predisposition of each patient will reflect combinations of poor- and extensive-metabolizer phenotypes; if these enzymes cooperate in the same metabolic pathway for any given drug or environmental agent, such ecogenetic variability might be synergistic and lead to as much as 30- or >40-fold differences in activation or degradation. The end result can be large interindividual differences in risk of environmentally caused toxicity or cancer.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The nursing profession is developing educational resources to improve their response to victims of nuclear, biological, and chemical terrorism. Future nurses may differ from practicing nurses in their perspective of what is critical information. The purpose of this study was to identify student nurses' major concerns in relation to working with victims of terrorism. Method: A descriptive study was used to identify how future nurses might practice as caregivers for victims of terrorism. The study population consisted of a convenience sample of 95 junior and senior baccalaureate nursing students at a mid-south state university. The students were given an anonymous questionnaire regarding their concerns and how their lives had changed after September 11, 2001. The questionnaire consisted of 19 major items that identified demographics and perceptions and concerns regarding preparedness, willingness to work, expectation of future terrorism events, effect on lifestyle, and other fears related to terrorism or caring for victims of terrorism. A Cronbach alpha coefficient of reliability on standardized items was .745. Results: Students' primary concern was for the safety of themselves and their families. They were primarily concerned about having adequate protection for all types of terrorist agents and indicated they would not be willing to care for victims if there was a lack of protection for both themselves and family. Although the nursing school faculty had provided self-education information about terrorism, students did not demonstrate an accurate understanding of the pathogenic nature of many agents.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters act as translocators of numerous substrates across extracellular and intracellular membranes, thereby contributing to bioavailability and consequently therapy response. Genetic polymorphisms are considered as critical determinants of expression level or activity and subsequently response to selected drugs. AREAS COVERED: Here the influence of polymorphisms of the prominent ABC transporters P-glycoprotein (MDR1, ABCB1), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) and the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2 (ABCC2) as well as MRP3 (ABCC3) on the pharmacokinetic of drugs and associated consequences on therapy response and clinical outcome is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: ABC transporter genetic variants were assumed to affect interindividual differences in pharmacokinetics and subsequently clinical response. However, decades of medical research have not yielded in distinct and unconfined reproducible outcomes. Despite some unique results, the majority were inconsistent and dependent on the analyzed cohort or study design. Therefore, variability of bioavailability and drug response may be attributed only by a small amount to polymorphisms in transporter genes, whereas transcriptional regulation or post-transcriptional modification seems to be more critical. In our opinion, currently identified genetic variants of ABC efflux transporters can give some hints on the role of transporters at interfaces but are less suitable as biomarkers to predict therapeutic outcome.",

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Panels of cell-lines such as the NCI-60 have long been used to test drug candidates for their ability to inhibit proliferation. Predictive models of in-vitro drug sensitivity have previously been constructed using gene-expression signatures generated from gene-expression microarrays. These statistical models allow the prediction of drug response for cell-lines not in the original NCI-60. We improve on existing techniques by developing a novel multi-step algorithm that builds regression models of drug response using Random Forest, an ensemble approach based on classification and regression trees(CART). RESULTS: This method proved successful in predicting drug response for both a panel of 19 Breast-Cancer and 7 Glioma cell-lines, outperformed other methods based on differential gene expression, and has general utility for any application that seeks to relate gene-expression data to a continuous output variable. Implementation: Software was written in the R language and will be available together with associated gene expression and drug response data as the package ivDrug at: http://r-forge.r-project.org.

        "abstract": "The mechanism by which CYP2B6*6 allele alters drug metabolism in vitro and in vivo is not fully understood. To test the hypothesis that altered substrate binding and/or catalytic properties contribute to its functional consequences, efavirenz 8-hydroxylation and bupropion 4-hydroxylation were determined in CYP2B6.1 and CYP2B6.6 proteins expressed without and with cytochrome b5 (Cyt b5) and in human liver microsomes (HLMs) obtained from liver tissues genotyped for the CYP2B6*6 allele. The susceptibility of the variant protein to inhibition was also tested in HLMs. Significantly higher V(max) and K(m) values for 8-hydroxyefavirenz formation and \u223c2-fold lower intrinsic clearance (Cl(int)) were noted in expressed CYP2B6.6 protein (-b5) compared with that of CYP2B6.1 protein (-b5); this effect was abolished by Cyt b5. The V(max) and Cl(int) values for 4-hydroxybupropion formation were significantly higher in CYP2B6.6 than in CYP2B6.1 protein, with no difference in K(m), whereas coexpression with Cyt b5 reversed the genetic effect on these kinetic parameters. In HLMs, CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype was associated with markedly lower V(max) (and moderate increase in K(m)) and thus lower Cl(int) values for efavirenz and bupropion metabolism, but no difference in catalytic properties was noted between CYP2B6*1/*1 and CYP2B6*1/*6 genotypes. Inhibition of efavirenz 8-hydroxylation by voriconazole was significantly greater in HLMs with the CYP2B6*6 allele (K(i) = 1.6 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcM) than HLMs with CYP2B6*1/*1 genotype (K(i) = 3.0 \u00b1 1.1 \u03bcM). In conclusion, our data suggest the CYP2B6*6 allele influences metabolic activity by altering substrate binding and catalytic activity in a substrate- and Cyt b5-dependent manner. It may also confer susceptibility to inhibition.",

However, the effects of antiproliferative drugs used in current drug-eluting stents (DES) on EPC proliferative and antithrombotic function remains poorly defined. METHOD AND RESULTS: Herein, we studied and compared the in vitro and in vivo effects of four antiproliferative drugs - paclitaxel, sirolimus, everolimus, and zotarolimus on several EPC properties including colony forming units (CFU), cell proliferation, apoptosis, antithrombotic and prothrombotic gene expression and nitric oxide (NO) as well as prostacyclin (PGI(2)) release. We also examined EPC migration and adhesion under flow conditions. We find that whereas all antiproliferative agents inhibited EPC proliferation and caused cell apoptosis, only paclitaxel and sirolimus reduced CFU formation. Paclitaxel treatment also resulted in the greatest down-regulation of antithrombotic gene expression and up-regulation of prothrombotic gene expression. NO release, migration, and adhesion of EPC under shear stress were inhibited by all antiproliferative drugs, most notably by paclitaxel and sirolimus. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that antiproliferative drugs on DES, particularly paclitaxel, impair the proliferative and antithrombotic functions of EPC, and thereby could contribute to incomplete vascular healing and increase the risk of stent thrombosis.",

However, the effects of antiproliferative drugs used in current drug-eluting stents (DES) on EPC proliferative and antithrombotic function remains poorly defined. Method and results: Herein, we studied and compared the in vitro and in vivo effects of four antiproliferative drugs - paclitaxel, sirolimus, everolimus, and zotarolimus on several EPC properties including colony forming units (CFU), cell proliferation, apoptosis, antithrombotic and prothrombotic gene expression and nitric oxide (NO) as well as prostacyclin (PGI2) release. We also examined EPC migration and adhesion under flow conditions. We find that whereas all antiproliferative agents inhibited EPC proliferation and caused cell apoptosis, only paclitaxel and sirolimus reduced CFU formation. Paclitaxel treatment also resulted in the greatest down-regulation of antithrombotic gene expression and up-regulation of prothrombotic gene expression. NO release, migration, and adhesion of EPC under shear stress were inhibited by all antiproliferative drugs, most notably by paclitaxel and sirolimus. Conclusions: These results indicate that antiproliferative drugs on DES, particularly paclitaxel, impair the proliferative and antithrombotic functions of EPC, and thereby could contribute to incomplete vascular healing and increase the risk of stent thrombosis. ?? 2012.",

        "title": "Searching for Drug Synergy in Complex Dose-Response Landscapes Using an Interaction Potency Model",
        "abstract": "Rational design of multi-targeted drug combinations is a promising strategy to tackle the drug resistance problem for many complex disorders. A drug combination is usually classified as synergistic or antagonistic, depending on the deviation of the observed combination response from the expected effect calculated based on a reference model of non-interaction. The existing reference models were proposed originally for low-throughput drug combination experiments, which make the model assumptions often incompatible with the complex drug interaction patterns across various dose pairs that are typically observed in large-scale dose-response matrix experiments. To address these limitations, we proposed a novel reference model, named zero interaction potency (ZIP), which captures the drug interaction relationships by comparing the change in the potency of the dose-response curves between individual drugs and their combinations. We utilized a delta score to quantify the deviation from the expectation of zero interaction, and proved that a delta score value of zero implies both probabilistic independence and dose additivity. Using data from a large-scale anticancer drug combination experiment, we demonstrated empirically how the ZIP scoring approach captures the experimentally confirmed drug synergy while keeping the false positive rate at a low level. Further, rather than relying on a single parameter to assess drug interaction, we proposed the use of an interaction landscape over the full dose-response matrix to identify and quantify synergistic and antagonistic dose regions. The interaction landscape offers an increased power to differentiate between various classes of drug combinations, and may therefore provide an improved means for understanding their mechanisms of action toward clinical translation.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the rate of sustained response (SR) to high-dose daily interferon (IFN) therapy in prior drug abusers with chronic hepatitis C. This was a retrospective matched cohort study conducted at a tertiary care university hospital in a large urban area. METHODS: The 120 individuals in each cohort were treated by the same physicians at the same facility, using the same treatment protocol and management procedures. Each patient received 5 million units of IFN daily for at least 1 yr and usually longer. RESULTS: Both groups achieved a similar rate of SR (no i.v. drug abuse, 37% vs i.v. drug abuse, 33%). The end of treatment (ET) response rate was unexpectedly higher in the drug-abusing population as compared to that non-drug-abusing control subjects but fell during the follow-up period to achieve an SR similar to that of the non-drug-abusing controls. The side effects of IFN therapy were no greater in the prior drug abusing population than in the controls, although many in the drug-abusing group increased their dose of methadone to counteract IFN side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The SR rate achieved by intravenous drug abusers to high-dose, daily IFN is similar to that in a non-drug-abusing HCV positive population. Recent use of illicit drugs within a 6-month period of starting IFN therapy or continued methadone use during treatment does not seem to impair the response to IFN when the results are compared with those of a matched cohort of non-drug-abusing controls.",

        "abstract": "Public communication on safety concerns over medicines and advice on how to prevent medicine-induced patient harm is a decisive challenge for the overall success of those responsible for pharmacovigilance. It was in this spirit that the topic of commu-nication in drug safety was put on the agenda of the 10th Annual Meeting of the International Society of Pharmacovigilance (ISoP) in Accra, Ghana, on 5 November 2010, as a follow-up to the sessions on communications at previous an-nual meetings. The informal environment chosen this time was different and unusual but ideal for the topic at stake; an interactive debate involving all participants in the session with the objective of understanding the characteristics of effective communication. Around 30 participants from all over the world came together and presented views from their various perspectives; community and hospital pharmacy, academia, pharmacovigilance centres and regulatory agencies, as well as international bodies. Much is known in theory about good com-munication practices, particularly with regard to the need for clear messages targeted at different populations. But how to achieve this in practice? Reciprocity was defined as the starting point; an exchange of information based on mutual re-spect and shared interest. Two crude commu-nication levels are to be distinguished; one-to-one communication between patients and healthcare professionals, versus mass communication -with smaller or larger audiences -by those investigat-ing and regulating medicines. Independently of the level, the principles of reciprocity and inter-action should apply, not least in the research and planning stage, before communication takes place. The interactive debate was a free-flowing dis-cussion where almost all participants took the floor and presented examples, bringing the prin-ciples and challenges of their application to life. Patients' misunderstandings as to the indication and adverse effects of medicines seem frequent. This was illustrated by examples, including one on women's fears over adverse effects resulting in infertility and termination of pregnancy. The introduction of a communication protocol for thoroughly informing the women concerned in the presence of a third-party witness or supporter has solved the problem in the setting presented. Other examples related to communication over counterfeit medicines, another difficult area given that many people feel they do not have the finan-cial means for, or easy access to, quality-assured products. 882 Bahri et al. The discussion then turned to the topic of feed-back, a further crucial characteristic of reciprocal communication. In one-to-one settings, this may well be achieved, as a participating pharmacist explained, through actively soliciting from the patient a repetition or rehearsal of what was un-derstood. In mass communication settings, ob-taining feedback is no less essential but more complex, and regulators will have to look into designing participation models accordingly. Other aspects for regulators to look at were identified. Participants in the debate stated that regulators often do not consider in their decision-making the situation of health workers in their local setting (particularly relating to easy access to up-to-date safety information), and that there is a need to build sound, trusting partnerships with patients and healthcare professionals. These partnerships may also provide a framework to develop recommendations for one-to-one com-munications between healthcare professionals and patients on certain safety concerns. The partici-pants highlighted the need for regulators to better explain to the public the rationale for regulatory decisions. Towards the end of the workshop, the experi-ences shared during the discussion helped to iden-tify more accurately what targeted, clear messages mean in practice: \u2022 Messages should address, in clear terms, the information needs of the various audiences, in an appropriate language and by suitable methods and, in particular, fill the respective information gaps. \u2022 Messages should describe the action desired as outcome from the communication, where that action has been agreed between the commu-nicating parties on the basis of shared under-standing and purpose. \u2022 Messages prepared for targeted populations should easily enable further individuahzation for one-to-one communications, taking into account the literacy level, psychology and social environment of the given patient. Implementing these recommendations will re-quire outreach to the healthcare communities and finding ways to engage patients. A comment was raised that thought should also be given to how to strengthen communication with health politi-cians and policy makers, who need information for decision-making on the one hand and shape so much of the communications environment by their decisions on the other.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacotherapy is the mainstay in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and the armamentarium of drugs available for the therapy of this disease is still expanding. Anti-Parkinson's disease drugs are effective in reducing the physical symptoms, such as hypokinesia, bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. However, there is a large interindividual variability in response to anti-Parkinson's disease drugs with respect to both drug efficacy and toxicity. It is thought that genetic variability in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug receptors and proteins involved in pathway signaling is an important factor in determining interindividual variability in drug response. Pharmacogenetics aims at identifying genetic markers associated with drug response. Ideally, knowledge of these genetic markers will enable us to predict an individual's drug response in terms of both efficacy and toxicity. The role of pharmacogenetics in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is relatively unexplored. Therefore, we aim to present a systematic review of the published pharmacogenetic studies in Parkinson's disease and to describe polymorphic genes of interest for future research.",

We assessed the UNAIDS/Uganda Ministry of Health HIV Drug Access Initiative - one of the first pilot antiretroviral programmes in Africa - in which patients paid for their medications at negotiated reduced prices. Methods: We assessed patients' clinical and laboratory information from August, 1998, to July, 2000, from three of the five accredited treatment centres in Uganda, and tested a subset of specimens for phenotypic drug resistance. Findings: 912 patients presented for care at five treatment centres. We assessed the care of 476 patients at three centres, of whom 399 started antiretroviral therapy. 204 (51%) received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), 189 (47%) dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (2NRTI), and six (2%) NRTI monotherapy. Median baseline CD4 cell counts were 73 cells/??L (IQR 15-187); viral load was 193 817 copies/mL (37 013-651 716). The probability of remaining alive and in care was 0.63 (95% CI 0.58-0.67) at 6 months and 0.49 (0.43-0.55) at 1 year. Patients receiving HAART had greater virological responses than those receiving 2NRTI. Cox's proportional hazards models adjusted for viral load and regimen showed that a CD4 cell count of less than 50 cells/??L (vs 50 cells/??L or more) was strongly associated with death (hazard ratio 2.93 [1.51-5.68], p=0.001). Among 82 patients with a viral load of more than 1000 copies/mL more than 90 days into therapy, phenotypic resistance to NRTIs was found for 47 (57%): 29 of 37 (78%) who never received HAART versus 18 of 45 (40%) who received HAART (p=0.0005). Interpretation: This pilot programme successfully expanded access to antiretroviral drugs in Uganda. Identification and treatment of patients earlier in the course of their illness and increased use of HAART could improve probability of survival and decrease drug resistance.",

        "title": "An interethnic comparison of polymorphisms of the genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters: experience in Singapore.",
        "abstract": "Much of the interindividual variability in drug response is attributable to the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. In recent years, we have investigated the polymorphisms in a number of genes encoding phase I and II drug-metabolizing enzymes including CYPIA1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, GSTM1, NAT2, UGT1A1, and TPMT and drug transporter (MDR1) in three distinct Asian populations in Singapore, namely the Chinese, Malays, and Indians. Significant differences in the frequencies of common alleles encoding these proteins have been observed among these three ethnic groups. For example, the frequency of the variant A2455G polymorphism of CYP1A1 was 28% in Chinese and 31% in Malays, but only 18% in Indians. CYP3A4*4 was detected in two of 110 Chinese subjects, but absent in Indians and Malays. Many Chinese and Malays (61-63%) were homozygous for the GSTM1*0 null genotype compared with 33% of Indians. The frequency of the UGTIA1*28 allele was highest in the Indian population (35%) compared to similar frequencies that were found in the Chinese (16%) and Malay (19%) populations. More importantly, our experience over the years has shown that the pharmacogenetics of these drug-metabolizing enzymes and MDR1 in the Asian populations are different from these in the Caucasian and African populations. For example, the CYP3A4*1B allele, which contains an A-290G substitution in the promoter region of CYP3A4, is absent in all three Asian populations of Singapore studied, but occurs in more than 54% of Africans and 5% of Caucasians. There were no difference in genotype and allelic variant frequencies in exon 12 of MDR1 between the Chinese, Malay, and Indian populations. When compared with other ethnic groups, the distribution of the wild-type C allele in exon 12 in the Malays (34.2%) and Indians (32.8%) was relatively high and similar to the Japanese (38.55%) and Caucasians (41%) but different from African-Americans (15%). The frequency of wild-type TT genotype in Asians (43.5% to 52.1%) and Japanese (61.5%) was much higher than those found in Caucasians (13.3%). All the proteins we studied represent the primary hepatic or extrahepatic enzymes, and their polymorphic expression may be implicated in disease risk and the disposition of drugs or endogenous substances. As such, dose requirements of certain drugs may not be optimal for Asian populations, and a second look at the factors responsible for this difference is necessary.",

The targeting of oncogenic protein tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways in cancer cells ushered in the molecularly targeted approach to therapeutics. The signaling cascade is initiated by the growth factors binding to their cognate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) at the extracellular domain. Protein and lipid kinases modulate the cellular functions of numerous other proteins and play critical roles in signal transduction pathways of cell growth and proliferation. The chapter explains the major receptor and cytosolic tyrosine kinases identified as novel cancer targets. It is found that, in addition to the HER or erbB family of oncogenic RTKs, several other RTKs constitute potential novel molecular targets for cancer drug discovery such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor has also been shown to be important in cancer progression and angiogenesis. Its overexpression has been correlated with treatment failure and mortality in brain, breast, cervical, esophageal, oropharyngeal, and ovarian cancers.",

        "abstract": "Global analysis of expression profiles using DNA microarrays was performed between a reference strain H37Rv and two clinical extensively drug-resistant isolates in response to three anti-tuberculosis drug exposures (isoniazid, capreomycin, and rifampicin). A deep analysis was then conducted using a combination of genome sequences of the resistant isolates, resistance information, and related public microarray data. Certain known resistance-associated gene sets were significantly overrepresented in upregulated genes in the resistant isolates relative to that observed in H37Rv, which suggested a link between resistance and expression levels of particular genes. In addition, isoniazid and capreomycin response genes, but not rifampicin, either obtained from published works or our data, were highly consistent with the differentially expressed genes of resistant isolates compared to those of H37Rv, indicating a strong association between drug resistance of the isolates and genes differentially regulated by isoniazid and capreomycin exposures. Based on these results, 92 genes of the studied isolates were identified as candidate resistance genes, 10 of which are known resistance-related genes. Regulatory network analysis of candidate resistance genes using published networks and literature mining showed that three two-component regulatory systems and regulator CRP play significant roles in the resistance of the isolates by mediating the production of essential envelope components. Finally, drug sensitivity testing indicated strong correlations between expression levels of these regulatory genes and sensitivity to multiple anti-tuberculosis drugs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These findings may provide novel insights into the mechanism underlying the emergence and development of drug resistance in resistant tuberculosis isolates and useful clues for further studies on this issue.",

Dendritic cells (DCs) have been extensively explored as a cellular vaccine for the stimulation of tumor specific T cells. Several strategies have been devised to manipulate these cells to become strongly activated tumor associated antigen (TAA) presenting cells. Our growing knowledge on the biology of DCs and the co- stimulatory as well as inhibitory molecules expressed by them, provides us with opportunities to generate DCs that are capable of hyper-activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) whilst they impact on regulatory T cells (Treg ), which are now well established to be an important contributor to failure of cancer vaccines. In this chapter, we will focus on the cross talk between DCs and T cells mediated by the CD70/CD27 and PD-L1/PD-1 axis as these have been identified as critical pathways in the regulation of immunity versus tolerance.",

As with any disaster, children are at risk for developing short- and long-term psychological consequences, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One area particularly affected by this disaster was southern India. Five hundred twenty-three juvenile survivors of the tsunami were studied to determine the prevalence of PTSD. The survey was conducted in 2 waves. Interviews were conducted by postgraduate psychiatric social work students, proficient in the local language of Tamil and trained in PTSD-related data collection. The Impact of Event Scale-8 items Tamil Version and Child Behaviour Checklist Post-traumatic Stress Disorder-Tamil Revised Version, with age-specific measures and validated for the local culture and language, were used for the study. Our study revealed a prevalence of 70.7% for acute PTSD and 10.9% for delayed onset PTSD. PTSD was more prevalent among girls and more severe among adolescents exposed to loss of life or property. These results indicate that PTSD is widely prevalent among the survivors of the tsunami, reinforcing the need to develop an effective, culturally sensitive outreach therapy strategy for them.

The Florida Department of Health requested assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a rapid assessment in Santa Rosa and Escambia counties to determine the health impact of the hurricane and needs of the affected population. Methods: A questionnaire was administered 6 days after the hurricane made landfall. The survey instrument elicited information about house damage, illness/injury, and access to utilities. A modified cluster sampling method was used to select 30 clusters in each county. Seven households were interviewed in each cluster and reported weighted frequencies. Results: Three quarters of houses in each county were damaged. Households in Santa Rosa and Escambia lacked basic utilities, including regular garbage pick-up, telephone service, and electricity. Fifty-four percent of households in Santa Rosa and 27% in Escambia reported using a generator. The most commonly self-reported health conditions were sleep disturbances in Santa Rosa (54%) and upper respiratory problems in Escambia (46%). Injuries were reported in fewer than 15% of households in each county. Conclusion: Rapid restoration of power, telephone services, and debris pick-up remained a priority 1 week after the event. Findings demonstrated the need for (1) mental health and primary care services, (2) information about safe generator use, and (3) ways to access medical care and medications.

        "abstract": "Bioterrorism represents a threat for which most emergency departments (EDs) are ill prepared. In order to develop an evidence-based plan for ED and hospital management of contaminated patients, a review was conducted of the most effective strategies developed during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, as well as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and military guidelines on biowarfare. Six basic steps were identified: 1) lock down the hospital and control access to the ED; 2) protect emergency care personnel with appropriate personal protective equipment; 3) decontaminate and triage patients; 4) isolate patients; 5) treat patients with appropriate medications or measures, including decontamination of wounds; and 6) use restrictive admission and transfer guidelines. By emphasizing these six basic concepts, a rural ED passed an annual state-run bioterrorism mass-casualty drill. The drill provided health care personnel with the knowledge and skills necessary to prepare for future bioterrorism casualties. These same concepts could also be used to manage highly virulent viral or bacterial outbreaks. ?? 2007 Emergency Nurses Association.",

Objective: This study examines the concept of support as perceived by aid workers who had recent experience in complex emergencies. Method: Using a phenomenological approach, 6 professional aid workers were interviewed about their experience. Results: Aid workers who work in complex emergencies do not feel supported at the pre-deployment, during deployment, and after deployment phases. Failure to provide this support may cause disappointment, reduced self-worth, anger with the organization, and feeling of lack of achievement regarding self and the mission. Conclusion: While the study may be limited by the volunteer sample and potential bias in data collection, the findings reiterate a proverbial but important issue in relation to aid relief staff in complex emergencies. ?? 2007 Emergency Nurses Association.",

        "abstract": "Excerpt Recent advances in genomic sequencing and bioinformatics have led to development of noninvasive detection methods with detection rates approaching those obtained with amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Recently, a novel prenatal testing method has become available. This method, known as non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), is a molecular approach for assessing fetal aneuploidy using cell-free fetal deoxyribonucleic acid (cffDNA) from the plasma of pregnant women. NIPT has a false positive rate of about 0.2% and detection rate of about 98% for Down syndrome. NIPT has been used for assessing abnormalities such as trisomy 21, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13. Approximately 10% to 15% of the cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in maternal blood comprises of cffDNA. The half-life of cffDNA is short and clears from maternal circulation soon after delivery. Hence, there is no risk of fetal DNA persisting from one pregnancy to the next and confounding test results. The cost of NIPT ranges from US$800 to US$2000 in the USA and from US$500 to US$1500 elsewhere. A Canadian economic study reported a cost range of C$600 to C$800 for NIPT. Among other factors, cost implications for introducing this new technology in clinical practice will need to be considered. At present there is some uncertainty around the incorporation of NIPT into current strategies for prenatal screening and diagnosis. The purpose of this report is to provide information on the cost-effectiveness of non-invasive pre-natal testing and to describe evidence-based guidelines for its use.",

        "abstract": "Background: A mass casualty incident (MCI) demands rapid and efficient triage of victims. The Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) protocol has been proposed to identify salvageable victims from those with imminent mortality. This study evaluates the efficacy of START triage to predict likelihood of mortality of an MCI trauma victim. Methods: Trauma patients were randomly selected using the trauma database at a local Level II trauma center. Survival was defined as a discharge from the hospital with the primary endpoint being death. For respiratory rate <30, pulse <100, and Glasgow Coma Scale score >14, one point was given to the victim for each category. Persons who did not meet these criteria were given a score of zero. The scores were then tabulated and analyzed with respect to the primary endpoint. Results: Of the 355 persons analyzed, 341 (96%) survived and 14 (3.9%) were categorized as deceased. For patients with a tabulated score ???1, the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 0.4 and 0.98, respectively. For patients with a tabulated score of ???2, the PPV and NPV were 0.08 and 0.99, respectively. Discussion: Of the total victims, 75.77% with a respiratory rate <30, palpable radial pulse, and intact mental status survived. The deceased victims with tabulated scores of 1, 2, and 3 had mortalities of 50%, 28%, and 21%, respectively. The trend toward lower tabulated scores in the deceased victims suggests efficacy with START triage. ?? 2007 The Emergency Nurses Association.",

Burn patients are best treated in a specialized unit, however, transfer may not always be practical or possible. If transfer is not an option, hospitals need to find another solution to provide safe, effective, and efficient care. A critical element in providing burn care is to have a sufficient number of capable trained nurses. The Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, Israel evaluated past experience and has developed an innovative and comprehensive plan to provide treatment for a large influx of burn patients. The plan allows the 15-bed burn unit to expand and treat up to 136 burn victims, uses supplementary personnel, and allocates hospital beds and equipment as needed. This article describes the educational program that is used to prepare supplemental nurses.",

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\u03b1-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD \u2264 2.0 \u00c5 for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.",

One study participant for each household was evaluated for mental health and psychosocial changes after the earthquakes. The participant's questionnaire was used to investigate the relationship between physical health, access to health care, housing, food and water, and the occurrence of negative mental health markers six months after the disasters. RESULTS: Findings indicate that the majority (67%) of respondents experienced 6 or more mental health complaints. Risk factors associated with multiple negative mental health symptoms included change in household income and loss of job, a new illness or a new injury in the household, reliance on healthcare services since the earthquake, and managing a chronic illness. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate a need for rapid, acute mental health screening with at-risk groups and the need to educate the entire community regarding what medical and mental health treatments are available to reduce barriers to treatment and increase public awareness.",

One of the major challenges for the organizations is the high turnover rate among their personnel. Another is recruiting the right persons. As part of a series of studies investigating factors that affect the recruitment process and the success of assignment, this qualitative study examined health professionals' motivations for volunteering, their various concerns, and their expectations about themselves and the organizations for which they would work. The findings from focus group interviews with potential humanitarian volunteers were considered within the framework of Hertzberg's theory of motivations and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. The study has significant implications for personnel policy and practice in the humanitarian sector. Recruitment officers should have the self-actualized person, as described by Maslow, in mind when interviewing candidates. This perspective would make it easier for them to understand the candidates' thoughts and concerns and would lead to more effective interventions. Program officers should have satisfiers and dissatisfiers, as identified by Herzberg, in mind when planning programs.

To gain a preliminary indication of MA users' response to drug court intervention, we compared a group of 57 MA-dependent participants treated in outpatient treatment within the context of a drug court to a group of comparable MA-dependent individuals treated in outpatient treatment but not supervised by a drug court (n = 230). Analyses reveal that drug court participation was associated with better rates of engagement, retention, completion, and abstinence, compared to outpatient treatment without drug court supervision. Six- and 12-month outcome analyses indicated that participants who were enrolled in drug court intervention used MA significantly less frequently. These findings suggest that drug court supervision coupled with treatment may improve the outcomes of MA-dependent offenders beyond that seen from treatment alone. \u00a9 2008.",

        "abstract": "Pulse pressure (PP) is emerging as a major pressure predictor of cardiac disease. The study comprised 10 185 untreated patients with essential hypertension. A total of 5395 men and 4790 women 56+/-13 years old, with uncomplicated essential hypertension, after a 15-day washout period and after 6 months of antihypertensive monotherapy were included. All patients included in the final cohort were responders and had normalized their blood pressure. PP was decreased least with diuretics (-5 mm Hg) and most with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium antagonists (-15 mm Hg), followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (-12 mm Hg) alpha- and beta-blockers (-10 and -9 mm Hg), differentiating among antihypertensive classes (P<0.001). The magnitude of PP fall was related to the degree of left ventricular (LV) mass reduction (P<0.001), seen best with ARBs (r=0.42) and least with ACEIs (r=0.18). Of the antihypertensive medications used in everyday practice, PP decrease may be achieved best with ARBs and calcium antagonists, whereas diuretics confer poor response. PP was decreased least with diuretics (-5 mm Hg) and most with ARBs and calcium channel blockers (-15 mm Hg), followed by ACEI (-12 mm Hg) alpha- and beta-blockers (-10 and -9 mm Hg), differentiating among antihypertensive classes (P<0.001). Of the antihypertensive medications used in everyday practice, PP decrease may be achieved best with ARBs and calcium antagonists.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In July 2013, during annual independence celebrations in Kiribati, staff at Tungaru Central Hospital on South Tarawa reported an increase in children presenting with severe diarrhoea. This report describes the outbreak investigation, findings and response.\\n\\nMETHOD: After notification of the outbreak, all health facilities on South Tarawa began reporting cases of acute diarrhoea and/or vomiting through the early warning syndromic surveillance system on a daily basis. Community awareness was raised and the public was encouraged to present to a health facility if ill with acute gastroenteritis. Specimens were collected and sent for laboratory testing.\\n\\nRESULTS: Between 10 and 24 July 2013, 1118 cases of gastroenteritis were reported; 103 were hospitalized and six died. The median age of cases was one year (range: 0-68 years); 93.4% were aged less than five years. Rotavirus was identified in 81% of specimens tested. The outbreak response included enhanced surveillance, community education, clinical training and changes to in-hospital patient management for infection control.\\n\\nDISCUSSION: This outbreak was the largest diarrhoea outbreak in Kiribati in five years. Factors that may have contributed to the magnitude and severity of the outbreak included high household density, inadequate sanitation infrastructure and a mass gathering--all increasing the chance of transmission--as well as limited clinical response capacity. The current outbreak highlights the importance of clinical management to minimize severe dehydration and death. Rotavirus vaccination should be considered as an adjunct to other comprehensive enteric disease control measures as recommended by the World Health Organization.",

Dual specificity phosphatase 6 is dynamically regulated in developmental and pathological conditions such as cancer.\\n\\nMETHODS: Cancer cell lines were made deficient in DUSP6 by siRNA and shRNA silencing.

        "abstract": "The number of physical conditions and chemical agents induce accumulation of misfolded proteins creating proteotoxic stress. This leads to activation of adaptive pro-survival pathway, known as heat shock response (HSR), resulting in expression of additional chaperones. Several cancer treatment approaches, such as proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib and hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, involve activation of proteotoxic stress. Low efficacy of these therapies is likely due to the protective effects of HSR induced in treated cells, making this pathway an attractive target for pharmacological suppression. We found that the anti-malaria drugs quinacrine (QC) and emetine prevented HSR in cancer cells, as judged by induction of hsp70 expression. As opposed to emetine, which inhibited general translation, QC did not affect protein synthesis, but rather suppressed inducible HSF1-dependent transcription of the hsp70 gene in a relatively selective manner. The treatment of tumor cells in vitro with a combination of non-toxic concentrations of QC and proteotoxic stress inducers resulted in rapid induction of apoptosis. The effect was similar if QC was substituted by siRNA against hsp70, suggesting that the HSR inhibitory activity of QC was responsible for cell sensitization to proteotoxic stress inducers. QC was also found to enhance the antitumor efficacy of proteotoxic stress inducers in vivo: combinatorial treatment with 17-DMAG + QC resulted in suppression of tumor growth in two mouse syngeneic models. These results reveal that QC is an inhibitor of HSF1-mediated HSR. As such, this compound has significant clinical potential as an adjuvant in therapeutic strategies aimed at exploiting the cytotoxic potential of proteotoxic stress.",

        "abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia often have anxiety and depression, and thus are treated with multiple psychotherapeutic medications. This practice of polypharmacy increases the possibility for drug-drug interactions. However, the pharmacological and behavioral mechanisms underlying drug-drug interactions in schizophrenia remain poorly understood. In the present study, we adopted a preclinical approach and examined a less known behavioral mechanism, drug-drug conditioning (DDC) between haloperidol (a typical antipsychotic) or olanzapine (atypical antipsychotic) and citalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). A rat two-way conditioned avoidance response paradigm was used to measure antipsychotic activity and determine how DDC may alter the antipsychotic efficacy in this model. Following acquisition of the avoidance response, rats were then randomly assigned to receive vehicle, citalopram (10.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg, subcutaneously), olanzapine (1.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously), combined haloperidol with citalopram, or combined olanzapine with citalopram treatment for seven avoidance test sessions. In comparison with antipsychotic treatment alone, combined treatment with citalopram potentiated the antiavoidance effect of olanzapine or haloperidol (to a lesser extent) during the seven drug-test sessions. In addition, repeated pairing of citalopram with haloperidol or olanzapine caused citalopram to show a newly acquired avoidance-disruptive effect. This effect was context specific because citalopram paired with haloperidol or olanzapine outside the avoidance testing context (i.e. home cages) did not show such an effect. These findings indicate that concurrent antidepressant and antipsychotic treatments may engender a DDC process that follows the general Pavlovian associative conditioning principles. They also indicate that adjunctive citalopram treatment may enhance the antipsychotic efficacy of haloperidol and olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "The chapter focuses on various pathways that positively and negatively regulate the cell death process in response to anticancer-drug induced damage. Currently used anticancer drugs simultaneously activate several pathways that either positively or negatively regulate cell death induction. The main pathway from specific damage induced by these drugs to apoptosis involves activation of caspases in the cytosol by proapoptotic molecules, such as cytochrome c, released from the mitochondria under the control of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Anticancer drugs modulate this pathway by modifying the expression of Bcl-2 proteins, their activity, and their subcellular localization. Anticancer drugs can also up-regulate the expression of death receptors, such as Fas (APO-1/CD95) and TRAIL receptors, and sensitize tumor cells to their cognate ligands. The Fas\u2013FasL interaction could amplify early steps of drug-induced apoptosis while up-regulation of TRAIL receptors offers the opportunity for a synergistic administration of an anticancer drug and TRAIL. In addition, anticancer drugs activate in tumor cells several lipid-dependent signal transduction pathways that either increase or decrease their ability to die by apoptosis. Better understanding of apoptotic pathways and their modulation by various negative and positive signals simultaneously activated by anticancer agents may prove particularly valuable in cancer therapy. Proteins involved in cell death regulation could be used as new targets for anticancer drugs, and simultaneous signals may be manipulated to increase the efficacy of classical anticancer drugs and radiation.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Electronic syndromic surveillance may have value in detecting emerging pathogens or a biological weapons release. Hospitals that have an agile process to evaluate chief complaints of patients seeking emergency care may be able to more quickly identify subtle changes in the community's health. An easily adaptable prototype system was developed to monitor emergency department patient visits during the Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville, Kentucky, from April 16-May 14, 2002. Use of the system was continued during the same festival periods in 2003 and 2004. Method: Twelve area hospitals in Louisville, Kentucky, participated in a prospective analysis of the chief symptoms of patients who sought care in the emergency department during the Kentucky Derby Festival during 2002. Six hospitals were classified as computer record groups (CRG) and used their existing computerized record capabilities. The other 6 hospitals used a personal digital assistant (PDA) with customized software (PDA group). Data were evaluated by the health department epidemiologist using SaTScan, a modified version of a cancer cluster detection program, to look for clusters of cases above baseline over time and by Zip code. Results: All 12 hospitals were able to collect and provide data elements during the study period. The 6 CRG hospitals were able to perform daily data transmission; however, 3 CRG hospitals were unable to interpret their data because it was transmitted in pure text format. In contrast, data from all 6 PDA group hospitals were interpretable. Real-time data analysis was compared with postevent data, and it was found that the real-time evaluation correctly identified no unusual disease activity during the study period. Conclusions: The 12 hospitals participating in this study demonstrated that community-wide surveillance using computerized data was possible and that the 6 study hospitals using a PDA could quickly interpret emergency department patients' chief complaints. The emergency department chief complaints group could serve as a disease sentinel for the community. Copyright ?? 2005 by the Emergency Nurses Association.",

Nurses conduct disease surveillance, which is an important first step in recognizing diseases caused by bioterrorist agents. Unfortunately, the current public health infrastructure and expectations for public health nurses are not clearly defined and therefore pose serious difficulties for conducting disease surveillance. Increased surveillance activities for bioterrorism preparedness add more responsibilities to the work of public health nurses. Methods A qualitative study on disease surveillance was conducted with public health officials at regional and local levels, working in a variety of urban and rural settings in one large public health region in Texas. Data analysis was supported by qualitative research software, The Ethnograph. Results The study found that the nurses working at the local level were extremely dedicated to serving their communities, had formed informal partnerships that are essential for disease surveillance, and effectively used informal communication channels to obtain critical surveillance information. The study revealed that nurses had unmet needs and experienced multiple barriers to conducting disease surveillance. Conclusions The study's findings could have implications for public policy and nursing leadership. Defining the structure of the public health system and the scope of public health nurses' responsibilities will serve as the cornerstone for improvement of bioterrorism preparedness. ",

Methods: Twenty-nine patients with rheumatism, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease were enrolled in the study. Semi-structured interviews were performed by the authors in 2004. Results: Priorities for patients with all three diseases were securing medications and ensuring that they were able to take their medications. Rheumatism patients required methods of preventing their bodies from becoming cold, fatigued, and stressed in order to prevent aggravation of their disease; they also wanted relief workers to understand the physical limitations they experience. The health needs of diabetic patients included receiving an appropriate diet and developing ways to cope with the stress caused by the change in living environment. Patients with chronic respiratory diseases reported that their health needs included developing methods to prevent their bodies from becoming cold, fatigued, and stressed in order to prevent aggravation of their disease, access to respiratory masks to minimize dust and cold air exposure, and guidance in methods to alleviate respiratory symptoms. Conclusions: The emergency preparedness planning and care priorities for individuals with chronic health problems, such as rheumatism, diabetes, and pulmonary disease, should include attention to medication availability, stress management, support for activities of daily living, appropriate food, and availability of support devices necessary to minimize exacerbation of symptoms. ?? 2007 Emergency Nurses Association.",

The Long Island University School of Nursing in Brooklyn, New York, has developed a specific educational experience for undergraduate nursing students enrolled in community health. The course is offered in the senior semester and includes didactic material based on the International Nursing Coalition for Mass Casualty Education-recommended competencies. Students are given the opportunity to apply the learning and develop additional skills by participating in a mock drill. Although anecdotal comments from the students indicate that the coursework has been helpful, additional research is planned to evaluate the program. ?? 2006 Emergency Nurses Association.",

        "abstract": "Hurricanes Katrina and Rita forced many individuals along the coast of Texas and Louisiana to seek shelter inland. Among the evacuees were residents with special needs and residents of nursing homes and group homes caring for mentally retarded and physically disabled persons. Many nurses volunteered to provide health care for those in need. This article discusses challenges and opportunities that were encountered by nurses volunteering in special-needs shelters. Issues related to human and physical resources, patient care, and confidentiality are discussed including lessons learned. As nurses who cared for evacuees in the shelter, it is hoped some of the lessons learned can be utilized in future disasters. ?? 2006 Emergency Nurses Association.",

The most controversial of these is a proposal to close hospital doors in the wake of a mass casualty terror event. However, several specific challenges posed by mass casualty events make closing hospitals doors undesirable. These include the need for efficient movement of resources, maintenance of social order, and providing the moral reassurance needed by the general public in times of crisis. Importantly, these challenges are related to features of terrorist events that distinguish such events from circumstances of \"normal\" surge that might result in, for example, closure of emergency rooms. ?? 2006 Emergency Nurses Association.",

Working with the City of Houston Health Department, researchers conducted a medical and psychological needs assessment of 124 Hurricane Katrina evacuees in Houston shelters from September 4-12, 2005. Among those willing to talk about their experiences, 41% were afraid they would die, 16% saw someone close to them injured or die, 17% saw violence, and 6% directly experienced physical violence. When using a version of the Impact of Stress Experiences scale, the majority of evacuees scored as experiencing moderate (38.6%) to severe (23.9%) post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. These data suggest that in addition to challenges in finding loved ones, housing, and jobs, many Katrina survivors have experienced significant psychological trauma that may lead to future PTSD. \u00a9 2006 Emergency Nurses Association.",

Recruitment, development, and retention of volunteers who offer their knowledge and skills in the event of a disaster are essential to ensuring a functional workforce during catastrophes. These opportunities also address the inherent need for individuals to feel necessary and useful in times of crisis. Universities are a particularly important setting for voluntary action, given that they are based in communities and have access to resources and capabilities to bring to bear on an emergency situation. Methods: The purpose of the study was to discern how one large private organization might participate and respond in the case of a large scale disaster. Using a 2-phase random sample survey, 337 unique respondents (5.7%) out of a sample of 6000 replied to the survey. Results: These data indicate that volunteers in a private organization are willing to assist in disasters and have skills that can be useful in disaster mitigation. Discussion: Much is to be learned related to the deployment of volunteers during disaster. These findings suggest that volunteers can and will help and that disaster preparedness drills are a logical next step for university-based volunteers. \u00a9 2007 Emergency Nurses Association.",

Critical care services are often the first to be overwhelmed. Personal experiences and regional disaster plans were examined in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to uncover shortfalls in delivery of care and resources. A search was undertaken for a viable model for delivering critical care services in the immediate post-disaster period. Such a model already exists in the US Air Force's (USAF) Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT). These teams have functioned well during recent military conflicts by providing both ground critical care and transport of high-risk, severely injured patients. The need for augmented critical care and transport resources in the face of overwhelming casualties in the civilian environment does not require a de novo construct. The USAF's CCATT model should be easily adaptable to the civilian disaster scenario. ?? 2006 Emergency Nurses Association.",

METHODS: A convenience sample of 100 households of 594 inhabitants of San Sebastian and the surrounding rural farming areas was completed. One study participant for each household was evaluated for mental health and psychosocial changes after the earthquakes. The participant's questionnaire was used to investigate the relationship between physical health, access to health care, housing, food and water, and the occurrence of negative mental health markers six months after the disasters. RESULTS: Findings indicate that the majority (67%) of respondents experienced 6 or more mental health complaints. Risk factors associated with multiple negative mental health symptoms included change in household income and loss of job, a new illness or a new injury in the household, reliance on healthcare services since the earthquake, and managing a chronic illness. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate a need for rapid, acute mental health screening with at-risk groups and the need to educate the entire community regarding what medical and mental health treatments are available to reduce barriers to treatment and increase public awareness.",

        "abstract": "Background: The presence of H5N1 influenza in Southeast Asia has reawakened fears of a worldwide influenza pandemic of the sort that occurred in 1918. It is estimated that up to 1.9 million people in the United States could die if such an outbreak occurs. It is unlikely that a vaccine for a pandemic strain will be available quickly enough to protect first-responders. Similar concerns existed in 2002 when the United States attempted to vaccinate first-responders against smallpox, a potential biologic weapon. Method: We conducted a survey of one group of first-responders, paramedics, to determine if fear of infection would compromise their ability to care for persons potentially infected with smallpox. Results: Three hundred paramedics were given the survey, and 95 (32%) responded. More than 80% of paramedics polled would not remain on duty if there were no vaccine and no protective gear. Even if protective gear was available but the vaccine was unavailable, only 39% of respondents would remain on duty. Finally, although 91% of paramedics would remain on duty if they were fully protected, this number falls to 38% if the respondent believed that his or her immediate family was not protected. The results of this survey are relevant to current concerns about an influenza pandemic. Every effort must be made to protect first-responders from pandemic influenza and educate them about it. ?? 2007 Emergency Nurses Association.",

Part I reviews the background, methods, and results of post-earthquake conditions with regards to healthcare, access to healthcare, housing, food, water and sanitation. Part II reviews the implications of these results and recommendations for improvements within the community. Part III investigates the psychosocial and mental health consequences of the earthquakes and provides suggestions for improved mental health awareness, assessment, and intervention. BACKGROUND: El Salvador experienced 2 major earthquakes in January and February 2001. This study evaluates the effects of the earthquakes on the health practices in the rural town of San Sebastian. METHODS: The research was conducted with use of a convenience sample survey of subjects affected by the earthquakes. The sample included 594 people within 100 households. The 32-question survey assessed post-earthquake conditions in the areas of health care and access to care, housing, food and water, and sanitation. RESULTS: Communicable diseases affected a number of family members. After the earthquakes, 38% of households reported new injuries, and 79% reported acute exacerbations of chronic illness. Rural inhabitants were 30% more likely to have an uninhabitable home than were urban inhabitants. Concerns included safe housing, water purification, and waste elimination. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate a need for greater public health awareness and community action to adapt living conditions after a disaster and prevent the spread of communicable disease.",

        "abstract": "Background: In recent years, the World Health Organization in general, and Israel in particular, have dealt with mass casualty events (MCEs) resulting from terrorism. Children are the casualties in many of these events-a reality that forces hospitals to prepare to deal with such a scenario. A literature review designed to identify unique recommendations regarding pediatric MCEs highlights both a lack of existing training programs and uncertainty on the part of health care staff when dealing with these events. Objectives: The purpose of the study was to examine the preparedness level of emergency department staff to deal with MCEs involving pediatric casualties. The study included 104 physicians and nurses working in, or responding to, the emergency department at a hospital in Israel. Method: The study included a 41-item questionnaire examining perception, approaches, and staff knowledge regarding dealing with pediatric MCEs versus those involving adults. The reliability of all sections of the questionnaire ranged between Chronbach's \u03b1 coefficient 0.6 \u03b1-0.94. Results: The preparedness levels for MCEs involving children were found to be low. Study participants ranked the likelihood of a pediatric MCE lower than one involving adults, while ranking significantly higher (P = .000) their ability to cope mentally and the knowledge and skills required when treating adults involved in MCEs. While nurses ranked higher than physicians regarding their knowledge and skills in dealing with pediatric MCE casualties, the level of knowledge for MCEs involving children was low in all subjects. Staff agreement for the parent of an MCE victim to be present during treatment was medium-low. Implications: On the basis of these findings, additional research involving a larger number of individuals and hospitals is indicated to determine if these results are consistent throughout the region. \u00a9 2007 Emergency Nurses Association.",

Drug preference was measured by the method of paired-comparison and personality was measured with the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire-50 CC. Contrary to expectations, high compared with low scorers on Sociability and Impulsive-Sensation Seeking preferred depressants. Surprisingly, low compared with high scorers on neuroticism did not differ in preference for alcohol. As in the previous study, drug preference, use, and availability were highly correlated, although ease of availability was slightly more predictive of drug use than drug preference.

        "abstract": "In vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that the induction or inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) is one of the major mechanisms for some clinically important pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions. Thus, an attempt was made to predict pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions using the pharmacokinetic principles that are used for predicting drug-drug interactions. The expected AUC ratio was mainly dependent on unbound herbal inhibitor concentration ([I]) and inhibition constant (Ki), hepatic fraction (fh), number of inhibitory herbal constituents (n) and metabolic pathway fraction in hepatic metabolism (fm). Herb-drug interactions would be with low risk if sigma(i=1)n [[Ii]/Ki(i)] is less than 0.1, medium risk if it is between 0.1 and 1.0, and high risk if it is greater than 1. For high clearance drugs, the change of fh x fm had minor influence on AUC ratio when sigma(i=1)n [[Ii]/Ki(i)] values were fixed. Similarly, fm did not affect the AUC ratio for low clearance drugs. It appeared likely to predict a herb-drug metabolic interaction when [I], Ki, fh, fm and n could be determined. However, many herb- and drug-related factors may cause difficulties with the prediction, and well-designed human studies are always necessary.",

An instruction manual for responding to disasters had been developed and was exercised through drills.\\n\\nACTION: In accordance with the manual, the hospital disaster task force was established. The Ishinomaki Zone Joint Relief Team coordinated medical support from organizations such as physicians associations, dental associations, self-defence forces medical teams, pharmacists associations, the Japanese Red Cross and relief teams from hospitals all over the country. In three days, the joint relief team directly visited all emergency shelters to make an initial assessment and to collect information about the number and state of health of evacuees, provision of food and drinking-water and the availability of electricity, water and sewerage.\\n\\nOUTCOME: Initial assessment revealed that 35 emergency shelters lacked a sufficient food supply and that 100 shelters had unsanitary conditions. The joint relief team provided the Miyagi Prefecture government and the Ishinomaki municipal government with information about emergency shelters that did not have sufficient food supply. As of 30 September, the activities of the joint relief team were completed, and there was no outbreak of communicable diseases in the Ishinomaki Medical Zone.

        "abstract": "We propose a long-term HIV-1 dynamic model by considering drug potency, drug exposure, and drug susceptibility. Using a Bayesian approach, HIV-1 dynamic parameters were estimated by fitting the model to viral load data from a phase 1/2 randomized clinical study of 2 indinavir (IDV)/ritonavir (RTV)-containing highly active antiretroviral (ARV) therapy regimens in HIV-infected subjects who had previously failed protease inhibitor-containing ARV therapies. A large between-subject variation in estimated viral dynamic parameters was observed, even after accounting for variations in drug exposure and drug susceptibility, suggesting that characteristics of HIV-1 dynamics are host dependent. Significant correlations of baseline factors such as HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 cell counts with viral dynamic parameters were found. These correlations coincide with biologic interaction mechanisms between HIV and the host immune system and also provide an explanation for the correlations between the baseline viral load and phase 1 viral decay rate, for which inconsistent results have been reported in the literature. The relations between viral dynamic parameters and virologic response were established, and these results suggest that viral dynamic parameters may play an important role in determining treatment success or failure. In particular, we estimated a drug efficacy threshold for each patient that can be used to assess whether an ARV regimen is potent enough to suppress HIV viruses in the individual patient. Our findings indicate that it is necessary to individualize the ARV regimen to treat HIV-1-infected patients. The proposed mathematic models and statistical techniques may provide a framework to simulate and predict antiviral response for individual patients.",

        "abstract": "The direct reporting of adverse drug reactions by patients is becoming an increasingly important topic for discussion in the world of pharmacovigilance. At this time, few countries accept consumer reports. We present an overview of experiences with consumer reporting in various countries of the world. The potential contribution of patient reports of adverse drug reactions is discussed, both in terms of their qualitative and quantitative contribution. The crucial question is one of whether patient reports will increase the number and quality of the reports submitted and/or lead to a more timely detection of signals of possible adverse reactions, thus contributing to an enhance- ment of the existing methods of drug safety monitoring. To date, the data available are insufficient to establish such added value",

        "title": "Drug-Related Problems in Hospitals",
        "abstract": "Problems associated with pharmacotherapy (in particular, medication errors and adverse drug events) are frequent and are associated with increased costs for treatment. Analysis of original publications published between 1990 and 2005 on the topics of medication errors and/or adverse drug events in hospitalised patients, focusing on the frequency of, risk factors for and avoidance of such problems associated with pharmacotherapy, indicated that medication errors occurred in a mean of 5.7% of all episodes of drug administration, but with a high variability among the 35 studies retrieved. This variability was explained by the methods by which medication errors were detected (systematic screening of patients versus chart review or spontaneous reporting) and by the way drugs were administered (intravenously administered drugs are associated with the highest error frequencies). Errors occurred throughout the whole medication process, with administration errors accounting for more than half of all errors. Important risk factors included insufficient pharmacological knowledge of health professionals, errors in the patient charts or documentation by nurses and inadequate pharmacy services. Adverse events or reactions, on the other hand, affected 6.1 patients per 100 hospitalised and also showed a high variability among the 46 studies retrieved. This variability could also be explained by the different methods of assessment of the frequency of adverse drug events or reactions, as well as by the different wards on which the studies were performed. Important risk factors for adverse drug events or reactions included polypharmacy, female sex, drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, renal elimination of drugs, age >65 years and use of anticoagulants or diuretics. Since medication errors are strong risk factors for preventable adverse drug events or reactions, strategies have to be put in place for their reduction. Such strategies include ensuring that all persons involved in the medication process (nurses, pharmacists and physicians) have good pharmacological knowledge, computerisation of the entire medication process, and the engagement of a sufficient number of clinical pharmacists on the wards.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacogenetics fields of research was initially restricted to drug metabolism enzymes. It has recently progressed to drug transporters, receptors, and any kind of targets that can modulate drug response. This rapid extension of pharmacogenetics to all the different medical specialties is in close relation with the recent completion of the draft sequence of the human genome and the discovery that about 0.1% of its sequence is polymorphic. The goal of pharmacogenetics for the next years is clearly to determine the clinical consequences of these 2-3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Things can be schematically divided in two situations. (1) Frequent SNPs (allele frequency > 10%) which have a low impact on drug response (odds ratios < 2), even combined with other SNPs in haplotype combinations. Such situations, which are by far the most frequent, have no clinical relevance for a single patient to predict its response to a particular drug. CYP3A and MDR1 allelic variants are good examples of such frequent situations. (2) Rare SNPs, which dramatically alter the expression or the activity of a target protein, can sometimes have a real clinical relevance (odds ratios > 5), usually to predict drug side effects. Only few examples, such as TPMT and CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms, can illustrate this rare situation. Unfortunately, less than 1% of the population is concerned by these rare SNPs, and genotyping can only explain a small part of the variability of the response to a single drug. Beside the impressive mass of data available for pharmacogenetics, it is surprising to observe its poor development in routine medical practice. This discrepancy relies mainly on educational and methodological problems, which might be solved in the decade. To promote pharmacogenetics in routine medical practice, large prospective randomized trials are needed to demonstrate that pharmacogenetic orientated prescription can sometimes predict drug response without dramatic increase in costs.",

        "abstract": "We study the demand response to non-linear price schedules using data on insurance contracts and prescription drug purchases in Medicare Part D. Consistent with a static response of drug use to price, we document bunching of annual drug spending as individuals enter the famous \"donut hole,\" where insurance becomes discontinuously much less generous on the margin. Consistent with a dynamic response to price, we document a response of drug use to the future out-of-pocket price by using variation in beneficiary birth month which generates variation in contract duration during the first year of eligibility. Motivated by these two facts, we develop and estimate a dynamic model of drug use during the coverage year that allows us to quantify and explore the effects of alternative contract designs on drug expenditures. For example, our estimates suggest that \"filling\" the donut hole, as required under the Affordable Care Act, will increase annual drug spending by $180 per beneficiary, or about 10%. Moreover, almost half of this increase is \"anticipatory,\" coming from beneficiaries whose spending prior to the policy change would leave them short of reaching the donut hole. We also describe the nature of the utilization response and its heterogeneity across individuals and types of drugs.",

        "title": "Antimalarial drug toxicity: a review",
        "abstract": "Malaria, caused mostly by Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. Antimalarial drug toxicity is one side of the risk-benefit equation and is viewed differently depending upon whether the clinical indication for drug administration is malaria treatment or prophylaxis. Drug toxicity must be acceptable to patients and cause less harm than the disease itself. Research that leads to drug registration tends to omit two important groups who are particularly vulnerable to malaria--very young children and pregnant women. Prescribing in pregnancy is a particular problem for clinicians because the risk-benefit ratio is often very unclear. The number of antimalarial drugs in use is very small. Despite its decreasing efficacy against P. falciparum, chloroquine continues to be used widely because of its low cost and good tolerability. It remains the drug of first choice for treating P. vivax malaria. Pruritus is a common adverse effect in African patients. As prophylaxis, chloroquine is usually combined with proguanil. This combination has good overall tolerability but mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal upset are more common than with other prophylactic regimens. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is well tolerated as treatment and when used as intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant African women. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is no longer used as prophylaxis because it may cause toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens Johnson syndrome. Mefloquine remains a valuable drug for prophylaxis and treatment. Tolerability is acceptable to most patients and travellers despite the impression given by the lay press. Dose-related serious neuropsychiatric toxicity can occur; mefloquine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of epilepsy or psychiatric disease. Quinine is the mainstay for treating severe malaria in many countries. Cardiovascular or CNS toxicity is rare, but hypoglycaemia may be problematic and blood glucose levels should be monitored. Halofantrine is unsuitable for widespread use because of its potential for cardiotoxicity. There is renewed interest in two old drugs, primaquine and amodiaquine. Primaquine is being developed as prophylaxis, and amodiaquine, which was withdrawn from prophylactic use because of neutropenia and hepatitis, is a potentially good partner drug for artesunate against falciparum malaria. Atovaquone/proguanil is a new antimalarial combination with good efficacy and tolerability as prophylaxis and treatment. The most important class of drugs that could have a major impact on malaria control is the artemisinin derivatives. They have remarkable efficacy and an excellent safety record. They have no identifiable dose-related adverse effects in humans and only very rarely produce allergic reactions. Combining an artemisinin derivative with another efficacious antimalarial drug is increasingly being viewed as the optimal therapeutic strategy for malaria.",

        "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions can be associated with patient morbidity due to either increased toxicity or a potentially ineffective concentration. Because interactions cannot always be anticipated during drug development and actual patients receiving a drug for therapeutic use often differ from those included in clinical trials, postmarketing surveillance is essential. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) databases offer a unique opportunity in this respect. Prerequisites for TDM databases to provide valid information in a pharmacoepidemiological perspective include the following: precise description of exposure to the potentially interacting drugs; measurement of parent compound and active metabolites through accurate and precise analytical techniques; documentation of relevant patient characteristics that may act as confounding factors (e.g. gender, age, smoking habits); repeated assessments over time if possible; and sound pharmacokinetic framework for data selection, analysis and interpretation. The contribution of TDM to the documentation of drug-drug interactions takes advantage of different possible study designs, discussed on the basis of recently published studies. The single case report plays an important role as an alert signal. It is illustrated for a patient on long-term treatment, who displayed an unexpectedly high clozapine concentration rafter the introduction of ciprofloxacin comedication. The prospective on and off comedication panel study shows advantages in terms of carefully selected inclusion criteria and control of treatment modalities. A study of the thioridazine-fluvoxamine interaction is presented, with patients followed on thioridazine monotherapy, after introduction of fluvoxamine and after its discontinuation. The main advantage of the retrospective large-scale TDM database screen is representativeness of patients actually treated, whereas drawbacks are related to quality of data and suitability for valid interpretation. Such an approach is illustrated by a review of data collected over 10 years of routine TDM that allowed documenting induction of nortriptyline metabolism by carbamazepine and inhibition by several phenothiazines. Finally, population pharmacokinetics is well suited to observational data collected for TDM purpose, provided quality is ascertained. Focus is placed on interindividual variability and relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and patient characteristics, including comedication. The population approach is discussed with respect to a study that documented a 32% increase of haloperidol clearance associated with anticonvulsant comedication, in addition to effects of age and bodyweight. Among factors to consider for improved effectiveness in the use of TDM databases for postmarketing surveillance of drug-drug interactions, integration of efficacy and safety data in future studies and communication of expert recommendations to prescribing physicians are essential.",

The current study determines whether the formerly unsanctioned supervised smoking facility (SSF)-operated by the grassroot  organization, Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU) for the last few years-costs less than the costs incurred for health-care services\u00a0 as a direct consequence of not having such a program in Vancouver, Canada. The data pertaining to the attendance at the SSF was gathered in 2012-2013 by VANDU. By relying on this data, a mathematical model was employed to estimate the number of HCV infections prevented by the  former facility in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES). The DTES SSF's benefit-cost ratio was conservatively estimated at 12.1:1 due to its low operating cost. The study used 70% and 90% initial pipe-sharing rates for sensitivity analysis. At 80% sharing rate, the marginal HCV cases prevented were determined to be 55 cases. Moreover, at 80% sharing rate, the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio ranges from $1,705 to $97,203. The results from both the baseline and sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the establishment of the SSF by VANDU on average had annually saved CAD$1.8 million dollars in taxpayer's money. Funding SSFs in Vancouver is an efficient and effective use of financial resources in the public health domain; therefore, Vancouver Coastal Health should actively participate in their establishment in order to reduce HCV and other blood-borne infections such as HIV within the non-injecting drug users.",

We therefore compared the virologic response among participants in a population-based HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program in British Columbia, Canada, by injection drug use activity. Participants who were HIV infected and naive to antiretroviral therapy and who were prescribed antiretroviral treatment between August 1996 and December 2000 were eligible for this study. They were classified as current, former, or non-injection drug users. The main outcome was having two consecutive HIV-1 RNA levels less than 500 copies/mL. We used logistic regression to adjust for baseline HIV-1 RNA, type of antiretroviral regimen (2 nucleosides + nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor versus 2 nucleosides + protease inhibitor), duration of therapy (months), adherence (derived from refill compliance data), and age. A total of 578 participants were first prescribed HAART during the study period. Among them, 78 (13%) were current injection drug users, 96 (17%) were former injection drug users, and 404 (70%) never injected drugs. In the multivariable logistic regression, relative to non-drug users, current injection drug users were significantly less likely to suppress their HIV-1 RNA (adjusted OR [AOR] = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.13-0.67), and former injection drug users were not significantly different from non-drug users (AOR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.24-1.34). There was a significant interaction between drug use and adherence. In the analyses stratified by drug use, the adherence of former and non-drug users was positively associated with HIV-1 RNA suppression (AOR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.14-1.55), whereas for current drug users, it was not (AOR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.87-1.33). Current injection drug users were less likely to achieve HIV-1 RNA suppression compared with non-drug users. Adherence as measured by pharmacy refill compliance was not a reliable measure in this subpopulation.",

A 2.5-mm pressure monitoring catheter was placed through the cervix to the uterine fundus to record uterine tone and activity during the 5-hour observation period. Serum levels of misoprostol acid were measured at 15 and 30 minutes, then every 30 minutes.\\n\\nRESULTS: The four groups were similar in age, race or ethnicity, body mass index, parity, and gestation. Serum levels after vaginal, vaginal moistened and buccal administration rose gradually, peaked between 15 and 120 minutes and fell slowly. Vaginal and vaginal moistened routes produced higher peak serum levels than buccal and rectal (445.9 and 427.1 compared with 264.8 and 202.2 pg/mL; P = .03) and higher serum concentration area under the curve at 5 hours (1,025.0 and 1279.4 compared with 519.6 and 312.5 pg-hr/mL; P < .001). Uterine tone and activity, however, were similar for buccal and the two vaginal routes. After rectal administration, serum levels peaked earlier (P < .001) then dropped more abruptly, and peak uterine tone (P < .001) and total activity (P = .04) were lower than after the other routes.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Although serum levels were lower for buccal compared with the vaginal routes, the three routes produced similar uterine tone and activity. Rectal administration produced lower uterine tone and activity. Vaginal serum levels were two to three and a half times higher than those observed in prior misoprostol pharmacokinetic studies.",

        "abstract": "Conditioned associations between drug experience and its context are maintained long after drug use ceases, and may contribute to relapse after extended abstinence. These include operantly conditioned associations directed toward seeking drug, but also Pavlovian conditioned associations between drug reward and contextual cues present at the time of drug administration. The present study sought to determine whether expression of a Pavlovian conditioned locomotor (CL) response to a cocaine-associated context increases over time in the same manner observed for instrumental responses, and whether the CL memory is differentially susceptible to extinction and recovery after brief versus extended abstinence. Male rats received injections of cocaine (30. mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle once per day for 6 days. In Exp. 1, CL activity was measured 1, 7, 21, or 42 days later. Rats that had received cocaine injections displayed robust CL, regardless of when testing occurred. In Exp. 2, extinction and recovery of CL were assessed after 1 or 42 days. The CL response was more readily extinguished in rats tested 1 day after drug exposure, as compared to rats tested 42 days later. Exp. 3 confirmed that conditioning in the testing context was necessary for expression of CL. Overall, our results indicate that Pavlovian associations underlying the CL response are maintained long after drug experience. Although the expression of CL does not change with the passage of time, as has been observed for instrumental drug-related responses, the memory trace does appear to become more resilient over time. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

The microchamber array chip was equipped with a pressure-driven interface, in which medium and drug solution were added with a micropipet and delivered into the microfluidic network by pneumatic pressure. We demonstrated that the microchamber array chip could be used to estimate the 50% growth inhibitory concentration using the model anticancer drug paclitaxel and the model cancer cell line HeLa. The results obtained by using the microchamber array chip were consistent with those obtained by a conventional assay using microplates. The microchamber array chip, with its simple interface and well-designed microfluidic network, has potential as an efficient platform for high-throughput dose response assays in drug discovery applications.",

        "abstract": "Background. Vitamin D level seems to be an independent predictor of outcome in chronic hepatitis C patients. Vitamin B12 is a natural inhibitor of hepatitis C virus replication. There are some studies which reported that supplementation with vitamin D or vitamin B12 may improve sustained virologic response (SVR) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) but the data are still conflincting. Aim: to assess the SVR in naive patients with CHC treated with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin after supplementation with vitamin D and/or vitamin B12 . Methods. We randomized 92 naive patients with CHC in four groups: group A (20 patients) received standard of care (SOC): pegylated interferon alpha + ribavirin; group B (24 patients): SOC + vitamin D (1000 UI vitamin D3 - colecalciferol/day); group C (25 patients): SOC + vitamin B12 (5000 mug/month intramuscular); group D (23 patients): SOC + vitamin D + vitamin B12. In Romania almost all CHC patients (99%) are genotype 1b. We analyzed SVR (undetectable serum HCV-RNA 24 weeks after completing treatment) in these four groups, counting also baseline viral load and fibrosis (detected by transient elastography -Fibroscan). Results. The SVR was improved by vitamin (especially vitamin B12) supplementation but without statistical significance: 45% in group A, 50% in group B (p=0.770), 56% in group C (p = 0,554) and 65.2% in group D (p=0.13). There are no SVR differences in the four groups depending the fibrosis. The percentage of non-responders, relapsers and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was similar in the four groups. The best response was in patients in group 4 with high baseline viral load (>800 000 UI/ml): 73.3% (p=0.04). Conclusions: supplementation with vitamin B12 and with association between vitamin B12 and vitamin D may increase SVR in naive, genotype 1, CHC patients treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, especially in those with high baseline viral load. Further studies are necessary to confirm this findings and to analyze the role of vitamin supplementation in triple therapy or direct antiviral agents therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: With over 100,000 different types of drug-drug interactions health care professionals rely heavily on automated drug-interaction alerts. Substantial variance in drug-interaction alerts yields opportunities for the use of clinical decision support (CDS) as a potential benefit to pharmacists. Objective: The purpose of this research was to determine whether decision support during dispensing impacts pharmacist response to drug-interaction alerts. Methods: A brief survey was administered to pharmacists in the community consisting of three patient cases, each containing three drug-drug interactions of varying severity. For each interaction, pharmacists were asked how they would respond, one group of pharmacists was randomly assigned to receive CDS while the other group did not. Results: There were no significant differences in pharmacist response to alerts between the two groups. The control group did appear to be more likely to consult a drug reference, but this difference was not significant. While this study did not demonstrate a significant difference, drug-interaction alerts are still an area where improvements could be made. Advancements have the potential to reduce risk to patients and limit unnecessary hospital admissions. Conclusion: This study suggests that this level of clinical decision support has limited impact, but may prove beneficial by reducing the need to consult additional references.",

        "abstract": "This column addresses two important clinical trial issues in psychiatry. Placebo is frequently misrepresented by the media as representing nothing. In fact, placebo represents everything except the investigational treatment. That is an important distinction. The second is the concept of the drug-specific response/remission rate. While manufacturers frequently cite the overall response/remission rate observed in the group treated with their drug in their clinical trials, that is not the true rate specifically attributable to the drug. Instead, it represents the combined rate due to both the drug and the non-drug (or \"placebo\") therapeutic aspects of the trial. To determine the drug-specific response/remission rate, the placebo response/remission rate must be subtracted from the overall response/remission rate observed in the drug treated group. That is because the drug treated group receives both the therapeutic benefit of the drug and all of the nondrug therapeutic benefit of the trial (i.e., the \"placebo\" condition). Viewed from this perspective, only about one out of four patients with major depression responds specifically to either selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. These principles are important if one is to put the recent controversy about the effectiveness of modern antidepressant treatment into perspective. The critical issue is not how good the drugs are but rather how serious our diseases are. When evaluating the current antidepressants, the principal issue is not how many patients with major depression they treat but instead how well they treat the patients they do treat. The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study has clearly documented that approximately 40% of patients with major depression do not respond to existing antidepressants. That finding is consistent with the concept that there are likely many forms of depressive illness, only a fraction of which are responsive to drugs that work via effects on biogenic amines.",

One of the greatest challenges in cancer chemotherapy is that seemingly identical cancer cells can respond differently to drug treatment. The pioneering work reported by Cohen and colleagues moves one step closer to solving this challenge. They develop a dynamic proteomics approach that utilizes fluorescent markers and a time-lapse microscope to detect the fluctuating locations and levels of approximately 1000 proteins in individual cancer cells at high temporal resolution. After adminstration of the cancer drug camptothecin, certain proteins display similar spatiotemporal distribution patterns in individual cells; for example, the drug target topoisomerase-1 shows a rapid decrease in protein level and in nuclear location. However, two particular proteins demonstrate cell-cell variability in their behavior corresponding to cell fate, which may help to explain drug resistance. This method offers an effective way to investigate drug mechanisms in individual cells.",

Herein, we investigate the spatial and temporal effects of an anti-inflammatory drug on the cellular dynamics of the innate immune response to subcutaneously implanted poly(lactic-co-glycolic) microparticles. Noninvasive fluorescence imaging was used to investigate the influence of dexamethasone drug loading and release kinetics on the local and systemic inhibition of inflammatory cellular activities. Temporal monitoring of host response showed that inhibition of inflammatory proteases in the early phase was correlated with decreased cellular infiltration in the later phase of the foreign body response. We believe that using controlled-release anti-inflammatory platforms to modulate early cellular dynamics will be useful in reducing the foreign body response to implanted biomaterials and medical devices. ?? 2011.",

Central opioidergic pathways may be implicated in the heightened drug cue-reactivity, but the effects of the opioid receptors' blockade on the brain responses to drug cues in opioid dependence are unknown. To pursue this question, we studied 17 abstinent i.v. heroin users with brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during exposure to visual heroin-related cues and matched neutral images before and 10-14 days after an injection of extended-release naltrexone (XRNTX). Whole brain analysis of variance of fMRI data showed main effect of XRNTX in the medial frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, cuneus, precuneus, caudate and the amygdala. fMRI response was decreased in the amygdala, cuneus, caudate and the precentral gyrus and increased in the medial frontal gyrus and the precuneus. Higher plasma levels of naltrexone's major metabolite, 6-beta-naltrexol, were associated with larger reduction in the fMRI response to drug cues after XRNTX in the precentral, caudate and amygdala clusters. The present data suggest that XRNTX pharmacotherapy of opioid-dependent patients may, respectively, decrease and potentiate prefrontal and limbic cortical responses to drug cues and that this effect might be related to the XRNTX metabolism. Our findings call for further evaluation of the brain fMRI response to drug-related cues and of the 6-beta-naltrexol levels as potential biomarkers of XRNTX therapeutic effects in patients with opioid dependence.",

Given the growth of large-scale biological data obtained by multi-level assays, computational modeling has become an important approach to understand the mechanism of drug action. However, due to complicated interactions between drugs and cellular targets, the prediction of drug efficacy is a challenge, especially for complex systems. And the biological systems can be regarded as networks, where nodes represent molecular entities (DNA, RNA, protein and small compound) and processes, edges represent the relationships between nodes. Thus we combine biological pathway-based network modeling and molecular docking to evaluate drug efficacy. Results Network efficiency (NE) and network flux (NF) are both global measures of the network connectivity. In this work, we used NE and NF to quantitatively evaluate the inhibitory effects of compounds against the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of prostaglandin E2. The edge values of the pathway network of this biological process were reset according to the Michaelis-Menten equation, which used the binding constant and drug concentration to determine the degree of inhibition of the target protein in the pathway. The combination of NE and NF was adopted to evaluate the inhibitory effects. The dose-response curve was sigmoid and the EC50 values of 5 compounds were in good agreement with experimental results (R2=0.93). Moreover, we found that 2 drugs produced maximal synergism when they were combined according to the ratio between each EC50. Conclusions This quantitative model has the ability to predict the dose-response relationships of single drug and drug combination in the context of the pathway network of biological process. These findings are valuable for the evaluation of drug efficacy and thus provide an effective approach for pathway network-based drug discovery.",

This review examines the structure, localisation and functional role of P-gp, the mechanism of drug efflux and drug-herb interactions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Today, \u223c74% of drugs are taken orally and are not found to be as effective as desired. To improve such characteristics, transdermal drug delivery was brought to existence. This delivery system is capable of transporting the drug or macromolecules painlessly through skin into the blood circulation at fixed rate. Topical administration of therapeutic agents offers many advantages over conventional oral and invasive techniques of drug delivery. Several important advantages of transdermal drug delivery are prevention from hepatic first pass metabolism, enhancement of therapeutic efficiency and maintenance of steady plasma level of the drug. Human skin surface, as a site of drug application for both local and systemic effects, is the most eligible candidate available. New controlled transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) technologies (electrically-based, structure-based and velocity-based) have been developed and commercialized for the transdermal delivery of troublesome drugs. This review article covers most of the new active transport technologies involved in enhancing the transdermal permeation via effective drug delivery system.",

        "title": "Polymorphic Drug Metabolism in Anaesthesia",
        "abstract": "A substantial part of the interindividual variability in response to drugs and xenobiotics is related to genetically-determined impairment in drug metabolism. Several drug-metabolising enzymes are polymorphic in humans and often polymorphisms are strongly related to altered drug biodisposition and to the risk of developing adverse effects. Drugs used in general anaesthesia undergo polymorphic metabolism. Among these, halothane is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP3A4 and CYP2A6. CYP2E1 also plays a key role in the metabolism of isoflurane, sevoflurane, enflu-rane and desflurane. CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 play a relevant role in the metabolism of ketamine. The enzymes involved in the metabolism of thiopental and etomidate remains to be elucidated. Propofol is metabolized mainly by glucuronidation by uridine diphos-phate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and by hydroxylation by CYP2B6 and CYP2C enzymes. The enzymes SULT1A1 and NQO1 participate in later steps in propofol metabolism. All the above-mentioned anaesthetic-metabolising enzymes are polymorphic in man. The present review analyzes the importance of en-zymes in the metabolism of anaesthetics and common polymorphisms related to the biotransformation of general anaesthetics and it raises hypotheses on genetic and non-genetics factors related to altered response to anaesthetics that require further investigation. Based on functional relevance and allele frequencies, we identify the most promising targets for the clinical use of pharmacogenomic techniques in anaesthesia to prevent altered pharmacokinetics or adverse drug effects.",

        "abstract": "Belgium is a small country bordering the southern North Sea near one of the busiest shipping routes in the world. Marine management in general and government involvement in environmental emergencies at sea in particular have evolved tremendously over the past 25 years. Changes were at first stimulated by the difficulties and often confusion encountered in dealing with shipping accidents, such as the loss of the Mont-Louis in 1984 and the tragedy of the ferry Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987. From a defensive and rather passive attitude in the 1980s, government services moved through a decade of building up awareness to a more alert and co-operative level of preparedness. Government scientists having an interest in marine management were very influential during this transition, which lead to a comprehensive packet of legislation. Since the turn of the millennium, the Administration's attitude has become overtly offensive, supported by European law which lays a strict liability on the polluter. An elementary Coast Guard structure has been established, equipment has been purchased, and operational plans have been adopted. How these measures will succeed in mitigating the impact of marine pollution remains to be demonstrated.",
