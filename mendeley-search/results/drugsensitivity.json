        "abstract": "Recent screening of drug sensitivity in large panels of cancer cell lines provides a valuable resource towards developing algorithms that predict drug response. Since more samples provide increased statistical power, most approaches to prediction of drug sensitivity pool multiple cancer types together without distinction. However, pan-cancer results can be misleading due to the confounding effects of tissues or cancer subtypes. On the other hand, independent analysis for each cancer-type is hampered by small sample size. To balance this trade-off, we present CHER (Contextual Heterogeneity Enabled Regression), an algorithm that builds predictive models for drug sensitivity by selecting predictive genomic features and deciding which ones should-and should not-be shared across different cancers, tissues and drugs. CHER provides significantly more accurate models of drug sensitivity than comparable elastic-net-based models. Moreover, CHER provides better insight into the underlying biological processes by finding a sparse set of shared and type-specific genomic features.",

A major drawback of these methods is that if culturing is not performed properly, ambiguous results are produced. Therefore, we developed an oxygen electrode apparatus that uses cellular metabolism as an indicator of anticancer drug sensitivity and investigated its usefulness in 29 breast cancer patients with the following histopathological classifications: papillotubular carcinoma (n= 15); solid tubular carcinoma (n= 6); and scirrhous carcinoma (n= 8). Comparison of anticancer drug sensitivity testing results obtained using the conventional HDRA method and those obtained using the oxygen electrode apparatus showed significant reproducibility between the two methods. In addition, similar anticancer drug sensitivity testing results using the oxygen electrode apparatus were obtained for in vivo testing of nude mice transplanted with established cancer cell lines. These findings suggest that the oxygen electrode apparatus is a useful procedure in anticancer drug sensitivity testing that provides better reproducibility and that is faster, more convenient, and less expensive than other testing methods.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The ability to predict drug sensitivity in cancer is one of the exciting promises of pharmacogenomic research. Several groups have demonstrated the ability to predict drug sensitivity by integrating chemo-sensitivity data and associated gene expression measurements from large anti-cancer drug screens such as NCI-60. The general approach is based on comparing gene expression measurements from sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines and deriving drug sensitivity profiles consisting of lists of genes whose expression is predictive of response to a drug. Importantly, it has been shown that such profiles are generic and can be applied to cancer cell lines that are not part of the anti-cancer screen. However, one limitation is that the profiles can not be generated for untested drugs (i.e., drugs that are not part of an anti-cancer drug screen). In this work, we propose using an existing drug sensitivity profile for drug A as a substitute for an untested drug B given high structural similarities between drugs A and B.\\n\\nRESULTS: We first show that structural similarity between pairs of compounds in the NCI-60 dataset highly correlates with the similarity between their activities across the cancer cell lines. This result shows that structurally similar drugs can be expected to have a similar effect on cancer cell lines. We next set out to test our hypothesis that we can use existing drug sensitivity profiles as substitute profiles for untested drugs. In a cross-validation experiment, we found that the use of substitute profiles is possible without a significant loss of prediction accuracy if the substitute profile was generated from a compound with high structural similarity to the untested compound.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Anti-cancer drug screens are a valuable resource for generating omics-based drug sensitivity profiles. We show that it is possible to extend the usefulness of existing screens to untested drugs by deriving substitute sensitivity profiles from structurally similar drugs part of the screen.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The majority of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) screens aiming to minimize the risk of drug-induced long QT syndrome have been conducted using heterologous systems expressing the hERG 1a subunit, although both hERG 1a and 1b subunits contribute to the K(+) channels producing the repolarizing current I(Kr) . We tested a range of compounds selected for their diversity to determine whether hERG 1a and 1a/1b channels exhibit different sensitivities that may influence safety margins or contribute to a stratified risk analysis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We used the IonWorks\u2122 plate-based electrophysiology device to compare sensitivity of hERG 1a and 1a/1b channels stably expressed in HEK293 cells to 50 compounds previously shown to target hERG channels. Potency was determined as IC(50) values (\u00b5M) obtained from non-cumulative, eight-point concentration-effect curves of normalized data, fitted to the Hill equation. To minimize possible sources of variability, compound potency was assessed using test plates arranged in alternating columns of cells expressing hERG 1a and 1a/1b. KEY RESULTS Although the potency of most compounds was similar for the two targets, some surprising differences were observed. Fluoxetine (Prozac) was more potent at blocking hERG 1a/1b than 1a channels, yielding a corresponding reduction in the safety margin. In contrast, E-4031 was a more potent blocker of hERG 1a compared with 1a/1b channels, as previously reported, as was dofetilide, another high-affinity blocker. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The current assays may underestimate the risk of some drugs to cause torsades de pointes arrhythmia, and overestimate the risk of others.",

In this paper, we present a new approach for drug sensitivity prediction and combination therapy design based on integrated functional and genomic characterizations. The modeling approach when applied to data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia shows a significant gain in prediction accuracy as compared to elastic net and random forest techniques based on genomic characterizations. Utilizing a Mouse Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma cell culture and a drug screen of 60 targeted drugs, we show that predictive modeling based on functional data alone can also produce high accuracy predictions.

We present MATCH (Merging genomic and pharmacologic Analyses for Therapy CHoice), an approach using public genomic resources and drug testing of fresh tumor samples to link drugs to patients. Valproic acid (VPA) is highlighted as a proof-of-principle. In order to predict specific tumor types with high probability of drug sensitivity, we create drug response signatures using publically available gene expression data and assess sensitivity in a data set of >40 cancer types. Next, we evaluate drug sensitivity in matched tumor and normal tissue and exclude cancer types that are no more sensitive than normal tissue. From these analyses, breast tumors are predicted to be sensitive to VPA. A meta-analysis across breast cancer data sets shows that aggressive subtypes are most likely to be sensitive to VPA, but all subtypes have sensitive tumors. MATCH predictions correlate significantly with growth inhibition in cancer cell lines and three-dimensional cultures of fresh tumor samples. MATCH accurately predicts reduction in tumor growth rate following VPA treatment in patient tumor xenografts.

Biochemical studies showed that cAMP increased FBS-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in HepG(2) cells, but completely inhibited FBS-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in Bel-7402 cells, suggesting that the differential response of Akt to cAMP in these two cell lines might contribute to their differential sensitivity. LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor that inhibits FBS-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, restored the sensitivity of HepG(2) cells to cAMP and API-2 (Akt/protein kinase B signaling inhibitor-2) also showed similar effect. These results collectively indicate that the response level of Akt to cAMP may play a critical role in determining drug sensitivity.",

In particular, the inability of undergo apoptosis in response to chemotherapy and other external stimuli poses a selective advantage for tumor progression, metastasis formation as well as resistance to therapy in melanoma. Herein, we will review the molecular mechanisms of sensitivity and/or resistance of the most important drugs used in the treatment of melanoma. Furthermore, the novel strategies to overcome tumor chemoresistance will also be discussed. In particular, we will review the cancer stem cell hypothesis and how the failure of MDR reversal agents might increase the therapeutic index of substrate antineoplastic agents.",

In our model, Contributions from different genetic alterations are considered as free parameters, which are optimized by the drug response data from the Cancer Genome Project (CGP). 10-fold cross validation on CGP data set showed that our model achieved comparable prediction results with existing elastic net model using much less input features.",

To exert their pharmacological action first they need to enter into the cell across plasma membrane transporters and be metabolized. Thus, efficacy of treatment and acquisition of resistance can rely on a variety of events. In this article, we will focus in the role of nucleoside transporters in the sensitivity to nucleoside-derived drugs used in chemotherapy. Evidence of different transporter protein expression patterns in tumors compared to normal tissues, besides inter-individual variability in the levels of nucleoside transporters in tumors, suggest a major role of nucleoside transporters in the cytotoxicity of nucleoside analogs. In fact, different studies have linked nucleoside transporter function to drug sensitivity and clinical outcome in cancer patients. However, prospective clinical studies analysing nucleoside transporters and metabolic enzymes, as biomarkers of drug metabolism and action are required to better establish the role these proteins might play in cancer chemotherapy.",

The present article proposed a novel model of module network rewiring to characterize functional reorganization of a complex biological system, and described a new framework named as module network rewiring-analysis (MNR) for systematically studying dynamical drug sensitivity and resistance during drug treatment. MNR was used to investigate functional reorganization or rewiring on the module network, rather than molecular network or individual molecules. Our experiments on expression data of patients with Hepatitis C virus infection receiving Interferon therapy demonstrated that consistent module genes derived by MNR could be directly used to reveal new genotypes relevant to drug sensitivity, unlike the other differential analyses of gene expressions. Our results showed that functional connections and reconnections among consistent modules bridged by biological paths were necessary for achieving effective responses of a drug. The hierarchical structures of the temporal module network can be considered as spatio-temporal biomarkers to monitor the efficacy, efficiency, toxicity, and resistance of the therapy. Our study indicates that MNR is a useful tool to identify module biomarkers and further predict dynamical drug sensitivity and resistance, characterize complex dynamic processes for therapy response, and provide biologically systematic clues for pharmacogenomic applications.",

        "abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor protein is frequently mutated in human tumors. It is thought that the p53 pathway is indirectly impaired in the remaining tumors, for example by overexpression of its important regulators Mdm2 and Mdm4, making them attractive targets for the development of anti-cancer agents. Recent studies have suggested that Mdm4 levels determine the sensitivity of tumor cells for anti-cancer therapy. To investigate this possibility, we studied the drug sensitivity of several breast cancer cell lines containing wild-type p53, but expressing different Mdm4 levels. We show that endogenous Mdm4 levels can affect the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to anti-cancer agents, but in a cell line-dependent manner and depending on an intact apoptotic response. Furthermore, treatment with the non-genotoxic agent Nutlin-3 sensitizes cells for doxorubicin, showing that activation of p53 by targeting its regulators is an efficient strategy to decrease cell viability of breast cancer cells. These results confirm a function of Mdm4 in determining the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents to induce apoptosis of cancer cells in a p53-dependent manner, although additional undetermined factors also influence the drug response. Targeting Mdm4 to sensitize tumor cells for chemotherapeutic drugs might be a strategy to effectively treat tumors harboring wild-type p53.",

        "abstract": "The oncologist's challenges, particularly with advanced cancers, are (a) how to predict tumor response to a given drug or regimen; (b) how to predict which tumors of identical histology will remain indolent and which will be likely to progress; and (c) how to determine the appropriate timing of the emergence of drug-resistant cancer cells and hence switch to appropriate therapy. These issues are still unresolved; current clinical practice is hampered by the complexity and heterogeneity of anti-tumor drug resistance where multiple cellular, tumor microenvironment and host factors operate simultaneously. The rapid accumulation of genomic and proteomic databases for complex biological systems, such as cancer, together with advances in technology platforms, have paved the way to an increased molecular understanding and prediction of antitumor drug response. The complex phenotype of drug resistance can now be dissected and specific, clinically relevant markers pinpointed. Several microarray studies of genetic patterns from untreated and pre-treated cancers have provided \"fingerprints\" that can predict response to therapeutics. Nevertheless, such approaches require further validation in experimental models and in large clinical trials before their routine clinical use. Moreover, comparative transcriptional profiling alone is unlikely to predict drug sensitivity/resistance, a dynamic process where protein phosphorylation, protein trafficking, and protein-protein interactions with secondary effectors play key roles in the fate of cancer cells following therapeutic stress. Functional proteomics is potentially more predictive, but still faces technical challenges with regards to sampling, tumor heterogeneity, and lack of standardized methodologies. These obstacles are surmountable with current concerted research efforts and availability of powerful high-throughput genomic and proteomic instrumentations, and thus approaches to predict and overcome drug resistance could be rationalized.",

Gluthatione S-transferases (GST) have been attributed a role in the resistance of cancer cells, e.g., to nitrosoureas. Here, we assessed the expression levels of GST-pi and GST-mu RNA and protein as well as total GST activity in a panel of 12 human glioma cell lines and correlated these data with p53 status, BCL-2 family protein expression and drug sensitivity in these cells. Neither GST protein levels nor GST activity correlated with genetic or functional p53 status or with the expression of various BCL-2 family proteins. No evidence for GST-mediated protection from chemotherapeutic drugs became apparent. In contrast, high levels of GST-pi protein, probably the major source of GST activity in glioma cells, and of total GST activity correlated with enhanced sensitivity to vincristine-induced clonogenic cell death. Expression of GST-pi in human glioblastomas in vivo was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Neither total, nor cytoplasmic or nuclear, GST-pi immunoreactivity correlated with the response to adjuvant radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. A comparative analysis of primary and recurrent tumors showed that GST expression was not enhanced by radiochemotherapy in vivo. We conclude that GST does not account for the differential chemosensitivity of glioma cell lines in vitro and does not accumulate in glioma subpopulations that form recurrent tumors after radiochemotherapy in vivo.",

Reverse-Phase Protein Array (RPPA) technology offers proteomic information of cancer patients which may be directly related to drug sensitivity. For cancer patients with different drug sensitivity, the proteomic profiling reveals important pathophysiologic information which can be used to predict chemotherapy responses.\\n\\nRESULTS: The goal of this paper is to present a framework for personalized medicine using both RPPA and drug sensitivity (drug resistance or intolerance). In the proposed personalized medicine system, the prediction of drug sensitivity is obtained by a proposed augmented naive Bayesian classifier (ANBC) whose edges between attributes are augmented in the network structure of naive Bayesian classifier. For discriminative structure learning of ANBC, local classification rate (LCR) is used to score augmented edges, and greedy search algorithm is used to find the discriminative structure that maximizes classification rate (CR). Once a classifier is trained by RPPA and drug sensitivity using cancer patient samples, the classifier is able to predict the drug sensitivity given RPPA information from a patient.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: In this paper we proposed a framework for personalized medicine where a patient is profiled by RPPA and drug sensitivity is predicted by ANBC and LCR. Experimental results with lung cancer data demonstrate that RPPA can be used to profile patients for drug sensitivity prediction by Bayesian network classifier, and the proposed ANBC for personalized cancer medicine achieves better prediction accuracy than naive Bayes classifier in small sample size data on average and outperforms other the state-of-the-art classifier methods in terms of classification accuracy.",

Data are freely available without restriction. GDSC currently contains drug sensitivity data for almost 75 000 experiments, describing response to 138 anticancer drugs across almost 700 cancer cell lines. To identify molecular markers of drug response, cell line drug sensitivity data are integrated with large genomic datasets obtained from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database, including information on somatic mutations in cancer genes, gene amplification and deletion, tissue type and transcriptional data. Analysis of GDSC data is through a web portal focused on identifying molecular biomarkers of drug sensitivity based on queries of specific anticancer drugs or cancer genes. Graphical representations of the data are used throughout with links to related resources and all datasets are fully downloadable. GDSC provides a unique resource incorporating large drug sensitivity and genomic datasets to facilitate the discovery of new therapeutic biomarkers for cancer therapies.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneity is known to be present to varying degrees in cancer cell groups. There have been no reports, however, of studies in which a single cell clone was prepared from a cancer cell group to examine heterogeneity with respect to anticancer drug sensitivity. Thus, the authors herein report an investigation into the heterogeneity of cancer cells within the same tumor with respect to anticancer drug sensitivity. Anticancer drug sensitivity was investigated in primary tumors, metastatic lymph node tumors, recurrent tumors and established cell lines obtained from four cases of tongue cancer using an oxygen electrode apparatus. As differences were observed in anticancer drug sensitivity from one case to another, even though all four were of the same pathological tissue type, the individual differences were apparently significant. Moreover, primary tumors and recurrent tumors demonstrated different sensitivities to the anticancer drugs even in the same patient. When single cell clones were prepared from primary tumors and anticancer drug sensitivity testing was carried out, sensitivity to anticancer drugs that was not seen in the primary tumors was observed. We performed RT-PCR on cell groups derived from this single cell using MDR1, MRP1, MRP2 and ERCC1, which are primary genes that are resistant to anticancer drugs. Expression of MDR and ERCC1 was not observed in single cell clones nos. 1-10. MRP1 and MRP2, on the other hand, were expressed in all of these single cell clones. Because cells with different sensitivity levels were initially present in the cancer cell groups, even when large numbers of cancer cells died in response to anticancer drug therapy, the results suggest the possibility that recurrence and metastasis occur based on cells with differing sensitivities. After examining anticancer drug sensitivity at the single cell level, we believe that anticancer drug-resistant genes may be involved in the heterogeneity of anticancer drug sensitivity with respect to cancer cell groups.",

METHODS: The drug sensitivity of CDDP and GEM in 4 SCLC cell lines and 6 NSCLC cell lines was determined using MTT colorimetric assay, while the cDNA macroarray was applied to detect the gene expression state related to drug sensitivity of 10 lung cancer cell line in 1 291, and the correlation between the two was analysized. RESULTS: There were 6 genes showing significant positive correlation (r>=0.632, P<0.05) with GEM sensitivity; 45 genes positively related to CDDP; another 41 genes related to both GEM and CDDP (r>=+/- 0.4). Lung cancer with GEM and CDDP sensitivity of two types of drugs significantly related genes were Metallothinein (Signal transduction molecules), Cathepsin B (Organization protease B) and TIMP1 (Growth factor); the GEM, CDDP sensitivity associated genes of lung cancer cell lines mainly distributed in Metallothinein, Cathepsin B, growth factor TIMP1 categories. CONCLUSIONS: There existed drug-related sensitive genes of GEM, CDDP in SCLC and NSCLC cell lines; of these genes, Metallothinein, Cathepsin B and TIMP1 genes presented a significant positive correlation with GEM drug sensitivity, a significant negative correlation with CDDP drug sensitivity.",

Dissecting the molecular basis of different drug responses is difficult due to complex interactions involving multiple genes, pathways, and cellular processes. We previously found a single nucleotide polymorphism within cystathionine beta-synthase (CYS4) that causes multi-drug sensitivity in a vineyard strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, not all variation was accounted for by CYS4. To identify additional genes influencing drug sensitivity, we used CYS4 as a covariate and conducted both single- and combined-cross linkage mapping. After eliminating numerous false-positive associations, we identified 16 drug-sensitivity loci, only 3 of which had been previously identified. Of 4 drug-sensitivity loci selected for validation, 2 showed replicated associations in independent crosses, and two quantitative trait genes within these regions, AQY1 and MKT1, were found to have drug-specific and background-dependent effects. Our results suggest that drug response may often depend on interactions between genes with multi-drug and drug-specific effects.",

        "abstract": "The drug sensitivity of normal cells provides a baseline for detg. the therapeutic index, and therefore the effectiveness, of cytotoxic drugs, yet little is known about the factors that affect normal cell chemosensitivity.  Some parameters are known to have a profound effect on tumor cell sensitivity.  The purpose of this study was to det. how cytotoxic drug sensitivity of hematopoietic cells isolated from cancer patients was affected by various parameters.  These included previous chemotherapy (yes or no), sex, age, tumor type (leukemias or solid tumors), sample source (blood, bone marrow, serous effusions, or tumor biopsies) and predominant cell lineage (lymphoid, myeloid, macrophage, or mixed).  Mononuclear cells isolated from blood, bone marrow, serous effusions, and tumor biopsies were incubated for four days with a median of 16 drugs.  The differential staining cytotoxicity assay, an ex vivo apoptotic drug sensitivity test in which cell survival is detd. morphol., was used to assess normal hematopoietic and tumor cell response to cytotoxic drugs.  One hundred forty-six specimens yielded hematopoietic cell chemosensitivity results with 3-36 drugs.  Compared with tumor cells, there was far less interpatient variation in chemosensitivity of hematopoietic cells.  Mean hematopoietic cell drug sensitivity showed little variation due to previous chemotherapy, sex, age, tumor type, and sample source or cell lineage.  The authors therefore concluded that cytotoxic drug sensitivity of hematopoietic cells from a variety of sources could be used for assessment of therapeutic index.  Drug therapeutic index results are a valuable tool in identifying novel cytotoxic agents and individually tailored chemotherapy regimens. [on SciFinder(R)]",

        "abstract": "Smad3 and Smad4 are signaling mediators in the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) pathway and play a major role in the progression and migration of many types of cancers. The TGF\u03b2 pathway is correlated with resistance against both targeted and conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Smad3/4 on drug sensitivity in chemotherapy-resistant colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. We isolated the TGF\u03b2-mediated chemoresistant CRC cell line DLD1-5FU-C10, which showed high expression of Smad3/4 and p21. In order to analyze the influence of Smad3/4 on drug sensitivity in DLD1-5FU-C10 cells, we knocked down Smad3/4 using small interfering RNAs (siRNA). The results showed similar drug sensitivity between the DLD1\u20115FU-C10 and the DLD1 control cells and reduced p21 expression. In addition, we found a significant increase in the levels of 3 TGF\u03b2 downstream factors: interleukin 6 (IL6), plasminogen activator (PLAU) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2). Furthermore, we showed that Smad3/4 regulated the JAK1/STAT3 pathway via IL6 in the chemoresistant CRC cell line. In conclusion, we identified Smad3/4 as a novel drug sensitivity regulator in TGF\u03b2-mediated chemotherapy-resistant CRC cells. Our results suggest that Smad3/4 regulate p-STAT3 signaling by IL6 and p21 and highlight an important role for STAT3 signaling in Smad3/4 regulated drug sensitivity in chemoresistant CRC cells.",

        "abstract": "The personal genomics era has attracted a large amount of attention for anti-cancer therapy by patient-specific analysis. Patient-specific analysis enables discovery of individual genomic characteristics for each patient, and thus we can effectively predict individual genetic risk of disease and perform personalized anti-cancer therapy. Although the existing methods for patient-specific analysis have successfully uncovered crucial biomarkers, their performance takes a sudden turn for the worst in the presence of outliers, since the methods are based on non-robust manners. In practice, clinical and genomic alterations datasets usually contain outliers from various sources (e.g., experiment error, coding error, etc.) and the outliers may significantly affect the result of patient-specific analysis. We propose a robust methodology for patient-specific analysis in line with the NetwrokProfiler. In the proposed method, outliers in high dimensional gene expression levels and drug response datasets are simultaneously controlled by robust Mahalanobis distance in robust principal component space. Thus, we can effectively perform for predicting anti-cancer drug sensitivity and identifying sensitivity-specific biomarkers for individual patients. We observe through Monte Carlo simulations that the proposed robust method produces outstanding performances for predicting response variable in the presence of outliers. We also apply the proposed methodology to the Sanger dataset in order to uncover cancer biomarkers and predict anti-cancer drug sensitivity, and show the effectiveness of our method.",

The histopathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma, mature cystic teratoma with malignant transformation, stage IV. Paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy was selected as adjuvant chemotherapy based on CD-DST results. Upon completion of 6 courses, no increases in carcinomatous ascites or recurrent lesions were evident, and the chest wall tumor had disappeared completely.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The CD-DST may be particularly useful for selecting preoperative chemotherapeutic drugs for patients with ovarian cancer in which the histological type of the primary tumor is unknown.",

        "abstract": "The cell wall is essential for fungal survival in natural environments. Many fungal wall carbohydrates are absent from humans, so they are a promising source of antifungal drug targets. Galactofuranose (Gal. f) is a sugar that decorates certain carbohydrates and lipids. It comprises about 5% of the Aspergillus fumigatus cell wall, and may play a role in systemic aspergillosis. We are studying Aspergillus wall formation in the tractable model system, A. nidulans. Previously we showed single-gene deletions of three sequential A. nidulans Gal. f biosynthesis proteins each caused similar hyphal morphogenesis defects and 500-fold reduced colony growth and sporulation. Here, we generated ugeA, ugmA and ugtA strains controlled by the alcA(p) or niiA(p) regulatable promoters. For repression and expression, alcA(p)-regulated strains were grown on complete medium with glucose or threonine, whereas niiA(p)-regulated strains were grown on minimal medium with ammonium or nitrate. Expression was assessed by qPCR and colony phenotype. The alcA(p) and niiA(p) strains produced similar effects: colonies resembling wild type for gene expression, and resembling deletion strains for gene repression. Gal. f immunolocalization using the L10 monoclonal antibody showed that ugmA deletion and repression phenotypes correlated with loss of hyphal wall Gal. f. None of the gene manipulations affected itraconazole sensitivity, as expected. Deletion of any of ugmA, ugeA, ugtA, their repression by alcA(p) or niiA(p), OR, ugmA overexpression by alcA(p), increased sensitivity to Caspofungin. Strains with alcA(p)-mediated overexpression of ugeA and ugtA had lower caspofungin sensitivity. Gal. f appears to play an important role in A. nidulans growth and vigor. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Leukemia is the most common childhood cancer. Trisenox, the active ingredient of which is trivalent arsenic, is the first line of treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Since drug action usually requires uptake of the drug, it is of importance to determine the transport system responsible for Trisenox uptake. Recently, human aquaglyceroporin 9 (AQP9) has been shown to transport As(III) in Xenopus oocytes. In this study we report to show that AQP9 expression modulates the drug sensitivity of leukemic cells. AQP9 was transfected into the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. The transfectants became hypersensitive to Trisenox and Sb(III). The promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 treated with vitamin D showed higher expression of AQP9 and hypersensitivity to Trisenox and Sb(III). This sensitivity was due to higher rates of uptake of the trivalent metalloids by the cell lines overexpressing AQP9. Trisenox hypersensitivity results from increased expression of AQP9 drug uptake system. The possibility of using pharmacological agents to increase expression of AQP9 gene delivers the promise of new therapies for the treatment of leukemia. Thus, drug hypersensitivity can be correlated with increased expression of the drug uptake system. This is the first demonstration that AQP9 can modulate drug sensitivity in cancer. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Tumor cells are known to exhibit highly varied sensitivity to camptothecins (CPT; e.g., irinotecan and topotecan). However, the factors that determine CPT sensitivity/resistance are largely unknown. Recent studies have shown that the ubiquitin-like protein, IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), which is highly elevated in many human cancers and tumor cell lines, antagonizes the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. In the present study, we show that ISG15 is a determinant for CPT sensitivity/resistance possibly through its effect on proteasome-mediated repair of topoisomerase I (TOP1)-DNA covalent complexes. First, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of either ISG15 or UbcH8 (major E2 for ISG15) in breast cancer ZR-75-1 cells decreased CPT sensitivity, suggesting that ISG15 overexpression in tumors could be a factor affecting intrinsic CPT sensitivity in tumor cells. Second, the level of ISG15 was found to be significantly reduced in several tumor cells selected for resistance to CPT, suggesting that altered ISG15 regulation could be a significant determinant for acquired CPT resistance. Parallel to reduced CPT sensitivity, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of either ISG15 or UbcH8 in ZR-75-1 cells resulted in increased proteasomal degradation of CPT-induced TOP1-DNA covalent complexes. Taken together, these results suggest that ISG15, which interferes with proteasome-mediated repair of TOP1-DNA covalent complexes, is a potential tumor biomarker for CPT sensitivity.",

Rapid emergence of hospital pathogens and antibiotic-resistant organisms necessitate periodic evaluation of bacterial colonisation patterns and antibiogram sensitivity in burn wards. In this study, which was conducted in a 3 months' period in 2009, 106 samples from the wounds of 59 patients admitted in a burn ward were taken, one in the 1st and one between the 3rd and the 7th days. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter and Klebsiella were the most common Gram-negative and Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive organisms recovered from the patients.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with malignant mesothelioma have a poor prognosis and only 40% respond to first line treatment; a combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin. We used primary malignant mesothelioma cells and an ex vivo chemosensitivity assay with future purpose to predict best choice of treatment. The clinical outcome of these patients might be predicted by measuring drug sensitivity.\\n\\nMETHODS: Pleural effusions containing primary malignant mesothelioma cells were received from the diagnostic routine. We characterized and tested the chemosensitivity of 18 malignant samples and four benign samples from 16 different patients with pleural effusions. Cells were seeded in a 384-well plate for a robotized ex vivo testing of drug sensitivity to 32 different drugs. The primary cells were further characterized by immunocytochemistry to evaluate the proportion of malignant cells and to study the RRM1 and ERCC1 reactivity, two proteins associated with drug resistance.\\n\\nRESULTS: We observed great individual variability in the drug sensitivity. Primary cell isolates were affected by between one and ten drugs, and resistant to the remaining tested drugs. Actinomycin D and daunorubicin were the two drugs effective in most cases. Adjusting efficiency of individual drugs for varying proportion of tumor cells and to the average effect on benign cells correlated with effect of pemetrexed, cisplatin and survival time. General drug sensitivity, proportion of malignant cells and reactivity to RRM1 correlated to each other and to survival time of the patients.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The proportion of malignant cells and RRM1 reactivity in the pleural effusions correlate to drug sensitivity and survival time. The variability in response to the commonly used chemotherapies emphasizes the need for tests that indicate best individual choice of cytotoxic drugs. The efficiency of the obtained results should preferably be corrected for admixture of benign cells and effects of given drugs on benign cells.",

        "abstract": "Changing treatment practices may be selecting for changes in the drug sensitivity of malaria parasites. We characterized ex vivo drug sensitivity and parasite polymorphisms associated with sensitivity in 459 Plasmodium falciparum samples obtained from subjects enrolled in two clinical trials in Tororo, Uganda, from 2010 to 2013. Sensitivities to chloroquine and monodesethylamodiaquine varied widely; sensitivities to quinine, dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine, and piperaquine were generally good. Associations between ex vivo drug sensitivity and parasite polymorphisms included decreased chloroquine and monodesethylamodiaquine sensitivity and increased lumefantrine and piperaquine sensitivity with pfcrt 76T, as well as increased lumefantrine sensitivity with pfmdr1 86Y, Y184, and 1246Y. Over time, ex vivo sensitivity decreased for lumefantrine and piperaquine and increased for chloroquine, the prevalences of pfcrt K76 and pfmdr1 N86 and D1246 increased, and the prevalences of pfdhfr and pfdhps polymorphisms associated with antifolate resistance were unchanged. In recurrent infections, recent prior treatment with artemether-lumefantrine was associated with decreased ex vivo lumefantrine sensitivity and increased prevalence of pfcrt K76 and pfmdr1 N86, 184F, and D1246. In children assigned chemoprevention with monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with documented circulating piperaquine, breakthrough infections had increased the prevalence of pfmdr1 86Y and 1246Y compared to untreated controls. The noted impacts of therapy and chemoprevention on parasite polymorphisms remained significant in multivariate analysis correcting for calendar time. Overall, changes in parasite sensitivity were consistent with altered selective pressures due to changing treatment practices in Uganda. These changes may threaten the antimalarial treatment and preventive efficacies of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, respectively.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An enduring challenge in personalized medicine lies in selecting the right drug for each individual patient. While testing of drugs on patients in large trials is the only way to assess their clinical efficacy and toxicity, we dramatically lack resources to test the hundreds of drugs currently under development. Therefore the use of preclinical model systems has been intensively investigated as this approach enables response to hundreds of drugs to be tested in multiple cell lines in parallel.\\n\\nMETHODS: Two large-scale pharmacogenomic studies recently screened multiple anticancer drugs on over 1000 cell lines. We propose to combine these datasets to build and robustly validate genomic predictors of drug response. We compared five different approaches for building predictors of increasing complexity. We assessed their performance in cross-validation and in two large validation sets, one containing the same cell lines present in the training set and another dataset composed of cell lines that have never been used during the training phase.\\n\\nRESULTS: Sixteen drugs were found in common between the datasets. We were able to validate multivariate predictors for three out of the 16 tested drugs, namely irinotecan, PD-0325901, and PLX4720. Moreover, we observed that response to 17-AAG, an inhibitor of Hsp90, could be efficiently predicted by the expression level of a single gene, NQO1.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that genomic predictors could be robustly validated for specific drugs. If successfully validated in patients' tumor cells, and subsequently in clinical trials, they could act as companion tests for the corresponding drugs and play an important role in personalized medicine.",

Resistance was also detected for amodiaquine (18.18%) and sulfadoxine / pyrimethamine (15%). No resistance was detected for artemisinin, mefloquine and quinine. P. vivax showed 27.73% resistance to chloroquine and 13.64% resistance to primaquine. No resistance was found for other antimalarial drugs. Chloroquine resistance has developed because of indiscrimate use of this drug. Proper diagnosis of malaria and drug sensitivity testing should be done routinely to prevent emergence of resistance to antimalarial drugs. Monotherapy should be avoided and combined drug therapy will reduce chances of emergence of drug resistance.",

We developed a rapid assay for assessing the effect of various drugs on GBM stem cells. The assay uses a small number of separated CD133+ cells (20,000 in 0.2 ml) in 96-well plate that form neurospheres within 1-2 days. Various drugs disperse the neurospheres within 24-36 h, which can be quantified microscopically. We used the GBM cell line A-172 to develop the conditions for the assay, utilizing Gleevec, the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT, and the anti-bacterial peptide amph1D. The results show dispersion of the neurospheres leading to cell death, at relatively low drugs concentrations (<25 ??M). Drug combination showed a synergistic effect and disruption of neurospheres under lower concentrations. We applied this assay to the CD133+ cells of surgical specimens from three patients that showed similar results. This assay facilitates a rapid test of drugs on small amounts of fractionated patient's GBM stem cells. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Risk-based treatment strategies have improved outcome in childhood B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and in vitro drug sensitivity assessment using methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) assay has been shown to be an independent prognostic marker. To date, such strategies in childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) have proved elusive, and in vitro drug sensitivity testing has had limited success in T-ALL due to poor T-cell lymphoblast survival in vitro. We have developed the flow cytometric drug sensitivity assay (FCDSA) to evaluate in vitro drug sensitivity. We studied 68 cases of childhood T-ALL for cytarabine (Ara-C) and daunorubicin sensitivity by FCDSA and compared the results with those obtained by MTT assay. Spontaneous apoptosis was correlated with cytotoxicity rates for both drugs by FCDSA, but not with the results obtained by MTT assay. Daunorubicin sensitivity had a positive correlation with Ara-C in individual cases by FCDSA; but not by MTT assay. Studies repeated on stored samples had comparable results for both drugs by FCDSA (P<0.01), but not for Ara-C by MTT assay. Comparison of T-ALL sensitivity with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases revealed a unique pattern difference. Median cytotoxicity (expressed in arbitrary units) for Ara-C was 8 (0-47) and 27 (0-81), and daunorubicine cytotoxicity for T-ALL and AML samples was 79 (5-100) and 34 (0-98), respectively. Although age or white blood cell count at diagnosis was not associated with any particular drug response pattern, CD13 expression on T-lymphoblasts was associated with in vitro resistance. FCDSA is a reliable, practical and reproducible method that can be integrated into studies of drug-target cell interactions in T-ALL.",

        "abstract": "Introduction. Sinonasal squamous cell carcinomas (SNSCC) are rare malignant epithelial tumors etiologically related to occupational exposure to leather and wood dust as well as several industrial chemicals as nickel, asbestos and formaldehyde. However, tobacco, a strong etiological factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), does not play an important role in SNSCC. The prognosis is poor due to the difficulties for the complete resection of the tumor and so alternative treatment options are needed. EGFR amplification and protein overexpression has been reported to occur up to 40% in SNSCC. Recently we have established five SNSCC cell lines in our laboratory that serve as an in vitro model for testing new anti-cancer therapeutic agents. The aim of this study was to examine the sensitivity to well-known drugs as cisplatin (alkylating agent) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; intercalating agent), and to novel treatments as cetuximab (a monoclonal anti- EGFR antibody) and gefitinib (EGFR tirosin kinase inhibitor), as are applied in HNSCC, using our panel of cell lines. Methods. Cell lines SCCNC1, SCCNC4, SCCNC5, SCCNC6 and SCCNC7 were tested for EGFR copy number, KRAS and BRAF mutations and treated with various concentrations of the drugs mentioned above. MTS assay was performed and the IC50 for each cell line was obtained from dose-response curves. Results. Combination therapy of cisplatin and 5-FU produced growth inhibition in every cell line except SCCNC1. Cetuximab inhibited cell proliferation of all SCCNC cell lines, irrespective of the status of EGFR, KRAS or BRAF. SCCNC6 responded poorly, possibly caused by the low proliferation rate of this cell line. Finally, gefitinib decreased the proliferation rate in all cell lines, irrespective of EGFR, KRAS or BRAF. Conclusions. Drugs response in SCCNC cell lines seems to be independent of cellular growth rate, KRAS and BRAF mutations and EGFR status.",

        "abstract": "Platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens are ultimately unsuccessful due to intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. Understanding the molecular basis for platinum drug sensitivity/resistance is necessary for the development of new drugs and therapeutic regimens. In an effort to identify such determinants, we evaluated the expression of approximately 4000 genes using cDNA microarray screening in a panel of 14 unrelated human ovarian cancer cell lines derived from patients who were either untreated or treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. These data were analysed relative to the sensitivities of the cells to four platinum drugs (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin), carboplatin, DACH-(oxalato)platinum (II) (oxaliplatin) and cis-diamminedichloro (2-methylpyridine) platinum (II) (AMD473)) as well as the proliferation rate of the cells. Correlation analysis of the microarray data with respect to drug sensitivity and resistance revealed a significant association of Stat1 expression with decreased sensitivity to cisplatin (r=0.65) and AMD473 (r=0.76). These results were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. To study the functional significance of these findings, the full-length Stat1 cDNA was transfected into drug-sensitive A2780 human ovarian cancer cells. The resulting clones that exhibited increased Stat1 expression were three- to five-fold resistant to cisplatin and AMD473 as compared to the parental cells. The effect of inhibiting Jak/Stat signalling on platinum drug sensitivity was investigated using the Janus kinase inhibitor, AG490. Pretreatment of platinum-resistant cells with AG490 resulted in significant increased sensitivity to AMD473, but not to cisplatin or oxaliplatin. Overall, the results indicate that cDNA microarray analysis may be used successfully to identify determinants of drug sensitivity/resistance and future functional studies of other candidate genes from this database may lead to an increased understanding of the drug resistance phenotype.",

Over the past decades, public health efforts to address these disparities have focused primarily on increasing access to prenatal care, however, this has not led to closing the gap in birth outcomes. We propose a 12-point plan to reduce Black-White disparities in birth outcomes using a lifecourse approach. The first four points (increase access to interconception care, preconception care, quality prenatal care, and healthcare throughout the life course) address the needs of African American women for quality healthcare across the lifespan. The next four points (strengthen father involvement, systems integration, reproductive social capital, and community building) go beyond individual-level interventions to address enhancing family and community systems that may influence the health of pregnant women, families, and communities. The last four points (close the education gap, reduce poverty, support working mothers, and undo racism) move beyond the biomedical model to address the social and economic inequities that underlie much of health disparities. Closing the Black-White gap in birth outcomes requires a life course approach which addresses both early life disadvantages and cumulative allostatic load over the life course.",

In this study, we investigated genetic alteration of germline tumours that affect the drug sensitivity of cells. Although all germline tumour cells we tested were hypersensitive to DNA-damaging drugs, no significant alteration was observed in their DNA repair activity or the expression of DNA repair proteins. In contrast, germline tumours expressed very low level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) compared to drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells. An immunohistochemical analysis indicated that most of the primary germline tumours we tested expressed very low level of EGFR. In accordance with this, overexpression of EGFR in germline tumour cells showed an increase in drug resistance, suggesting that a lack of EGFR, at least in part, contributes to the drug sensitivity of germline tumours.",

The genetic and epigenetic characterization of a cell line provides observations on various aspects of regulation including DNA copy number variations, gene expression, DNA methylation and protein abundance. To extract relevant information from the various data types, we applied a random forest based approach to generate sensitivity predictions from each type of data and combined the predictions in a linear regression model to generate the final drug sensitivity prediction. Our approach when applied to the NCI-DREAM drug sensitivity prediction challenge was a top performer among 47 teams and produced high accuracy predictions. Our results show that the incorporation of multiple genomic characterizations lowered the mean and variance of the estimated bootstrap prediction error. We also applied our approach to the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database for sensitivity prediction and the ability to extract the top targets of an anti-cancer drug. The results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in predicting drug sensitivity from heterogeneous genomic datasets.",

Here we describe the use of a transgenic parasite line for assaying drug sensitivity in all gametocyte stages.\\n\\nMETHODS: A transgenic parasite line expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) under the control of the gametocyte-specific gene \u03b1-tubulin II promoter was generated. This parasite line expresses GFP in all gametocyte stages. Using this transgenic line, we developed a flow cytometry-based assay to determine drug sensitivity of all gametocyte stages, and tested the gametocytocidal activities of four antimalarial drugs.\\n\\nFINDINGS: This assay proved to be suitable for determining drug sensitivity of all sexual stages and can be automated. A Z' factor of 0.79 \u00b1 0.02 indicated that this assay could be further optimized for high-throughput screening. The daily sensitivity of gametocytes to three antimalarial drugs (chloroquine, dihydroartemisinin and pyronaridine) showed a drastic decrease from stage III on, whereas it remained relatively steady for primaquine.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: A drug assay was developed to use a single transgenic parasite line for determining drug susceptibility of all gametocyte stages. This assay may be further automated into a high-throughput platform for screening compound libraries against P. falciparum gametocytes.",

        "abstract": "We profiled receptor tyrosine kinase pathway activation and key gene mutations in eight human lung tumor cell lines and 50 human lung tumor tissue samples to define molecular pathways. A panel of eight kinase inhibitors was used to determine whether blocking pathway activation affected the tumor cell growth. The HER1 pathway in HER1 mutant cell lines HCC827 and H1975 were found to be highly activated and sensitive to HER1 inhibition. H1993 is a c-MET amplified cell line showing c-MET and HER1 pathway activation and responsiveness to c-MET inhibitor treatment. IGF-1R pathway activated H358 and A549 cells are sensitive to IGF-1R inhibition. The downstream PI3K inhibitor, BEZ-235, effectively inhibited tumor cell growth in most of the cell lines tested, except the H1993 and H1650 cells, while the MEK inhibitor PD-325901 was effective in blocking the growth of KRAS mutated cell line H1734 but not H358, A549 and H460. Hierarchical clustering of primary tumor samples with the corresponding tumor cell lines based on their pathway signatures revealed similar profiles for HER1, c-MET and IGF-1R pathway activation and predict potential treatment options for the primary tumors based on the tumor cell lines response to the panel of kinase inhibitors.",

In the context of lung cancer, numerous studies have shown that tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that play crucial roles in lung tumor development and progression are targets of miRNA regulation. Manipulation of miRNA levels that modulate lung cancer cell survival and drug sensitivity can therefore provide novel therapeutic targets and agents. Areas covered: Here, the authors review the published in vitro, in vivo and preclinical studies on the functional role of miRNAs in modulating lung cancer cell viability and drug response, and discuss the limitations and promise of translating current findings into miRNA-based therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.

        "abstract": "There are currently no molecular targeted approaches to treat small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) similar to those used successfully against non-small-cell lung cancer. This failure is attributable to our inability to identify clinically-relevant subtypes of this disease. Thus, a more systematic approach to drug discovery for SCLC is needed. In this regard, two comprehensive studies recently published in Nature, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and the Cancer Genome Project, provide a wealth of data regarding the drug sensitivity and genomic profiles of many different types of cancer cells. In the present study we have mined these two studies for new therapeutic agents for SCLC and identified heat shock proteins, cyclin-dependent kinases and polo-like kinases (PLK) as attractive molecular targets with little current clinical trial activity in SCLC. Remarkably, our analyses demonstrated that most SCLC cell lines clustered into a single, predominant subgroup by either gene expression or CNV analyses, leading us to take a pharmacogenomic approach to identify subgroups of drug-sensitive SCLC cells. Using PLK inhibitors as an example, we identified and validated a gene signature for drug sensitivity in SCLC cell lines. This gene signature could distinguish subpopulations among human SCLC tumors, suggesting its potential clinical utility. Finally, circos plots were constructed to yield a comprehensive view of how transcriptional, copy number and mutational elements affect PLK sensitivity in SCLC cell lines. Taken together, this study outlines an approach to predict drug sensitivity in SCLC to novel targeted therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The identification of circulating TB strains in the community and drug sensitivity patterns is essential for the tuberculosis control program. This study was undertaken to identify M. tuberculosis strains circulating in selected communities in Ethiopia as well as to evaluate the drug sensitivity pattern of these strains.\\n\\nMETHOD: This study was a continuation of the Ethiopian National TB Prevalence Survey that was conducted between 2010 and 2011. Culture-positive isolates of M. tuberculosis from previous study were typed using region of difference (RD) 9-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and spoligotyping. Drug sensitivity testing was conducted using the indirect proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen media.\\n\\nRESULT: All 92 isolates were confirmed as M. tuberculosis by RD9-based PCR and spoligotyping of 91 of these isolates leds to the identification of 41 spoligotype patterns. Spoligotype revealed higher diversity (45\u00a0%) and among this 65.8\u00a0% (27/41) were not previously reported. The strains were grouped into 14 clusters consisting of 2-15 isolates. The dominant strains were SIT53, SIT149 and SIT37 consisting of 15, 11, and 9 isolates, respectively. Our study reveals 70\u00a0% (64/91) clustered strains and only 39.1\u00a0% (25/64) occurred within the same Kebele. Further assignment of the strains to the lineages showed that 74.7\u00a0% (68/91) belonged to Euro-American lineage, 18.6\u00a0% (17/91) to East Africa Indian lineage and the remaining 6.5\u00a0% (6/91) belonged to Indo-oceanic lineage. Valid drug susceptibility test results were available for 90 of the 92 isolates. Mono-resistance was observed in 27.7\u00a0% (25/90) and poly-resistance in 5.5\u00a0% (5/90) of the isolates. Moreover, multi-drug resistance (MDR-TB) was detected in 4.4\u00a0% of the isolates whilst the rest (60/90) were susceptible to all drugs. The highest level of mono-resistance, 26.6\u00a0% (24/90), was observed for streptomycin with majority (91.1\u00a0%) of streptomycin mono-resistant strains belonging to the Euro-American lineage.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: In this study, the strains of M. tuberculosis circulating in selected sites of Ethiopia were identified along with the drug sensitivity patterns. Thus, these findings are useful for the TB Control Program of the country.",

Mathematical model estimation and continuous interpolation makes the scoring approach robust against sources of technical variability and widely applicable to various experimental settings, both in cancer cell line models and primary patient-derived cells. Here, we demonstrate its improved performance over other response parameters especially in a leukemia patient case study, where differential DSS between patient and control cells enabled identification of both cancer-selective drugs and drug-sensitive patient sub-groups, as well as dynamic monitoring of the response patterns and oncogenic driver signals during cancer progression and relapse in individual patient cells ex vivo. An open-source and easily extendable implementation of the DSS calculation is made freely available to support its tailored application to translating drug sensitivity testing results into clinically actionable treatment options.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Protein kinase C(PKC) is a potentially important target for can-cer therapeutics due to its potential role in carcinogenesis.Abnormal expression and increasing activity of PKC-alpha are present in non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC).PKC inhibitor can show anti-tumor effects through inducing tumor cell apoptosis,enhancing cytotoxic effects and down-regulating expressions of multidrug resistance gene.By observing the effects of PKC inhibitor chelerythrine chloride(CH) on drug-sensitivity to cisplatin of four NSCLC cell lines its mechanism of effect initially is explored. METHODS: NSCLC cell lines(H1299,H460,A549 and cisplatin-resistant A549) were dealed with PKC inhibitor CH respectively.The expressions of PKC-alpha mRNA and protein in NSCLC cell lines were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) and Western blot.The apoptosis rates of NSCLC cells lines were detected by flow cytometry.The drug-sensitivity to cisplatin of NSCLC cells lines was measured by methabenzthiazuron(MTT) assay. RESULTS: The expression levels of PKC-alpha mRNA and protein in cisplatin-resistant A549 cell lines were significantly higher than H1299,H460 and parent A549 cell lines(P < 0.05).The expression levels of PKC-alpha mRNA and protein in four NSCLC cell lines decreased at different extent.The apoptosis rates of cisplatin-resistant A549 cell lines increased obviously after treating with CH for 4 and 24 hours,but it was not seen in H1299,H460 and parent A549 cell lines.The IC50 value of cisplatin of NSCLC cell lines decreased at different degree after treating with CH and it was more obvious in cisplatin-resistant A549 cell lines(P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High expressions of PKC-alpha mRNA and protein exist in all four NSCLC cell lines.PKC inhibitor CH can enhance the drug-sensitivity of NSCLC cell lines to cisplatin by inhibiting their expression of PKC-alpha mRNA and protein.When compared with parent A549 cell lines,cisplatin-resistant A549 cell line's drug-sensitivity to cisplatin is increasing more efficiently by PKC inhibitor CH through inhibition of PKC-alpha protein's expression and elevation of tumor cell apoptosis rates.",

Among the 19 mutants generated, H759P and N770P showed resistance to etoposide and doxorubicin at the non-permissive temperature, where cell growth depends on activity of the human enzyme. For these residues, mutants with an Ala substitution were further created, in which H759A also showed resistance to etoposide. H759P, H759A and N770P were expressed, purified and subjected to in vitro measurement of drug sensitivity. They generated lower amounts of the etoposide-induced cleavable complexes, and were also found to have lower decatenation activity than the wild-type. In the crystal structure, the yeast equivalent of His759 is found in the vicinity of the Arg713, a putative anchoring residue of the 3'-side of cleaved DNA strands. These results suggest that His759 and the other alpha4 helix residues are involved in the enzymatic activity and drug sensitivity of human DNA topoisomerase IIalpha, via interaction with cleaved DNA.",

        "abstract": "Aberrant promoter hypermethylation and associated gene silencing are epigenetic hallmarks of tumorigenesis. It has been suggested that aberrant DNA methylation can affect the sensitivity of cancers to antineoplastic agents by altering expression of genes critical to drug response. To study this issue, we used bisulfite PCR to assess DNA methylation of 32 promoter-associated CpG islands in human cancer cell lines from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug-screening panel (NCI-60 panel). The frequency of aberrant hypermethylation of these islands ranged from 2% to 81% in NCI-60 cancer cells, and provided a database that can be analyzed for the sensitivity to approximately 30,000 drugs tested in this panel. By correlating drug activity with DNA methylation, we identified a list of methylation markers that predict sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Among them, hypermethylation of the p53 homologue p73 and associated gene silencing was strongly correlated with sensitivity to alkylating agents. We used small interfering RNA to down-regulate p73 expression in multiple cell lines, including the resistant cell lines TK10 (renal cancer) and SKMEL28 (melanoma). Down-regulating p73 substantially increased sensitivity to commonly used alkylating agents, including cisplatin, indicating that epigenetic silencing of p73 directly modulates drug sensitivity. Our results confirm that epigenetic profiles are useful in identifying molecular mediators for cancer drug sensitivity (pharmaco-epigenomics).",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate a method for the prediction of chemotherapeutic response in patients using only before-treatment baseline tumor gene expression data. First, we fitted models for whole-genome gene expression against drug sensitivity in a large panel of cell lines, using a method that allows every gene to influence the prediction. Following data homogenization and filtering, these models were applied to baseline expression levels from primary tumor biopsies, yielding an in vivo drug sensitivity prediction. We validated this approach in three independent clinical trial datasets, and obtained predictions equally good, or better than, gene signatures derived directly from clinical data.",

Given the limited power of microarray signatures to predict therapeutic response in associative studies of small clinical trial cohorts, the use of functional genomic data combined with expression or sequence analysis of genes and microRNAs implicated in drug response in human tumours may provide a more robust method to guide adjuvant treatment strategies in breast cancer that are transferable across different expression platforms and patient cohorts.",

        "abstract": "The Gal4p family of yeast zinc cluster proteins comprises over 50 members that are putative transcriptional regulators. For example, Pdr1p and Pdr3p activate multidrug resistance genes by binding to pleiotropic drug response elements (PDREs) found in promoters of target genes such as PDR5, encoding a drug efflux pump involved in resistance to cycloheximide. However, the role of many zinc cluster proteins is unknown. We tested a panel of strains carrying deletions of zinc cluster genes in the presence of various drugs. One deletion strain (Deltardr1) was resistant to cycloheximide, whereas eight strains showed sensitivity to the antifungal ketoconazole or cycloheximide. Unnamed zinc cluster genes identified in our screen were called RDS for regulators of drug sensitivity. RNA levels of multidrug resistance genes such as PDR16, SNQ2, and PDR5 were decreased in many deletion strains. For example, cycloheximide sensitivity of a Deltastb5 strain was correlated with decreased RNA levels and promoter activity of the PDR5 gene. We tested if activation of PDR5 is mediated via a PDRE by inserting this DNA element in front of a minimal promoter linked to the lacZ gene. Strikingly, activity of the reporter was decreased in a Deltastb5 strain. The purified DNA binding domain of Stb5p bound to a PDRE in vitro. Mutations in the PDRE known to affect binding of Pdr1p/Pdr3p showed similar effects when assayed with Stb5p. These results strongly suggest that Stb5p is a transcriptional activator of multidrug resistance genes. Thus, we have identified new regulators of drug sensitivity in the family of zinc cluster proteins.",

        "abstract": "ATP binding cassette (ABC) systems are a diverse group of proteins that have been identified in every organism, from bacteria to humans. Analysis of nematode genomes indicates that the number and arrangement of ABC systems are similar to other organisms, with the majority being ABC transporters. There are few functional studies of ABC transporters in parasitic nematodes; most reports have been on their identification or use as genetic markers to monitor drug resistance. In eukaryotes, some ABC transporters function in tissue defense by actively removing drugs, thus preventing their accumulation. The overexpression of ABC transporters that function as efflux pumps, such as P-glycoprotein (PGP) and the multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP) are known to confer resistance. Drug sensitivity can be restored by administration of PGP interfering or MDR reversal agents. The objective of this study was to determine if ABC systems in filarioid nematodes function similarly to those of other organisms. The relative expression of 33 ABC systems identified in Brugia malayi was quantified following exogenous exposure to the commonly used drug ivermectin (IVM). Following exposure of adults and microfilariae to IVM, there was a significant increase in the transcriptional profiles of a number of ABC systems, mostly within the PGP and MRP subgroups. Coadministration of PGP-interfering and MDR-reversal agents with IVM potentiated sensitivity to the drug in adults and microfilariae. The results suggest that B. malayi ABC transporters function similarly to those in other organisms and are a factor in determining drug sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Based on the change in electrochemical behavior of enzymatic activity induced by medicines related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), a simple electrochemical method has been developed for investigation of medicine sensitivity using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) biosensor. The sol-gel-derived silicate network incorporating gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-SiSG) provided a biocompatible microenvironment around the enzyme molecule to stabilize its biological activity and prevent them from leaking out of the interface. AuNPs provided a conductive pathway for electron transfer and improved electrochemical reactions at a lower potential. Typical medicines for treatment of AD such as galantamine and neostigmine were selected for medicine sensitivity test. Due to the inhibitions of medicines, the electrochemical responses of substrate on AChE-sensor decreased greatly. The inhibition curves were similar to Michaelis-Menten and the Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) were calculated to be 0.14 \u03bcM and 0.19 \u03bcM, respectively. The inhibition curves showed good correspondence with the results by UV spectrophotometry assay. Ninety-six percent reactivation of the inhibited AChE could be regenerated for using pralidoxime iodide within 8 min. The proposed electrochemical drug sensitivity test exhibited high sensitivity, low cost and simplified procedures, which provided a new promising tool for investigation of drug sensitivity. \u00a9 2007.",

In an attempt to bridge this knowledge gap between cancer genetic and molecular profiling and clinically useful information, an individualized systems medicine program has been established at the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, and the Helsinki University Hospital. Central to this program is drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT), in which responses of primary cancer cells to a comprehensive clinical oncology and signal transduction drug collection are monitored. The drug sensitivity information is used with molecular profiling to establish hypotheses on individual cancer-selective targeting drug combinations and their predictive biomarkers, which can be explored in the clinic. Here, we describe how acoustic droplet ejection is enabling DSRT in our cancer individualized systems medicine program to (1) generate consistent but configurable assay-ready plates and determine how this affects data quality, (2) flexibly prepare drug combination testing plates, (3) dispense reagents and cells to the assay plates, and (4) perform ultra-miniaturized follow-up assays on the cells from DSRT plates.",

        "abstract": "Background: Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare KSHV/HHV8-assocd. high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of B-cell origin, characterized by serous effusions in body cavities.  Most patients are HIV-infected men with severe immunosuppression and other HHV8-assocd. diseases such as Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).  The prognosis for those infected is poor, with a median survival of less than 6 mo in most cohorts.  Sustained complete remission is rare.  High-dose chemotherapy regimens are used to improve remission rate and survival.  The aim of the present study was to compare the drug sensitivity pattern of the available primary effusion (body cavity based) lymphoma-derived cell lines in order to find addnl., potentially effective drugs that are not included in current chemotherapy treatment protocols.  Methods: We have analyzed 11 cell lines against 27 frequently used cytostatic drugs in short term (3 days) survival assays using automated high throughput confocal microscopy.  Results: All cell lines showed a distinct, individual drug sensitivity pattern.  Considering the in vitro used and clin. achieved drug concn., Vinorelbine, Paclitaxel, Epirubicin and Daunorubicin were the most effective drugs.  Conclusions: We suggest that inclusion of the above drugs into PEL chemotherapy protocols may be justified.  The heterogeneity in the drug response pattern however indicated that assay-guided individualized therapy might be required to optimize therapeutic response. [on SciFinder(R)]",

Here, we present an assay for the simultaneous and rapid genotyping of five polymorphisms influencing drug sensitivity. Design and methods: We used a hybridization probe assay on the LightCycler to detect five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): INPP1 (973C>A), ADRB2 (R16G and Q27E), HTR2A (102T>C), and mtDNA (1555A>G). Two fluorescent labeled hybridization probes were designed for the simultaneous detection of the five SNPs and detection of the variant alleles was performed by melting curve analysis. Results: All five SNPs were detected with a single thermocycle protocol within 40 min. The genotypes determined in this assay were identical to those obtained with conventional PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Conclusions: To our knowledge, we report here for the first time a method for simultaneous detection of five SNPs, on a single thermocycle protocol by the LightCycler. This method is rapid, highly sensitive, and high-throughput, and is thus suitable for routine clinical use and large-scale epidemiologic studies.",

Whether FOLFOX or FOLFIRI is administered first is not significant, however, it is essential that full administration of the targeted dosages of all 3 drugs, 5-FU, l-OHP and SN-38, is achieved. However, this is not always possible and second-line chemotherapy must be abandoned in certain cases. Where possible, the most effective regimen should be selected as the first line of treatment. The aim of this study was to determine whether first-line chemotherapy may be individualized using the collagen gel droplet-embedded drug sensitivity test (CD-DST). Specimens of primary tumors were obtained from 43 CRC patients who had received no preoperative chemotherapy. Informed consent to measure drug sensitivity was obtained from all patients. The CD-DST allows evaluation of drug sensitivity using isolated, 3-dimensionally cultured tumor cells in a small collagen gel droplet. The CD-DST was performed and the growth inhibition rate (IR) was obtained under incubation conditions (5-FU with l-OHP at 6.0 and 3.0 mug/ml, or 5-FU with SN-38 at 6.0 and 0.2 mug/ml, respectively, for 24 h). The cumulative distributions of the growth IRs under each condition were evaluated based on the evidence that the clinical response rates to FOLFOX and FOLFIRI were almost the same. Individualization of first-line treatment was possible in all patients, with FOLFOX and FOLFIRI showing higher efficacy in 26 and 15 patients, respectively, and equal efficacy in 2 cases. This method has the potential to facilitate the establishment of individualized first-line chemotherapy for CRC and improve the prognosis in such patients.",

A higher sensitivity of human than mouse lymphocytes was seen for topotecan and for 3 of 5 antimetabolites tested. Clear species specificity was also seen for the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib where rodent cells were 50-300 times less sensitive than human cells.

Recent studies have shown reduced WRN expression due to aberrant DNA hypermethylation in cancer cells. Furthermore, WRN expression is thought to affect sensitivity to DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors in cancer therapy. In this study, we examined the relationship between aberrant DNA hypermethylation of WRN and the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to anticancer drugs. DNA was extracted from samples from 22 patients with primary cervical cancer and 6 human cervical cancer-derived cell lines. Aberrant DNA hypermethylation was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR. WRN expression in cultured cells before and after addition of 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, a demethylating agent, was examined using RT-PCR. The sensitivity of cells to anticancer drugs was determined using a collagen gel droplet embedded culture drug sensitivity test (CD-DST). siRNA against WRN was transfected into a cervical cancer-derived cell line with high WRN expression. Changes in drug sensitivity after silencing WRN were determined by CD-DST. Aberrant DNA hypermethylation and decreased expression of WRN were detected in 7/21 cases of primary cervical cancer and in two cervical cancer-derived cell lines. These two cell lines showed high sensitivity to CPT-11, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, but became resistant to CPT-11 after treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine. Transfection of siRNA against WRN increased the sensitivity of the cells to CPT-11. Aberrant DNA hypermethylation of WRN also increased the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to CPT-11. Therefore, epigenetic inactivation of this gene may be a biomarker for selection of drugs for the treatment of cervical cancer. This is the first report to show a relationship between the methylation of the WRN gene and sensitivity to CPT-11 in gynecological cancers.",

MWNTs promoted electron transfer between the electroactive centers of cells and the electrode. Leukemia K562 cells exhibited a well-defined anodic peak of guanine at +0.823 V at 50 mV s(-1). HPLC assay with ultraviolet detection was used to elucidate the reactant responsible for the electrochemical response of the tumor cells. The guanine content within the cytoplasm of each K562 cell was detected to be 920 amol. For the drug sensitivity tests, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and several clinical antitumor drugs, such as vincristine, adriamycin, and mitomycin C, were added to cell culture medium. As a result, the electrochemical responses of the K562 cells decreased significantly. The cytotoxicity curves and results obtained corresponded well with the results of MTT assays. In comparison to conventional methods, this electrochemical test is highly sensitive, accurate, inexpensive, and simple.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: According to some studies, susceptibility of cells to anticancer drug-induced apoptosis is markedly inhibited by targeted deletion of genes encoding apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) or certain caspases. Information about levels of these polypeptides in common cancer cell types and any possible correlation with drug sensitivity in the absence of gene deletion is currently fragmentary. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunoblotting was used to estimate levels of Apaf-1 as well as procaspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -9 in the 60-cell-line panel used for drug screening by the National Cancer Institute. Sensitivity of the same lines to >80,000 compounds was determined with 48-hour sulforhodamine B binding assays. Additional 6-day assays were performed for selected agents. RESULTS: Levels of Apaf-1 and procaspases varied widely. Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, which are implicated in caspase activation after treatment of cells with various anticancer drugs, were detectable in all of the cell lines, with levels of Apaf-1 ranging from approximately 1 x 10(5) to 2 x 10(6) molecules per cell and procaspase-9 from approximately 5 x 10(3) to approximately 1.6 x 10(5) molecules per cell. Procaspase-8 levels ranged from 1.7 x 10(5) to 8 x 10(6) molecules per cell. Procaspase-3, a major effector caspase, varied from undetectable to approximately 1.6 x 10(6) molecules per cell. Correlations between levels of these polypeptides and sensitivity to any of a variety of experimental or conventional antineoplastic agents in either 2-day or 6-day cytotoxicity assays were weak at best. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of caspase-3, all of the components of the core cell-death machinery are expressed in all of the cell lines examined. Despite variations in expression, levels of any one component are not a major determinant of drug sensitivity in these cells in vitro.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent of immunosuppression associated lymphoproliferations such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), AIDS related immunoblastic lymphomas (ARL) and immunoblastic lymphomas in X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP). The reported overall mortality for PTLD often exceeds 50%. Reducing the immunosuppression in recipients of solid organ transplants (SOT) or using highly active antiretroviral therapy in AIDS patients leads to complete remission in 23-50% of the PTLD/ARL cases but will not suffice for recipients of bone marrow grafts. An additional therapeutic alternative is the treatment with anti-CD20 antibodies (Rituximab) or EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cells. Chemotherapy is used for the non-responding cases only as the second or third line of treatment. The most frequently used chemotherapy regimens originate from the non-Hodgkin lymphoma protocols and there are no cytotoxic drugs that have been specifically selected against EBV induced lymphoproliferative disorders.\\n\\nMETHODS: As lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) are well established in vitro models for PTLD, we have assessed 17 LCLs for cytotoxic drug sensitivity. After three days of incubation, live and dead cells were differentially stained using fluorescent dyes. The precise numbers of live and dead cells were determined using a custom designed automated laser confocal fluorescent microscope.\\n\\nRESULTS: Independently of their origin, LCLs showed very similar drug sensitivity patterns against 29 frequently used cytostatic drugs. LCLs were highly sensitive for vincristine, methotrexate, epirubicin and paclitaxel.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our data shows that the inclusion of epirubicin and paclitaxel into chemotherapy protocols against PTLD may be justified.",

        "abstract": "Anthelmintic resistance is a major problem in livestock farming, especially of small ruminants, but our understanding of it has been limited by the difficulty in carrying out functional genetic studies on parasitic nematodes. An important nematode infecting sheep and goats is Haemonchus contortus; in many parts of the world this species is resistant to almost all the currently available drugs, including ivermectin. It is extremely polymorphic and to date it has proved impossible to relate any sequence polymorphisms to its ivermectin resistance status. Expression of candidate drug-resistance genes in Caenorhabditis elegans could provide a convenient means to study the effects of polymorphisms found in resistant parasites, but may be complicated by differences between the gene families of target and model organisms. We tested this using the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) gene family, which forms the ivermectin drug target and are candidate resistance genes. We expressed GluCl subunits from C. elegans and H. contortus in a highly resistant triple mutant C. elegans strain (DA1316) under the control of the avr-14 promoter; expression of GFP behind this promoter recapitulated the pattern previously reported for avr-14. Expression of ivermectin-sensitive subunits from both species restored drug sensitivity to transgenic worms, though some quantitative differences were noted between lines. Expression of an ivermectin-insensitive subunit, Hco-GLC-2, had no effect on drug sensitivity. Expression of a previously uncharacterised parasite-specific subunit, Hco-GLC-6, caused the transgenic worms to become ivermectin sensitive, suggesting that this subunit also encodes a GluCl that responds to the drug. These results demonstrate that both orthologous and paralogous subunits from C. elegans and H. contortus are able to rescue the ivermectin sensitivity of mutant C. elegans, though some quantitative differences were observed between transgenic lines in some assays. C. elegans is a suitable system for studying parasitic nematode genes that may be involved in drug resistance.",

Methods: Three thousand three hundred and twenty-six urine samples of genitourinary tract and 701 mid-stream urine samples were collected. Culture of mycoplasma (Uu+Mycoplasma humenis) and drug sensitivity tests were performed, and quantity of mycoplasma (greater-than or equal to)104 CFU was regarded as positive. Results: Among the 701 mid-stream urine samples, 130 (18.5%)samples were positive for Uu, including 124 females (124/650, 19.1%) and 6 males (6/51, 11.8%), and all were negative for Mycoplasma humenis. Among the 3 326 urine samples of genitourinary tract, 851 (25.6%) samples were positive for Uu, including 783 females (783/2 790, 28.1%) and 67 males (67/536, 12.5%), and 3 samples were positive for Mycoplasma humenis. Drug sensitivity tests of Uu in mid-stream urine revealed that drugs with highest sensitivity were josamycin (98.5%), doxycycline (97.9%) and pristinamycin (97.7%). Uu infection in mid-stream urine was more sensitive to josamycin, doxycycline and pristinamycin with lower resistance than genital secretion (P<0.05). The sensitivity of Un to azithromycin was only 70.2% in urinary tract infection, and that was 77.7% in genital tract infection, which was significantly lower than that to josamycin (98.5%). Conclusion: The positive detection rate of Uu infection is relatively higher in initial screening of urinary infection. The sensitivity and resistance to antibiotics may be different in different sites of Uu infection. Josamycin and doxycycline may serve as the first-line therapy for urinary Uu infection.",

        "abstract": "Drug-releasing implant tests cancer\u2019s resolveBack to Top\\nPredicting whether a patient will respond to a drug is not easy, often relying on empirical evidence. Toward personalized medicine, animal models of patient tumors have been developed as well as engineered cell-material combinations meant to replicate a tumor in vitro. But the true test of whether a tumor responds to a drug will be by evaluating the tumor itself, within its own microenvironment. To this end, Jonas et al. created miniature drug delivery vessels that can be implanted with a standard biopsy needle directly into the tumor. These vessels, less than 1 mm in diameter, contained up to 16 microwells that each released a bolus of drug into the surrounding tumor tissue. The device and its surrounding tissue were then removed with a larger coring needle to see if the cancer cells had responded to the drug\u2014or combination of drugs. In mouse models of melanoma, breast, or prostate cancers, the local response to a common chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin, matched the tumor response to systemic therapy. Furthermore, in a mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer, tumor sensitivity to five different locally delivered cancer drugs was identical to tumor response after intravenous administration of drug; for instance, tumors were most responsive to paclitaxel and least responsive to lapatinib. Such tiny drug-releasing devices can be implanted at different locations within the tumor, overcoming issues with tumor heterogeneity, and allowing for reproducible evaluation of drug sensitivity directly within the patient.",

Dasatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and sorafenib all showed antiviral activity at micromolar concentrations. The 50% effective concentration for erlotinib and sorafenib was within blood concentrations readily achieved in human subjects. Quantitative PCR is a convenient method for viral drug sensitivity testing for slow-growing viruses that do not readily produce cytopathic effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experimental assays were performed with cultures, IC(50) of leukemic cells to drugs, immunochemistry and flow cytometry. RESULTS: The results showed that the two antisense oligodeoxynucleotides significantly reduced IC(50) levels for VP-16, Ara-c, DNA and As(2)O(3), inhibited bcl-2 gene expression and induced apoptosis of leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Computational prediction of antisense efficacy is faster than other methods and more cost-efficient.

In a second study on HER2-driven breast cancer, Angelini and colleagues investigate how the constitutively active, truncated carboxy-terminal fragment of HER2, p95HER2, promotes metastatic progression through non-cellautonomous secretion of factors from senescent cells. These new findings advance our understanding of HER2 biology in the context of HER2 activation as well as offer new insights into our understanding of drug sensitivity and metastatic progression.",

        "abstract": "Whole-organism compound sensitivity assays are a valuable strategy in infectious diseases to identify active molecules. In schistosomiasis drug discovery, larval-stage Schistosoma allows the use of a certain degree of automation in the screening of compounds. Unfortunately, the throughput is limited, as drug activity is determined by manual assessment of Schistosoma viability by microscopy. To develop a simple and quantifiable surrogate marker for viability, we targeted glucose metabolism, which is central to Schistosoma survival. Lactate is the end product of glycolysis in human Schistosoma stages and can be detected in the supernatant. We assessed lactate as a surrogate marker for viability in Schistosoma drug screening assays. We thoroughly investigated parameters of lactate measurement and performed drug sensitivity assays by applying schistosomula and adult worms to establish a proof of concept. Lactate levels clearly reflected the viability of schistosomula and correlated with schistosomulum numbers. Compounds with reported potencies were tested, and activities were determined by lactate assay and by microscopy. We conclude that lactate is a sensitive and simple surrogate marker to be measured to determine Schistosoma viability in compound screening assays. Low numbers of schistosomula and the commercial availability of lactate assay reagents make the assay particularly attractive to throughput approaches. Furthermore, standardization of procedures and quantitative evaluation of compound activities facilitate interassay comparisons of potencies and, thus, concerted drug discovery approaches.",

H2A.Z.2 is highly expressed in metastatic melanoma, correlates with decreased patient survival, and is required for cellular proliferation. Our integrated genomic analyses reveal that H2A.Z.2 controls the transcriptional output of E2F target genes in melanoma cells. These genes are highly expressed and display a distinct signature of H2A.Z occupancy. We identify BRD2 as an H2A.Z-interacting protein, levels of which are also elevated in melanoma. Wefurther demonstrate that H2A.Z.2-regulated genes are bound by BRD2 and E2F1 in an H2A.Z.2-dependent manner. Importantly, H2A.Z.2 deficiency sensitizes melanoma cells to chemotherapy and targetedtherapies. Collectively, our findings implicate H2A.Z.2 as a mediator of cell proliferation and drug sensitivity in malignant melanoma, holding translational potential for novel therapeutic strategies.",

        "abstract": "Future curative cancer chemotherapies have to overcome tumor cell heterogeneity and plasticity. To test the hypothesis that the tumor suppressor maspin may reduce microenvironment-dependent prostate tumor cell plasticity and thereby modulate drug sensitivity, we established a new schematic combination of two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D), and suspension cultures to enrich prostate cancer cell subpopulations with distinct differentiation potentials. We report here that depending on the level of maspin expression, tumor cells in suspension and 3D collagen I manifest the phenotypes of stem-like and dormant tumor cell populations, respectively. In suspension, the surviving maspin-expressing tumor cells lost the self-renewal capacity, underwent senescence, lost the ability to dedifferentiate in vitro, and failed to generate tumors in vivo. Maspin-nonexpressing tumor cells that survived the suspension culture in compact tumorspheres displayed a higher level of stem cell marker expression, maintained the self-renewal capacity, formed tumorspheres in 3D matrices in vitro, and were tumorigenic in vivo. The drug sensitivities of the distinct cell subpopulations depend on the drug target and the differentiation state of the cells. In 2D, docetaxel, MS275, and salinomycin were all cytotoxic. In suspension, while MS275 and salinomycin were toxic, docetaxel showed no effect. Interestingly, cells adapted to 3D collagen I were only responsive to salinomycin. Maspin expression correlated with higher sensitivity to MS275 in both 2D and suspension and to salinomycin in 2D and 3D collagen I. Our data suggest that maspin reduces prostate tumor cell plasticity and enhances tumor sensitivity to salinomycin, which may hold promise in overcoming tumor cell heterogeneity and plasticity.",

Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens.",

        "abstract": "Although the anticancer drugs paclitaxel and doxorubicin are commonly used to treat many solid tumors, their effectiveness is highly variable due to tumor cell resistance. Therefore, it is important to find mechanisms that can be targeted to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to current chemotherapeutic agents. NIMA\u2011related kinase 2 (Nek2), a serine/threonine kinase is emerging as an important oncogene because of its regulatory role in mitosis. Thus, regulation of the Nek2 expression levels may prove important as a target for cancer treatment. The purpose of our study was to determine whether drug sensitivity was increased in the triple negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against Nek2. To this end, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells transfected with Nek2 siRNA or ASO were exposed to various concentrations of paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Cell viability, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were evaluated. We observed that drug susceptibility in these transfected cells was dramatically increased compared with either agent alone. FACS results showed that apoptosis was induced in siRNA- and ASO\u2011transfected cells as expected due to the regulatory function of Nek2 in centrosome duplication. Interestingly, the cell cyle was not arrested in transfected cells. We found that siRNA and ASO against Nek2 worked synergistically with paclitaxel and doxorubicin by promoting cell apoptosis. Our results suggest that these drugs in combination with Nek2 siRNA or ASO treatment may improve the sensitivity of cancer cells during chemotherapy treatments.",

        "abstract": "Drug resistance in cancer cells involves complex molecular mechanisms and ovarian carcinoma cells become resistant to chlorambucil (Cbl) after continuous treatment. This drug- and ionizing radiation-resistant cells have lower level of endogenous ROS (reactive oxygen species) compared with sensitive cells. Elevation of the cellular ROS level by exogenous ROS generation increases the sensitivity of Cbl to resistant cells. In contrast, antioxidants prevent the sensitization of resistant cells to Cbl by H(2)O(2), COS (chronic oxidative stress) or NOO(-). The molecular mechanism of drug sensitivity with COS has been investigated by microarray gene expressions followed by gene network analysis and it reveals that a cdc42/rac1 guanine exchange factor, ARHGEF6, with p53 and DNA-Pkc (PRKDC) is central to induce apoptosis in Cbl(cos) (Cbl with COS) cells. mRNA and protein levels of major gene network pathway differ significantly in Cbl(cos) cells than in Cbl-treated cells. Moreover, DNA-PKc physically interacts with ARHGEF6 and p53 mostly in the nucleus of Cbl-treated cells, whereas in Cbl(cos)-treated cells, its interactions are mostly in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that low doses of Cbl and very low doses of COS together kill Cbl-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells and ARHGEF6 signaling may have an instrumental role in induction of apoptosis in Cbl(cos) cells.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the utility of the collagen gel droplet culture drug-sensitivity test (CD-DST) for predicting the response of gynecological cancers to chemotherapy. Eighty-three cancer patients were enrolled in this study: 26 ovarian, 29 cervical and 31 endometrial cancers. The CD-DST was performed at various concentrations of drugs. We calculated the T/C ratio, where T is the total volume of the treated culture and C is the total volume of the control culture, and a T/C ratio of 50% or less was defined as sensitive in vitro. The efficacy rate (%) was defined as the number of cultures with a T/C ratio of 50% or less, divided by the total number of evaluable cultures. True-positive cases were defined as clinical responders (complete+partial responses) and true-negative cases were defined as clinical non-responders. The overall tumor evaluation rate was found to be 79.1%. The appropriate drug concentrations were selected as 1.0 microg/ml for cisplatin, 20.0 microg/ml for carboplatin, 1.0 microg/ml for paclitaxel and 0.1 microg/ml for docetaxel by the linear regression equations. The in vitro sensitivity for each drug showed a significant correlation with clinical response rates (r=0.592, p=0021). We therefore conclude that the CD-DST can be used to predict the response to anti-cancer drugs, and may also provide important information by contributing to the development of new chemotherapy regimens.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of drug-resistant tumors during treatment remains one of the major obstacles in cancer chemotherapy. Overexpression of P-glycoprotein encoded by the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene or multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) (or both) and decreased expression of DNA topoisomerase II are responsible for expression of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. The expression of P-glycoprotein is also often observed in untreated cancers showing spontaneous MDR, such as renal cell carcinoma. Regarding cisplatin resistance, decreased cisplatin accumulation, an increase in cisplatin detoxification by glutathione-related enzymes or metallothionein (or both), and increased repair of DNA damage are all considered to play an important role. The combination of reversal agents targeting such drug resistance markers may be a way to improve the outcome of chemotherapy. Regarding the presently available reversal agents, however, clinically relevant chemosensitizing doses cannot be given to humans without inducing significant toxicity. The development of new agents that reverse drug resistance without causing significant toxicity and their clinical application based on the mechanisms regulating drug sensitivity may therefore be a potentially effective new treatment strategy for genitourinary carcinomas.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An enduring challenge in personalized medicine is to select right drug for individual patients. Testing drugs on patients in large clinical trials is one way to assess their efficacy and toxicity, but it is impractical to test hundreds of drugs currently under development. Therefore the preclinical prediction model is highly expected as it enables prediction of drug response to hundreds of cell lines in parallel.\\n\\nMETHODS: Recently, two large-scale pharmacogenomic studies screened multiple anticancer drugs on over 1000 cell lines in an effort to elucidate the response mechanism of anticancer drugs. To this aim, we here used gene expression features and drug sensitivity data in Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) to build a predictor based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a recursive feature selection tool. Robustness of our model was validated by cross-validation and an independent dataset, the Cancer Genome Project (CGP).\\n\\nRESULTS: Our model achieved good cross validation performance for most drugs in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (\u226580% accuracy for 10 drugs, \u226575% accuracy for 19 drugs). Independent tests on eleven common drugs between CCLE and CGP achieved satisfactory performance for three of them, i.e., AZD6244, Erlotinib and PD-0325901, using expression levels of only twelve, six and seven genes, respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that drug response could be effectively predicted from genomic features. Our model could be applied to predict drug response for some certain drugs and potentially play a complementary role in personalized medicine.",

Therefore, the P-gp modulators that block P-gp-mediated drug efflux have been developed, and used in combination with standard chemotherapy. In this paper, the capacity of zosuquidar, a specific P-gp modulator, to reverse chemoresistance was examined in both leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts.\\n\\nMETHODS: The transporter protein expressions were analyzed by flow cytometry using their specific antibodies. The protein functionalities were assessed by the uptake of their fluorescence substrates in presence or absence their specific modulators. The drug cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT test.\\n\\nRESULTS: Zosuquidar completely or partially restored drug sensitivity in all P-gp-expressing leukemia cell lines tested and enhanced the cytotoxicity of anthracyclines (daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone) and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) in primary AML blasts with active P-gp. In addition, P-gp inhibition by zosuquidar was found to be more potent than cyclosporine A in cells with highly active P-gp.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: These in vitro studies suggest that zosuquidar may be an effective adjunct to cytotoxic chemotherapy for AML patients whose blasts express P-gp, especially for older patients.",

Yet the dose-response curves generated by those assays, usually approximated by four-parameter logistic (4PL) models, are oftentimes difficult to interpret, with no clear indication of which metric should be used to compare them. Here, five commonly used metrics, absolute and relative half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)), area under the dose-response curve (AUC) based on trapezoidal rule and a parametric approach, and the effect at the maximal concentrations (E(max)), were compared in both simulations and real-life scenarios to evaluate their use with 4PL curves. Despite the fact that IC(50) is the most widely used metric to analyze dose-response curves, this study demonstrated that it was not the most reliable of the metrics tested. Fitted AUC showed the best overall performance in both the simulation and real-life scenarios; trapezoidal AUC showed similar performance to fitted AUC in most cases.",

This approach consists in seeding primary MM cells freshly extracted from bone marrow aspirates into microfluidic chambers implemented in multi-well plates, each consisting of a reconstruction of the bone marrow microenvironment, including extracellular matrix (collagen or basement membrane matrix) and stroma (patient-derived mesenchymal stem cells) or human-derived endothelial cells (HUVECs). The chambers are drugged with different agents and concentrations, and are imaged sequentially for 96 hr through bright field microscopy, in a motorized microscope equipped with a digital camera. Digital image analysis software detects live and dead cells from presence or absence of membrane motion, and generates curves of change in viability as a function of drug concentration and exposure time. We use a computational model to determine the parameters of chemosensitivity of the tumor population to each drug, as well as the number of sub-populations present as a measure of tumor heterogeneity. These patient-tailored models can then be used to simulate therapeutic regimens and estimate clinical response.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge of successful chemotherapy in ovarian cancer is overcoming intrinsic or acquired multi-drug resistance caused by active drug efflux mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Regulation of these transporters in ovarian cancer is poorly understood. We have found that abnormal expression of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway transcription factor Gli1 is involved in the regulation of ABC transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 in ovarian cancer. Hh is a known regulator of cancer cell proliferation and differentiation in several other types of invasive and metastatic malignancies. Our work has demonstrated that Gli1 is abnormally activated in a portion of ovarian cancers. Inhibition of Gli1 expression decreases ABCB1 and ABCG2 gene expression levels and enhances the response of ovarian cancer cells to certain chemotherapeutic drugs. The underlying mechanism is a direct association of Gli1 with a specific consensus sequence located in the promoter region of ABCB1 and ABCG2 genes. This study provides new understanding of ABC gene regulation by Hh signaling pathway, which may lead to the identification of new markers to detect and to anticipate ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug sensitivity. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

A mono-lung cancer cell line, a mixture of lung cancer and stromal cell lines, and cells from fresh lung cancer tissues were cultured in 3D under continuous media supplementation, mimicking the actual tumor microenvironment in vivo. The cells were treated with anti-cancer drugs according to a gradient concentration generator inside the chips to screen the appropriate chemotherapy schemes. We successfully cultured cell lines or primary cells with this device. We also smoothly assayed the sensitivities of different anti-cancer drugs in parallel and accurately screened appropriate-dose, single and combined-drug chemotherapy schemes for eight patients.

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is frequently caused by a mutation (G1896A) in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) precore (PC) reading frame that creates a stop codon, causing premature termination of the PC protein. During lamivudine treatment, drug resistance develops at a similar rate in HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative CHB. Lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants have been shown to replicate inefficiently in vitro in the absence of PC mutations, but it is unknown whether the presence of PC mutations affects replication efficiency or antiviral sensitivity. This study utilized the recombinant HBV baculovirus system to address these issues. HBV baculoviruses encoding the G1896A PC stop codon mutation were generated in wild-type (WT) and lamivudine-resistant (rtM204I and rtL180M + rtM204V) backgrounds, resulting in a panel of 6 related recombinant baculoviruses. In vitro assays were performed to compare the sensitivities of the PC mutant viruses with lamivudine and adefovir and to compare relative replication yields. The PC mutation did not significantly affect sensitivities to either adefovir or lamivudine. WT HBV and PC mutant HBV showed similar replication yields, whereas the replication yields of the lamivudine-resistant mutants were greatly reduced in HBeAg positive HBVs, confirming previous observations. However, the presence of the PC mutation was found to compensate for the replication deficiency in each of the lamivudine-resistant mutants, increasing the replication yields of each virus. In conclusion, the PC stop codon mutation appears to increase the replication efficacy of lamivudine-resistant virus but does not affect in vitro drug sensitivity.",

To this end we cloned KCNH6 channel of the crucian carp (Carassius carassius) that produces the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr), the main repolarising current of the fish heart. KCNH6 (ccErg2) was the main isoform of the Kv11 potassium channel family with relative transcript levels of 98.9% and 99.6% in crucian carp atrium and ventricle, respectively. KCNH2 (ccErg1), an orthologue to human cardiac Erg (Herg) channel, was only slightly expressed in the crucian carp heart. The native atrial IKr and the cloned ccErg2 were inhibited by similar concentrations of verapamil, terfenadine and KB-R7943 (P>0.05), while the atrial IKr was about an order of magnitude more sensitive to E-4031 than ccErg2 (P<0.05) suggesting that some accessory \u03b2-subunits may be involved. Sensitivity of the crucian carp atrial IKr to E-4031, terfenadine and KB-R7943 was similar to what has been reported for the Herg channel. In contrast, the sensitivity of the crucian carp IKr to verapamil was approximately 30 times higher than the previously reported values for the Herg current. In conclusion, the cardiac IKr is produced by non-orthologous gene products in fish (Erg2) and mammalian hearts (Erg1) and some marked differences exist in drug sensitivity between fish and mammalian Erg1/2 which need to be taken into account when using fish heart as a model for human heart.",

        "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a devastating cancer with a poor prognosis, is resistant to the currently available chemotherapeutic agents. Capsaicin, the major pungent ingredient found in hot red chili peppers of the genus Capsicum, suppresses the growth of several malignant cell lines. Our aims were to investigate the role and mechanism of capsaicin with respect to the sensitivity of CCA cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The effect of capsaicin on CCA tumor sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was assessed in vitro in CCA cells and in vivo in a xenograft model. The drug sensitivity of QBC939 to 5-FU was significantly enhanced by capsaicin compared with either agent alone. In addition, the combination of capsaicin with 5-FU was synergistic, with a combination index (CI) < 1, and the combined treatment also suppressed tumor growth in the CCA xenograft to a greater extent than 5-FU alone. Further investigation revealed that the autophagy induced by 5-FU was inhibited by capsaicin. Moreover, the decrease in AKT and S6 phosphorylation induced by 5-FU was effectively reversed by capsaicin, indicating that capsaicin inhibits 5-FU-induced autophagy by activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in CCA cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that capsaicin may be a useful adjunct therapy to improve chemosensitivity in CCA. This effect likely occurs via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation, suggesting a promising strategy for the development of combination drugs for CCA.",

It was the aim of the present study to develop a malaria drug sensitivity assay based on the measurement of HRP2 in a simple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The new test proved to be as reliable as traditional in vitro assays, while it was considerably easier to establish and perform. Parasites are incubated at an initial level of parasitemia of 0.01 to 0.1% on microculture plates predosed with ascending concentrations of antimalarial drugs. After incubation for 48 to 72 h, the samples are freeze-thawed and transferred to ELISA plates. The complete ELISA takes about 2.5 h to perform, may be carried out with commercially available test kits, and requires relatively little technical equipment. In correlation analysis, the results closely paralleled those obtained by the isotopic assay (R = 0.892; P < 0.0001) and World Health Organization schizont maturation tests (R = 0.959; P < 0.0001). The novel HRP2 drug susceptibility assay proved to be very sensitive, simple to establish, and highly reproducible.

        "abstract": "Cancer cells eventually acquire drug resistance largely via the aberrant expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ATP-dependent efflux pumps. Because cancer cells produce ATP mostly through glycolysis, in the present study we explored the effects of inhibiting glycolysis on the ABC transporter function and drug sensitivity of malignant cells. Inhibition of glycolysis by 3-bromopyruvate (3BrPA) suppressed ATP production in malignant cells, and restored the retention of daunorubicin or mitoxantrone in ABC transporter-expressing, RPMI8226 (ABCG2), KG-1 (ABCB1) and HepG2 cells (ABCB1 and ABCG2). Interestingly, although side population (SP) cells isolated from RPMI8226 cells exhibited higher levels of glycolysis with an increased expression of genes involved in the glycolytic pathway, 3BrPA abolished Hoechst 33342 exclusion in SP cells. 3BrPA also disrupted clonogenic capacity in malignant cell lines including RPMI8226, KG-1, and HepG2. Furthermore, 3BrPA restored cytotoxic effects of daunorubicin and doxorubicin on KG-1 and RPMI8226 cells, and markedly suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth in combination with doxorubicin in RPMI8226-implanted mice. These results collectively suggest that the inhibition of glycolysis is able to overcome drug resistance in ABC transporter-expressing malignant cells through the inactivation of ABC transporters and impairment of SP cells with enhanced glycolysis as well as clonogenic cells.",

        "abstract": "Chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (CML BC) remains a challenging disease to treat despite the introduction and advances in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. In this study we set out to identify novel candidate drugs for CML BC by using an unbiased high-throughput drug testing platform. We used three CML cell lines representing different types of CML blast phases (K562, EM-2 and MOLM-1) and primary leukemic cells from three CML BC patients. Profiling of drug responses was performed with a drug sensitivity and resistance testing platform comprising 295 anticancer agents. Overall, drug sensitivity scores and the drug response profiles of cell line and primary cell samples correlated well and were distinct from other types of leukemia samples. The cell lines were highly sensitive to TKIs and the clinically TKI-resistant patient samples were also resistant ex vivo. Comparison of cell line and patient sample data identified new candidate drugs for CML BC, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase inhibitors. Our results indicate that these drugs in particular warrant further evaluation by analyzing a larger set of primary patient samples. The results also pave way for designing rational combination therapies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive disease associated with poor survival. It is essential to account for the complexity of GBM biology to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This complexity is best represented by the increasing amounts of profiling (\"omics\") data available due to advances in biotechnology. The challenge of integrating these vast genomic and proteomic data can be addressed by a comprehensive systems modeling approach. METHODS: Here, we present an in silico model, where we simulate GBM tumor cells using genomic profiling data. We use this in silico tumor model to predict responses of cancer cells to targeted drugs. Initially, we probed the results from a recent hypothesis-independent, empirical study by Garnett and co-workers that analyzed the sensitivity of hundreds of profiled cancer cell lines to 130 different anticancer agents. We then used the tumor model to predict sensitivity of patient-derived GBM cell lines to different targeted therapeutic agents. RESULTS: Among the drug-mutation associations reported in the Garnett study, our in silico model accurately predicted ~85% of the associations. While testing the model in a prospective manner using simulations of patient-derived GBM cell lines, we compared our simulation predictions with experimental data using the same cells in vitro. This analysis yielded a ~75% agreement of in silico drug sensitivity with in vitro experimental findings. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a strong predictability of our simulation approach using the in silico tumor model presented here. Our ultimate goal is to use this model to stratify patients for clinical trials. By accurately predicting responses of cancer cells to targeted agents a priori, this in silico tumor model provides an innovative approach to personalizing therapy and promises to improve clinical management of cancer.",

        "abstract": "Aim: Afatinib (BIBW-2992) has been approved for patients with untreated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations. Pharmacogenomic studies have found that genome-wide assays allows the unbiased discovery of genomic alterations which are associated with drug response to targeted therapy. The aim of our study was to identify the correlation between DNA copy number profiles and treatment response to afatinib.Methods: Integrative analysis of DNA copy number alterations (CNA) from 32 metastatic NSCLC patients were performed to identify recurrent regions of genomic change associated with primary response to afatinib using the Affymetrix Mapping 250K Nsp SNP array. Copy number-associated transciptome profiling was identified using Affymetrix Human genome U133 Plus 2.0 array. Comparison of candidate genes correlated with copy number variation and clinical outcome of afatinib treatment was conducted by quantitative-PCR (qPCR).Results: Predictive model scores generated from cross-validation were correlated with sensitivity to afatinib. Eight distinct genomic regions were identified in a predictive model for afatinib sensitivity. Regions contained chromosomal gain of EGFR (7p11.2) as well as chromosomal loss of HSD3B2 (1p12) and MTAP (9p21.3). The extreme concordance between DNA copy number and transcript abundance was highly significant for the genes mapping to 7p11.2 in the afatinib-sensitive group. Amplification of CCT6A was related to intrinsic resistance to afatinib.Conclusions: These data show that integrative analysis of DNA copy number analysis can be used to identify genetic alterations which can be used to discover clinically relevant predictors of drug sensitivity to afatinib.Disclosure: All authors have declared no conflicts of interest.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Squamous cell lung cancer (SqCC) is the second most common type of lung cancer in the United States. Previous studies have used gene-expression data to classify SqCC samples into four subtypes, including the primitive, classical, secretory and basal subtypes. These subtypes have different survival outcomes, although it is unknown whether these molecular subtypes predict response to therapy.\\n\\nMETHODS: Here, we analysed RNAseq data of 178 SqCC tumour samples and characterised the features of the different SqCC subtypes to define signature genes and pathway alterations specific to each subtype. Further, we compared the gene-expression features of each molecular subtype to specific time points in models of airway development. We also classified SqCC-derived cell lines and their reported therapeutic vulnerabilities.\\n\\nRESULTS: We found that the primitive subtype may come from a later stage of differentiation, whereas the basal subtype may be from an early time. Most SqCC cell lines responded to one of five anticancer drugs (Panobinostat, 17-AAG, Irinotecan, Topotecan and Paclitaxel), whereas the basal-type cell line EBC-1 was sensitive to three other drugs (PF2341066, AZD6244 and PD-0325901).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Compared with the other three subtypes of cell lines, the secretory-type cell lines were significantly less sensitive to the five most effective drugs, possibly because of their low proliferation activity. We provide a bioinformatics framework to explore drug repurposing for cancer subtypes based on the available genomic profiles of tumour samples, normal cell types, cancer cell lines and data of drug sensitivity in cell lines.",

        "abstract": "Developing cost-effective and simple analysis tools is of vital importance for practical applications in bioanalysis. In this work, a new disposable electrochemical cell sensor with low cost and simple fabrication was proposed to study the electrochemical behavior of leukemia K562 cells and the effect of anticancer drugs on cell viability. The analytical device was integrated by using ITO glass as the substrate of working electrodes and paper as the electrolytic cell. The cyclic voltammetry of the K562 cells at the disposable electrode exhibited an irreversible anodic peak and the peak current is proportional to the cell number. This anodic peak is attributed to the oxidation of guanine in cells involving two protons per transfer of two electrons. For the drug sensitivity tests, arsenic trioxide and cyclophosphamide were added to cell culture media. As a result, the electrochemical responses of the K562 cells decreased significantly. The cytotoxicity curves and results obtained corresponded well with the results of CCK-8 assays. In comparison to conventional methods, the proposed method is simple, rapid and inexpensive. More importantly, the developed sensor is supposed to be a single-use disposable device and electrodes were prepared \"as new\" for each experiment. We think that such disposable electrodes with these characteristics are suitable for experimental study with cancer cells or other types of pathogens for disease diagnosis, drug selection and on-site monitoring.",

The profile of in vitro resistance to drugs was determined in the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay. High-quality total RNA was prepared and hybridized to oligonucleotide arrays HG-U133A 2.0 Chip (Affymetrix). The expression of selected genes was tested by qualitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).\\n\\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The exposure of leukemic blasts to drugs initiates a complex cellular response, which reflects global changes in gene expression.

        "abstract": "The ongoing cancer research has shown that malignant tumour cells have highly disrupted signalling transduction pathways. In cancer cells, signalling pathways are altered to satisfy the demands of continuous proliferation and survival. The changes in signalling pathways supporting uncontrolled cell growth, termed as rewiring, can lead to dysregulation of cell fates e.g. apoptosis. Hence comparative analysis of normal and oncogenic signal transduction pathways may provide insights into mechanisms of cancer drug-resistance and facilitate the discovery of novel and effective anti-cancer therapies. Here we propose a hybrid modelling approach based on ordinary differential equation (ODE) and machine learning to map network rewiring in the apoptotic pathways that may be responsible for the increase of drug sensitivity of tumour cells in triple-negative breast cancer. Our method employs Genetic Algorithm to search for the most likely network topologies by iteratively generating simulated protein phosphorylation data using ODEs and the rewired network and then fitting the simulated data with real data of cancer signalling and cell fate. Most of our predictions are consistent with experimental evidence from literature. Combining the strengths of knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches, our hybrid model can help uncover molecular mechanisms of cancer cell fate at systems level.",

        "abstract": "Platinum-based drugs such as cisplatin, carboplatin and xoaliplatin hav been introduced into clinical trials and their outcomes has progressed the treatment on several tumors, including ovarian cancer. However, cancer cells acquire chemo-resistance in the long term incubation of drugs, which turns out to be the major limitation for cancer therapy. Recent studies have shown that cisplatin can accumulate in mitochondria and induce cytochrome C release, thereby resulting in apoptosis. We found that glutamine plays a vital role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function by regulating NAD+ and NADH. Using bioenergetics and isotopomer analysis we show that chemodrugs in presence of glutamine affect oxidative phosphorylation in drug sensitive parental ovarian cancer cells. Addition of NAD+ substrates increased NAD/NADH ratio abrogating cisplatin's effect on cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, drug resistant cancer cells had relatively higher glutamine dependence when compared with parental cells. Importantly, we found that when glutamine's entry into TCA cycle was inhibited ovarian cancer cells became more sensitive to chemotherapy. Our findings are based on the quantification of metabolites, related to glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the TCA and urea cycles, and amino acids and nucleotide metabolism, and comparison of these pathways fluxes in drug sensitive and drug resistant ovarian cancer. The insights obtained present a unique opportunity for overcoming the drug resistance limitation in clinical trials in ovarian cancers. Citation Format: Lifeng Yang, Tyler J. Moss, Juan C.

        "abstract": "Mutationally activated KRAS, detected in ~90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs), has proven an intractable pharmacologic target to date. Consequently, efforts to treat KRAS mutated cancers are focused on targeting RAS-regulated signaling pathways. In mouse models, expression of BRAFV600E combined with dominant-negative TP53 elicits PDA, and pharmacologic blockade of MEK inhibits proliferation of human PDA-derived cell lines. To better understand the role of RAF\u2192MEK\u2192ERK signaling on PDA cell proliferation, we assessed the consequences of MEK inhibition on global patterns of mRNA expression and tumor cell proliferation in a panel of human PDA-derived cell lines. This analysis revealed that RAF\u2192MEK\u2192ERK signaling regulates mRNAs involved in cell cycle control as well as regulators of the immune system. Linear regression analysis of GI50 and mRNA expression revealed mRNAs and pathways correlating with relative drug sensitivity of the cell lines. Mice carrying orthotopically implanted pancreas tumors treated displayed reduced tumor growth concomitant with a reduction of cells in S phase. Furthermore, analysis of tumor mRNA expression revealed PDA cell lines to display similar baseline and MEK inhibitor mRNA expression profiles in vitro and in vivo. Amongst the proteins subject to down-regulation following MEK inhibition we identified c-MYC as a key driver of cell proliferation downstream of RAF\u2192MEK\u2192ERK signaling. Indeed, in some PDA cell lines, RNAi-mediated silencing of c-MYC expression had anti-proliferative similar to that of MEK inhibition, thereby highlighting the importance of c-MYC in key aspects of pancreatic cancer cell maintenance.",

The present study evaluated flow cytometry measurement of DNA staining with Sybr Green in comparison with the P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase assay, the tritiated hypoxanthine incorporation assay, a previously described Sybr Green based plate reader assay and light microscopy.\\n\\nMETHODS: All assays were set up in standardized format in 96-well plates. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of chloroquine, mefloquine and dihydroartemisinin against the laboratory adapted P. falciparum strains 3D7, E8B, W2mef and Dd2 were determined using each method.\\n\\nRESULTS: The resolution achieved by flow cytometry allowed quantification of the increase in individual cell DNA content after an incubation period of only 24 h. Regression, and Bland and Altman analyses showed that the IC50 values determined using the flow cytometry assay after 24 h agreed well with those obtained using the hypoxanthine incorporation assay, the P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase assay, the Sybr Green plate reader assay and light microscopy. However the values obtained with the flow cytometry assay after 48 h of incubation differed significantly from those obtained with the hypoxanthine incorporation assay, and the P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase assay at low IC50 values, but agreed well with the Sybr Green plate reader assay and light microscopy.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Although flow cytometric equipment is expensive, the necessary reagents are inexpensive, the procedure is simple and rapid, and the cell volume required is minimal.

To date, the role of this protein in drug resistance and tumorigenesis has not been determined. NSCLC cells stably expressing \u03b2III-tubulin short hairpin RNA displayed reduced growth and increased chemotherapy sensitivity when compared with control clones. In concordance with these results, stable suppression of \u03b2III-tubulin reduced the incidence and significantly delayed the growth of tumors in mice relative to controls. Our findings indicate that \u03b2III-tubulin mediates not only drug sensitivity but also the incidence and progression of lung cancer. \u03b2III-Tubulin is a cellular survival factor that, when suppressed, sensitizes cells to chemotherapy via enhanced apoptosis induction and decreased tumorigenesis.

        "title": "Chemical Biology Drug Sensitivity Screen Identifies Sunitinib as Synergistic Agent with Disulfiram in Prostate Cancer Cells",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current treatment options for castration- and treatment-resistant prostate cancer are limited and novel approaches are desperately needed. Our recent results from a systematic chemical biology sensitivity screen covering most known drugs and drug-like molecules indicated that aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram is one of the most potent cancer-specific inhibitors of prostate cancer cell growth, including TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive cancers. However, the results revealed that disulfiram alone does not block tumor growth in vivo nor induce apoptosis in vitro, indicating that combinatorial approaches may be required to enhance the anti-neoplastic effects.\\n\\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we utilized a chemical biology drug sensitivity screen to explore disulfiram mechanistic details and to identify compounds potentiating the effect of disulfiram in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive prostate cancer cells. In total, 3357 compounds including current chemotherapeutic agents as well as drug-like small molecular compounds were screened alone and in combination with disulfiram. Interestingly, the results indicated that androgenic and antioxidative compounds antagonized disulfiram effect whereas inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase, proteasome, topoisomerase II, glucosylceramide synthase or cell cycle were among compounds sensitizing prostate cancer cells to disulfiram. The combination of disulfiram and an antiangiogenic agent sunitinib was studied in more detail, since both are already in clinical use in humans. Disulfiram-sunitinib combination induced apoptosis and reduced androgen receptor protein expression more than either of the compounds alone. Moreover, combinatorial exposure reduced metastatic characteristics such as cell migration and 3D cell invasion as well as induced epithelial differentiation shown as elevated E-cadherin expression.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results propose novel combinatorial approaches to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. Disulfiram-sunitinib combination was identified as one of the potent synergistic approaches. Since sunitinib alone has been reported to lack efficacy in prostate cancer clinical trials, our results provide a rationale for novel combinatorial approach to target prostate cancer more efficiently.",

All patients were younger than 85 years and had untreated evaluable metastatic lesions. The primary tumors were surgically resected, and the tissue samples were investigated by CD-DST. Patients treated with in vitro sensitive drugs were defined as Group A (n = 14), while those treated with in vitro non-sensitive drugs were defined as Group B (n = 24). We evaluated response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).\\n\\nRESULTS: RR was 85.71 % in Group A and 41.67 % in Group B (p = 0.0079). The median PFS was 696.5 days in Group A and 297.5 days in Group B (p = 0.0326). The median OS was 1,023.4 days in Group A and 518.5 days in Group B (p = 0.0061).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The CD-DST can define chemoresistant and chemosensitive tumors.

For doxorubicin, asparaginase, vincristine, prednisone combination sensitivity, there was a significant worsening of prognosis from the extremely sensitive patients through an intermediate sensitive group to a most resistant group.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although studies have shown that Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OKSM)-mediated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology sensitizes cancer cells to drugs, the potential risk of inserting c-Myc and random insertions of exogenous sequences into the genome persists. Several authors, including us, have presented microRNA (miRNA)-mediated reprogramming as an alternative approach. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy of miRNA-mediated reprogramming on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.\\n\\nMETHODS: Among three miRNAs (miR-200c, miR-302s, and miR-369s) that were previously presented for miRNA-mediated reprogramming, miR-302 was expressed at low levels in HCC cells. After transfecting three times with miR-302, the cells were incubated in ES medium for 3\u00a0weeks and then characterized.\\n\\nRESULTS: iPSC-like spheres were obtained after the 3-week incubation. Spheres presented high NANOG and OCT4 expression, low proliferation, high apoptosis, low epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker expression (N-cadherin, TGFBR2), and sensitization to drugs. Several miRNAs were changed (e.g., low oncomiR miR-21, high miR-29b). cMyc was decreased, and methylation was elevated on histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4). Differentiated cells expressed markers of each germ layer (GFAP, FABP4, and ALB). AOF2 (also known as LSD1 or KDM1), one of the targets for miR-302, was repressed in iPSC-like-spheres. Silencing of AOF2 resulted in similar features of iPSC-like-spheres, including cMyc down-regulation and H3K4 methylation. In drug-resistant cells, sensitization was achieved through miR-302-mediated reprogramming.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: miR-302-mediated iPSC technology reprogrammed HCC cells and improved drug sensitivity through AOF2 down-regulation, which caused H3K4 methylation and c-Myc repression.",

There is a trend towards changing the norm for drug selection; one approach is to seek individualized cancer chemotherapy (ICC). Methods and results: ICC is an approach to maximizing the efficacy of chemotherapy and reducing its adverse effects to a minimum. It involves choosing anticancer drugs through the following critical steps: (i) performing drug sensitivity tests in vivo and/or in vitro; (ii) analyzing pathogenic information from morphology, histology and bioinformatics, so that targeted therapy can be offered to disrupt the escalating tumorigenic molecules and pathways; (iii) introducing mathematical and computational systems to assist in improving the quality of decision-making. Conclusion: Increasing clinical evidence indicates that drug sensitivity tests, pathological profile analyses and computational coordination are ways to improve therapeutic quality.

Drug sensitivity of two parasite lines, adapted to grow separately in conventional as well as in RPNI medium was compared to observe the effect of RPNI medium on functional characteristics of the parasite. The results revealed identical IC50 values of standard anti-malarials obtained by both the (3H) Hypoxanthine incorporation assay and the MSF assay and no untoward effect of FBS and ALBUMAX-II could be noticed on the chemo-sensitivity of standard anti-malarials. Apart from this the chemo-sensitive response of parasite line adapted to grow in RPNI medium was observed to be intact. These findings showed that RPNI medium has potential to be used for chemo-sensitivity studies and the MSF assay being more convenient was observed to be most suitable assay for bio evaluation of new molecules. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

The aim of this study was to explore the role of CacyBP in multidrug resistance (MDR) in gastric cancer cells.\\n\\nMETHODS: The cDNA encoding CacyBP was generated by reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and mouse antisera against CacyBP was raised using recombinant CacyBP as the immunogen. The expression of CacyBP in gastric cancer cells was determined by Northern and Western blots. Sense and antisense vectors for CacyBP were introduced into SGC7901 and SGC7901/ADR cells, respectively. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to evaluate the drug sensitivity of gastric cancer cells. Flow cytometry was employed to determine adriamycin accumulation and retention in gastric cancer cells.\\n\\nRESULTS: Northern and Western blots demonstrated upregulation of CacyBP in SGC7901/ADR cells compared to SGC7901 cells. SGC7901-CacyBP and SGC7901/ADR-anCacyBP cells were prepared, in which CacyBP was genetically increased and decreased, respectively. As compared with SGC7901, SGC7901-CacyBP cells exhibited significantly increased ( P < 0.01) IC(50) values for vincristine, adriamycin, and 5-fluorouracil. Meanwhile, as compared with SGC7901/ADR, SGC7901/ADR-anCacyBP cells exhibited significantly decreased ( P < 0.01) IC(50) values for these three drugs. SGC7901-CacyBP and SGC7901/ADR-anCacyBP cells displayed no obvious difference ( P > 0.05) in intracellular adriamycin content compared to their corresponding parental cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of CacyBP is associated with MDR in gastric cancer cells. CacyBP could regulate the responses of gastric cancer cells to chemotherapy. But the underlying mechanisms of CacyBP-related MDR need further identification.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: c-Kit is expressed in the plasma cells from 30% of patients with multiple myeloma. Two different isoforms of c-Kit, characterized by the presence or absence of the tetrapeptide sequence GNNK in the extracellular domain, have been described. However, their expression and function in myeloma cells are unknown. We explored the function and expression of these c-Kit isoforms in myeloma cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: Expression of c-Kit isoforms was investigated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in fresh plasma cells from patients and cell lines. The function of these c-Kit isoforms was analyzed upon expression in myeloma cells. Signaling was investigated by western blotting using antibodies specific for activated forms of several signaling proteins. The impact of c-Kit on the action of drugs commonly used in the treatment of multiple myeloma was investigated by MTT proliferation assays. RESULTS: Fresh plasma cells from patients as well as myeloma cell lines expressed the two isoforms of c-Kit. Retroviral infection of myeloma cells with vectors that code for c-Kit-GNNK+ or c-Kit-GNNK- forms demonstrated differences in the kinetics of phosphorylation between these isoforms. Stem cell factor-induced activation of the GNNK- form was faster and more pronounced than that of the GNNK+ form, whose activation, however, lasted for longer. The c-Kit receptors weakly activated the Erk1/2 and Erk5 pathways. Both receptors, however, efficiently coupled to the PI3K/Akt pathway, and stimulated p70S6K activation. The latter was sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Studies of drug sensitivity indicated that cells expressing the GNNK- form were more resistant to the anti-myeloma action of bortezomib and melphalan. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that c-Kit expression in multiple myeloma cells is functional, and coupled to survival pathways that may modulate cell death in response to therapeutic compounds used in the treatment of this disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent landmark studies have profiled cancer cell lines for molecular features, along with measuring the corresponding growth inhibitory effects for specific drug compounds. These data present a tool for determining which subsets of human cancer might be more responsive to particular drugs. To this end, the NCI-DREAM-sponsored DREAM7: Drug Sensitivity Prediction Challenge (sub-challenge 1) set out to predict the sensitivities of 18 breast cancer cell lines to 31 previously untested compounds, on the basis of molecular profiling data and a training subset of cell lines. METHODS AND RESULTS: With 47 teams submitting blinded predictions, team Creighton scored third in terms of overall accuracy. Team Creighton's method was simple and straightforward, incorporated multiple expression data types (RNA-seq, gene array, RPPA), and incorporated all profiled features (not only the \"best\" predictive ones). As an extension of the approach, cell line data, from public datasets of expression profiling coupled with drug sensitivities (Barretina, Garnett, Heiser) were used to \"predict\" the drug sensitivities in human breast tumors (using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas). Drug sensitivity correlations within human breast tumors showed differences by expression-based subtype, with many associations in line with the expected (e.g. Lapatinib sensitivity in HER2-enriched cancers) and others inviting further study (e.g. relative resistance to PI3K inhibitors in basal-like cancers). CONCLUSIONS: Molecular patterns associated with drug sensitivity are widespread, with potentially hundreds of genes that could be incorporated into making predictions, as well as offering biological clues as to the mechanisms involved. Applying the cell line patterns to human tumor data may help generate hypotheses on what tumor subsets might be more responsive to therapies, where multiple cell line datasets representing various drugs may be used, in order to assess consistency of patterns.",

A better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in cisplatin-induced cell death could potentially indicate ways to overcome cellular unresponsiveness to the drug and thus lead to better treatment results. We used the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism to identify and characterize novel genes involved in cisplatin-induced cell kill, and found that SKY1 (SR-protein-specific kinase from budding yeast) is a cisplatin sensitivity gene whose disruption conferred cisplatin resistance. In cross-resistance studies, we observed resistance of yeast sky1 Delta cells (i.e., cells from which the SKY1 gene had been disrupted) to cisplatin, carboplatin (but not oxaliplatin), doxorubicin and daunorubicin, and hypersensitivity to cadmium chloride and 5-fluorouracil. Furthermore, these cells did not display reduced platinum accumulation, DNA platination or doxorubicin accumulation, indicating that the resistance is unrelated to decreased drug import or increased drug export. Based on the modification of the anticancer drug sensitivity profile and our finding that sky1 Delta cells display a mutator phenotype, we propose that Sky1p might play a significant role in specific repair and/or tolerance pathways. Disruption of the S. cerevisiae SKY1 gene would thus result in deregulation of such mechanisms and, consequently, lead to altered drug sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "We have evaluated the 5-fluorouracil sensitivity of cancer cells from colorectal cancer patients using the collagen gel droplet embedded drug sensitivity test under multiple drug concentrations and contact durations. After converting drug concentration and contact time to the area under the curve (AUC) and plotting against the growth inhibition rate, the correlation between AUC and the growth inhibition rates was approximated to the logarithmic regression curve. In this study, to further validate the reliability of the regression curve, the growth inhibition rate was calculated from the regression curve and the actual growth inhibition rate was compared at AUC of 48 mug h/ml. No significant difference was observed in the growth inhibition rates between the two groups by paired t-test (P=0.590). A strong positive correlation was found between the two groups by regression analysis (y=0.7555x+10.514, R=0.8236). This result strongly suggests that in-vitro antitumor effect of 5-fluorouracil depends on the AUC in colorectal cancer and the AUC-inhibition rate curve is reliable. We can obtain the inhibition rate from AUC and vice versa using the AUC-inhibition rate curve. We can also calculate the individualized AUCIR50, AUC value that gives 50% growth inhibition, using the AUC-inhibition rate curve. This could be useful to establish individualized chemotherapy using the collagen gel droplet embedded drug sensitivity test.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronically infects 170 million individuals, causing severe liver disease. Although antiviral chemotherapy exists, the current regimen is ineffective in 50% of cases due to high levels of innate virus resistance. New, virus-specific therapies are forthcoming although their development has been slow and they are few in number, driving the search for new drug targets. The HCV p7 protein forms an ion channel in vitro and is critical for the secretion of infectious virus. p7 displays sensitivity to several classes of compounds, making it an attractive drug target. We recently demonstrated that p7 compound sensitivity varies according to viral genotype, yet little is known of the residues within p7 responsible for channel activity or drug interactions. Here, we have employed a liposome-based assay for p7 channel function to investigate the genetic basis for compound sensitivity. We demonstrate using chimeric p7 proteins that neither the two trans-membrane helices nor the p7 basic loop individually determines compound sensitivity. Using point mutation analysis, we identify amino acids important for channel function and demonstrate that null mutants exert a dominant negative effect over wild-type protein. We show that, of the three hydrophilic regions within the amino-terminal trans-membrane helix, only the conserved histidine at position 17 is important for genotype 1b p7 channel activity. Mutations predicted to play a structural role affect both channel function and oligomerization kinetics. Lastly, we identify a region at the p7 carboxy terminus which may act as a specific sensitivity determinant for the drug amantadine.",

        "abstract": "The stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is widely used by eukaryotic organisms as a central conduit via which cellular responses to the environment effect growth and differentiation. The basidiomycetous human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans uniquely uses the stress-activated Pbs2-Hog1 MAPK system to govern a plethora of cellular events, including stress responses, drug sensitivity, sexual reproduction, and virulence. Here, we characterized a fungal \"two-component\" system that controls these fundamental cellular functions via the Pbs2-Hog1 MAPK cascade. A typical response regulator, Ssk1, modulated all Hog1-dependent phenotypes by controlling Hog1 phosphorylation, indicating that Ssk1 is the major upstream signaling component of the Pbs2-Hog1 pathway. A second response regulator, Skn7, governs sensitivity to Na+ ions and the antifungal agent fludioxonil, negatively controls melanin production, and functions independently of Hog1 regulation. To control these response regulators, C. neoformans uses multiple sensor kinases, including two-component-like (Tco) 1 and Tco2. Tco1 and Tco2 play shared and distinct roles in stress responses and drug sensitivity through the Hog1 MAPK system. Furthermore, each sensor kinase mediates unique cellular functions for virulence and morphological differentiation. Our findings highlight unique adaptations of this global two-component MAPK signaling cascade in a ubiquitous human fungal pathogen.",

We investigated the relationship between the clinical efficacy of treatment for pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and drug-sensitivity test for isolated MAC by comparison between data from 2005 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2010. We studied 60 patients who satisfied diagnostic criteria of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection established by the American Thoracic Society in 2007 and who received combination therapy using rifampicin (RFP), ethambutol (EB), streptomycin (SM), and clarithromycin (CAM). Average CAM dosage was increased from the early (517 mg/day) to the later (800 mg/day) period. Sputum conversion rate increased from 63% in the early period to 83% in the later period. Clinical improvement also increased from 38% in the early period to 53% in the later period. The causative microorganisms isolated were M. avium in 35 patients and M. intracellulare in 25. In both periods, isolated MAC strains showed excellent minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for CAM. Regarding the relationship between clinical efficacy and MICs of RFP, EB, CAM, and SM, most patients with good clinical effects showed low MIC for CAM in both periods. Good clinical efficacy, including the sputum conversion rate, was obtained with an increased dose of CAM in the later period. We speculate that the increased dose of CAM influenced the good clinical effect in both periods.",

A 28-year old man presented at our hospital with a large mass in his right shank which had a hard texture and an obscure boundary. The histopathological diagnosis of excisional biopsy specimens was synovial sarcoma with low differentiation. Theprubicin/Cisplatin (THP/CDDP) neoadjuvant chemotherapy was selected based on the results obtained from the CD-DST. After three courses, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed which indicated that the volume of the tumor had decreased significantly. Additionally, tumor necrosis, as well as the clinical response, showed complete response. The histopathological diagnosis of wide excision specimens indicated a grade III chemotherapy response. The patient was alive and without recurrence after a follow-up of 16 months. Our results indicated that the CD-DST is a useful tool for selecting neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic drugs for patients with synovial sarcoma.",

Emerging evidence shows that drug resistance not only exists against conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, but also limits the efficacy of new biological agents. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms through which AML patients develop drug resistance. MicroRNAs have been shown to play an important role in regulating the chemotherapy resistance in AML. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of microRNA that are clinically relevant in AML may enhance our ability to predict and overcome drug resistance. Here, we demonstrated, for the first time, that miR\u2011181b was decreased significantly in human multidrug-resistant leukemia cells and relapsed/refractory AML patient samples. Overexpression of miR\u2011181b increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and promoted drug-induced apoptosis. Moreover, miR\u2011181b inhibited HMGB1 and Mcl-1 expression by direct binding to their 3'-untranslated regions. In addition, HMGB1 was expressed at high levels in relapsed/refractory AML patients and suppression of HMGB1 via RNA interference sensitized multidrug-resistant leukemia cells to chemotherapy and induced apoptosis. In conclusion, these results provide a strong rationale for the development of miR\u2011181b-based therapeutic strategies for the enhancement of efficacy in AML treatment.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the heterogeneous drug response of cancer patients is essential to precision oncology. Pioneering genomic analyses of individual cancer subtypes have begun to identify key determinants of resistance, including up-regulation of multi-drug resistance (MDR) genes and mutational alterations of drug targets. However, these alterations are sufficient to explain only a minority of the population, and additional mechanisms of drug resistance or sensitivity are required to explain the remaining spectrum of patient responses to ultimately achieve the goal of precision oncology. We hypothesized that a pan-cancer analysis of in vitro drug sensitivities across numerous cancer lineages will improve the detection of statistical associations and yield more robust and, importantly, recurrent determinants of response. In this study, we developed a statistical framework based on the meta-analysis of expression profiles to identify pan-cancer markers and mechanisms of drug response. Using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (CCLE), a large panel of several hundred cancer cell lines from numerous distinct lineages, we characterized both known and novel mechanisms of response to cytotoxic drugs including inhibitors of Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1; Topotecan, Irinotecan) and targeted therapies including inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC; Panobinostat) and MAP/ERK kinases (MEK; PD-0325901, AZD6244). Notably, our analysis implicated reduced replication and transcriptional rates, as well as deficiency in DNA damage repair genes in resistance to TOP1 inhibitors. The constitutive activation of several signaling pathways including the interferon/STAT-1 pathway was implicated in resistance to the pan-HDAC inhibitor. Finally, a number of dysregulations upstream of MEK were identified as compensatory mechanisms of resistance to the MEK inhibitors. In comparison to alternative pan-cancer analysis strategies, our approach can better elucidate relevant drug response mechanisms. Moreover, the compendium of putative markers and mechanisms identified through our analysis can serve as a foundation for future studies into these drugs.",

Through a replacement of chromosomal rDNA with a plasmid rDNA system, I show that suppression of paromomycin sensitivity is mediated by rDNA.

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional tumor models accurately describe different aspects of the tumor microenvironment and are readily available for mechanistic studies of tumor biology and for drug screening. Nevertheless, these systems often overlook biomechanical stimulation, another fundamental driver of tumor progression. To address this issue, we cultured Ewing sarcoma (ES) cells on electrospun poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) 3D scaffolds within a flow perfusion bioreactor. Flow-derived shear stress provided a physiologically relevant mechanical stimulation that significantly promoted insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) production and elicited a superadditive release in the presence of exogenous IGF1. This finding is particularly relevant, given the central role of the IGF1/IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway in ES tumorigenesis and as a promising clinical target. Additionally, flow perfusion enhanced in a rate-dependent manner the sensitivity of ES cells to IGF-1R inhibitor dalotuzumab (MK-0646) and showed shear stress-dependent resistance to the IGF-1R blockade. This study demonstrates shear stress-dependent ES cell sensitivity to dalotuzumab, highlighting the importance of biomechanical stimulation on ES-acquired drug resistance to IGF-1R inhibition. Furthermore, flow perfusion increased nutrient supply throughout the scaffold, enriching ES culture over static conditions. Our use of a tissue-engineered model, rather than human tumors or xenografts, enabled precise control of the forces experienced by ES cells, and therefore provided at least one explanation for the remarkable antineoplastic effects observed by some ES tumor patients from IGF-1R targeted therapies, in contrast to the lackluster effect observed in cells grown in conventional monolayer culture.",

To facilitate the study of this enzyme, the production, purification, and characterization of the recombinant hPAO is reported. hPAO oxidizes N1-acetylspermidine (Km=2.1\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b5M, Kcat=15.0\u00c2\u00a0s-1) and has very high affinity for N1-acetylspermine (Km=0.85\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b5M, Kcat=31.7\u00c2\u00a0s-1). The recombinant hPAO does not efficiently oxidize spermine, thereby demonstrating a significant difference in substrate specificity from the previously described human spermine oxidase PAOh1/SMO. Importantly, hPAO demonstrates the ability to oxidize a subset of antitumor polyamine analogues, suggesting that this oxidase activity could have a significant effect on determining tumor sensitivity to these or similar agents. Transfection of A549 human lung cancer cells with an hPAO-expressing plasmid leads to a profound decrease in sensitivity to those analogues which act as substrates, confirming its potential to alter drug response.

This study investigates the differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in LRTIs.\\n\\nMETHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of 4,762 LRTI patients in the general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) of Xiangya Hospital (Changsha) were retrospectively analyzed.\\n\\nRESULTS: The infection rate of Gram-negative bacteria was significantly higher than that of Gram-positive bacteria in both the general ward and RICU (P<0.05). The incidence of Gram-negative bacteria infection was significantly higher in the RICU than in the general ward (P<0.05), whereas the incidence of Gram-positive bacteria infection is less in the RICU than in the general ward (P<0.05). In the general ward, the incidence of Gram-negative bacteria infection significantly increased (P<0.05) over time, whereas the incidence of Gram-positive bacteria infection significantly decreased from 1996 to 2011 (P<0.05). In the RICU, the incidence of Gram-positive bacteria infection decreased, while Gram-negative bacteria infections increased without statistical significance (P>0.05). Staphylococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were found to be the predominant Gram-positive strains in the general ward (34.70-41.18%) and RICU (41.66-54.87%), respectively (P>0.05). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were the predominant gram negative strains in the general ward (19.17-21.09%) and RICU (29.60-33.88%), respectively (P>0.05). Streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to most antibiotics with a sensitivity of more than 70%. Staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (100%), chloramphenicol (74.36-82.19%), doxycycline (69.57-77.33%), and sulfamethoprim (67.83-72.46%); however, its sensitivity to other antibiotics is low and decreased each year. Sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to most \u03b2-lactam, aminoglycoside, and quinolone group antibiotics decreased each year.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The distribution and drug sensitivity of LRTI pathogens exhibit a high divergence between the general ward and RICU. Streptococcus pneumoniae may not be the predominant pathogen in LRTIs in some areas of China.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that the ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling pathway plays an important role not only in cell growth, cell cycle regulation, and differentiation, but also in determining the sensitivity of cells to anticancer agents as well. Furthermore, expression of kinase suppressor of Ras-1 (KSR1), a molecular scaffold that modulates signaling through the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway, has been shown to influence the cellular sensitivity to the anticancer agent cisplatin. To further define the role of KSR1 expression on drug sensitivity, the expression of KSR1 was examined in the NCI60 anticancer drug screen, a panel of cancer cell lines representing nine tissue types, established by the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The expression of thousands of molecular targets has been examined in the NCI60 panel as well as the cellular toxicity for greater than 400,000 compounds. KSR1 expression varied almost 30-fold difference between the highest and lowest expressing cell lines in the NCI60. Using the COMPARE analysis algorithm, KSR1 expression was correlated with sensitivity of the compounds screened by DTP and several novel agents were identified whose sensitivity correlated with KSR1 expression in the NCI60 panel. Cytotoxicity of two agents, cytochalasin H and tunicamycin, identified through the COMPARE analysis of KSR1 expression and drug sensitivity, was also examined in wild type (KSR(+/+)) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and MEFs deficient in KSR1 expression (KSR1(-/-)). These studies demonstrated enhanced sensitivity, as well as increased ERK activation, in KSR(-/-) MEFs following exposure to tunicamycin or cytochalasin H compared to KSR(+/+) MEFs. Furthermore, restoration of KSR1 expression in KSR(-/-) MEFs following stable transduction of cells with a KSR1 expression vector, enhanced sensitivity of cells to tunicamycin and cytochalasin H and decreased ERK1/2 activation following exposure to these drugs. In addition, the sensitivity to cytochalasin H and tunicamycin of breast cancer cell lines with low KSR1 expression, (HS578T and MDA-MB-231/ATCC), was increased relative to the sensitivity of breast cancer cells with higher levels of KSR1 (MCF7). These studies indicate that KSR1 may play an important role in the determination of cellular sensitivity to anticancer agents.",

        "abstract": "F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBW7) is a member of the F-box protein family that regulates cell cycle progression and cell growth and differentiation. FBW7 also functions as a tumor suppressor. A cisplatin (CDDP)-based multidrug chemotherapy regimen is standard for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but drug resistance is an increasing problem. Here, we evaluated the relationship between FBW7 and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), and its correlation with drug resistance in NPC, and explored the mechanism underlying drug resistance to CDDP in this disease. We used cell viability assays, Western blotting, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) interference to investigate the underlying mechanism underlying CDDP resistance in a NPC cell line. The expression of FBW7 and MRP was detected by Western blotting after siRNA interference in the CDDP-resistant NPC cell line, CNE2-CDDP. The 3-(4 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2 5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to evaluate drug sensitivity of various types of antitumor drugs, including paclitaxel (PCX), CDDP, fluorouracil (5-FU), and vincristine (VCR). We found that siRNA-mediated upregulation of FBW7 significantly increased CDDP chemosensitivity. The IC50 values of CDDP in siRNA-FBW7-CNE2-CDDP and FBW7-CNE2-CDDP-NC cells were 2.485\u2009\u00b1\u20090.155 and 4.867\u2009\u00b1\u20090.442\u00a0\u03bcmol/mL, respectively. The IC50 values of PCX, CDDP, 5-FU, and VCR were significantly decreased in siRNA-FBW7-CNE2 than in FBW7-CNE2-NC (3.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14 vs. 46.21\u2009\u00b1\u20096.03\u00a0\u03bcmol/mL; 3.76\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 vs. 39.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.96\u00a0\u03bcmol/mL; 2.14\u2009\u00b1\u20091.67 vs. 28.76\u2009\u00b1\u20091.89\u00a0\u03bcmol/mL; 4.43\u2009\u00b1\u20090.89 vs. 87.90\u2009\u00b1\u20093.45\u00a0\u03bcmol/mL, respectively). The IC50 of CDDP was significantly less in siRNA-FBW7-CNE2-CDDP than in FBW7-CNE2-CDDP-NC. The level of FBW7 expression in CNE2 cells was correlated with CDDP chemosensitivity. siRNA-mediated upregulation of FBW7 expression downregulated the expression of MRP, significantly increasing drug sensitivity in CNE2 cells.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The screening of lead compounds against in vitro parasite cultures is an essential step in the development of novel anti-malarial drugs, but currently relies on laboratory parasite lines established in vitro during the last century. This study sought to establish in continuous culture a series of recent Plasmodium falciparum isolates to represent the current parasite populations in Africa, all of which are now exposed to artemisinin combination therapy.\\n\\nMETHODS: Pre-treatment P. falciparum isolates were obtained in EDTA, and placed into continuous culture after sampling of DNA. One post-treatment blood sample was also collected for each donor to monitor parasite clonality during clearance in vivo. IC\u2085\u2080 estimates were obtained for 11 anti-malarial compounds for each established parasite line, clonal multiplicity measured in vivo and in vitro, and polymorphic sites implicated in parasite sensitivity to drugs were investigated at the pfmdr1, pfcrt, pfdhfr, pfdhps and pfap2mu loci before and after treatment, and in the cultured lines.\\n\\nRESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum isolates from seven malaria patients with recent travel to three West African and two East African countries were successfully established in long-term culture. One of these, HL1211, was from a patient with recrudescent parasitaemia 14 days after a full course of artemether-lumefantrine. All established culture lines were shown to be polyclonal, reflecting the in vivo isolates from which they were derived, and at least two lines reliably produce gametocytes in vitro. Two lines displayed high chloroquine IC\u2085\u2080 estimates, and carried the CVIET haplotype at codons 72-76, whereas the remaining five lines carried the CVMNK haplotype and were sensitive in vitro. All were sensitive to the endoperoxides dihydroartemisinin and OZ277, but IC\u2085\u2080 estimates for lumefantrine varied, with the least sensitive parasites carrying pfmdr1 alleles encoding Asn at codon 86.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This study describes the establishment in continuous culture, in vitro drug sensitivity testing and molecular characterization of a series of multiclonal P. falciparum isolates taken directly from UK malaria patients following recent travel to various malaria-endemic countries in Africa. These \"HL\" isolates are available as an open resource for studies of drug response, antigenic diversity and other aspects of parasite biology.",

        "abstract": "Emerging therapies for chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection involve inhibition of viral enzymes with drug combinations. Natural, or treatment-induced, enzyme polymorphisms reduce efficacy. We developed a phenotyping assay to aid drug selection based on viral transfer from monocytes to hepatocytes. We studied HCV in monocytes from infected patients and developed a model in which patient-derived HCV is \"captured\" by the cell line THP-1 and replication assessed after fusion to hepatoma cells. We found that monocytes from HCV-infected patients harbour virus that replicates when cells are fused to hepatocytes. THP-1 cells incubated with infected sera 'capture' HCV which replicates when fused to hepatocytes. Inhibitable replication of all HCV genotypes was achieved (42 of 52 isolates). We measured sensitivity of telaprevir and alisporivir in different genotypes and showed differences in IC50 correlating with clinical response (telaprevir IC50 for genotype (G)1 was 0.042 \u00b1 0.003 \u00b5M, versus 0.117 \u00b1 0.015 \u03bcM for G3, whereas alisporivir IC50 for G1 was 0.139 \u00b1 0.013 \u00b5M versus 0.044 \u00b1 0.007 \u00b5M for G3). We tested telaprevir resistant viral isolates and identified changes in IC50 . One patient with a poor clinical response to telaprevir and 'wild type' viral sequence showed reduced telaprevir sensitivity in our assay. We studied samples from a 2-week telaprevir monotherapy study in which 5/8 patients with G3 HCV did not respond whilst 3/8 patients did. The 'capture-fusion' assay correctly identified responders. Conclusion: The 'capture-fusion' model represents a promising new technique which may help identify appropriate treatment strategies for patients with chronic HCV infection. (Hepatology 2014;).",

To determine why YAB103 lacked the growth defect and the hygromycin B sensitivity of its parent, TIY20, gene expression profiles of YAB103 and TIY20 were analyzed using DNA microarrays. Expression of genes that encode enzymes in the gluconeogenesis pathway and glyoxylate cycle, which produce glucose 6-phophate and its derivatives, was up-regulated in YAB103. Up-regulation of these genes suppressed the drug sensitivity of the TIY20 strain. Furthermore, we found that YAB103 had a thicker cell-wall due to an increase in glucan content.

        "abstract": "Epipodophyllotoxins are effective antitumour drugs that trap eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II in a covalent complex with DNA. Based on DNA cleavage assays, the mode of interaction of these drugs was proposed to involve amino acid residues of the catalytic site. An in vitro binding study, however, revealed two potential binding sites for etoposide within human DNA topoisomerase II\u03b1 (htopoII\u03b1), one in the catalytic core of the enzyme and one in the ATP-binding N-terminal domain. Here we have tested how N-terminal mutations that reduce the affinity of the site for etoposide or ATP affect the sensitivity of yeast cells to etoposide. Surprisingly, when introduced into full-length enzymes, mutations that lower the drug binding capacity of the N-terminal domain in vitro render yeast more sensitive to epipodophyllotoxins. Consistently, when the htopoII\u03b1 N-terminal domain alone is overexpressed in the presence of yeast topoII, cells become more resistant to etoposide. Point mutations that weaken etoposide binding eliminate this resistance phenotype. We argue that the N-terminal ATP-binding pocket competes with the active site of the holoenzyme for binding etoposide both in cis and in trans with different outcomes, suggesting that each topoisomerase II monomer has two non-equivalent drug-binding sites.",

However, most inhibitors of kinases or other cancer targets result in polypharmacological effects, which complicate the identification of target dependencies directly from the drug-response phenotypes. In this study, we developed a chemical systems biology approach that integrates comprehensive drug sensitivity and selectivity profiling to provide functional insights into both single and multi-target oncogenic signal addictions. When applied to 21 breast cancer cell lines, perturbed with 40 kinase inhibitors, the subtype-specific addiction patterns clustered in agreement with patient-derived subtypes, while showing considerable variability between the heterogeneous breast cancers. Experimental validation of the top predictions revealed a number of co-dependencies between kinase targets that led to unexpected synergistic combinations between their inhibitors, such as dasatinib and axitinib in the triple-negative basal-like HCC1937 cell line.",

The BChE KO mouse cannot tolerate standard doses of the muscle relaxant succinylcholine or the Alzheimer's disease drugs huperzine A and donepezil. It is resistant to the asthma drug bambuterol. The importance of BChE in detoxication of cocaine has been demonstrated by hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity in cocaine-challenged BChE KO mice. The BChE KO mouse becomes obese on a high-fat diet, suggesting a role for BChE in fat metabolism. BChE serves as a backup for acetylcholinesterase by hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in acetylcholinesterase knockout mice. Imaging studies show that BChE injected intrathecally crosses the blood-brain barrier. Mice, but not humans, have carboxylesterase in their blood. Carboxylesterase obscures the role of BChE in detoxication of organophosphorus pesticides. Future studies will make a double knockout that has neither BChE nor carboxylesterase. The double knockout is expected to be unusually sensitive to the toxicity of organophosphorus pesticides. Knowledge of drug sensitivities in the mouse model of human BChE deficiency will aid in understanding adverse drug effects in humans.",

DCA specifically acted on cells with mitochondrial respiratory defect to reverse paclitaxel resistance. DCA could not effectively activate oxidative respiration in drug-resistant cells, but induced higher levels of citrate accumulation, which led to inhibition of glycolysis and inactivation of P-glycoprotein.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The abilityof DCA to target cells with mitochondrial respiratory defect and restore paclitaxel sensitivity by inducing citrate accumulation supports further preclinical development.",

        "abstract": "Widely used chemical genetic screens have greatly facilitated the identification of many antiviral agents. However, the regions of interaction and inhibitory mechanisms of many therapeutic candidates have yet to be elucidated. Previous chemical screens identified Daclatasvir (BMS-790052) as a potent nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with an unclear inhibitory mechanism. Here we have developed a quantitative high-resolution genetic (qHRG) approach to systematically map the drug-protein interactions between Daclatasvir and NS5A and profile genetic barriers to Daclatasvir resistance. We implemented saturation mutagenesis in combination with next-generation sequencing technology to systematically quantify the effect of every possible amino acid substitution in the drug-targeted region (domain IA of NS5A) on replication fitness and sensitivity to Daclatasvir. This enabled determination of the residues governing drug-protein interactions. The relative fitness and drug sensitivity profiles also provide a comprehensive reference of the genetic barriers for all possible single amino acid changes during viral evolution, which we utilized to predict clinical outcomes using mathematical models. We envision that this high-resolution profiling methodology will be useful for next-generation drug development to select drugs with higher fitness costs to resistance, and also for informing the rational use of drugs based on viral variant spectra from patients.",

Advancing on our studies of EVs in triple-negative breast cancer, here we more comprehensively analysed isogenic cell line variants and their EV populations, tissues cell line variants and their EV populations, as well as breast tumour and normal tissues. Profiling 384 miRNAs showed EV miRNA content to be highly representative of their cells of origin. miRNAs most substantially down-regulated in aggressive cells and their EVs originated from 14q32. Analysis of miR-134, the most substantially down-regulated miRNA, supported its clinical relevance in breast tumours compared to matched normal breast tissue. Functional studies indicated that miR-134 controls STAT5B which, in turn, controls Hsp90. miR-134 delivered by direct transfection into Hs578Ts(i)8 cells (in which it was greatly down-regulated) reduced STAT5B, Hsp90, and Bcl-2 levels, reduced cellular proliferation, and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Delivery via miR-134-enriched EVs also reduced STAT5B and Hsp90, reduced cellular migration and invasion, and enhanced sensitivity to anti-Hsp90 drugs. While the differing effects achieved by transfection or EV delivery are likely to be, at least partly, due to specific amounts of miR-134 delivered by these routes, these EV-based studies identified miRNA-134 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic for breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Molecular profiling of markers involved in the activity of chemotherapeutic agents can shed light on the successes and failures of treatment in patients and can also provide a basis for individualization of therapy. Toward those ends, we have used reverse-phase protein lysate microarrays to evaluate expression of protein components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways. Those pathways strongly influence the anticancer activities of numerous drugs, including those that are the focus here, cisplatin and ecteinascidin 743 (Et-743; Yondelis, Trabectedin). Cisplatin is generally more active in cell types deficient in NER, whereas Et-743 tends to be less active in those cells. We measured protein expression and sensitivity to those drugs in 17 human ovarian and colon cancer cell lines (13 of them from the NCI-60 panel) and five xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patient cell types, each containing a different NER defect. Of the NER proteins giving reliable signals, XPF and XPG showed the highest correlations of protein expression with drug activity across all three tissue-of-origin groups. When we compared protein expression data with mRNA expression data from Affymetrix U133A chips, we found no consistent correlation between the two across the cell lines studied, which reinforces the conclusion that protein measurements can give more interpretable mechanistic information than can transcript measurements. The work reported here provides motivation for larger proteomic studies with more cell types focused on potential biomarkers in additional pharmacologically pertinent pathways.",

Eighteen trypanosome isolates collected from cattle during this period were characterised in cattle, goats and mice for their sensitivity to homidium, isometamidium and diminazene; 10 of the isolates were selected randomly, 8 were from animals that had the highest serum isometamidium concentrations at the time the isolates were collected. All the isolates contained only Trypanosoma brucei and/or T. vivax. In na??ve Boran (Bos indicus) cattle the isolates exhibited low pathogenicity and were sensitive to diminazene aceturate at 3.5 mg/kg body weight (bw) and isometamidium chloride at 0.5 mg/kg bw. In goats, 5 of 8 isolates were highly pathogenic, producing clinical signs indicative of central nervous system involvement within 60 days of infection; all such isolates contained T. brucei. However, all 8 populations were sensitive in goats to diminazene aceturate at 3.5 mg/kg bw. In contrast, 4 populations were refractory to treatment with isometamidium chloride at 0.5 mg/kg bw in at least 1 out of 3 goats each. Furthermore, 5 populations were refractory to treatment with homidium chloride at 1.0 mg/kg bw in a minimum of 2 out of 3 goats each. In mice, the 50% curative dose values for 11 Mukono isolates that contained T. brucei ranged from 0.30 to 1.89 mg/kg bw for diminazene aceturate, from 0.02 to 0.17 mg/kg bw for isometamidium chloride and from 0.90 to 4.57 mg/kg bw for homidium chloride. Thus, by comparison to reference drug-sensitive populations, all the stabilates were highly sensitive to diminazene and isometamidium, while some expressed low levels of resistance to homidium. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have the potential to predict interindividual differences in drug metabolism capacity and drug response. However, it remains uncertain whether human iPSC-derived HLCs can reproduce the interindividual difference in hepatic metabolism and drug response. We found that cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism capacity and drug responsiveness of the primary human hepatocytes (PHH)-iPS-HLCs were highly correlated with those of PHHs, suggesting that the PHH-iPS-HLCs retained donor-specific CYP metabolism capacity and drug responsiveness. We also demonstrated that the interindividual differences, which are due to the diversity of individual SNPs in the CYP gene, could also be reproduced in PHH-iPS-HLCs. We succeeded in establishing, to our knowledge, the first PHH-iPS-HLC panel that reflects the interindividual differences of hepatic drug-metabolizing capacity and drug responsiveness.",

        "abstract": "Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme capable of catalyzing protein cross-links. TG2-dependent cross-links are important in extracellular matrix integrity and it has been proposed that this TG2 activity establishes a barrier to tumor spread. Furthermore, TG2 controls sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Both doxorubicin sensitivity and TG2 expression are highly variable in cultured human breast cancer cell lines and inspection of the human gene (termed TGM2) determined that a canonical CpG island exists within its 5' flank. These features, when combined with its potential tumor suppressor activity, make TG2 an attractive candidate for epigenetic silencing. Consistent with this, we observed that culturing breast tumor cells with the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azadC) resulted in a robust increase in TG2 expression. Analysis of DNA harvested from cultured lines and primary breast tumor samples indicated that TGM2 often displays aberrant hypermethylation and that there is a statistically significant correlation between gene methylation and reduced expression. Finally, we observed that doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells do not show TGM2 silencing but that doxorubicin-sensitive MCF-7 cells do and that culturing MCF-7 cells on 5-azadC and subsequently restoring TG2 expression reduced sensitivity to doxorubicin. This work indicates that the TGM2 gene is a target for epigenetic silencing in breast cancer and suggests that this aberrant molecular event is a potential marker for chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "The t(12;21) (p13;q22) translocation resulting in ETV6/RUNX1 (previously named TEL/AML1) gene fusion is present in about 25% of children with precursor B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We successfully tested 275 precursor B-ALL samples from children aged 1 to 17 years to determine the relation between t(12;21) and in vitro cellular drug resistance, measured by the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA). Samples from 83 patients (30%) were positive for t(12;21). The ETV6/RUNX1(+) samples were significantly more sensitive than ETV6/RUNX1(-) samples to doxorubicin, etoposide, amsacrine, and dexamethasone, whereas the opposite was true for cytarabine. After matching for unevenly distributed patient characteristics, that is, excluding patients with high hyperdiploidy (> 51 chromosomes), t(9; 22), t(1;19), or 11q23 rearrangement, the ETV6/RUNX1(+) samples remained significantly more sensitive to doxorubicin (P = .001) and etoposide (P = .001). For the other drugs tested (amsacrine, cytarabine, dexamethasone, prednisolone, vincristine, 6-thioguanine, and 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide), no significant difference in cellular drug sensitivity was found. In conclusion, we found that the presence of the t(12;21) translocation in childhood precursor B-ALL is associated with a high tumor cell sensitivity to doxorubicin and etoposide. High throughput techniques should now be used to elucidate the cellular mechanisms by which ETV6/RUNX1 gene fusion is linked to increased sensitivity to these drugs.",

Simple assays to monitor parasite drug response in direct patient samples (ex vivo) can detect drug resistance before it becomes clinically apparent, and can inform changes in treatment policy to prevent the spread of resistance.\\n\\nMETHODS: Parasite drug responses to amodiaquine, artemisinin, chloroquine and mefloquine were tested in approximately 400 Plasmodium falciparum malaria infections in Thi\u00e8s, Senegal between 2008 and 2011 using a DAPI-based ex vivo drug resistance assay. Drug resistance-associated mutations were also genotyped in pfcrt and pfmdr1.\\n\\nRESULTS: Parasite drug responses changed between 2008 and 2011, as parasites became less sensitive to amodiaquine, artemisinin and chloroquine over time. The prevalence of known resistance-associated mutations also changed over time. Decreased amodiaquine sensitivity was associated with sustained, highly prevalent mutations in pfcrt, and one mutation in pfmdr1 - Y184F - was associated with decreased parasite sensitivity to artemisinin.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Directly measuring ex vivo parasite drug response and resistance mutation genotyping over time are useful tools for monitoring parasite drug responses in field samples. Furthermore, these data suggest that the use of amodiaquine and artemisinin derivatives in combination therapies is selecting for increased drug tolerance within this population.",

        "abstract": "The innate genetic variability characteristic of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection makes drug resistance a concern in the clinical development of HCV inhibitors. To address this, a transient replication assay was developed to evaluate the replication fitness and the drug sensitivity of NS5B sequences isolated from the sera of patients with chronic HCV infection. This novel assay directly compares replication between NS5B isolates, thus bypassing the potential sequence and metabolic differences which may arise with independent replicon cell lines. Patient-derived NS5B sequences were similar to those of the established HCV genotypes, but isolates from each patient shared genetic variability specific to that patient, with additional genetic variability observed across the individual isolates. Every sample provided functional NS5B isolates which supported subgenomic replication, frequently to levels comparable to that of laboratory-optimized replicons. All isolates were equivalently sensitive to an active-site nucleoside inhibitor, but the sensitivities to a panel of nonnucleoside inhibitors which targeted three distinct sites on NS5B varied among the isolates. In con1, the original laboratory-optimized replicon, the NS5B S282T substitution confers resistance to the nucleoside inhibitor but impairs replication. This substitution was engineered into both genotype 1a and genotype 1b isolates. Replication was severely debilitated, demonstrating that no compensatory residues were encoded within these genetically diverse sequences to increase the replication fitness of the mutated replicons. This work describes a transient replicon-based assay that can support the clinical development of compounds which target NS5B and demonstrates its utility by examining several patient-derived NS5B isolates for replication fitness and differential sensitivity to NS5B inhibitors.",

It is also part of the TFIIH transcription complex and is required for the association of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) subcomplex with TFIIH. Using the NCI-60 panel of human tumor cell lines, we had shown that the ERCC2 gene variant Gln(751) was significantly associated to increased taxanes sensitivity and decreased ERCC2 gene expression. Since TFIIH is involved in both DNA repair and cell cycle progression, we hypothesized that quantitative or qualitative ERCC2 alterations might cause CAK liberation, allowing its activation of the G(2)/M transition. Enhancing mitosis entry would lead to hypersensitivity to spindle poisons, explaining the effect of ERCC2 polymorphisms on taxane sensitivity. Starting from ERCC2-deficient XP6BE, we generated several isogenic clones differing only by the Lys751Gln variation. Wild-type and variant ERCC2-expressing clones recovered ultraviolet radiation and cisplatin resistance but presented similar sensitivity to paclitaxel, demonstrating that the amino acid change was not involved in paclitaxel differential sensitivity in the NCI-60 panel. Using small interfering RNA approach, we knocked down ERCC2 expression and observed a block in the G(2)/M phase, with a consistent increase in paclitaxel sensitivity and no change in cisplatin sensitivity. We observed in addition an increase in CDK1 activity, as evaluated by histone H1 phosphorylation. We evaluated messenger RNA (mRNA) half-life in the isogenic lines and observed a more rapid degradation in cells bearing the variant construct. We concluded that the increased paclitaxel sensitivity of ERCC2 variant cell lines is a consequence of lower gene expression, likely due to decreased stability of the variant ERCC2 mRNA.",

If true, drug treatment might promote the evolution of more virulent parasites (defined here as those doing more harm to hosts). Drug-resistance mechanisms that protect parasites through interactions with drug molecules at the sub-cellular level are well known. However, parasite phenotypes associated with virulence might also help parasites survive in the presence of drugs. For example, rapidly replicating parasites might be better able to recover in the host if drug treatment fails to eliminate parasites. We quantified the effects of drug treatment on the in-host survival and between-host transmission of rodent malaria (Plasmodium chabaudi) parasites which differed in virulence and had never been previously exposed to drugs. In all our treatment regimens and in single- and mixed-genotype infections, virulent parasites were less sensitive to pyrimethamine and artemisinin, the two antimalarial drugs we tested. Virulent parasites also achieved disproportionately greater transmission when exposed to pyrimethamine. Overall, our data suggest that drug treatment can select for more virulent parasites. Drugs targeting transmission stages (such as artemisinin) may minimize the evolutionary advantage of virulence in drug-treated infections.",

Objectives: This study was conducted to observe dominant organisms causing UTI in tribal community of Medinipur, West Bengal, India and evaluate their sensitivity to common antibiotics. Patients and Methods: A total number of 4,416 urine samples of clinically suspected UTI attending outpatient department and hospitalized tribal patients of West Medinipur zone were collected. Urine samples were inoculated on Blood agar, MacConkey's agar, and cystine lactose electrolyte deficient (CLED) agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hr and extended up to 48 hr in cases of negative growth. Antibiotic susceptibility testing against the most common causative bacteria was also performed. Results: A total number of 1,190 samples revealed positive bacterial growth. Seven types of dominant organisms were isolated as causative agents like Escherichia coli (63.44%), Klebsiella sp. (14.62%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.53%), Proteus sp. (4.62%), other Gram negative bacteria (5.79%), Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Streptococci (5.21%), and other Enterococcus sp. (1.76%). E. coli was the most common pathogen of UTI in tribal population with female susceptibility predominantly more than male patients. Among16 antibiotics, amikacin (14.30%) and meropenem (12.0%) were shown to be the most sensitive to and Tobramycin (0.66%) the least effective on E. coli. Conclusions: Females are more susceptible to UTI than males and the most effective drug (sensitive against isolated E. coli) is Amikacin. Therefore, culture and antimicrobial drug sensitivity testing are essential procedures for proper management of UTI in tribal population.",

Deregulation in intracellular transduction pathways generates mitogenic signals that promote abnormal cell growth and the acquisition of an undifferentiated phenotype. Genetic abnormalities in cancer have been widely studied to identify those factors predictive of tumor progression, survival, and response to chemotherapeutic agents. Pharmacogenetics has been founded as a science to examine the genetic basis of interindividual variation in drug metabolism, drug targets, and transporters, which result in differences in the efficacy and safety of many therapeutic agents. The traditional pharmacogenetic approach relies on studying sequence variations in candidate genes suspected of affecting drug response. However, these studies have yielded contradictory results because of the small number of molecular determinants of drug response examined, and in several cases this approach was revealed to be reductionistic. This limitation is now being overcome by the use of novel techniques, i.e., high-density DNA and protein arrays, which allow genome- and proteome-wide tumor profiling. Pharmacogenomics represents the natural evolution of pharmacogenetics since it addresses, on a genome-wide basis, the effect of the sum of genetic variants on drug responses of individuals. Development of pharmacogenomics as a new field has accelerated the progress in drug discovery by the identification of novel therapeutic targets by expression profiling at the genomic or proteomic levels. In addition to this, pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics provide an important opportunity to select patients who may benefit from the administration of specific agents that best match the genetic profile of the disease, thus allowing maximum activity.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a key step in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, is incompletely understood. Current models emphasize the role of BH3-only BCL2 family members in BAX and BAK activation. Here we demonstrate concentration-dependent BAK autoactivation under cell-free conditions and provide evidence that this autoactivation plays a key role in regulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in intact cells. In particular, we show that up to 80% of BAK (but not BAX) in lymphohematopoietic cell lines is oligomerized and bound to anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members in the absence of exogenous death stimuli. The extent of this constitutive BAK oligomerization is diminished by BAK knockdown and unaffected by BIM or PUMA down-regulation. Further analysis indicates that sensitivity of cells to BH3 mimetics reflects the identity of the anti-apoptotic proteins to which BAK is constitutively bound, with extensive BCLXL*BAK complexes predicting navitoclax sensitivity, and extensive MCL1*BAK complexes predicting A1210477 sensitivity. Moreover, high BAK expression correlates with sensitivity of clinical acute myelogenous leukemia to chemotherapy, whereas low BAK levels correlate with resistance and relapse. Collectively, these results inform current understanding of MOMP and provide new insight into the ability of BH3 mimetics to induce apoptosis without directly activating BAX or BAK.",

Application of modern machine learning approaches to pharmacogenomic datasets have demonstrated the ability to infer genomic predictors of compound sensitivity. Such modeling approaches entail many analytical design choices; however, a systematic study evaluating the relative performance attributable to each design choice is not yet available. In this work, we evaluated over 110,000 different models, based on a multifactorial experimental design testing systematic combinations of modeling factors within several categories of modeling choices, including: type of algorithm, type of molecular feature data, compound being predicted, method of summarizing compound sensitivity values, and whether predictions are based on discretized or continuous response values. Our results suggest that model input data (type of molecular features and choice of compound) are the primary factors explaining model performance, followed by choice of algorithm. Our results also provide a statistically principled set of recommended modeling guidelines, including: using elastic net or ridge regression with input features from all genomic profiling platforms, most importantly, gene expression features, to predict continuous-valued sensitivity scores summarized using the area under the dose response curve, with pathway targeted compounds most likely to yield the most accurate predictors. In addition, our study provides a publicly available resource of all modeling results, an open source code base, and experimental design for researchers throughout the community to build on our results and assess novel methodologies or applications in related predictive modeling problems.",

The knowledge of organism commonly causative of CAP helps in early empirical treatment initiation. AIM: To study the microbiological profile of patients with community acquired pneumonia and to study drug sensitivity pattern. METHODS: Hospital based cross sectional study among 100 patients with CAP was conducted in a tertiary care hospital of Southern India. Sputum culture showed that out of 100 patients 39 had an identifiable etiology with 12 patients having evidence of mixed infection. RESULT: Micro-organisms isolated in sputum culture were Streptococcus pneumoniae (31%) followed by, Pseudomonas pyogens (15%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13%). AFB smear was found to be positive in 6 patients. Organisms were found to be sensitive for piperacillin plus tazobactum (41%), aminoglycocides (amikacin-46%, gentamicin-31%), third generation cephalosporins (Cefotaxim-36%, Ceftriaxone-18%) and macrolides (Erythromicin-31%, Azithromycin-18%). Sensitivity to chloramphenicol was observed in 31% sputum culture positive patients. Ciprofloxacin sensitivity was seen among 49%. CONCLUSION: Most of the organisms were found to be sensitive to monotherapy with extended spectrum beta lactamases, third generation cephalosporins, fluroquinolones, macrolides.",

Mutant spectrum analyses and kinetics of virus production in the absence and presence of drugs indicate that resistance is not due to the presence of drug-resistance mutations in the mutant spectrum of the initial or passaged populations, but to increased replicative fitness acquired during passage. Fitness increase did not alter host factors that lead to shutoff of general host cell protein synthesis and preferential translation of HCV RNA. The results imply viral replicative fitness as a mechanism of multidrug resistance in HCV.\\n\\nIMPORTANCE: Viral drug resistance is usually attributed to the presence of amino acid substitutions in the protein targeted by the drug. In the present study with HCV we show that high viral replicative fitness can confer a general drug resistance phenotype to the virus. The results exclude that genomes with drug resistance mutations are responsible for the observed phenotype. The fact that replicative fitness can be a determinant of multidrug resistance may explain why in prolonged chronic HCV infections that favor replicative fitness increase, the virus is less sensitive to drug treatments.",

A useful in vitro method to evaluate individual chemosensitivity is required to select effective anti-cancer drugs. This study aimed to establish in vitro tumor response testing for malignant melanoma. We determined the chemosensitivity of primary cultured melanoma cells using the collagen gel droplet-embedded culture drug sensitivity test (CD-DST). Nineteen tests were carried out for 15 cases of malignant melanoma. Primary cultured melanoma cells in collagen gel droplets were exposed to anti-cancer drugs, including cisplatin, adriamycin, dacarbazine, nimustine and vincristine. After a 7-day incubation in a serum-free medium, living melanoma cells in a collagen droplet were detected by image analysis after staining with Neutral red reagent. In vitro drug exposure conditions were determined to reproduce the value of the plasma area under the time-drug concentration curve in vivo. The rate of evaluation of the primary culture of melanoma cells was 78.9% (15/19 tests). The chemosensitivity of cisplatin, adriamycin, dacarbazine, nimustine and vincristine was 15, 62, 0, 0 and 62%, respectively. Dacarbazine was not suitable for CD-DST due to its prodrug characteristics. The CD-DST method was able to evaluate the chemosensitivity of malignant melanoma to anti-cancer drugs in vitro. This method can also be applied to estimate the efficacy of newly developed anti-cancer drugs in vitro.",

        "abstract": "Single cell analysis has allowed critical discoveries in drug testing, immunobiology and stem cell research. In addition, a change from two to three dimensional growth conditions radically affects cell behavior. This already resulted in new observations on gene expression and communication networks and in better predictions of cell responses to their environment. However, it is still difficult to study the size and shape of single cells that are freely suspended, where morphological changes are highly significant. Described here is a new method for quantitative real time monitoring of cell size and morphology, on single live suspended cancer cells, unconfined in three dimensions. The precision is comparable to that of the best optical microscopes, but, in contrast, there is no need for confining the cell to the imaging plane. The here first introduced cell magnetorotation (CM) method is made possible by nanoparticle induced cell magnetization. By using a rotating magnetic field, the magnetically labeled cell is actively rotated, and the rotational period is measured in real-time. A change in morphology induces a change in the rotational period of the suspended cell (e.g. when the cell gets bigger it rotates slower). The ability to monitor, in real time, cell swelling or death, at the single cell level, is demonstrated. This method could thus be used for multiplexed real time single cell morphology analysis, with implications for drug testing, drug discovery, genomics and three-dimensional culturing.",

The development of reliable high-throughput technologies is clearly a prerequisite for the industrial implementation of 3-D models. In this study the robustness of spherical microtissue production and drug testing in a 96-well hanging-drop multiwell plate format was assessed on a standard 96-well channel robotic platform. Microtissue models derived from six different cell lines were produced and characterized according to their growth profile and morphology displaying high-density tissue-like reformation and growth over at least 15 days. The colon cancer cell line HCT116 was chosen as a model to assess microtissue-based assay reproducibility. Within three individual production batches the size variations of the produced microtissues were below 5%. Reliability of the microtissue-based assay was tested using two reference compounds, staurosporine and chlorambucil. In four independent drug testings the calculated IC(50) values were benchmarked against 2-D multiwell testings displaying similar consistency. The technology presented here for the automated production of a variety of microtissues for efficacy testing in a standard 96-well format will aid the implementation of more organotypic models at an early time point in the drug discovery process.",

The flow cytometric (FCM) detection of apoptosis was used to det. the in vitro sensitivity of tumor cells obtained at surgery to 30 different kinds of anticancer agents.  From the results of FCM assay, an in vitro best regimen was prospectively selected.  All the patients concurrently received the individualized chemotherapy with the in vitro best regimen and 60 Gy of conventional radiation therapy.  Of the 31 assessable patients, eight patients (26%) achieved partial response, and 20 patients (65%) had stable disease.  The median survival time was 20.5 mo.

MDR-1 was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a boy who initially developed SRNS at 3years, we observed MDR-1 expression over 3years. Maximal and minimal MDR-1 expression were 90,000 and 7800 copies/\u00b5g RNA, respectively. In a 4-year-old boy who initially developed SRNS at 3years, we determined MDR-1 expression over 2years. Maximal and minimal MDR-1 expression were 42,000 and 6900, respectively. MDR-1 evaluation requires determination of MDR-1 expression at several time points in a clinical course. Establishment of a normal expression may be needed for each individual patient. Increasing MDR-1 during remission was followed soon by recurrences, an observation that may be a guide for therapeutic choice. LDL influences a humoral factor involved in MDR-1 expression. Both patients responded to LDL adsorption therapy because of elevated LDL levels. While cyclosporine A therapy gradually decreased MDR-1 expression, LDL adsorption therapy decreased expression sharply. Based on the results of the present study, LDL adsorption therapy could contribute to the amelioration of drug sensitivity for immunosuppressants including corticosteroids via inhibitory effects on MDR-1 expression.",

MCF-7DoxR and MCF-7MDR1 were broadly cross-resistant to natural product anticancer agents, whereas MCF-7TaxR cells were not, contrary to P-gp expression. Whilst DEP revealed modest membrane changes in MDR sub-lines, we saw significant changes in their cytoplasmic conductivity: MCF-7TaxR < MCF-7 < MCF-7MDR1 < MCF-7DoxR (range 0.14-0.40\u00a0S/m). Cytoplasmic conductivity is affected by the movement of molecules e.g. as in intracellular trafficking MCF-7TaxR showed a reduced membrane potential, whereas MCF-7DoxR and MCF-7MDR1 showed an increase. Thus, altered membrane potential is associated with an MDR phenotype, but in a complex manner. DEP data suggest a model whereby relative increases in cytoplasmic conductivity are correlated with MDR, whilst relative decreases equate with a sensitised phenotype e.g. MCF-7TaxR. Moreover, extent of anthracycline accumulation was inversely related to cytoplasmic conductivity. These data are representative of a model where drug sensitivity is associated with low ionic conductance (reduced cellular trafficking and ion transport) and substantial anthracycline accumulation. For classical MDR i.e. MCF-7MDR1, we saw the reverse picture. Thus, the drug resistance phenotypes of this panel of MCF-7 lines can be delineated by assessment of cytoplasmic biophysical properties using DEP. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Sanitization of the cellular nucleotide pools from mutagenic base analogues is necessary for the accuracy of transcription and replication of genetic material and plays a substantial role in cancer prevention. The undesirable mutagenic, recombinogenic, and toxic incorporation of purine base analogues [i.e., ITP, dITP, XTP, dXTP, or 6-hydroxylaminopurine (HAP) deoxynucleoside triphosphate] into nucleic acids is prevented by inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA). The ITPA gene is a highly conserved, moderately expressed gene. Defects in ITPA orthologs in model organisms cause severe sensitivity to HAP and chromosome fragmentation. A human polymorphic allele, 94C???A, encodes for the enzyme with a P32T amino acid change and leads to accumulation of non-hydrolyzed ITP. ITPase activity is not detected in erythrocytes of these patients. The P32T polymorphism has also been associated with adverse sensitivity to purine base analogue drugs. We have found that the ITPA-P32T mutant is a dimer in solution, as is wild-type ITPA, and has normal ITPA activity in vitro, but the melting point of ITPA-P32T is 5????C lower than that of wild-type. ITPA-P32T is also fully functional in vivo in model organisms as determined by a HAP mutagenesis assay and its complementation of a bacterial ITPA defect. The amount of ITPA protein detected by Western blot is severely diminished in a human fibroblast cell line with the 94C???A change. We propose that the P32T mutation exerts its effect in certain human tissues by cumulative effects of destabilization of transcripts, protein stability, and availability. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to investigate the sensitivity of cancer cells to antimitotic agents, we developed a cross-linked HA hydrogel, a three-dimensional matrix in which cells can invade and grow. We have studied three cell lines (SA87, NCI-H460 and H460M), from primary tumors and metastases, that migrated into the HA hydrogel and proliferated giving rise to clusters and colonies. Concurrently, we studied the growth of these cell lines in a usual monolayer culture system. In these two models, increasing concentrations of doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil were evaluated for their ability to inhibit tumor cell growth and colony formation. Taken together, our data suggest that the cancer cells were more resistant in the three-dimensional model than in monolayer cell systems. The antimitotic drugs were efficient after 24 h of treatment in the monolayer cultures, whereas they were significantly efficient only after one week of incubation in the HA hydrogels. Herein, we show that this cross-linked matrix provides a three-dimensional model particularly appropriate for investigating mechanisms involved in cancer cell line sensitivity to antimitotic drugs. ?? 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.",

        "abstract": "Live cell mass profiling is a promising new approach for rapidly quantifying responses to therapeutic agents through picogram-scale changes in cell mass over time. A significant barrier in mass profiling is the inability of existing methods to handle pleomorphic cellular clusters and clumps, which are more commonly present in patient-derived samples or tissue cultures than are isolated single cells. Here we demonstrate automated Live Cell Interferometry (LCI) as a rapid and accurate quantifier of the sensitivity of single cell and colony-forming human breast cancer cell lines to the HER2-directed monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin). The relative sensitivities of small samples (<500 cells) of four breast cancer cell lines were determined tens-to-hundreds of times faster than is possible with traditional proliferation assays. These LCI advances in clustered sample assessment and speed open up the possibility for therapeutic response testing of patient-derived solid tumor samples, which are viable only for short periods ex vivo and likely to be in the form of cell aggregates and clusters.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND New oncology drugs are being developed in conjunction with companion diagnostics with approval restricting their use to certain biomarker-positive subgroups. We examined the impact of different predictive biomarker screening techniques and population enrichment criteria on the cost-effectiveness of targeted drugs in lung cancer, using ALK and crizotinib to build the initial model. METHODS Health economic modeling of cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year was based on literature review and expert opinion. The modeled population represented advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), eligible for predictive biomarker screening with prescribing restricted to biomarker-positive patients. RESULTS For assays costing $1400 per person, cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for ALK screening all advanced NSCLC, excluding treatment cost, is $106,707. This falls to $4756 when only a highly enriched population is screened (increasing biomarker frequency from 1.6 to 35.9%). However, the same enrichment involves missing 56% patients who segregate within the unscreened group. Cheaper screening tests that miss some true positives can be more cost-effective if proportional reductions in cost exceed proportion of subjects missed. Generic modeling of idealised screening assays, including treatment cost, reveals a dominant effect of screening cost per person at low biomarker frequencies. Cost-effectiveness of <$100,000 per QALY gained is not achievable at biomarker frequencies <5% (with drug costs $1-5000 per month and screening costs $600-1400 per person). INTERPRETATION Cost-effectiveness of oncology drugs whose prescribing is restricted to biomarker-positive subgroups should address the cost of detecting marker-positive patients. The cost of screening dominates at low frequencies and strategies to improve cost-effectiveness based on the assay cost, drug cost and the group screened should be considered in these scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Kinetoplastid parasites cause lethal diseases in humans and animals. The kinetoplast itself contains the mitochondrial genome, comprising a huge, complex DNA network that is also an important drug target. Isometamidium, for example, is a key veterinary drug that accumulates in the kinetoplast in African trypanosomes. Kinetoplast independence and isometamidium resistance are observed where certain mutations in the F1-\u03b3-subunit of the two-sector F1Fo-ATP synthase allow for Fo-independent generation of a mitochondrial membrane potential. To further explore kinetoplast biology and drug resistance, we screened a genome-scale RNA interference library in African trypanosomes for isometamidium resistance mechanisms. Our screen identified 14 V-ATPase subunits and all 4 adaptin-3 subunits, implicating acidic compartment defects in resistance; V-ATPase acidifies lysosomes and related organelles, whereas adaptin-3 is responsible for trafficking among these organelles. Independent strains with depleted V-ATPase or adaptin-3 subunits were isometamidium resistant, and chemical inhibition of the V-ATPase phenocopied this effect. While drug accumulation in the kinetoplast continued after V-ATPase subunit depletion, acriflavine-induced kinetoplast loss was specifically tolerated in these cells and in cells depleted for adaptin-3 or endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex subunits, also identified in our screen. Consistent with kinetoplast dispensability, V-ATPase defective cells were oligomycin resistant, suggesting ATP synthase uncoupling and bypass of the normal Fo-A6-subunit requirement; this subunit is the only kinetoplast-encoded product ultimately required for viability in bloodstream-form trypanosomes. Thus, we describe 30 genes and 3 protein complexes associated with kinetoplast-dependent growth. Mutations affecting these genes could explain natural cases of dyskinetoplasty and multidrug resistance. Our results also reveal potentially conserved communication between the compartmentalized two-sector rotary ATPases.",

        "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment strongly effects the drug response. Although the advantages of organotypic 3D-cell-culture models are known for years, complex production and readout processes impede the implementation in an industrial setting. This study, presents for the first time a novel multi-well platform in a standard 96-well format to produce organotypic, scaffold-free cancer microtissues models and its implementation in an automated screening process. This technology allows to produce either homotypic or heterotypic tumor microtissues in a hanging-drop culture by liquid top-loading similar to standard 96-well plates. The core piece of the well is a microfluidic channel connecting an inlet funnel at the top and an outlet funnel at the bottom of the plate, where a hanging drop is formed and stabilized by a combination of capillary and surface-tension forces. The use of this technology enables the automated production of microtissues with a very narrow size distribution below 10% on plate and batch-to-batch. 3 cancer microtissue models were developed from two colon cancer and one breast cancer cell lines and characterized in terms of their proliferative capacity and growth characteristics. Process parameters for media exchange, addition of compounds, microtissue-size variances and implementation of cell-based viability assays (ATP, LDH and size) were established. As a proof of concept, a whole screening process using four reference compounds was performed in comparison to classical monolayer cultures underlining the different behavior of both cell-culture models. Finally, four novel compounds that inhibit tumor cell proliferation in monolayer cultures, were tested for their potential in a 3-D system. Overall, we could demonstrate that organotypic microtissues can be implemented into an automated screening process using standard liquid-handling robotics. The use of this system in drug development may strengthen the predictive force of the in-vitro evaluation of novel drug candidates and reduce drug failure in clinics.

However, in breast cancer, it is still controversial whether those molecular markers predict 5-FU sensitivity or not. One possible reason for the difficulty may be the histological heterogeneity in breast cancer specimens. In this study, TS, DPD and TP mRNA expression in 40 breast cancer tumors were semi-quantified separately in cancer cells (Ca), cancerous stroma (Str) and normal glands (Nor) using laser capture microdissection and real time RT-PCR (LCM+RT-PCR). The histoculture drug response assay (HDRA) for 5-FU sensitivity was performed for 22 tumors. TS and TP mRNA expressions were higher in Ca than Str, although DPD gene expression was lower in Ca than Str. The group of high TS and high DPD gene expression in Ca was resistant to 5-FU, and the group of low TS and low DPD gene expression in Ca was sensitive to 5-FU (P=0.048 chi-square test). TS and DPD mRNA expressions measured using LCM + RT-PCR might be useful predictive markers for 5-FU sensitivity in human breast cancer. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is scarce information in the literature about a possible association between atopy and certain clinical manifestations of NSAID sensitivity. OBJECTIVES: (1) To evaluate the prevalence of atopy in patients proved to be sensitive to cyclooxygenase inhibitors. (2) To assess cross-reactivity to two alternative NSAIDs, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nimesulide. METHODS: NSAID-sensitive patients attending an allergy clinic and unselected controls were prick tested with inhalant allergens. Oral challenges with NSAIDs were carried out by the single-blinded (SBOC) method. Clinical data about personal and family history of allergic and atopic diseases were obtained by a careful review of the medical records and by direct questioning by experienced allergists. RESULTS: Fifty patients had positive SBOCs to the suspected NSAID and only these were studied. A personal history of atopic diseases was present in 41 patients (82%) and 7 controls (14.5%), and a family history in 24 patients (48%) and 6 controls (12.5%). Prick skin tests with aeroallergens were positive in 39 of 45 patients tested (86.6%) and in 14 of 48 controls (29.1%), (P = .0001). Skin test positivity rates were higher in patients with cutaneous challenge reactions who responded to only one NSAID (single reactors) in comparison to cross-reactors (P = .04). The most frequent clinical manifestations of NSAID sensitivity were (1) cutaneous (angioedema, urticaria) in 34 patients, (2) blended (cutaneous plus respiratory) in 12, (3) respiratory in 3, and (4) anaphylactoid in 1. Aspirin, pyrazolone, paracetamol, and ibuprofen were the drugs more frequently implicated in these reactions. Cross-sensitivity with paracetamol and nimesulide were 32% and 25%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of atopy is increased in challenge-proven NSAID-intolerant patients. The atopic condition may represent an important risk factor for developing reactions to these drugs. Paracetamol and nimesulide are relatively safe alternative choices in those patients, although their use still carries some risk of unwanted reactions.",

        "abstract": "The prognosis for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) has improved in recent decades. On the other hand, not all patients can be cured with the currently established therapy regimes and this therapy is associated with several adverse late effects. Therefore it is necessary to develop new therapy strategies. After treatment of L-540 HL cells with 5'-azacytidine (5AC), we observed increased expression of the preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME). In addition, we detected an increased resistance of 5AC-treated cells against cytotoxic drugs. We analyzed the influence of PRAME on cell survival of HL cells by knocking down PRAME in the chemotherapy resistant cell line L-428, a cell line that express PRAME at a high level. After knock-down of PRAME using vector based RNA interference we observed increased sensitivity for cisplatin, etoposide and retinoic acid. DNA microarray analysis of HL cells after PRAME knock-down indicated regulation of several genes including down-regulation of known anti-apoptotic factors. Increased retinoic acid signaling in these cells was revealed by increased expression of the retinoic acid metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP26B1), a transcriptional target of retinoic acid signaling. Our data suggest that PRAME inhibits retinoic acid signaling in HL cells and that the knock-down of PRAME might be an interesting option for the development of new therapy strategies for patients with chemo-resistant HL.",

        "abstract": "ABCA1 belongs to the A class of ABC transporter, which is absent in yeast. ABCA1 elicits lipid translocation at the plasma membrane through yet elusive processes. We successfully expressed the mouse Abca1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cloned ABCA1 distributed at the yeast plasma membrane in stable discrete domains that we name MCA (membrane cluster containing ABCA1) and that do not overlap with the previously identified punctate structures MCC (membrane cluster containing Can1p) and MCP (membrane cluster containing Pma1p). By comparison with a nonfunctional mutant, we demonstrated that ABCA1 elicits specific phenotypes in response to compounds known to interact with membrane lipids, such as papuamide B, amphotericin B and pimaricin. The sensitivity of these novel phenotypes to the genetic modification of the membrane lipid composition was studied by the introduction of the cho1 and lcb1-100 mutations involved respectively in phosphatidylserine or sphingolipid biosynthesis in yeast cells. The results, corroborated by the analysis of equivalent mammalian mutant cell lines, demonstrate that membrane composition, in particular its phosphatidylserine content, influences the function of the transporter. We thus have reconstituted in yeast the essential functions associated to the expression of ABCA1 in mammals and characterized new physiological phenotypes prone to genetic analysis.

We present here a new ES cell line, SS-ES-1, established from the left thoracic tumor of a 16-year-old female patient. The SS-ES-1 cells retained genotype, morphology, and growth rate for over 150 passages. Immunocytochemical staining showed the strong immunoreactivity for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, neurofilament, CD99, P53, Ki-67, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha), and Bcl-2, but no reactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein, epidermal growth factor receptor, and HER-2/neu. The presence of the type 1 EWS/FLI-1 fusion transcripts was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. On the basis of the MTT assay results, GW2974, a dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-2/neu, exhibited only a weak cytotoxic response in SS-ES-1 cells. In contrast, tyrphostin A9, a specific inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptor, had a high cytotoxic effect against these cells. Surprisingly, it was found that SS-ES-1 cells displayed a high sensitivity to 4OH-tamoxifen. In conclusion, the SS-ES-1 cell line shows unique cellular properties, which makes it a useful model for studying various aspects of the biology of ES. In addition, the results suggest that ER can be a good therapeutic target for ER + ES.",

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an emerging model system for studying the cardiac conduction system. However, real-time recording of the electrocardiogram remains a challenge. In the present study, we assessed the feasibility of recording electrical cardiogram (ECG) signals from the zebrafish larvae using the micropipette electrodes, and demonstrated the dynamic changes in ECG signals and their sensitivity to Amiodarone during the developmental stages. We observed that ECG signals revealed P waves and QRS complexes at 7 days postfertilization (dpf). T waves started to develop at 14 dpf. Distinct P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves were similar to those of adult zebrafish at 35 dpf, accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in QRS intervals (from 256 \u00b1 16 ms at 7 dpf to 54 \u00b1 6 ms, p < 0.01, n = 5). In response to Amiodarone, ECG signals showed QRS prolongation from 7 to 35 dpf (p < 0.05, n = 5). Hence, micropipette electrodes can be applied to detect evolving ECG signals from the developing zebrafish larvae, thus providing a noninvasive and nonparalyzing approach to investigate cardiac conduction phenotypes in response to genetic, epigenetic, or pharmacologic perturbation.",

        "abstract": "The progeroid Werner's syndrome (WS) represents the best current model of human aging. It is caused by loss of the WRN helicase/exonuclease, resulting in high levels of replication fork stalling and genomic instability. Current models suggest that characteristic WS phenotypes of poor S phase progression, low proliferative capacity, and drug hypersensitivity are the result of accumulation of alternative DNA structures at stalled or collapsed forks during DNA replication, and Holliday junction resolution has been shown to enhance survival of cis-platin-treated WS cells. Here, we present a direct test of the hypothesis that the replication/repair defect in unstressed WS cells is the result of an inability to resolve recombination intermediates. We have created isogenic WS cell lines expressing a nuclear-targeted bacterial Holliday junction endonuclease, RusA, and show that Holliday junction resolution by RusA restores DNA replication capacity in primary WS fibroblasts and enhances their proliferation. Furthermore, RusA expression rescues WS fibroblast hypersensitivity to replication fork blocking agents camptothecin and 4NQO, suggesting that the hypersensitivity is caused by inappropriate recombination at DNA structures formed when the replication fork arrests or collapses at 4NQO- or camptothecin-induced lesions. This work is the first to demonstrate that Holliday junction accumulation in primary Werner syndrome fibroblasts results in their poor proliferative capacity, and to rescue WS hypersensitivity to camptothecin and 4NQO by Holliday junction resolution.",

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the in vitro effectiveness of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to render rat fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) susceptible to drugs. We also attempted the electroporation-mediated transfer of siRNA against multidrug resistance (MDR) genes into rat knee joints. METHODS: FLS were transfected with siRNAs corresponding to MDR1a and MDR1b genes. FLS were treated with dexamethasone (DEX) and lipopolysaccharide. The mRNA and protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta were measured. Both siRNAs were co-transduced into rat knee joints by an electroporation method and evaluated the target gene expressions in the synovium. RESULTS: Each siRNA could sequence-specifically reduce the target gene expression by over 70% and effectively suppressed P-gp expression and function in the FLS. Both gene expression and protein production of the inflammatory cytokines in the cells transfected with siRNA were reduced by a greater amount compared to in control cells. The in vivo electroporation-mediated transduction of siRNA could significantly inhibit the target gene expressions. CONCLUSIONS: MDR1a/1b gene silencing by siRNA could effectively inhibit P-gp in rat FLS, resulting in a significant enhancement of the anti-inflammatory effects of DEX. The in vivo siRNA transduction could successfully silence MDR gene expression in the rat synovium. These findings indicate that the siRNA targeting MDR gene could be a useful tool for treating refractory arthritis in RA.",

        "abstract": "A novel three-dimensional cell culture system was constructed with an array of cell panels (4 x 5) in a silicon chip, together with multi-channel drug containers. Human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells were embedded in a collagen-gel matrix and entrapped in a pyramidal-shaped silicon hole. Each cell panel can be isolated by a channel composed of a microfluid part and a reservoir. A cell panel was exposed to 200 mm KCN for 2 days to demonstrate that each cell panel could be independently evaluated under various stimulation conditions. Based on the cellular respiration activity, the proliferation behavior was continuously monitored on the silicon-based cell array for 5 days using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The cells entrapped in the device (3-D culture) proliferated normally, and the proliferation rate was lower than that of cells grown in a monolayer cell culture (2-D culture). The effects of three anticancer drugs measured simultaneously on the cell chip were in good agreement with those obtained by a conventional colorimetric assay. Our results suggest that the silicon-based device for 3D culture is appropriate for a chemosensitivity assay involving multi-chemical stimulation.",

        "abstract": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification of the mammalian genome that occurs predominantly at cytosine residues of the CpG dinucleotide. Following formaldehyde activation, pixantrone alkylates DNA and particularly favours the CpG motif. Aberrations in CpG methylation patterns are a feature of most cancer types, a characteristic that may determine their susceptibility to specific drug treatments. Given their common target, DNA methylation may modulate the DNA damage induced by formaldehyde-activated pixantrone. In vitro transcription, mass spectrometry and oligonucleotide band shift assays were utilized to establish that pixantrone-DNA adduct formation was consistently enhanced 2-5-fold at discrete methylated CpG doublets. The methylation-mediated enhancement was exquisitely sensitive to the position of the methyl substituent since methylation at neighboring cytosine residues failed to confer an increase in pixantrone-DNA alkylation. Covalent modification of DNA by formaldehyde-activated doxorubicin, but not cisplatin, was augmented by neighbouring CpG methylation, indicating that modulation of binding by CpG methylation is not a general feature of all alkylators. HCT116 colon cancer cells vastly deficient in CpG methylation were 12- and 10-fold more resistant to pixantrone and doxorubicin relative to the wild-type line, suggesting that these drugs may selectively recognize the aberrant CpG methylation profiles characteristic of most tumour types.",

After transfection of the breast cancer cell lines BT-474, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-435 with Plk1-specific ASOs, paclitaxel, carboplatin, or Herceptin was added and cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis were measured. Whereas the dual treatment of breast cancer cells with Plk1-specific ASOs with carboplatin or Herceptin caused only a limited antiproliferative effect in breast cancer cells, we observed synergistic effects after combination of low doses of Plk1-specific ASOs with paclitaxel, which is used in a variety of clinical anticancer regimens. Plk1-specific ASOs also acted synergistically with paclitaxel in the arrest of the cell cycle at the G(2)-M phase and in the induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, in a human xenograft experiment using MDA-MB-435 cells, the combination of Plk1 ASOs with paclitaxel led to synergistic reduction of tumor growth after 3 weeks of treatment compared with either agent alone. This study suggests that antisense inhibitors against Plk1 at well-tolerated doses may be considered as highly efficient promoters for the antineoplastic potential of taxanes, such as paclitaxel, causing synergistic effects in breast cancer cells.",

The repressor element-1 silencing transcription (REST) factor has been found to play important roles in the regulation of neural differentiation and tumorigenesis. Recently, a REST signature consisting of downstream targets of REST has been reported to have clinical relevance in both breast cancer and glioblastoma. However it remains unclear how the REST signature works in neuroblastoma. Publicly available datasets were mined and bioinformatic approaches were used to investigate the utility of the REST signature in neuroblastoma with both preclinical and real patient data. The REST signature was found to be associated with drug sensitivity in neuroblastoma cell lines. Further, neuroblastoma patients with enhanced REST activity are significantly associated with higher clinical stages. Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 11q23, which occurs in a large subset of high-risk neuroblastomas, tends to be correlated with high REST activity, with marginal significance. In conclusion, the REST signature has important implications for targeted therapy, and it is a prognostic factor in neuroblastoma patients.",

Susceptibility of Candida species to antifungal drugs was determined using standard methodology. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed taking positive NAC count as the dependent variable and a number of known Candida risk factors as independent variables.\\n\\nRESULTS: Prevalence of candidal carriage of the population was 78.4%, of which 0.5% of the subjects were NAC positive. Candida dubliniensis was the most prevalent NAC species, followed by Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis. The NAC positive elderly were more often edentulous with dental prostheses or had fewer teeth than Candida albicans-positive or yeast-negative subjects. Dental caries slightly increased the risk for having NAC strains (odds ratio 1.08), whilst greater age appeared to lower the risk (odds ratio 0.77). Candida species were susceptible to the commonly used antifungal agents in general, but with considerable variation among species. Occasionally, some NAC exhibited lower antifungal susceptibility.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The possibility of oral reservoirs of NAC strains which are resistant to common antifungals should be noted in elderly outpatients.",

C. glabrata infections are difficult to treat and are often resistant to many azole antifungal agents and are also associated with a high mortality rate in compromised patients. We determined the antigenic structure of the cell wall mannoproteins from three C. glabrata strains, NBRC 0005, NBRC 0622, and NBRC 103857. (1) H NMR and methylation analyses of the acetolysis products of these mannoproteins showed a significant difference in the amount of the \u03b2-1,2-linked mannose residue and side chain structure. The C. glabrata NBRC 103857 strain contained up to the triose side chains and the non-reducing terminal of the triose was predominantly the \u03b2-1,2-linked mannose residue. On the other hand, the mannans of the two former strains possessed up to the tetraose side chains and the amount of the \u03b2-1,2-linked mannose residue was very low. Larger oligosaccharides than tetraose in the acetolysis products of these mannans were identified to be incomplete cleavage fragments by analyses of the methylation, (1) H NMR spectra, and \u03b11-2,3 mannosidase degradation reaction. Resistance to the antifungal drugs, itraconazole and micafungin, of these strains was significantly different. Interestingly, the NBRC 103857 strain, which involved a large amount of the \u03b2-1,2-linked mannose residues, exhibited a significant sensitivity to these antifungal drugs.",

        "abstract": "Topoisomerases alter DNA topology and are vital for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Topoisomerases I and II are also targets for widely used antitumor agents. We demonstrated previously that in the human leuke- mia cell line, HL-60, resistance to topoisomerase (topo) II-targeting drugs such as etoposide is associated with site-specific hypophosphorylation of topo II ? . This effect can be mimicked in sensitive cells treated with the intracellular Ca2? chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophe- noxy)ethane-N,N,N?,N?-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM). Here we identify Ser-1106 as a major phosphorylation site in the catalytic domain of topo II ? . This site lies within the consensus sequence for the acidotrophic ki- nases, casein kinase I and casein kinase II. Mutation of serine 1106 to alanine (S1106A) abrogates phosphoryla- tion of phosphopeptides that were found to be hy- pophosphorylated in resistant HL-60 cells or sensitive cells treated with BAPTA-AM. Purified topo II ? contain- ing a S1106A substitution is 4-fold less active than wild type topo II ? in decatenating kinetoplast DNA and also exhibits a 2\u20134-fold decrease in the level of etoposide- stabilized DNA cleavable complex formation. Saccharo- myces cerevisiae (JN394t2-4) cells expressing S1106A mu- tant topo II ? protein are more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of etoposide or amsacrine. These results demon- strate that Ca2?-regulated phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in the catalytic domain of topo II ? modulates the enzy- matic activity of this protein and sensitivity to topo II-targeting drugs.",

        "abstract": "Survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ({CLL}) cells is triggered by several stimuli, such as the B-cell receptor ({BCR}), {CD}40 ligand ({CD}40L), or interleukin-4 ({IL}-4). We identified that these stimuli regulate apoptosis resistance by modulating sphingolipid metabolism. Applying liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, we revealed a significant decrease of proapoptotic ceramide in {BCR}/{IL}-4/{CD}40L-stimulated primary {CLL} cells compared with untreated controls. Antiapoptotic glucosylceramide levels were significantly increased after {BCR} cross-linking. We identified {BCR} engagement to catalyze the crucial modification of ceramide to glucosylceramide via {UDP}-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase ({UGCG}). Besides specific {UGCG} inhibitors, our data demonstrate that {IgM}-mediated {UGCG} expression was inhibited by the novel and highly effective {PI}3Kdelta and {BTK} inhibitors {CAL}-101 and {PCI}-32765, which reverted {IgM}-induced resistance toward apoptosis of {CLL} cells. Sphingolipids were recently shown to be crucial for mediation of apoptosis via mitochondria. Our data reveal {ABT}-737, a mitochondria-targeting drug, as interesting candidate partner for {PI}3Kdelta and {BTK} inhibition, resulting in synergistic apoptosis, even under protection by the {BCR}. In summary, we identified the mode of action of novel kinase inhibitors {CAL}-101 and {PCI}-32765 by controlling the {UGCG}-mediated ceramide/glucosylceramide equilibrium as a downstream molecular switch of {BCR} signaling, also providing novel targeted treatment options beyond current chemotherapy-based regimens.",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Recent high-throughput analyses of genomic alterations revealed several driver genes and altered pathways in GC. However, therapeutic applications from genomic data are limited, largely as a result of the lack of druggable molecular targets and preclinical models for drug selection. To identify new therapeutic targets for GC, we performed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of DNA from 103 patients with GC for copy number alteration (CNA) analysis, and whole-exome sequencing from 55 GCs from the same patients for mutation profiling. Pathway analysis showed recurrent alterations in the Wnt signaling [APC, CTNNB1, and DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1)], ErbB signaling (ERBB2, PIK3CA, and KRAS), and p53 signaling/apoptosis [TP53 and BCL2L1 (BCL2-like 1)] pathways. In 18.4% of GC cases (19/103), amplification of the antiapoptotic gene BCL2L1 was observed, and subsequently a BCL2L1 inhibitor was shown to markedly decrease cell viability in BCL2L1-amplified cell lines and in similarly altered patient-derived GC xenografts, especially when combined with other chemotherapeutic agents. In 10.9% of cases (6/55), mutations in DLC1 were found and were also shown to confer a growth advantage for these cells via activation of Rho-ROCK signaling, rendering these cells more susceptible to a ROCK inhibitor. Taken together, our study implicates BCL2L1 and DLC1 as potential druggable targets for specific subsets of GC cases.",

        "abstract": "A solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas is a rare type of pancreatic neoplasm found predominantly in young women. SPTs typically behave as though benign; however, in some cases they also have malignant potential. We encountered a rare case of a recurrent SPT that developed 4 years after the initial surgery in an elderly male patient. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed that the 61-year-old patient had four intra-abdominal masses, suggesting a recurrence of SPT. The patient had a history of distal pancreatectomy due to SPT in the pancreatic tail 4 years previously. These tumors showed positive signals on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and were treated successfully by aggressive surgical resection. Microscopic diagnosis was compatible with recurrent tumors of SPT. A chemosensitivity test, the collagen gel droplet-embedded culture drug sensitivity test (CD-DST), showed that the resected tumors were sensitive to several antitumor drugs. We suggest that the CD-DST may be used to indicate promising antitumor agents for treating SPTs with malignant tendencies. In addition, a diffusion-weighted MRI can be useful for accurately visualizing SPTs of the pancreas.",

        "abstract": "Anthracyclines and taxanes are standard anticancer drugs used in breast cancer chemotherapy. In general, the efficacy of chemotherapy is lower in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors compared to patients with ER-negative tumors. Although less chemosensitive, ER-positive disease includes a subset of patients who significantly benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. The collagen gel droplet-embedded culture-drug sensitivity test (CD-DST) is an in vitro chemosensitivity test that has several advantages over conventional tests. The aim of the present study was to examine the correlation between CD-DST and the expression of Ki67, an indicator of tumor proliferation, to evaluate the efficacy of anthracyclines and taxanes in patients with ER-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. CD-DST was performed in 68 patients with ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer between August 2001 and November 2006. The specimens obtained during surgery were used for the CD-DST and immunohistological examination of Ki67 expression. Chemosensitivity to the anticancer drugs adriamycin (ADM), epirubicin (EPI), docetaxel (DOC) and paclitaxel (PTX) was estimated using CD-DST. Results obtained from the CD-DST showed the chemosensitivity to each anticancer drug to be ADM, 23.7%; EPI, 75.0%; DOC, 69.2% and PTX, 43.6%. Ki67 expression was significantly higher in the group that was sensitive to DOC compared to the group that was resistant to DOC (P=0.048) and PTX (P=0.036). In addition, a significant correlation was observed between a Ki67 labeling index (LI) of >30% and chemosensitivity to PTX. In conclusion, results obtained from CD-DST and Ki67 expression levels are able to identify a subset of patients with ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer who exhibit sensitivity to chemotherapy, particularly to taxane therapy.",

DESIGN: Collection of stool samples from children with sporadic diarrhoea and laboratory based microbiological analysis. SETTING: Microbiology Research Laboratory, Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Parasitology, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria. RESULTS: Out of one thousand seven hundred and sixty one diarhoeic faecal specimens collected, one hundred and seven strains of staphylococci were isolated as pure culture. Seventy two of these 107 staphylococci were coagulase positive S. aureus, 33 strains were S. epidermidis and two strains were S. saprophyticus. Sixty one (84.7%) of 72 isolates of S. aureus produced enterotoxins. Staphylococcal enterotoxins A was produced singly by 37(60.7%) of the toxigenic strain, while 12(19.7%) produced enterotoxin D alone. Two strains produced both enterotoxins A and C, six strains produced both enterotoxins A and D, one strain produced enterotoxins A, C and D while two strains produced enterotoxins A, B, and D. Most strains were resistant to pennicilin, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) within the range of 1-16 microg/ml. CONCLUSION: Enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus were recovered from children aged five years and below suffering from sporadic diarhoea. The incidence rate was 3.5% of the samples investigated. Results of their antibiogram revealed that chloramphenicol, gentamicin, cephalothin and clindamycin would be appropriate for treatment of such diarrhoea after the clinical value of the antibiotics in young children has been evaluated.",

We demonstrated that C. tropicalis switched spontaneously, reversibly and at high frequency (10(-1) to 10(-3)) when grown on yeast extract-peptone-D-glucose (YPD) agar medium. Phenotypic switching in five clinical isolates of C. tropicalis resulted in colonies exhibiting the following morphologies: crepe, rough, crater, irregular center, mycelial and diffuse. The majority of the variant colonies were associated with higher percentages of filamentous growth relative to their parental unswitched isolates. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in the production of hemolytic factor were found between most of the switched variants and their respective parental counterparts. Variant colonies exhibiting the crepe (derived from isolates 49.07 and 100.10) and rough phenotype (derived from isolate 49.07) had higher biofilm formation than their parental counterparts exhibiting a smooth dome surface (P < 0.05). Our data revealed that switching was correlated with changes in the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of a subset of the switched variants phenotypes to itraconazole. While the MIC to itraconazole was higher for crepe variant compared with its parental isolate 49.07, the rough variant of 100.10 had a lower MIC to this antifungal agent. The presented data support the role of phenotypic switching in promoting changes in phenotypic expression of putative virulence traits and itraconazole susceptibility of clinical isolates of C. tropicalis.",

Therefore, it is not surprising that Hsp90 has been reported to be a promising target for the treatment of several neoplasias, such as non-small-cell lung cancer and HER2-positive breast cancer. Hsp90 chaperone function depends on its ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP and Hsp90 inhibitors have been shown to compete with nucleotides for binding to Hsp90. Multiple factors, such as co-chaperones and post-translational modification, are involved in regulating Hsp90 ATPase activity. Here, the impact of post-translational modifications and co-chaperones on the efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors are reviewed.",

        "abstract": "Big-data-based edge biomarker is a new concept to characterize disease features based on biomedical big data in a dynamical and network manner, which also provides alternative strategies to indicate disease status in single samples. This article gives a comprehensive review on big-data-based edge biomarkers for complex diseases in an individual patient, which are defined as biomarkers based on network information and high-dimensional data. Specifically, we firstly introduce the sources and structures of biomedical big data accessible in public for edge biomarker and disease study. We show that biomedical big data are typically 'small-sample size in high-dimension space', i.e. small samples but with high dimensions on features (e.g. omics data) for each individual, in contrast to traditional big data in many other fields characterized as 'large-sample size in low-dimension space', i.e. big samples but with low dimensions on features. Then, we demonstrate the concept, model and algorithm for edge biomarkers and further big-data-based edge biomarkers. Dissimilar to conventional biomarkers, edge biomarkers, e.g. module biomarkers in module network rewiring-analysis, are able to predict the disease state by learning differential associations between molecules rather than differential expressions of molecules during disease progression or treatment in individual patients. In particular, in contrast to using the information of the common molecules or edges (i.e.molecule-pairs) across a population in traditional biomarkers including network and edge biomarkers, big-data-based edge biomarkers are specific for each individual and thus can accurately evaluate the disease state by considering the individual heterogeneity. Therefore, the measurement of big data in a high-dimensional space is required not only in the learning process but also in the diagnosing or predicting process of the tested individual. Finally, we provide a case study on analyzing the temporal expression data from a malaria vaccine trial by big-data-based edge biomarkers from module network rewiring-analysis. The illustrative results show that the identified module biomarkers can accurately distinguish vaccines with or without protection and outperformed previous reported gene signatures in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Nias Island, off the north-western coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, was one of the first locations in which chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax malaria was reported. This resistance is of particular concern because its ancient megalithic culture and the outstanding surfing conditions make the island a popular tourist destination. International travel to and from the island could rapidly spread chloroquine-resistant strains of P. vivax across the planet. The threat posed by such strains, locally and internationally, has led to the routine and periodic re-assessment of the efficacy of antimalarial drugs and transmission potential on the island. Active case detection identified malaria in 124 (17%) of 710 local residents whereas passive case detection, at the central health clinic, confirmed malaria in 77 (44%) of 173 cases of presumed 'clinical malaria'. Informed consenting volunteers who had malarial parasitaemias were treated, according to the Indonesian Ministry of Health's recommendations, with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) on day 0 (for P. falciparum) or with chloroquine (CQ) on days 0, 1 and 2 (for P. vivax). Each volunteer was then monitored for clinical and parasite response until day 28. Recurrent parasitaemia by day 28 treatment was seen in 29 (83%) of the 35 P. falciparum cases given SP (14, 11 and four cases showing RI, RII and RIII resistance, respectively). Recurrent parasitaemia was also observed, between day 11 and day 21, in six (21%) of the 28 P. vivax cases given CQ. Although the results of quantitative analysis confirmed only low prevalences of CQ-resistant P. vivax malaria, the prevalence of SP resistance among the P. falciparum cases was among the highest seen in Indonesia. When the parasites present in the volunteers with P. falciparum infections were genotyped, mutations associated with pyrimethamine resistance were found at high frequency in the dhfr gene but there was no evidence of selection for sulfadoxine resistance in the dhps gene. Night-biting mosquitoes were surveyed by human landing collections and tested for sporozoite infection. Among the five species of human-biting anophelines collected, Anopheles sundaicus was dominant (68%) and the only species found to be infective--two (1.2%) of 167 females being found carrying P. vivax sporozoites. The risk of malarial infection for humans on Nias was considered high because of the abundance of asymptomatic carriers, the reduced effectiveness of the available antimalarial drugs, and the biting and infection 'rates' of the local An. sundaicus.",

They may show aggressive clinical behavior and are a paradigm for the interaction between the tumor and the immune system. So far, adequate functional studies enabling a better understanding of this malignancy have not been performed, since human thymoma/thymic carcinoma cell lines have not been available. Here, the authors describe the establishment, characterization and functional analyses of epithelial cell lines from a Type B1-thymoma and a poorly differentiated thymic carcinoma. By Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses, both cell lines were aneuploid. The aneuploid cell fraction of the thymic carcinoma cell line was characterized by a high proliferation index of 55.9%, in contrast to a lower proliferation rate of the aneuploid cell fraction of the thymoma (19.7%). Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and conventional cytogenetic analysis of the thymoma revealed only minor imbalances whereas the thymic carcinoma was characterized by a complex karyotype in the hyperdiploid range that was readily defined with multicolor FISH (mFISH). Application of a selective COX-2 inhibitor reduced cell viability in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, these first cell lines of a thymoma and a CD5-positive thymic carcinoma are useful tools for further in vitro studies of cellular, molecular and genetic aspects of the disease and for functional tests to evaluate new therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "To identify dysregulated pathways in distinct phases of NOTCH1-mediated T-cell leukemogenesis, as well as small-molecule inhibitors that could synergize with or substitute for gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) therapy, we compared gene expression profiles in a Notch1-induced mouse model of T-ALL with those in human T-ALL. The overall patterns of NOTCH1-mediated gene expression in human and mouse T-ALLs were remarkably similar, as defined early in transformation in the mouse by the regulation of MYC and its target genes and activation of NF-kappaB and PI3K/AKT pathways. Later events in murine Notch1-mediated leukemogenesis included downregulation of genes encoding tumor suppressors and negative cell cycle regulators. Gene set enrichment analysis and connectivity map algorithm predicted that small-molecule inhibitors, including heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), histone deacetylase (HDAC), PI3K/AKT and proteasome inhibitors, could reverse the gene expression changes induced by NOTCH1. When tested in vitro, HDAC, PI3K and proteasome inhibitors synergized with GSI in suppressing T-ALL cell growth in GSI-sensitive cells. Interestingly, alvespimycin, a potent inhibitor of the HSP90 molecular chaperone, markedly inhibited the growth of both GSI-sensitive and -resistant T-ALL cells, suggesting that its loss disrupts signal transduction pathways crucial for the growth and survival of T-ALL cells.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether differentiation of HL60 and NB4 leukemia cell lines induced by ATRA and PMA alters their drug sensitivity. The differentiation along the neutrophil lineage (upon stimulation with ATRA) and along the monocyte/macrophage lineage (upon stimulation with PMA) was proved by decreased proliferative potential of cells, changes in their morphology, increased ability for NBT reduction and increased expression of CD11b and CD14 cell surface markers. The effect of drugs: cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone and etoposide was examined by Alamar Blue test (proliferation and survival rates), as well as by evaluation of cell smears stained with Hoechst 33342 (apoptotic index). Differentiation resulted in the change of drug sensitivity in both cell lines: the differentiation along the neutrophil pathway (after stimulation with ATRA) increased sensitivity to cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone but decreased sensitivity to etoposide; the differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage pathway (induced by PMA) resulted in the decreased sensitivity of both cell lines to all drugs tested. In conclusion, we have shown that ATRA- and PMA-mediated differentiation of HL60 and NB4 cell lines results in the changes of their drug sensitivity. Our data may provide a contribution to a strategy aimed at a rational combination of differentiating agents and conventional anticancer drugs.",

        "abstract": "Retinoids are an important component of neuroblastoma therapy at the stage of minimal residual disease, yet 40-50% of patients treated with 13- cis-retinoic acid (13- cis-RA) still relapse, indicating the need for more effective retinoid therapy. Vorinostat, or Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), is a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) classes I & II and has antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Fenretinide (4-HPR) is a synthetic retinoid which acts on cancer cells through both nuclear retinoid receptor and non-receptor mechanisms. In this study, we found that the combination of 4-HPR + SAHA exhibited potent cytotoxic effects on neuroblastoma cells, much more effective than 13- cis-RA + SAHA. The 4-HPR + SAHA combination induced caspase-dependent apoptosis through activation of caspase 3, reduced colony formation and cell migration in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo. The 4-HPR and SAHA combination significantly increased mRNA expression of thymosin-beta-4 (T\u03b24) and decreased mRNA expression of retinoic acid receptor \u03b1 (RAR\u03b1). Importantly, the up-regulation of T\u03b24 and down-regulation of RAR\u03b1 were both necessary for the 4-HPR + SAHA cytotoxic effect on neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, T\u03b24 knockdown in neuroblastoma cells increased cell migration and blocked the effect of 4-HPR + SAHA on cell migration and focal adhesion formation. In primary human neuroblastoma tumor tissues, low expression of T\u03b24 was associated with metastatic disease and predicted poor patient prognosis. Our findings demonstrate that T\u03b24 is a novel therapeutic target in neuroblastoma, and that 4-HPR + SAHA is a potential therapy for the disease.",

The aim of our study was to investigate the functional role of both miR-101 and EZH2 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods MiR-101 and EZH2 expressions were evaluated in tumor tissues of 99 HCC patients and 7 liver cancer cell lines by real-time PCR. Luciferase reporter assay was employed to validate whether EZH2 represents a target gene of miR-101. The effect of miR-101 on HCC growth as well as programmed cell death was studied in vitro and in vivo. Results MiR-101 expression was significantly downregulated in most of HCC tissues and all cell lines, whereas EZH2 was significantly overexpressed in most of HCC tissues and all cell lines. There was a negative correlation between expression levels of miR-101 and EZH2. Luciferase assay results confirmed EZH2 as a direct target gene of miR-101, which negatively regulates EZH2 expression in HCC. Ectopic overexpression of miR-101 dramatically repressed proliferation, invasion, colony formation as well as cell cycle progression in vitro and suppressed tumorigenicity in vivo. Furthermore, miR-101 inhibited autophagy and synergized with either doxorubicin or fluorouracil to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Conclusion Tumor suppressor miR-101 represses HCC progression through directly targeting EZH2 oncogene and sensitizes liver cancer cells to chemotherapeutic treatment. Our findings provide significant insights into molecular mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis and may have clinical relevance for the development of novel targeted therapies for HCC. \u00a9 2013 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The standard in vitro test to assess anti-malarial activity of chemical compounds is the [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assay. It is a radioactivity-based method to measure DNA replication of Plasmodium in red blood cells. The method is highly reproducible, however, the handling of radioactive material is costly, hazardous and requires the availability of appropriate technology and trained staff. Several other ways to evaluate in vitro anti-malarial activity do exist, all with their own assets and limitations.\\n\\nMETHODS: The newly developed double-antibody sandwich ELISA described here is based on the properties of a non-overlapping pair of monoclonal antibodies directed against Plasmodium falciparum aldolase. This glycolytic enzyme possesses some unique nucleotide sequences compared to the human isoenzymes and has been highly conserved through evolution. Out of twenty possibilities, the most sensitive antibody pair was selected and used to quantitatively detect parasite aldolase in infected blood lysates.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 34 compounds with anti-malarial activity were tested side-by-side by ELISA and the [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assay. The novel ELISA provided IC 50s closely paralleling those from the radioactivity-based assay (R = 0.99, p < 0.001). At the investigated assay conditions (72 h incubation time, parasitaemia = 0.3%), the assay was found to be reproducible and easy to perform.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The newly developed ELISA presents several advantages over the comparative method, the [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assay. The assay is highly reproducible, less hazardous (involves no radioactivity) and requires little and cheap technical equipment. Relatively unskilled personnel can conduct this user-friendly assay. All this makes it attractive to be employed in resource-poor laboratories.",

        "abstract": "The gene that encodes the ??-isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3Ca) is frequently mutated in human cancers. We profiled the mutation status of the PIK3Ca gene in the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-60 panel of human cancer cell lines maintained by the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the NCI. Mutation hotspots on the gene were PCR amplified and sequenced, and the trace data were analyzed with software designed to detect mutations. Seven of the cell lines tested have PIK3Ca mutations: two lines derived from breast cancer, two from colon cancer, two from ovarian cancer, and one from lung cancer. BRAF and EGFR genes were normal in the PIK3Ca mutant lines. Two of the cell lines with mutant PIK3Ca also have a mutant version of the KRAS gene. The mutation status was correlated with array-based gene expression that is publicly available for the NCI-60 cell lines. We found increased expression levels for estrogen receptor (ER) and ERBB2 in PIK3Ca mutant lines. The PIK3Ca mutation status was also correlated with compound screening data for the cell lines. PIK3Ca-mutant cell lines were relatively more sensitive than PIK3Ca-normal cell lines to the ER inhibitor tamoxifen and the AKT inhibitor triciribine, among other compounds. The results provide insights into the role of mutant PIK3Ca in oncogenic signaling and allow preliminary identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in cancers harboring PIK3Ca mutations. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Peloruside A (PLA) and laulimalide (LAU) are potent microtubule-stabilizing natural products that are effective against a broad spectrum of cancer cells. The interactions of PLA and LAU with tubulin have attracted a great deal of attention, mainly because they bind to ??-tubulin at a site that is different from the classical taxoid site. Multiple ??I-tubulin amino acid residues have been predicted by computer modelling studies and more recently by protein crystallography to participate in the binding of PLA and LAU to tubulin. The relevance of these residues in determining cellular sensitivity to the compounds, however, remains largely uncertain. To determine the role of four binding site residues, Q291, D295, V333, and N337 on PLA and LAU activity, we introduced single mutations to these sites by site-directed mutagenesis and transfected each mutant tubulin separately into HEK and/or HeLa cells. We found that a Q291M ??I-tubulin mutation increased sensitivity of the cells to PLA, but not to LAU, paclitaxel (PTX), or vinblastine (VBL). In contrast, V333W and N337L mutations led to less stable microtubules, with the V333W causing resistance to PLA and PTX, but not LAU, and the N337L causing resistance to PLA, LAU, and PTX. Moreover, cells expressing either W333 or L337 were hypersensitive to the microtubule-destabilizing agent, VBL. The D295I mutation conferred resistance to both PLA and LAU without affecting microtubule stability or sensitivity to PTX or ixabepilone (IXB). This study identifies the first mammalian ??I-tubulin mutation that specifically increases sensitivity to PLA, and reports mutations at PLA and LAU binding site residues that can either reduce microtubule stability or impair drug-tubulin binding, conferring resistance to these microtubule-stabilizing agents. This information provides insights on ??-tubulin residues important for maintaining microtubule structural integrity and for sensitivity to microtubule-targeting agents, and suggests novel directions for rational structure-based design of new and more potent agents for cancer treatment that target the LAU/PLA site.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In conjunction with the spread of HIV infection, tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of illness and death worldwide. The Ethiopian national report reveals that extra pulmonary tuberculosis is on the rise and that case detection rate is exceeding that of smear positive or negative cases in many parts of the country. Different studies indicated that host and/or pathogen related factors are associated with the rise of extra pulmonary cases. However, the reason for this is not clearly known in our setting.\\n\\nMETHODS: Specimens were taken from clinically suspected extra pulmonary patients and confirmed by cytology, histopathology and culture. Deletion typing and Spoligotyping was utilized to identify the strains. The isolates were then assigned to lineage using conformal Bayesian network (rules model) algorithm and dendrograms were drawn using UPGMA methods. In addition, drug sensitivity test was done using the indirect proportion and 24 well plate methods.\\n\\nRESULTS: Out of the 200 clinically suspected extra pulmonary tuberculosis patients, 106 (53\u00a0%) were between 15 and 35\u00a0years of age and 167 (83.5\u00a0%) were new while 33 (16.5\u00a0%) were retreatment cases. The culture yield was 29.5\u00a0% (59). Of these only one was M. bovis and 58 were M. tuberculosis strains with 31 different spoligotype patterns grouped into seven clusters. The largest cluster (ST53) comprised 12 (20.3\u00a0%) isolates. There was higher clustering of CAS isolates in TBLN than in any other form of extra pulmonary tuberculosis cases. Resistance to rifampicin was higher (22\u00a0%) than that for INH, STM and EMB (8.1\u00a0%, 5\u00a0% and 3\u00a0% respectively). Out of the 37 isolates tested for resistance, only 2 isolates were resistant for both STM and INH and no MDR strain was found.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: There is an ongoing active recent transmission among extra pulmonary tuberculosis in the study areas as shown by the presence of clusters. Although no MDR case was observed, there is a risk of emergence of MDR as noted from the high proportion of resistance to rifampicin. Detailed study at population level is recommended to monitor its trend.",

        "abstract": "We prospectively investigated the relationship between the clinical efficacy of treatment of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease and drug-sensitivity testing of MAC isolates for antituberculous drugs, new quinolone antibiotics, and clarithromycin (CAM). Fifty-two patients who satisfied the diagnostic criteria of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and who received treatment between April 1998 and December 2005, using combined therapy of rifampicin (RFP), ethambutol (EB), streptomycin (SM), and CAM, were enrolled in this study. The causative microorganisms isolated were Mycobacterium avium in 30 patients and M. intracellulare in 22 patients. Although separation of the two strains showed drug sensitivity testing to have slightly better minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for M. intracellulare than for M. avium, there were no significant differences in the sputum eradication rate or clinical improvement between the two strains. The MICs of various antibiotics for the isolated MAC strains were as follows: RFP, 0.125-8 microg/ml; CAM, 0.25-16 microg/ml; SM, 2-128< or =microg/ml; EB, 128< or = microg/ml; levofloxacin (LVFX), 1-32 microg/ml; sparfloxacin (SPFX), 0.5-16 microg/ml; and gatifloxacin (GFLX), 0.25-8 microg/ml. The isolated MAC strains showed the same excellent drug sensitivity test results for RFP, new quinolones, and CAM, but they showed resistant drug-sensitivity results for EB and SM. Regarding the relationship between clinical efficacy and the MICs of RFP, EB, CAM, and SM, there was a good relationship only for CAM. Although the ATS has not yet recommended routine drug susceptibility testing of CAM, we believe that drug susceptibility testing of CAM should be performed before the initial treatment is undertaken for pulmonary MAC disease.",

The aim of the present study is to examine the clinical usefulness of this test in the prediction of response to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Seventy patients with primary (n = 45) or locally recurrent (n = 25) breast cancers were recruited, and each patient underwent tumor biopsy before chemotherapy. The biopsy specimens were used for CD-DST and immunohistological examination of 6 biological markers (P-gp, erbB2, p53, BCL2, MIB1 and ER-alpha). As chemotherapy, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) plus epirubicin 60 mg/m(2) q3w (CE, n = 28) or docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) q3w (DOC, n = 42) was given. Interpretable results using the CD-DST assay were obtained from 84.3% (59/70) of tumor specimens studied. Of the 18 tumors diagnosed as CE sensitive by CD-DST, 15 (83.3%) exhibited a response to CE therapy and none of the 5 tumors diagnosed as CE resistant by CD-DST exhibited a response to CE therapy. Of the 14 tumors diagnosed as DOC sensitive by CD-DST, 13 (92.9%) exhibited a response to DOC therapy and only one of the 22 tumors diagnosed as DOC resistant by CD-DST exhibited a response to DOC therapy. P-gp expression was found to exhibit a significant (p < 0.05) association with the resistance to CE therapy but not to DOC therapy. Diagnostic accuracy (72.7%) achieved by P-gp was lower than that (87.0%) achieved by CD-DST in CE therapy. Expressions of other biological markers (erbB2, p53, BCL2, MIB1 and ER-alpha) were not significantly associated with response to CE or DOC therapy. These results demonstrate that CD-DST can predict the response to CE and DOC therapy with a high accuracy in breast cancer patients and seems to be superior to the conventional predictors.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In India as elsewhere, multi-drug resistance (MDR) poses a serious challenge in the control of tuberculosis (TB). The End TB strategy, recently approved by the world health assembly, aims to reduce TB deaths by 95% and new cases by 90% between 2015 and 2035. A key pillar of this approach is early diagnosis of tuberculosis, including use of higher-sensitivity diagnostic testing and universal rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST). Despite limitations of current laboratory assays, universal access to rapid DST could become more feasible with the advent of new and emerging technologies. Here we use a mathematical model of TB transmission, calibrated to the TB epidemic in India, to explore the potential impact of a major national scale-up of rapid DST. To inform key parameters in a clinical setting, we take GeneXpert as an example of a technology that could enable such scale-up. We draw from a recent multi-centric demonstration study conducted in India that involved upfront Xpert MTB/RIF testing of all TB suspects.\\n\\nRESULTS: We find that widespread, public-sector deployment of high-sensitivity diagnostic testing and universal DST appropriately linked with treatment could substantially impact MDR-TB in India. Achieving 75% access over 3 years amongst all cases being diagnosed for TB in the public sector alone could avert over 180,000 cases of MDR-TB (95% CI 44187 - 317077 cases) between 2015 and 2025. Sufficiently wide deployment of Xpert could, moreover, turn an increasing MDR epidemic into a diminishing one. Synergistic effects were observed with assumptions of simultaneously improving MDR-TB treatment outcomes. Our results illustrate the potential impact of new and emerging technologies that enable widespread, timely DST, and the important effect that universal rapid DST in the public sector can have on the MDR-TB epidemic in India.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The collagen gel droplet embedded culture drug test (CD-DST), is an in vitro anticancer drug sensitivity test. The test has been used with various types of malignant tumors, but the significance of clinical application remains unknown. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the ability of this test to predict the response to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.\\n\\nMETHODS: From January 2000 through March 2007, CD-DST data using the primary tumor specimens to anticancer drugs such as cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin (CBDCA), paclitaxel (PAC), docetaxel (TXT), gemcitabine (GEM), and vinorelbine (VNR), was successfully obtained from 382 patients that underwent a radical resection for NSCLC. Eighty-one of those patients received 1st line chemotherapy using a \"new generation\" of anticancer drugs for postoperative recurrence. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of a CDDP (or CBDCA)-based combination (N=41), non-CDDP-based combination (N=1) and single agent (N=39). The predictability of the chemotherapeutic effect by the CD-DST data was analyzed retrospectively.\\n\\nRESULTS: Partial response (PR) was obtained in 24 patients (response rate=30%), stable disease (SD) in 33 (41%) and progressive disease (PD) in 24 (30%). Forty-two patients underwent chemotherapy with one or more CD-DST-sensitive drugs, 21 of whom showed PR (RR=50%), whereas only 3 (8%) patients showed PR with chemotherapy with regimen including no CD-DST-sensitive drugs. Good predictability was obtained, with a 50% positive predictive value (PPV) for PR and a 92% negative predictive value (NPV) by CD-DST. The predictive accuracy for the response based on the CD-DST data was 70%. Interestingly, a subset analysis according to recurrence site showed that the predictive accuracy was highest (86%) for CD-DST-based chemotherapy for recurrence in the lymph nodes.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The application of the CD-DST for \"new generation\" anticancer drugs using surgically resected specimens of primary lesion in NSCLC patients may be clinically useful in the prediction of the response to chemotherapy for postoperative recurrence. CD-DST-oriented chemotherapy for postoperative recurrence especially in the lymph nodes may therefore be promising for the improvement of the treatment outcome.",

Methods: Ten patients were treated with CRS and HIPEC. Treatment, drug sensitivity profiles, histopathology, and survival data were recorded and matched with potential prognostic indicators. Drug sensitivity was assessed with short-term fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay and compared with peritoneal metastases from CRC. Results: Patients with completeness of cytoreduction score (CC) ??? 1 had better median survival (36.6 months) than those with CC > 1 (16.4 months). In the CC ??? 1 group, 8 months elapsed between initial diagnosis and CRS with HIPEC compared with 22 months in the CC ??? 1 group. For standard drugs, tumor cells from AAC and CRC were equally sensitive; except for docetaxel, to which AAC was more sensitive than CRC. Conclusion: The CC-score correlated with overall survival. Candidates for this type of treatment should be referred early for evaluation in order to reach a better CC score. Drugs used for CRC also seem adequate for treatment of AAC, although other drugs, eg, docetaxel, might be more active. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) is an important cellular target for chemotherapeutic agents. Human cells have two isoforms of topo II (alpha and beta), and both are inhibited by the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide, amsacrine (mAMSA) and mitoxantrone. It is known that the cytotoxic importance of topo IIalpha or topo IIbeta drug-induced complexes differs depending on which drug is present. This study was designed to (a) assess isoform-specific formation and reversal of topo IIalpha and beta cleavable complexes, and (b) determine whether the cytotoxic importance of either isoform was related to differences in the longevity of the complexes. METHODS: Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were used to study the cellular response to the topo II poisons etoposide, mitoxantrone and mAMSA. The longevity of topo IIalpha and beta complexes was determined using the TARDIS assay. This immunofluorescence assay can differentiate between the topo II isoforms and thus allowed us to investigate the persistence and importance of topo IIalpha and beta complexes for the first time. RESULTS: In MEFs treated with etoposide, 50% of topo IIalpha complexes dissociated within 40 min whereas dissociation of topo IIbeta complexes took only 20 min. Disappearance of complexes was a slower process for mitoxantrone-treated cells. The time taken to reduce topo IIalpha and topo IIbeta cleavable complexes by 50% was 10 and 6 h, respectively. In contrast, mAMSA-stabilized topo IIalpha and topo IIbeta cleavable complexes were equally stable (dissociation within 15 min for both isoforms). These stability data were confirmed using an in vitro assay. CONCLUSIONS: We previously demonstrated that topo IIalpha is the major target for etoposide and mitoxantrone but that both topo IIalpha and topo IIbeta are important for mAMSA cytotoxicity. The longevity of the topo IIalpha and beta cleavable complexes shown here is therefore an important factor in determining the cytotoxic sensitivity of either isoform to these drugs.",

C5BL/6 mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA or P. berghei NK65 and Hz-containing leukocytes were analysed using CD11b and Gr1 expression. Parasitized RBC from infected mice were identified using anti-Ter119 and SYBR green I and were analysed for depolarized Side Scatter. A highly depolarizing RBC population was monitored in an in-vitro culture incubated with chloroquine or quinine.\\n\\nRESULTS: A flow cytometer can be easily adapted to detect depolarized Side-Scatter and thus, intracellular Hz. The detection and counting of Hz containing leukocytes in fresh human or mouse blood, as well as in leukocytes from in-vitro experiments was rapid and easy. Analysis of CD14/CD16 and CD11b/Gr1 monocyte expression in human or mouse blood, in a mixed populations of Hz-containing and non-containing monocytes, appears to show distinct patterns in both types of cells. Hz-containing pRBC and different maturation stages could be detected in blood from infected mice. The analysis of a highly depolarizing population that contained mature pRBC allowed to assess the effect of chloroquine and quinine after only 2 and 4 hours, respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: A simple modification of a flow cytometer allows for rapid and reliable detection and quantification of Hz-containing leukocytes and the analysis of differential surface marker expression in the same sample of Hz-containing versus non-Hz-containing leukocytes. Importantly, it distinguishes different maturation stages of parasitized RBC and may be the basis of a rapid no-added-reagent drug sensitivity assay.",

        "abstract": "Background. A number of chemotherapeutic drugs are active in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) but so far choice of drugs for treatment is mostly empirically based. Testing of drug activity in tumour cells from patients might provide a rationale for a more individualised approach for drug selection. Material and methods. Sensitivity of EOC to chemotherapeutic drugs was analysed in 125 tumour samples from 112 patients using a short-term primary culture assay based on the concept of total cell kill. Sensitivity was related to tumour histology, treatment status and clinical tumour response. Results. For most EOC standard drugs serous high grade and clear cell EOC were the most sensitive subtypes and the mucinous tumours the most resistant subtype. Docetaxel, however, tended to show the opposite pattern. Samples from previously treated patients tended to be more resistant than those from treatment na\u00efve patients. The activity of cisplatin correlated with that of other drugs with the exception of docetaxel. Tumour samples from two sites in the same patient at the same occasion showed similar cisplatin sensitivity in contrast to samples taken at different occasions. Samples from patients responding in the clinic to treatment were more sensitive to most drugs than samples from non-responding patients. At the individual patient level, drug sensitivity in vitro compared with clinical response showed sensitivities and specificities in the 83-100% and 55-83% ranges, respectively. Conclusions. Assessment of EOC tumour cell drug sensitivity in vitro provides clinically relevant and potentially useful information for the optimisation of drug treatment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

A total trypanosome prevalence of 4.8% (95% CI: 1.8-7.5) and 20.4% (95% CI: 14-26.8) were recorded in the tsetse-controlled study area of Humbo district and the non-tsetse-controlled area of Mareka district, respectively, indicated statistically significant difference between the two areas (P < 0.001). The mean PCV value for Humbo and Mareka was 26.2 (95%: 25.7-26.7) and 22.7 (95% CI: 22.1-23.3), respectively, which were also statistically significant (P < 0.001). The prophylactic activity of isometamidium chloride (ISMM) was observed in Humbo on nine naturally positive zebu cattle. Breakthrough infections were recorded in (6/9) 66.7% of the cases in less than 5 weeks. A qualitative assay on mice was conducted on two T. congolense isolates obtained from the breakthrough cases with ranges of doses of ISMM and diminazene diaceturate (DA). Thereafter the mice were followed for relapse infection. ISMM at doses 0.5-4 mg/kg body weight (bw) and DA at doses of 3.5-28 mg/kg bw failed completely to cure T. congolense infections in any of the mice. A quantitative assay on mice was conducted on four T. congolense isolates obtained from Mareka. The four isolates were pooled into two pools (Pool-1 and Pool-2) for the quantitative assay on mice. The pooled isolates were tested with the same trypanocidal drugs and ranges of doses as it was used for the qualitative assay on mice. The minimum curative dose (MCD) of ISMM that cleared T. congolense infected mice was 4 and 2 mg/kg bw for Pool-1 and Pool-2, respectively, whereas MCD of DA was 28 and 14 mg/kg bw, in Pool-1 and Pool-2, respectively. Although cloned populations were not used to prove whether the observed resistance was at the individual level or not, the results show that there is resistance to both ISMM and DA; failure of the \"sanative pair\". ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "The High Throughput Biomedicine (HTB) unit at FIMM Technology Centre provides a wide range of biomedical high throughput assays. In collaboration with research groups and the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa, we have set up drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) platform with a set of 450 approved and investigational oncology drugs on patient samples. Ex vivo drug testing is currently performed at FIMM with primary cancer cells from patients with leukaemia and multiple myeloma as well as cancer cell lines and the drug sensitivity responses are integrated with molecular profiling such as exome sequencing, transcriptomics and phosphoproteomics. Currently, DSRT is run in 384-well plate format in 5 concentrations for each drug or in 1536-well plate format with 9 concentrations per drug and the assay plates are pre-drugged using acoustic droplet ejection with Labcyte Echo550. The viability and cell death of cells is measured after 72. h and results are analysed using Dotmatics Studies - software and an in-house developed interface, Breeze. Application of the platform to AML patient samples has uncovered taxonomic drug-response subtypes and individualised therapy based on DSRT has resulted in several clinical responses. The DSRT platform enables drug repositioning, provides new combinatorial possibilities and allows for linking drug sensitivities to predictive biomarkers. We are developing the platform with additional readouts and increasing the number of drugs. Our Labcyte Access Workstation, with Echo550 and Echo525 integration, allows development and set-up of miniaturised follow-up assays, such as reverse-phase protein array and qPCR, using non-contact acoustic dispensing.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) is a safety and reproducible test to assess activation of drug-specific T cells in vitro; however, there are several practical concerns such as the time of testing and the influence of treatment. Our aim was to define the right timing to perform LTT for determining the causative agent in various types of drug reactions. METHODS: Lymphocyte transformation test was performed at different time points during the evolution of three types of drug reactions, maculo-papular type of drug eruptions (MP), Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome/drug rash and eosinophilia with systemic symptoms (DIHS/DRESS). RESULTS: Positive LTT reactions were obtained when the test was performed at the acute stage but not the recovery stage in MP and SJS/TEN, while positive LTT reactions were obtained at the recovery stage but not the acute stage in DIHS/DRESS, regardless of treatment with systemic prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocyte transformation test is a reliable method to define the causative agent, when LTT is performed at the right timing depending on the type of drug reactions. Lymphocyte transformation test should be performed within 1 week after the onset of skin rashes in patients with MP and SJS/TEN; and 5-8 weeks after in patients with DIHS/DRESS, respectively.",

We undertook a study to evaluate the ability of three in vitro assay systems to define drug sensitivity of clinical isolates of the human hookworm parasite Necator americanus recovered from children resident in a village in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea. The assays entailed observation of drug effects on egg hatch (EHA), larval development (LDA), and motility of infective stage larvae (LMA). The egg hatch assay proved the best method for assessing the response to benzimidazole anthelmintics, while the larval motility assay was suitable for assessing the response to ivermectin. The performance of the larval development assay was unsatisfactory on account of interference caused by contaminating bacteria. A simple protocol was developed whereby stool samples were subdivided and used for immediate egg recovery, as well as for faecal culture, in order to provide eggs and infective larvae, respectively, for use in the egg hatch assay and larval motility assay systems. While the assays proved effective in quantifying drug sensitivity in larvae of the drug-susceptible hookworms examined in this study, their ability to indicate drug resistance in larval or adult hookworms remains to be determined. \u00a9 2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

We report herein information on the clinical features of two patients from the same family infected with this virus, the genomic sequences of the viruses harbored, and antiviral drug sensitivity.\nMETHODS: Clinical and epidemiological data of two patients from the same family were collected and analyzed. Sequencing was done for the viruses isolated from these two patients and one epidemiologically related chicken, and the sequences of the eight gene segments of the viruses were analyzed phylogenetically. The sensitivity of the viruses to antiviral drug treatment was determined by neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility test.\nRESULTS: The two patients from one family cluster shared the same symptoms but had different outcomes, and had a strong epidemiological link. Three strains, two from these two patients and one from the chicken, were isolated. Genome sequencing and analyses of phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the two viruses were almost identical. We noted the presence of the PB2 E627K amino acid substitution that was not present in isolates from the first wave, as well as two new mutations in the NA gene and six in the PB2 gene. Drug sensitivity testing showed that the new isolates were resistant to oseltamivir but sensitive to peramivir.\nCONCLUSIONS: The two patients from one family cluster were probable human-to-human transmission cases. The new isolates were sensitive to peramivir but showed reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir.",

These isolates were not selected based on the treatment outcome but on availability. The drug sensitivity profile for all available drugs in use and the diamidine compound DB75 was established. IC50 values were not significantly different between the \"old\" and \"new\" stocks. No indications for emerging drug resistance to any drug could be observed.

This disease is characterized by poor response to chemotherapy and short survival time. Therefore, it is of critical importance to identify and develop effective antitumor drugs against HS. The objectives of this study were to examine the drug sensitivities of 10 antitumor drugs. Using a real-time RT-PCR system, the mRNA expression levels of 16 genes related to drug resistance in 4 canine HS cell lines established from dogs with disseminated HS were determined and compared to 2 canine lymphoma cell lines (B-cell and T-cell). These 4 canine HS cell lines showed sensitivities toward microtubule inhibitors (vincristine, vinblastine and paclitaxel), comparable to those in the canine B-cell lymphoma cell line. Moreover, it was shown that P-gp in the HS cell lines used in this study did not have enough function to efflux its substrate. Sensitivities to melphalan, nimustine, methotrexate, cytarabine, doxorubicin and etoposide were lower in the 4 HS cell lines than in the 2 canine lymphoma cell lines. The data obtained in this study using cultured cell lines could prove helpful in the developing of advanced and effective chemotherapies for treating dogs that are suffering from HS.",

Between phase 1 and phase 2 the proportion of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin (ABPC)-susceptible (BLNAS) strains declined from 62.9% to 34.3%; the proportions of beta-lactamase-positive ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains were 8.3% and 6.4% in phases 1 and 2, but the proportion of beta-lactamase-negative ABPC-resistant (BLNAR) strains increased from 28.8% in phase 1 to 59.3% in phase 2. Comparison of the MIC(90) values of the antibacterial agents for H. influenzae in phase 1 and phase 2 showed that cefcapene, cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone, panipenem, and clarithromycin kept the same level, while cefdinir, faropenem, and rokitamycin showed 2-fold to 8-fold decreases. With the exception of the above antibiotics, all of the other antibacterial agents tested showed 2-fold to 4-fold increases. The MIC(90) values of the beta-lactam drugs for BLNAR were 2-fold to 32-fold higher than the values for BLNAS. The proportion of BLNAR H. influenzae strains rose dramatically over the 3 years between phases 1 and 2. In relation to age, prior administration of antibacterial agents, and attendance at a day nursery as background factors, no significant differences between BLNAS and BLNAR were detected in phase 1. In the phase 2 survey, the proportion of BLNAR strains showed significant differences between children under 3 years and those aged 3 years or more, and there were also significant differences according to whether antibacterial agents, especially beta-lactams, had been administered previously. No significant difference was found in resistant bacteria according to whether or not a child had attended a day nursery.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The onset of drug-resistance is a major cause of treatment failure in multiple myeloma (MM). While increasing evidence is defining the role of microRNAs in mediating drug-resistance, their potential activity as drug-sensitizing agents has not yet been investigated in MM. Experimental Design: Here we studied the potential utility of miR-221/222 inhibition in sensitizing refractory MM cells to melphalan. Results: MiR-221/222 expression inversely correlated with melphalan-sensitivity of MM cells. Inhibition of miR-221/222 overcame melphalan-resistance and triggered apoptosis of MM cells in vitro, in the presence or absence of human bone marrow stromal cells. Decreased MM cell growth induced by inhibition of miR-221/222 plus melphalan was associated with a marked upregulation of pro-apoptotic BBC3/PUMA protein, a miR-221/222 target, as well as with modulation of drug influx-efflux transporters SLC7A5/LAT1 and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCC1/MRP1. Finally, in vivo treatment of SCID/NOD mice bearing human melphalan-refractory MM xenografts with systemic LNA-i-miR-221 plus melphalan overcame drug-resistance, evidenced by growth inhibition with significant antitumor effects together with modulation of PUMA and ABCC1 in tumors retrieved from treated mice. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings provide the proof of concept that LNA-i-miR-221 can reverse melphalan-resistance in preclinical models of MM, providing the framework for clinical trials to overcome drug resistance and improve patient outcome in MM.",

DNA damage repair is an important mechanism of drug resistance which is responsible for metastasis and recurrence after chemotherapy.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) is expressed in osteosarcoma MG63 cell line and involved in drug resistance induced by DNA repair. We found that DNA-PKcs was expressed in osteosarcoma cell line MG63. The pDNA-PKcs(T2609) was more expressed in cells treated with cisplatin (DDP) and etoposide (VP16). Down-regulation of DNA-PKcs produced higher sensitivity of MG63 cells to DDP or VP16 through increasing apoptosis and causing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Our study supported that DNA-PKcs was involved in drug-induced DNA damage repair and related to chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma MG63 cells.",

Cultured platinum-sensitive testicular (833K) and platinum-resistant breast and bladder (MDA-MB-231 and T24, respectively) cancer cells were incubated with a subpharmacological concentration of oxaliplatin (0.2 microM). Both cellular and DNA radiocarbon contents in the drug-sensitive testicular cells had approximately twice the area under the curve as compared to the more platinum-resistant cell lines, implying that differential accumulation of the drug may be responsible for the sensitivity of cancer cells to platinum treatment. The lowest concentration of radiocarbon measured was approximately 1+/-0.1 amol/microg of DNA, when assaying 1 microg of DNA. This sensitivity for measuring oxaliplatin-DNA adducts is the highest reported to date. The sensitivity offered by this method may be applicable to other DNA-damaging drugs, metabolisms studies, and diagnostics development.",

        "abstract": "The stability of praziquantel (PZQ)-insusceptible S. mansoni isolates and the possible selection of PZQ-insusceptible parasites upon applying therapeutic pressure were examined over several life cycle passages (snails to mice). To test isolate stability, 3 PZQ-susceptible and 7 PZQ-insusceptible isolates were used to establish infection in mice, and they were passaged each for 2-5 life cycles. After each passage, 6 groups of mice were used to assess the PZQ dose at which the worm burden was decreased by 50% (ED50). Five of them were treated with doses of PZQ (12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg for 5 days) 7 wk after infection; the last group represented infected, but untreated, controls. Possible selection of PZQ-insusceptible parasites under therapeutic pressure was examined by subjecting 1 PZQ-susceptible and 1 PZQ-insusceptible S. mansoni isolate to therapeutic pressure by PZQ for 8 passages. After the final passage, PZQ ED50 was estimated. All PZQ-susceptible S. mansoni isolates showed stable susceptibility to PZQ (mean PZQ ED50 = 85 mg/kg) over all passages. Two of the 7 PZQ-insusceptible S. mansoni isolates (847 and ER5) showed normal sensitivity to PZQ in 1-2 passages (although not the last passage, and without a declining ED50 profile), whereas the remaining passages kept a sustained insusceptibility to the drug (mean PZQ ED50 = 217 mg/kg). Worm maturity and sex were irrelevant to variability in drug ED50 within an individual isolate over different passages, revealing the heterogeneous nature of the parasite. Therapeutic pressure for limited life cycle passages did not result in a significant increase in drug ED50. The fact that reversion of some of the PZQ-insusceptible S. mansoni isolates to normal drug-sensitive state is not long lasting and that the therapeutic pressure by PZQ in the field is not comparable with that in the laboratory (unlimited), make monitoring the response of patients to the drug in the field an integral part of schistosomiasis control measures.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malignant mesothelioma cells have an epithelioid or sarcomatoid morphology, both of which may be present in the same tumor. The sarcomatoid phenotype is associated with worse prognosis and heterogeneity of mesothelioma cells may contribute to therapy resistance, which is often seen in mesothelioma. This study aimed to investigate differences in sensitivity between mesothelioma cell lines to anti-cancer drugs. We studied two novel drugs, selenite and bortezomib and compared their effect to four conventional drugs. We also investigated the immunoreactivity of potential predictive markers for drug sensitivity; Pgp, MRP-1, ERCC1, RRM1, TS, xCT and proteasome 20S subunit.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We treated six mesothelioma cell lines with selenite, bortezomib, carboplatin, pemetrexed, doxorubicin or gemcitabine as single agents and in combinations. Viability was measured after 24 and 48 hours. Immunocytochemistry was used to detect predictive markers.\\n\\nRESULTS: As a single agent, selenite was effective on four out of six cell lines, and in combination with bortezomib yielded the greatest response in the studied mesothelioma cell lines. Cells with an epithelioid phenotype were generally more sensitive to the different drugs than the sarcomatoid cells. Extensive S-phase arrest was seen in pemetrexed-sensitive cell lines. MRP-1 predicted sensitivity of cell lines to treatment with carboplatin and xCT predicted pemetrexed effect.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The observed heterogeneity in sensitivity of mesothelioma cell lines with different morphology highlights the need for more individualized therapy, requiring development of methods to predict drug sensitivity of individual tumors. Selenite and bortezomib showed a superior effect compared to conventional drugs, motivating clinical testing of these agents as future treatment regime components for patients with malignant mesothelioma.",

        "abstract": "Folate, a vitamin of the B group involved in one-carbon group metabolism, plays an important role in DNA synthesis and methylation. Several polymorphisms in the genes involved in folate uptake and biotransformations have been shown to be associated to the risk of cancer and to anticancer drug response. We studied common polymorphisms in MTHFR (N5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase), MTHFD1 (N5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase), MTR (methionine synthetase) and SLC19A1 (reduced folate carrier) in the panel of 60 human tumour cell lines established by the NCI for anticancer drug screening and we tentatively associated these polymorphisms with gene expression and drug cytotoxicity as extracted from the public database of the Developmental Therapeutic Programme. We observed a consistent and highly significant association between the presence of the variant C allele of the A>C1298 polymorphism of MTHFR and the sensitivity to many anticancer drugs belonging to the classes of antifolates, antimetabolites, alkylating agents and, to a lesser extent, topoisomerase inhibitors. In contrast, the T variant allele of the C>T677 variation of MTHFR was rather associated to lower sensitivity of the cell lines towards anticancer drugs (alkylating agents, antifolates and antimetabolites) but with much lower effects than the A>C1298 variation. The polymorphisms of the other genes studied were not associated with differences in anticancer drug sensitivity, but the expression of the SLC19A1 gene was significantly correlated with the sensitivity to several drugs (antifolates, thiopurines, nitrosoureas, and DACH-platinum drugs). We concluded that the NCI-60 panel may constitute a good starting point for implementing clinical studies aimed at discovering and validating predictive genetic markers of drug efficacy and/or toxicity. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

With the aim to further evaluate the role of this enzyme in cell biology, we stably modulated its expression the human glioblastoma cell ADF in which the transient inhibition of cN-II has been shown to induce cell death. Stable cell lines were obtained both with inhibition, obtained with plasmids coding cN-II-targeting short hairpin RNA, and stimulation, obtained with plasmids coding Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP)-fused wild type cN-II or a GFP-fused hyperactive mutant (GFP-cN-II-R367Q), of cN-II expression. Silenced cells displayed a decreased proliferation rate while the over expressing cell lines displayed an increased proliferation rate as evidenced by impedance measurement using the xCELLigence device. The expression of nucleotide metabolism relevant genes was only slightly different between cell lines, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in transfected cells. Cells with decreased cN-II expression were resistant to the nucleoside analog fludarabine confirming the involvement of cN-II in the metabolism of this drug. Finally, we observed sensitivity to cisplatin in cN-II silenced cells and resistance to this same drug in cN-II over-expressing cells indicating an involvement of cN-II in the mechanism of action of platinum derivatives, and most probably in DNA repair. In summary, our findings confirm some previous data on the role of cN-II in the sensitivity of cancer cells to cancer drugs, and suggest its involvement in other cellular phenomenon such as cell proliferation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aberrant choline metabolism has been proposed as a novel cancer hallmark. We recently showed that epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) possesses an altered MRS-choline profile, characterised by increased phosphocholine (PCho) content to which mainly contribute over-expression and activation of choline kinase-alpha (ChoK-alpha). METHODS: To assess its biological relevance, ChoK-alpha expression was downmodulated by transient RNA interference in EOC in vitro models. Gene expression profiling by microarray analysis and functional analysis was performed to identify the pathway/functions perturbed in ChoK-alpha-silenced cells, then validated by in vitro experiments. RESULTS: In silenced cells, compared with control, we observed: (I) a significant reduction of both CHKA transcript and ChoK-alpha protein expression; (II) a dramatic, proportional drop in PCho content ranging from 60 to 71%, as revealed by (1)H-magnetic spectroscopy analysis; (III) a 35-36% of cell growth inhibition, with no evidences of apoptosis or modification of the main cellular survival signalling pathways; (IV) 476 differentially expressed genes, including genes related to lipid metabolism. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified cellular functions related to cell death and cellular proliferation and movement as the most perturbed. Accordingly, CHKA-silenced cells displayed a significant delay in wound repair, a reduced migration and invasion capability were also observed. Furthermore, although CHKA silencing did not directly induce cell death, a significant increase of sensitivity to platinum, paclitaxel and doxorubicin was observed even in a drug-resistant context. CONCLUSION: We showed for the first time in EOC that CHKA downregulation significantly decreased the aggressive EOC cell behaviour also affecting cells' sensitivity to drug treatment. These observations open the way to further analysis for ChoK-alpha validation as a new EOC therapeutic target to be used alone or in combination with conventional drugs.",

        "abstract": "Tumor derived cell lines have been in use for cancer drug profiling as evidenced by the establishment of NCI-60 panel as a drug discovery tool in early 1990s. In recent years, due to the advancement of targeted therapies in cancer, screening of larger cell panels with greater genetic heterogeneity has become very important not only to measure efficacy of the compounds but also for identifying the biomarkers that are responsible for the efficacy. Here we present data from OncoPredictorSM, a cellular screening and bioinformatics platform able to (1) evaluate multiple types of genomic biomarkers for association with in vitro drug response and (2) analyze identified biomarkers in clinical tumor populations, thereby suggesting potential drug development strategies. The cellular screening component, OncoPanelTM, is comprised of a large panel of human tumor-derived cell lines from different origins with broad genetic heterogeneity providing a sensitive method of comparing proliferation or cytotoxicity (resistance or sensitivity) across genotypes. Our cell line panel consists of 240 cell lines that span a wide variety tumor tissue types including lung, breast, stomach, colon, ovary, liver, skin, kidney, bladder, prostate, pancreas, head and neck, brain, hematopoetic, and lymphoid tumors. We have mRNA expression, SNP and mutation data to characterize these cell lines. The media and culture conditions are standardized and optimized so that the genetic heterogeneity of the cell line will be responsible for the phenotypic responses obtained. We generate simultaneous data for each compound at 10 concentrations (in triplicates) resulting in precise IC50/EC50 values for analysis and comparison. Results from a case study will be presented to depict the very robust data quality including the doubling time for the cell lines. Also, sensitive and resistance data with 11 known anticancer agents including inhibitors of mTorr, ABL, MEK, PDGF, VEGF, FLT3, Aurora kinases, HSP90, EGFR, Topo II, and microtubulin disassembly will be presented using the robust high content data from these cell lines. As expected, the most sensitive cell lines against a clinical ABL inhibitor were the CML-derived cell lines. On the other hand, many of the colon, melanoma and pancreatic cell lines were sensitive to MEK inhibitor. Sensitive and resistant cells were further profiled against, mutation, expression, and SNP data to identify genes involved in the sensitive/resistant phenotypes using sophisticated bioinformatic analysis tools to identify genomic biomarker profiles and to estimate their frequency in clinical populations (data presented separately). OncoPredictor is ideally suited for prioritization of the leads, positioning of the leads against cancer types, repositioning of clinical candidates or drugs for supplemental indication, combination therapies, and for biomarker identification and characterization in clinical populations.",

        "abstract": "To improve the efficacy of therapeutic options in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) an in vitro system to determine the response of mononuclear blood cells from blood of patients was elaborated. The study combines four approaches, i.e., cell viability, apoptosis rate, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and immunoblotting to develop personalized therapy protocols based on the cell sensitivity to drug exposure of individual CLL patients. The complementary analyses were performed on 28 peripheral blood samples from previously untreated CLL patients before therapy. The induction and progress of apoptosis in CLL cells exposed in vitro to purine analogs combined with mafosfamide, i.e., cladribine + mafosfamide (CM) and fludarabine + mafosfamide (FM) were assessed using the above approaches. The changes in thermal profiles (decrease/loss of transition at 95+/-5 C) coincided with an accumulation of apoptotic cells, a decrease in the number of viable cells, and differences in the expression of the apoptosisrelated protein PARP1. No significant changes were observed in the thermal profiles of nuclei isolated from CLL cells resistant to the treatment. The complementary assays revealed a strong relationship between both the in vitro sensitivity of leukemia cells to drugs and the clinical response of the patients, determined usually after the sixth course of treatment (after ~6 months of therapy). As a summary of studies followed by complementary tests, our findings demonstrate the value of in vitro exposure of CLL cell samples to drugs intended to treat CLL patients, before their administration in order to recommend the most suitable and effective therapy for individual patients.",

        "abstract": "Histone deacetylation and DNA methylation have a central role in the control of gene expression in tumours, including transcriptional repression of tumour suppressor genes and genes involved in sensitivity to chemotherapy. Treatment of cisplatin-resistant cell lines with an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases, 2-deoxy-5'azacytidine (decitabine), results in partial reversal of DNA methylation, re-expression of epigenetically silenced genes including hMLH1 and sensitisation to cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo. We have investigated whether the combination of decitabine and a clinically relevant inhibitor of histone deacetylase activity (belinostat, PXD101) can further increase the re-expression of genes epigenetically silenced by DNA methylation and enhance chemo-sensitisation in vivo at well-tolerated doses. The cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cell line A2780/cp70 has the hMLH1 gene methylated and is resistant to cisplatin both in vitro and when grown as a xenograft in mice. Treatment of A2780/cp70 with decitabine and belinostat results in a marked increase in expression of epigenetically silenced MLH1 and MAGE-A1 both in vitro and in vivo when compared with decitabine alone. The combination greatly enhanced the effects of decitabine alone on the cisplatin sensitivity of xenografts. As the dose of decitabine that can be given to patients and hence the maximum pharmacodynamic effect as a demethylating agent is limited by toxicity and eventual re-methylation of genes, we suggest that the combination of decitabine and belinostat could have a role in the efficacy of chemotherapy in tumours that have acquired drug resistance due to DNA methylation and gene silencing.",

We studied the in vitro drug resistance by the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) in 132 children with AML and 178 children with ALL (aged 0-17 years). In AML, children with t(9;11) (n = 10) were significantly more sensitive to cytarabine (P < 0.001) and doxorubicin (P = 0.005) than non-11q23 rearranged patients (n = 108). Children with other 11q23 rearrangements (n = 14) differed less from non-rearranged children. The 'AML-profile' common to all three groups included relative resistance to glucocorticoids and vincristine. In ALL, children with 11q23 rearrangement (n = 22) were significantly more sensitive to cytarabine (P = 0.026) than children without 11q23 rearrangement (n = 156), also after stratification for white blood cell count. In conclusion, the findings indicate that the cellular drug resistance is correlated to both the cell lineage and the type of 11q23 rearrangement. High cellular sensitivity to cytarabine and doxorubicin might explain the excellent treatment results in children with AML and t(9;11). The present study supports the strategy of contemporary protocols to include high-dose cytarabine in the treatment of 11q23-positive patients both in AML and ALL.",

However, the potential role of NPM involved in drug-resistance in leukemia has not been investigated clearly. In this study, we generated an adriamycin (ADM)-resistant lymphoblastic cell line Molt-4/ADR (MAR) by stepwise induction. Cell proliferation, sensitivity to chemotherapy agents and expressions of drug resistance related molecules were assessed. The IC50 of Molt-4 cells were 0.58\u00b10.11\u03bcmol/L and MAR cells were 22.56\u00b11.94\u03bcmol/L, meaning MAR cells were 38.63 fold resistant to Molt-4 cells. Furthermore, MAR cells gained an expression of mdr-1 (P-gp) and a higher expression of NPM compared to Molt-4 cells. Knockdown of NPM by RNA interference (RNAi) suppressed the viability of both Molt-4 and MAR cells. After NPM RNAi, the IC50 of MAR and Molt-4 cells were 3.83\u00b10.38\u03bcmol/L and 0.19\u00b10.02\u03bcmol/L respectively. Both of them revealed an increase of drug sensitivity with down-regulation of mdr-1 and Akt/mTOR signaling. Knockdown of mdr-1 could also reverse the drug resistance, with no change in NPM expression. It could be concluded that knockdown of NPM reversed the drug resistance by down-regulating P-gp and Akt/mTOR signal pathway, indicating that NPM may serve as a potential modulator in drug resistance.",

It has been reported that the success rate of CD-DST is 64.0% in the case of colorectal cancer. Therefore, the sampling and washing of specimens before culture are extremely important. By washing specimens carefully with normal saline containing antibiotics, we achieved a success rate of 85.3% in the case of colorectal cancer. To improve the success rate, we started specimen irrigation with a large amount of normal saline in January 2007. As a result, a success rate exceeding 90% was acquired. For the success of CD-DST for colorectal cancer, it is important to irrigate specimens many times with a large amount of normal saline.",

Thus the EGFR kinase has long been recognized as a potential drug target in oncology, and small-molecule inhibitors have been under development for more than two decades. As a result of their effectiveness in treating non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) driven by somatic mutations in the EGFR kinase, gefitinib and erlotinib were the first EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) approved for clinical use. Ironically, these drugs found their target against mutant forms of the EGFR kinase, which have altered enzyme active sites, and not against the wild type (WT) kinase against which their potency and selectivity was carefully honed. Here we review recent structural and enzymological studies that explore the exquisite sensitivity of a subset of these lung cancer mutants to gefitinib and erlotinib.

        "abstract": "In B-CLL, non-proliferating B cells accumulate due to defective apoptosis. Cytotoxic therapies trigger apoptosis and deregulation of apoptotic pathways contributes to chemoresistance. Loss of the apoptosis-promoting Bax has been implicated in resistance to cytotoxic therapy. We therefore evaluated ex vivo drug sensitivity of CLL, producing chemoresponse data which are prognostic indicators for B-CLL, in particular in the case of purine nucleoside analogs. To analyze the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance, we compared endogenous Bax and Bcl-2 expression to ex vivo response to eight drugs, and to survival in 39 B-CLL patients. We found that reduced Bax levels correlated well with ex vivo resistance to traditional B-CLL therapies - anthracyclines, alkylating agents and vincristine (all P < 0.04). Surprisingly, no such relationship was observed for the purine nucleoside analogs or corticosteroids (all P > 0.5). Mutational analysis of p53 could not explain the loss of Bax protein expression. Levels of Bcl-2 were not associated with sensitivity to any drug. In contrast to the ex vivo data, neither Bax or Bcl-2 expression nor doxorubicin sensitivity were associated with increased survival whereas sensitivity to fludarabine correlated with better overall survival (P = 0.031). These findings suggest that the resistance to purine nucleoside analogs and corticosteroids in B-CLL is due to inactivation of pathways different from those activated by anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids and alkylating agents and may be the molecular rationale for the efficacy of purine analogs in this disease.",

According to recent surveys, as many as 100 million Americans will consume gluten-free products within a year. Operating under the concept that the GFD benefits only individuals with celiac disease, health care professionals have struggled to separate the wheat from the chaff; there are claims that eliminating gluten from the diet increases health and helps with weight loss, or even that gluten can be harmful to every human being. However, apart from unfounded trends, a disorder related to inges-tion of gluten or gluten-containing cereals, namely non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), has resurfaced in the literature, fueling a debate on the appropriateness of the GFD for people without celiac disease. Although there is clearly a fad component to the popularity of the GFD, there is also undisputable and increasing evidence for NCGS. However, we require a better understanding of the clinical presentation of NCGS, as well as its pathogenesis, epide-miology, management, and role in conditions such as irri-table bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue, and autoimmunity. Before we can begin to identify and manage NCGS, there must be agreement on the nomenclature and definition of the disorder based on proper peer-reviewed scientific in-formation. We review the most recent findings on NCGS and outline directions to dissipate some of the confusion related to this disorder.",

        "abstract": "We showed that the drug sensitivity of multidrug-resistant (MDR) cells could be enhanced by fractionated irradiation. The molecular changes associated with fractionated radiation-induced chemosensitization were characterized. Irradiated cells of the multidrug-resistant CEM/MDR sublines (CEM/MDR/IR1, 2 and 3) showed a loss of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and concurrent reduction of Ku DNA binding and DNA-PK activities with decreased level of Ku70/80 and increased level of DNA-PKcs, and these changes were followed by an increased susceptibility to anticancer drugs. These irradiated MDR cells also exhibited the reduction of other chemoresistance-related proteins, including BCL2, NF-kappaB, EGFR, MDM2 and Ku70/80, and the suppression of HIF-1alpha expression induced by hypoxia. In contrast, fractionated irradiation increased the levels of these proteins and induced drug resistance in the parental drug-sensitive CEM cells. These results suggest that the chemoresistance-related proteins are differentially modulated in drug-sensitive and MDR cells by fractionated irradiation, and the optimized treatment with fractionated radiation could lead to new chemoradiotherapeutic strategies to treat multidrug-resistant tumors.",

Therefore, selective targeting of the key biochemical events of the malignant cells may have a great therapeutic potential in specifically kill the cancer cells. We have evaluated in vitro the cytotoxic efficacy of a previously reported copper complex viz. copper N-(2-hydroxy acetophenone) glycinate (CuNG) on different drug sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines by MTT, annexin V positivity and caspase 3 activation assays. We have also investigated the underlying signalling events in CuNG mediated apoptosis of cancer cells by Western blotting technique. We have found that CuNG preferentially induces apoptosis to malignant cells irrespective of drug sensitivity and spares the normal cells. Our studies disclose that CuNG causes cellular redox imbalance in cancer cells through depletion of intracellular GSH level. CuNG mediated depletion of intracellular GSH level induces mitochondrial superoxide generation, which detaches cyto C from mitochondrial membrane through lipid peroxidation. The detached cyto C then release into the extra mitochondrial milieu in Bax mediated pathway where CuNG facilitates the binding of Bax through dissociation of hexokinase II from mitochondrial membrane. The present study opens the possibility of developing effective chemotherapeutic drugs by synthesizing numerous chemical compounds capable of targeting cellular redox environment and thus specifically kills cancer cells of broad spectrum.",

To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter clinical trial that has employed CD-DST to choose anticancer agents for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. Methods: Subjects (n\ufffd\ufffd=\ufffd\ufffd64) were patients with advanced or recurrent gastric cancer. Patients were allocated to one of the treatment regimens on the basis of CD-DST results. Outcome of the patients was compared between the groups deemed chemosensitive or chemoresistant by the CD-DST. Results: Thirty-three patients showed high sensitivity (T/C ratio <60\ufffd\ufffd%) to at least one type of anticancer agent (sensitive group), and 31 showed low sensitivity (T/C ratio \ufffd%\ufffd60\ufffd\ufffd%) to all agents (resistant group). Specifically, the 1-year survival rate was significantly higher in the sensitive group (78.5\ufffd\ufffd%; 95\ufffd\ufffd% CI, 67.2\ufffd_\"94.7\ufffd\ufffd%) than in the resistant group (54.7\ufffd\ufffd%; 95\ufffd\ufffd% CI, 38.7\ufffd_\"74.3\ufffd\ufffd%; P\ufffd\ufffd=\ufffd\ufffd0.019), whereas time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the sensitive group (59.8\ufffd\ufffd%; 95\ufffd\ufffd% CI, 48.2\ufffd_\"81.7\ufffd\ufffd%) than in the resistant group (30.0\ufffd\ufffd%; 95\ufffd\ufffd% CI 13.6\ufffd_\"46.4\ufffd\ufffd%; P\ufffd\ufffd=\ufffd\ufffd0.023). Median survival time was also significantly longer in the sensitive group (15.5\ufffd\ufffdmonths; 95\ufffd\ufffd% CI, 12.8\ufffd_\"18.2) than in the resistant group (12.5\ufffd\ufffdmonths; 95\ufffd\ufffd% CI, 10.2\ufffd_\"14.9; P\ufffd\ufffd=\ufffd\ufffd0.038).

Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24) has been demonstrated to play an important role in drug resistance in human cancer cell lines. However, the reversing effect of mda-7/IL-24 on drug resistance of human glioma is not fully clear. Here, we investigated the effects of overexpression of the mda-7/IL-24 gene in human glioma. We established a cisplatin-resistant U87 glioma cell line and found that mda-7/IL-24 was highly correlated with drug resistance. Furthermore, we investigated the apoptotic rate, intracellular accumulation of Rhodamine-123, and expression of glutathione and P-glycoprotein. The over-expression of mda-7/IL-24 enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity and reversal of drug resistance in glioma cells. The reversing effect of mda-7/IL-24 on drug resistance was induced mainly through the regulation of drug resistance-related genes and efflux drug pumps. Thus, mda-7/IL-24 can be used as a promising predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for chemotherapy in glioma. Anat Rec, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "title": "Changes in the status of p53 affect drug sensitivity to thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors by altering TS levels",
        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) resistance to fluoropyrimidines and other inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (TS) is a serious clinical problem often associated with increased intracellular levels of TS. Since the tumour suppressor gene p53, which is mutated in 50% of CRC, regulates the expression of several genes, it may modulate TS activity, and changes in the status of p53 might be responsible for chemoresistance. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate TS levels and sensitivity to TS inhibitors in wild-type (wt) and mutant (mt) p53 CRC cells, Lovo and WiDr, respectively, transfected with mt and wt p53. Lovo 175X2 cells (transfected with mt p53) were more resistant to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 2-fold), nolatrexed (3-fold), raltitrexed (3-fold) and pemetrexed (10-fold) in comparison with the wt p53 parental cells Lovo 92. Resistance was associated with an increase in TS protein expression and catalytic activity, which might be caused by the loss of the inhibitory effect on the activity of TS promoter or by the lack of TS mRNA degradation, as suggested by the reversal of TS expression to the levels of Lovo 92 cells by adding actinomycin. In contrast, Lovo li cells, characterized by functionally inactive p53, were 3-13-fold more sensitive to nolatrexed, raltitrexed and pemetrexed, and had a lower TS mRNA, protein expression and catalytic activity than Lovo 92. However, MDM-2 expression was significantly higher in Lovo li, while no significant differences were observed in Lovo 175X2 cells with respect to Lovo 92. Finally, mt p53 WiDr transfected with wt p53 were not significantly different from mt p53 WiDr cells with respect to sensitivity to TS inhibitors or TS levels. Altogether, these results indicate that changes in the status of p53, can differently alter sensitivity to TS inhibitors by affecting TS levels, depending on activity or cell line, and might explain the lack of clear correlation between mutations in p53 and clinical outcome after chemotherapy with TS inhibitors. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a key enzyme in the de novo synthesis of deoxythymidine-5 0 -monophosphate (dTMP; Carreras and Santi, 1995), an essential precursor for DNA replication. Therefore, one of the first rational approaches to pharmacological treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) was based upon fluoropyr-imidine inhibitors of this enzyme, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Danenberg et al, 1999; Rose et al, 2002). A major mechanism of resistance to 5-FU is overexpression of TS (Peters et al, 2002). At transcriptional level, TS expression is activated by the trans-cription factor E2F1, which plays a key role in cell cycle progression (DeGregori et al, 1995), and appears to be inhibited by the tumour suppressor gene p53 (Lee et al, 1997). In addition, TS protein functions as an RNA binding protein repressing the translation of its own mRNA (Chu et al, 1991, 1993), as well as of that of the oncogene c-myc (Chu et al, 1995) and of p53 (Ju et al, 1999). The relationship between p53 and TS may be altered by mutations affecting p53, which occur in approximately 50% of CRC (Hollstein et al, 1991; Soussi et al, 2006). Mutations in p53 have been related with resistance to chemotherapy (Lowe et al, 1993) and CRC cells with p53 mutated or disrupted through homologous recombination were less sensitive to 5-FU (O'Connor et al, 1997; Bunz et al, 1999). However, no clear survival benefit for wild-type (wt) p53 was observed in our previous study of 5-FU treated CRC patients (Van Triest et al, 2000), and the presence of p53 mutations failed to predict which patients would benefit from 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy in large retrospective clinical trials (Allegra et al, 2003; Russo et al, 2005). Indeed, although p53 is one of the most widely studied genes in CRC, yet there is no single guideline in gastrointestinal oncology recommending the routine analysis of p53 status for the assessment of drug response (Hoff, 2005). In the present study, we aimed to clarify the role of p53 as a possible resistance factor for TS inhibitors. For this purpose, we used mutant (mt) and wt p53 transfected cell lines to study the effect of p53 mutations on TS expression and activity levels as well",

Study 1 tested this hypothesis using a sample of college students (N = 379) whereas Study 2 (N = 104) was conducted using a community sample of adults. Both studies operationalized EC by a self-report measure. For a subsample in Study 2 (N = 80), ability to delay gratification at age 4 was also used as an early behavioral precursor of EC in adulthood. In both studies, high RS was associated with increased BP features among people low in self-reported EC. Among those high in self-reported EC, the relationship between RS and BP features was attenuated. Study 2 found parallel findings using preschool delay ability as a behavioral index of EC. These findings suggest that EC may protect high RS people against BP features.",

To validate these correlations, we investigated the expression of these two genes and the chemosensitivities in 12 additional gastric cancer cell lines. The expression of AKR1B1 in the additional cell lines exhibited significant correlations with sensitivities to 8 of the 23 drugs examined, while that of CTSH displayed a significant negative correlation with only one (MS-247) of the 27 drugs examined. Their expressions were weakly correlated with sensitivity and resistance, respectively, to the remainder of the drugs. Moreover, when the 12 cell lines were divided into high-expressing and low-expressing groups, a comparison of these groups using Mann-Whitney's U test revealed that high expression levels of AKR1B1 and CTSH were related to sensitivity to 21 of the drugs and resistance to 8 of the drugs, respectively.

DNA-binding fluorescent dyes like SYBR Green I may allow field laboratories, proximal to P. falciparum collection sites, to conduct drug assays. In 2007-2008, we assayed 121 P. falciparum field isolates from western Kenya for 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) against 6 antimalarial drugs using a SYBR Green I in vitro assay: 91 immediate ex vivo (IEV) and 30 culture-adapted, along with P. falciparum reference clones D6 (chloroquine [CQ] sensitive) and W2 (CQ resistant). We also assessed P. falciparum mdr1 (Pfmdr1) copy number and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at four codons. The IC(50)s for IEV and culture-adapted P. falciparum isolates were similar, and approximated historical IC(50)s. For Pfmdr1, mean copy number was 1, with SNPs common at codons 86 and 184. The SYBR Green I assay adapted well to our field-based laboratory, for both IEV and culture-adapted P. falciparum, warranting continued use.",

        "abstract": "Objective: We determined whether hepatic intra-arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with synchronous hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, in whom the primary lesion was resectable but hepatic metastatic lesions were non-resectable helped improve survival time when administered on the basis of the results of the anticancer drug sensitivity test. Patients and methods: The study population consisted of 29 patients with synchronous hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer who underwent surgical resection of the primary lesion alone. Of these 29 patients, 21 received hepatic intra-arterial infusion of 5-FU postoperatively after the 5-FU sensitivity test. The remaining 8 patients underwent surgical resection of the primary lesion but neither sensitivity testing nor hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy. Tissue fragments were cultured, with each concentration of 5-FU in the thermoreversible gelation polymer forming a three-dimensional structure at 37??C. The viability of tumor cells was evaluated according to WST methods; inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) values were calculated. We considered cancer tissue to be sensitive to IC50 values that were below twice the peak plasma concentration (120 ??g/ml). Results: Of the 21 patients, 10 had sensitivity to 5-FU and 11 had no sensitivity. The response rates were 90.0% and 9.1%, respectively. The median survival times were 38 months and 10 months in these groups, respectively, and 7 months in patients who received no chemotherapy. This finding indicates a significantly longer survival time in the sensitive group, compared with either the insensitive group or the no chemotherapy group (P = .0014 P = .0023). The cumulative survival rate was significantly higher in the sensitive group compared with the insensitive group (P = .0001). Conclusions: Ultimately, the group with sensitivity to 5-FU showed a significantly longer median survival time than the insensitive group. ?? 2006 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment can profoundly affect tumor cell survival as well as alter antitumor drug activity. However, conventional anticancer drug screening typically is performed in the absence of stromal cells. Here, we analyzed survival of myeloma cells co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) using an automated fluorescence microscope platform, ScanR. By staining the cell nuclei with DRAQ5, we could distinguish between BMSC and myeloma cells, based on their staining intensity and nuclear shape. Using the apoptotic marker YO-PRO-1, the effects of drug treatment on the viability of the myeloma cells in the presence of stromal cells could be measured. The method does not require cell staining before incubation with drugs, and less than 5000 cells are required per condition. The method can be used for large-scale screening of anticancer drugs on primary myeloma cells. This study shows the importance of stromal cell support for primary myeloma cell survival in vitro, as half of the cell samples had a marked increase in their viability when cultured in the presence of BMSC. Stromal cell-induced protection against common myeloma drugs is also observed with this method.",

        "abstract": "Constitutively activated signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) are reported to cause uncontrolled transmission of growth signals. In this study, we analyzed the roles of an inhibitor of STAT, protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) 3, in the development of lung cancer. Treatment with an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, LY294002, retarded the growth of human lung cancer cells and rendered them more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents. However, the inhibition of JAK/STAT by AG490 significantly suppressed cell growth but did not increase drug sensitivity at all. Overexpression of PIAS3 not only significantly inhibited cell growth but also rendered cancer cells up to 12.0-fold more sensitive to the above drugs, which was associated with the suppression of Akt phosphorylation. Inhibition of PIAS3 with small interfering RNA, nevertheless, led cancer cells to accelerate cell proliferation, deteriorate chemosensitivity, and augment Akt phosphorylation. Although the overexpression of suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 in cancer cells also inhibited cell growth and STAT3 phosphorylation, it neither increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs nor affected the phosphorylation of Akt. These results indicate that PIAS3 may be an attractive candidate for targeting the JAK/STAT and PI3-K/Akt signaling pathways in cancer treatment.",

Sensitivities to components of AL and DP are impacted by polymorphisms in pfmdr1 and pfcrt. We monitored changes in prevalences of polymorphisms in Tororo, Uganda, from 2008 to 2012.\\n\\nMETHODS: Polymorphic loci in pfmdr1 and pfcrt were characterized in samples from 312 children randomized to AL or DP for each episode of uncomplicated malaria (50 samples per arm for each 3-month interval) utilizing a fluorescent microsphere assay. Treatment outcomes and impacts of prior therapies were also characterized.\\n\\nRESULTS: Prevalence increased significantly over time for pfmdr1 N86 (AL: odds ratio [OR], 2.08 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.83-2.38]; DP: 1.41 [95% CI, 1.25-1.57]), pfmdr1 D1246 (AL: 1.46 [95% CI, 1.29-1.64]; DP: 1.36 [95% CI, 1.23-1.50]), and pfcrt K76 (AL: 3.37 [95% CI, 1.85-6.16]; DP: 5.84 [95% CI, 1.94-17.53], and decreased for pfmdr1 Y184 (AL: 0.78 [95% CI, .70-.86]; DP: 0.84 [95% CI, .76-1.50]); changes were consistently greater in the AL arm. Recent AL treatment selected for pfmdr1 N86, D1246, and 184F in subsequent episodes; DP selected for the opposite alleles.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Genotypes with decreased sensitivity to AL components increased over time. This increase was greater in children receiving AL, suggesting that the choice of treatment regimen can profoundly influence parasite genetics and drug sensitivity.

        "abstract": "Expression of gangliosides and alterations in their composition have been observed during cell proliferation and differentiation and in certain cell cycle phases, brain development and cancer malignancy. To investigate the characteristics of GM3 synthase, SAT-I mRNA and ganglioside GM3 expression levels in lung cancer, we examined the expression levels of SAT-I mRNA as well as GM3 in 40 tumor tissues surgically removed from non-small cell lung cancer patients. Adenocarcinoma tissues expressed SAT-I mRNA levels that were significantly higher than those of squamous and other carcinomas (P < 0.0001). Moreover, the SAT-I mRNA levels were high in the bronchioalveolar carcinoma subtype and low in the solid and mucin subtypes of adenocarcinomas (P = 0.049, 0.049 and 0.013, respectively). To clarify the relationship between SAT-I mRNA and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor sensitivity, we carried out drug sensitivity tests for the EGFR-TK inhibitors gefitinib and AG1478 using eight adenocarcinoma cell lines expressing no EGFR mutations. The IC(50) values for gefitinib and AG1478 decreased dramatically with increasing SAT-I mRNA levels (R(2) = 0.81 and 0.59, respectively), representing a wide range of drug sensitivities among adenocarcinoma cell lines. To explore a possible mechanism of how GM3 could enhance the sensitivity to EGFR-TK inhibitors, the SAT-I gene was introduced stably into a GM3-negative clone of murine 3LL lung cancer cells to produce GM3-reconstituted clones. We found an increase in EGFR protein levels and gefitinib sensitivity in GM3-reconstituted cells, suggesting the involvement of GM3 in the turnover of EGFR protein. Therefore, it is highly expected that, by measuring the expression levels of SAT-I mRNA in lung biopsy samples from non-small cell lung cancer patients, enhanced pathological identification and individualized chemotherapeutic strategies can be established for the appropriate use of EGFR-TK inhibitors.",

In this study, we analyzed TOP1 gene copy number variation in tumor tissue from CRC patients and CRC cell lines with different sensitivities to the TOP1 inhibitor SN-38 and oxaliplatin.\\n\\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A TOP1 gene probe with a chromosome 20 centromere (CEN-20) reference probe was applied on normal mucosa and on tumor tissue from 50 stage III CRC patients. Additionally, associations between TOP1/CEN-20 ratio and in vitro sensitivity to SN-38 (irinotecan) and oxaliplatin were tested on 10 CRC cell lines. Results. In the malignant epithelium, 84% of the samples demonstrated an increased TOP1 gene copy number and 64% had an increased TOP1/CEN-20 ratio compared with the non-affected mucosa. Sixteen (32%) of the tumors had a ratio of \u2265 1.5 and 9 (18%) of these had a ratio of \u2265 2.0. A positive association was observed between the TOP1 gene copy number and the TOP1/CEN-20 ratio and in vitro sensitivity toward SN-38, but not toward oxaliplatin.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: A large fraction of the clinical samples demonstrated increased TOP1 gene copy number and increased TOP1/CEN-20 ratio.

        "abstract": "Fungal histidine kinase receptors (HKRs) sense and transduce many extracellular signals. We investigated the role of HKRs in morphogenetic transition, osmotolerance, oxidative stress response, and mating ability in the opportunistic yeast Candida lusitaniae. We isolated three genes, SLN1, NIK1, and CHK1, potentially encoding HKRs of classes VI, III, and X, respectively. These genes were disrupted by a transformation system based upon the \"URA3 blaster\" strategy. Functional analysis of disruptants was undertaken, except for the sln1 nik1 double mutant and the sln1 nik1 chk1 triple mutant, which are not viable in C. lusitaniae. The sln1 mutant revealed a high sensitivity to oxidative stress, whereas both the nik1 and chk1 mutants exhibited a more moderate sensitivity to peroxide. We also showed that the NIK1 gene was implicated in phenylpyrrole and dicarboximide compound susceptibility while HKRs seem not to be involved in resistance toward antifungals of clinical relevance. Concerning mating ability, all disruptants were still able to reproduce sexually in vitro in unilateral or bilateral crosses. The most important result of this study was that the sln1 mutant displayed a global defect of pseudohyphal differentiation, especially in high-osmolarity and oxidative-stress conditions. Thus, the SLN1 gene could be crucial for the C. lusitaniae yeast-to-pseudohypha morphogenetic transition. This implication is strengthened by a high level of SLN1 mRNAs revealed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR when the yeast develops pseudohyphae. Our findings highlight a differential contribution of the three HKRs in osmotic and oxidant adaptation during the morphological transition in C. lusitaniae.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 29 patients with synchronous hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer who underwent surgical resection of the primary lesion alone. Of these 29 patients, 21 received hepatic intra-arterial infusion of 5-FU postoperatively after the 5-FU sensitivity test. The remaining 8 patients underwent surgical resection of the primary lesion but neither sensitivity testing nor hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy. Tissue fragments were cultured, with each concentration of 5-FU in the thermoreversible gelation polymer forming a three-dimensional structure at 37 degrees C. The viability of tumor cells was evaluated according to WST methods; inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) values were calculated. We considered cancer tissue to be sensitive to IC50 values that were below twice the peak plasma concentration (120 microg/ml). RESULTS: Of the 21 patients, 10 had sensitivity to 5-FU and 11 had no sensitivity. The response rates were 90.0% and 9.1%, respectively. The median survival times were 38 months and 10 months in these groups, respectively, and 7 months in patients who received no chemotherapy. This finding indicates a significantly longer survival time in the sensitive group, compared with either the insensitive group or the no chemotherapy group (P = .0014 P = .0023). The cumulative survival rate was significantly higher in the sensitive group compared with the insensitive group (P = .0001) CONCLUSIONS: Ultimately, the group with sensitivity to 5-FU showed a significantly longer median survival time than the insensitive group.",

CD-DST was conducted using tumor samples surgically obtained from 189 patients. The therapeutic effect of 5-FU-based regimens between high (high-group) and low (low-group) sensitivity groups and a group that did not receive chemotherapy [CTx(-) group] was compared. CD-DST was successfully performed in 151 out of the 189 patients (79.9%), 87 of whom received 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Twenty-seven of these 87 patients (31.0%) were classified as the high-group and the remaining 60 (69.0%) as the low-group. The 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the high-group was significantly higher compared to that in the low- and the CTx(-) groups. No differences in the 5-year RFS were observed between the low- and CTx(-) groups.

Although the exact pathological processes involved are currently unclear, NCM appears to arise from an abnormal development of melanoblasts or melanocyte precursors. Currently, it has an extremely poor prognosis due to rapid disease progression and lack of effective treatment modalities. METHODS: In this study, we report on an experimental approach to examining NCM cells by establishing subcutaneous tumors in nude mice, which can be further expanded for conducting molecular and drug sensitivity experiments. RESULTS: Analysis of the NRAS gene-coding sequences of an established NCM cell line (YP-MEL) and NCM patient cells revealed heterogeneity in NRAS Q61K that activated mutation and possibly consequential differential sensitivity to MEK inhibition. Gene expression studies were performed to compare the molecular profiles of NCM cells with normal skin fibroblasts. In vitro cytotoxicity screens of libraries of targeted small-molecule inhibitors revealed prospective agents for further evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies provide an experimental platform for the generation of NCM cells for preclinical studies and the production of molecular and in vitro data with which to identify druggable targets for the treatment.",

First, the HIV-1 M184I mutant vector displays reduced transduction efficiency compared to wild type (WT) RT vector, which could be rescued by both elevating the cellular dNTP concentration and incorporating WT RT molecules into the M184I vector particles. Second, the central polypurine tract (cPPT) mutation and M184I mutation additively reduced the vector transduction to almost undetectable levels, particularly in nondividing cells. Third, the M184I (-) cPPT vector became significantly more sensitive to 3TC than the M184I (+) cPPT vector, but not to AZT or Nevirapine in the dividing cells. Finally, this 3TC sensitizing effect of the cPPT inactivation of the M184I vector was reversed by elevating the dCTP level, but not by the other three dNTPs. These data support a mechanistic interaction between cPPT and M184I RT with respect to viral replication and sensitivity to 3TC. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Resistance to chemotherapy is an obstacle to the successful treatment of oncohematological malignances. Failure of therapeutic treatment may be due to the development of multidrug resistance (MDR), the mechanisms of which include upregulation of membrane-resident transporters that efflux chemotherapeutic drugs from tumor cells. Deregulation may occur at different levels: gene or protein expression or function depletion. Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells of adults were studied. ABCB1 (P-gp) and ABCG2 (BCRP) expression were determined by flow cytometry, rhodamine 123 (Rho123) and mitoxantrone were used for functional activity study of MDR proteins, sensitization of leukemic cells to drugs was quantified by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assays. Appropriate gene expression was determined using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. No differences between expression of P-gp and BCRP and genes in primary and relapsed acute leukemia (AL) cells as well as in de novo and treated CLL samples were established. Higher expression of P-gp and BCRP proteins was detected in CLL lymphocytes compared to blast cells. Increased P-gp protein expression and function was detected in cells of CLL patients who had more aggressive therapy regimen. Doxorubicine, rubomycinum and L-asparaginase resistance correlates with P-gp overexpression and increased function in pediatric AL whereas vincristine resistance might be associated with P-gp protein expression in AL samples and impared P-gp function in CLL lymphocytes only. A tendency for the decreased doxorubicin cytotoxic activity was shown in BCRP-overexpressing cells both in children and adults leukemia. Multifactorial ANOVA showed that P-gp/MDR1 and BCRP as well as their function could not be used as unconditional and universal predictors of leukemia cell drug resistance in vitro. These results suggest that studied MDR transporter-proteins have a limited role per se in vitro and admittedly in vivo drug resistance estimated in leukemia patients or it is not yet fully understood unless would not be studied in aggregate. In any event, the expression and function studies of the proteins under investigation when singularly considered do not have a crucial significance for impact on drug resistance evaluation in all leukemia patients.",

        "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment can profoundly affect tumor cell survival as well as alter antitumor drug activity. However, conventional anticancer drug screening typically is performed in the absence of stromal cells. Here, we analyzed survival of myeloma cells co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) using an automated fluorescence microscope platform, ScanR. By staining the cell nuclei with DRAQ5, we could distinguish between BMSC and myeloma cells, based on their staining intensity and nuclear shape. Using the apoptotic marker YO-PRO-1, the effects of drug treatment on the viability of the myeloma cells in the presence of stromal cells could be measured. The method does not require cell staining before incubation with drugs, and less than 5000 cells are required per condition. The method can be used for large-scale screening of anticancer drugs on primary myeloma cells. This study shows the importance of stromal cell support for primary myeloma cell survival in vitro, as half of the cell samples had a marked increase in their viability when cultured in the presence of BMSC. Stromal cell-induced protection against common myeloma drugs is also observed with this method.",

        "abstract": "Developing a reliable and cost-effective miniaturized electroanalysis tool is of vital importance for cell electrochemical analysis. In this work, a novel mini-electrochemical system has been constructed for trace detection of cell samples. The mini-electrochemical system was constructed by integrating a pencil graphite modified by threonine (PT/PGE) as working electrode, an Ag/AgCl (Sat'd) as reference electrode, platinum wire as counter electrode and a micropipet tip as electrochemical cell. The mini-electrochemical system not only saved dramatically usage of samples from 500??L in traditional electrochemical system to 10??L, but also possessed an adjustable active surface area by changing the length of PT/PGE immersed into the cell suspension from 3mm to 15mm, and the linear equation was ipa=2.25l-2.64 (R2=0.990). The system was successfully used in detection of MCF-7 cells, and a nonlinear exponent relationship between peak current and the cell number range from 3.0??l03 to 7.0??l06cellsmL-1 was established firstly with the index equation ipa=59.557e (-C/1.709)-71.486 (R2=0.954). Finally, the system was used for evaluating the sensitivity of cyclophosphamide on MCF-7 cell, and the result was corresponded well with that of MTT assay. The proposed system is sufficiently simple, cheap and easy operated, and could be applied in electrochemical detection of other biological samples.",

        "abstract": "Hydroxamic acid analog pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HA-HDIs) have shown preclinical and clinical activity against human acute leukemia. Here we describe HA-HDI-resistant human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) HL-60 (HL-60/LR) cells that are resistant to LAQ824, vorinostat, LBH589, and sodium butyrate. HL-60/LR cells show increased expression of HDACs 1, 2, and 4 but lack HDAC6 expression, with concomitant hyperacetylation of heat shock protein 90 (hsp90). Treatment with HA-HDI failed to further augment hsp90 acetylation, or increase the levels of p21 or reactive oxygen species (ROSs), in HL-60/LR versus HL-60 cells. Although cross-resistant to antileukemia agents (eg, cytarabine, etoposide, and TRAIL), HL-60/LR cells are collaterally sensitive to the hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG. Treatment with 17-AAG did not induce hsp70 or deplete the hsp90 client proteins AKT and c-Raf. HL-60/LR versus HL-60 cells display a higher growth fraction and shorter doubling time, along with a shorter interval to generation of leukemia and survival in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Thus, resistance of AML cells to HA-HDIs is associated with loss of HDAC6, hyperacetylation of hsp90, aggressive leukemia phenotype, and collateral sensitivity to 17-AAG. These findings suggest that an hsp90 inhibitor-based antileukemia therapy may override de novo or acquired resistance of AML cells to HA-HDIs.",

        "abstract": "The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) is thought to act as a seizure-gating mechanism in kindling and other epilepsy models. We investigated whether the kindling process induces site-specific (anterior-posterior) and seizure-outlasting alterations in the activity of putative GABAergic SNr neurons and in their response to pharmacological manipulation. Female Wistar rats were kindled via the basolateral amygdala by daily stimulation. In vivo extracellular single unit recordings of SNr neurons were performed in kindled rats 1 day after a generalized seizure in order to examine activity changes that outlast the kindled seizures. Sham-kindled and naive rats served as controls. We found a significant and seizure-outlasting increase of discharge rates within the posterior but not within the anterior SNr of kindled rats when compared to controls. Furthermore, kindling resulted in seizure-outlasting burst-like firing pattern of SNr neurons. The antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA; 100 mg/kg i.v.) significantly reduced SNr discharge rates in all animal groups. Interestingly, neurons located in the anterior SNr of kindled rats were significantly less depressed by VPA compared to the reduction obtained in naive controls. The present data disclose kindling induced functional plasticity within basal ganglia regions. The findings are relevant for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the seizure-gating function of the SNr and might provide new targets for rational therapeutic manipulations, which aim to establish a remote control of epileptic seizures.",

        "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinase KIT controls many signal transduction pathways and represents a typical allosterically regulated protein. The mutation-induced deregulation of KIT activity impairs cellular physiological functions and causes serious human diseases. The impact of hotspots mutations (D816H/Y/N/V and V560G/D) localized in crucial regulatory segments, the juxtamembrane region (JMR) and the activation (A-) loop, on KIT internal dynamics was systematically studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The mutational outcomes predicted in silico were correlated with in vitro and in vivo activation rates and drug sensitivities of KIT mutants. The allosteric regulation of KIT in the native and mutated forms is described in terms of communication between the two remote segments, JMR and A-loop. A strong correlation between the communication profile and the structural and dynamical features of KIT in the native and mutated forms was established. Our results provide new insight on the determinants of receptor KIT constitutive activation by mutations and resistance of KIT mutants to inhibitors. Depiction of an intra-molecular component of the communication network constitutes a first step towards an integrated description of vast communication pathways established by KIT in physiopathological contexts.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of microRNAs in regulation of BCRP expression and BCRP-mediated drug resistance in breast cancer cells. Microarray analysis was performed to determine the differential expression patterns of miRNAs that target BCRP between the MX-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF-7/MX and its parental MX-sensitive cell line MCF-7. MiR-181a was found to be the most significantly down-regulated miRNA in MCF-7/MX cells. Luciferase activity assay showed that miR-181a mimics inhibited BCRP expression by targeting the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the BCRP mRNA. Overexpression of miR-181a down-regulated BCRP expression, and sensitized MX-resistant MCF-7/MX cells to MX. In a nude mouse xenograft model, intratumoral injection of miR-181a mimics inhibited BCRP expression, and enhanced the antitumor activity of MX. In addition, miR-181a inhibitors up-regulated BCRP expression, and rendered MX-sensitive MCF-7 cells resistant to MX. These findings suggest that miR-181a regulates BCRP expression via binding to the 3'-UTR of BCRP mRNA. MiR-181a is critical for regulation of BCRP-mediated resistance to MX. MiR-181a may be a potential target for preventing and reversing drug resistance in breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in South Africa by death notification, but accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis is challenging in this setting of high HIV prevalence. We conducted limited autopsies on young adults dying in a single public hospital in the province of KwaZulu-Natal between October 2008 and August 2009 in order to estimate the magnitude of deaths attributable to tuberculosis.\\n\\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied a representative sample of 240 adult inpatients (aged 20-45 years) dying after admission to Edendale Hospital. Limited autopsies included collection of respiratory tract secretions and tissue by needle core biopsies of lung, liver, and spleen. Specimens were examined by fluorescent microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and cultured in liquid media; cultures positive for M. tuberculosis were tested for drug susceptibility to first- and second-line antibiotics. Ninety-four percent of our study cohort was HIV seropositive and 50% of decedents had culture-positive tuberculosis at the time of death. Fifty percent of the participants were on treatment for tuberculosis at the time of death and 58% of these treated individuals remained culture positive at the time of death. Of the 50% not receiving tuberculosis treatment, 42% were culture positive. Seventeen percent of all positive cultures were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (i.e., multidrug resistant); 16% of patients dying during the initiation phase of their first ever course of tuberculosis treatment were infected with multidrug-resistant bacilli.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal the immense toll of tuberculosis among HIV-positive individuals in KwaZulu-Natal. The majority of decedents who remained culture positive despite receiving tuberculosis treatment were infected with pan-susceptible M. tuberculosis, suggesting that the diagnosis of tuberculosis was made too late to alter the fatal course of the infection. There is also a significant burden of undetected multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among HIV-coinfected individuals dying in this setting. New public health approaches that improve early diagnosis of tuberculosis and accelerate the initiation of treatment are urgently needed in this setting.

        "abstract": "We have previously reported the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitivity of cancer cells from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients using the collagen gel droplet embedded culture-drug sensitivity test (CD-DST) under multiple drug concentrations and contact durations. Moreover, the area under the concentration curve (AUC) and growth inhibition rate (IR) were combined, resulting in the AUC-IR curve, which was approximated to the logarithmic curve. In the present study, we used the AUC-IR curve to calculate the individualized AUC IR50, the AUC value that imparts 50% growth inhibition. Individual AUCIR50 was calculated in CRC patients, and its distribution was evaluated. The cumulative distribution of individual AUCIR50 was regressed over two lines (logarithmic scale). Among the 45 resectable CRC patients, those who achieved more than the individual AUCIR50 during post-operative 5-FU-based chemotherapy demonstrated a trend towards better disease-free survival compared to those who did not achieve AUCIR50. Of the Dukes' D patients (n=10), those who achieved more than twice the individual AUCIR50 during post-operative 5-FU-based chemotherapy demonstrated significantly better survival rates (p=0.05) than those who did not. In this study, the distribution of the individual AUCIR50 suggested that approximately 6% of patients demonstrated very low 5-FU sensitivity. Therefore, the individual AUCIR50 was useful in classifying good, intermediate and poor 5-FU response. Achievement of the individual AUCIR50 may be a prerequisite for individualized 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. As well, the early achievement of twice the individual AUCIR50 may indicate an improved prognosis in Dukes' D patients. The individual AUCIR50 using CD-DST is useful in determining the individualized chemotherapy of CRC patients, thus CD-DST has the potential to facilitate the establishment of individualized chemotherapy for CRC.",

Characteristics of the cell lines including morphology in vivo and in vitro; mutations of the K-ras, p53, APC and MMR genes and microsatellite instability (MSI) status in vitro were determined. Expression of drug-sensitivity genes including MDR1, MXR, MRP1 and COX2 was also analyzed. The cell lines were unique as judged by DNA fingerprinting using 16 short tandem repeats. Eleven of the cell lines grew as adherent populations and the remaining two as floating aggregates. None of the cell lines were contaminated with Mycoplasma or bacteria. All cell lines showed high viability with relatively long doubling times. Six cell lines contained mutations at K-ras. Seven cell lines displayed p53 gene missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations. MSI was found in three cell lines and two cell lines with an MSI-high phenotype-possessed hMLH1 mutations. Nine cell lines had an APC mutation. MRP1 was highly expressed in all cell lines, and high expression of MDR1, MXR and COX2 evident in eight, six and six cell lines, respectively. Embryonal stem cell markers (MELK, SOX4 and OCT4) were expressed in most of cell lines. The cancer stem cell biomarkers CD133, CD44 and Lgr5 were expressed in 12, 13 and 13 cell lines, respectively. The presently well-characterized CRC cell lines should be useful in investigations of the biological characteristics of CRC, particularly for investigations related to gene alterations associated with CRC and biology of cancer stem cells.",

If the patient had CD-DST active drugs, more than three cycles of chemotherapy containing these drugs were administered. If the patient did not have CD-DST active drugs, the patient could choose any treatment including best supportive care.\\n\\nRESULTS: Of the 80 patients in this study, CD-DST yielded results successfully in 49 patients (61.3%). CD-DST active drugs were present in 22 patients, and significantly more female patients had in vitro active anticancer agents than male (P=0.0008). All of the patients with CD-DST active agents received chemotherapy including these agents. In these patients, the response rate was 72.7%, and median survival was 15.0 months. In the patients without CD-DST active agents, 11 patients received standard, empirical chemotherapy.

        "abstract": "The motility assay is the current gold standard for evaluating drug effects on hookworm larvae and adults, however, among other drawbacks the assay is time consuming, and prone to individual subjectivity. We evaluated six alternative in vitro assays, namely the feeding inhibition assay, the colourimetric AlamarBlue\u00ae, MTT formazan and acid phosphatase activity assays, as well as isothermal calorimetry and the xCELLigence System using Ancylostoma ceylanicum third-stage larvae, stimulated third-stage larvae and adults. The performances of the assays were compared to the motility assay using three standard drugs: albendazole, levamisole and ivermectin (100-1 \u03bcg/ml). None of the assays investigated offered an advantage over the motility assay, because they were all inapplicable to third-stage larvae, which were presumably metabolically and physically too inactive. Among all assays tested the xCELLigence System performed best on adult worms as the test was accurate, simple, required a minimal number of worms and offered the possibility for conducting a medium-throughput screening.",

        "abstract": "In order to provide a sensitive cell line model for investigating the mechanisms underlying the lymphatic metastasis of tumors and the effect of medicine against cells, a new murine ascites hepatocarcinoma cell line with high lymphatic metastatic potential (Hca-P/L6) was established and the effect of curcumin on biological behavior of Hca-P/L6 was observed. Murine ascites hepatocarcinoma cell strain with low lymphatic metastatic potential (Hca-P) was subcutaneously inoculated into the medioventral line of a mouse 615 and the first generation of metastatic tumor cells of inguinal lymph node (Hca-P/L1) was obtained. Then, Hca-P/L1 was screened by the route of mouse foot pad subcutaneously \u2192 lymph node \u2192 scale-up culture in vitro \u2192 mouse foot pad subcutaneously for five times consecutively. The sensitivity of two murine ascites hepatocarcinoma cell lines (Hca-P and Hca-P/L6) and two anchorage-dependent human hepatocarcinoma cell lines (SMC7721 and HepG2) to curcumin were studied by use of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay after these cells had been pretreated by curcumin at the concentration of 15-240 \u03bcmol/L for 48 h. After pretreatment by curcumin at the maximum non-cytotoxic dose of 15 \u03bcmol/L in vitro, the effect of curcumin against cell proliferation of Hca-P and Hca-P/L6 was observed by inverted microscope, cell growth curve and cell population doubling time; the effects of curcumin on cell cycles of Hca-P/L6 and Hca-P were studied by flow cytometry (FCM). The results showed Hca-P/L6 spreading to the lymph nodes at multiple sites in mice was screened from Hca-P. The lymph node metastatic rate was 100%. Curcumin had significant growth inhibiting effect on both murine ascites and human hepatocarcinoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (P <0. 05). At concentrations of 30-120 \u03bcmol/L, curcumin had more inhibition on murine ascites hepatocarcinoma cell lines than on human anchorage-dependent hepatocarcinoma cell lines. At concentrations of 60-240 \u03bcmol/L, curcumin had more inhibition on Hca-P/L6 with the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 51.48 \u03bcmol/L than on Hca-P with IC50 of 90.87 \u03bcmol/L. After pretreatment by curcumin at the maximum non-cytotoxic dose of 15 mol/L for 7 days, the proliferations of Hca-P/L6 and Hca-P were inhibited (P <0.05) in a time-dependent manner (P <0.01) and the population doubling time of Hca-P/L6 and Hca-P was prolonged (P <0.01), and curcumin had more inhibition on Hca-P/L6 than on Hca-P (P <0.05). After pretreatment by 15 \u03bcmol/L curcumin for 48 h, the morphous of Hca-P/L6 was influenced more seriously than that of Hca-P and the cell cycle was redistributed with Hca-P/L6 being blocked in the S phase and Hca-P in the S and G2/M phases. Hca-P/L6 was validated to be more sensitive to curcumin than Hca-P. Hca-P/L6 is a novel sensitive cell line model for investigating the mechanisms underlying tumor lymphatic metastasis and the effect of the medicine against cells. \u00a9 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.",

        "abstract": "The anti-angiogenic activity of chemotherapy is both dose- and schedule-dependent. While conventional maximum tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy exerts only mild and reversible anti-angiogenic effects, low-dose metronomic (LDM) chemotherapy was developed to specifically target tumour angiogenesis. However, the long-term effects of either MTD or LDM chemotherapy on vascular endothelial cells have never been investigated. Here, we demonstrated that repeated exposure to MTD and LDM chemotherapy differentially impact on the angiogenic potential and chemosensitivity of immortalized endothelial cells. Repeated MTD vinblastine treatment of vascular endothelial cells led to an increased proliferation rate and resistance to paclitaxel. In contrast, repeated LDM treatment with vinblastine or etoposide impaired the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells and increased their chemosensitivity. This effect was associated with a significant decrease in \u03b2II- and \u03b2III-tubulin expression. Functional analysis using siRNA showed that silencing the expression of \u03b2III-tubulin in endothelial cells significantly decreased their capacity to form vascular structures and increased their sensitivity to the anti-angiogenic and vascular-disrupting effects of chemotherapy, whereas silencing \u03b2II-tubulin expression had no effect. Collectively our results show that LDM chemotherapy impairs the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells while increasing their chemosensitivity-an effect at least in part mediated by the down-regulation of \u03b2III-tubulin expression. Furthermore, our study suggests that \u03b2III-tubulin represents an attractive therapeutic target to increase the anti-angiogenic effects of chemotherapy and overall anti-tumour efficacy.",

Here, we investigated the possible role of microRNAs in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in colorectal carcinoma cells. We analyzed microRNA (miRNA) expression levels between multidrug resistant colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116/L-OHP and its parent cell line HCT116 using a miRNA microarray. miR-1915 had the lowest expression of miRNA in HCT116/L-OHP cells compared to its parental cells. Overexpression of Bcl-2 is generally associated with tumor drug resistance, meanwhile Bcl-2 is a predicted target of miR-1915. We found that elevated levels of miR-1915 in the mimics-transfected HCT116/L-OHP cells reduced Bcl-2 protein level and the luciferase activity of a Bcl-2 3'-untranslated region-based reporter, and also sensitized these cells to some anticancer drugs. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-1915 could play a role in the development of MDR in colorectal carcinoma cells at least in part by modulation of apoptosis via targeting Bcl-2.",

        "abstract": "Glutathione S-transferase ?? (GST, E.C.2.5.1.18) overexpression contributes to resistance of cancer cells towards cytostatic drugs. Furthermore, GST?? is involved in the cellular stress response through inhibition of Jun N-terminal-kinase (JNK), a process that can be modulated by GST inhibitors. GSH conjugates are potent GST inhibitors, but are sensitive towards ??-glutamyltranspeptidase (??GT)-mediated breakdown. In search for new peptidase stable GST inhibitors we employed the following strategy: (1) selection of a suitable (GST inhibiting) peptide-bond isostere from a series of previously synthesized ??GT stabilized GSH-analogs. (2) The use of this peptidomimetic strategy to prepare a GST?? selective inhibitor. Two ??GT stable GSH conjugate analogs inhibited human GSTs, although non-selectively. One of these, a urethane-type peptide-bond is well accepted by GSTs and we selected this modification for the development of a ??GT stable, GST?? selective inhibitor, UrPhg-Et2. This compound displayed selectivity for GST?? compared to ?? and ?? class enzymes. Furthermore, the inhibitor reversed GST??-mediated drug resistance (MDR) in breast tumor cells. In addition, short-term exposure of cells to UrPhg-Et2 led to GST?? oligomerization and JNK activation, suggesting that it activates the JNK-cJun signaling module through GST?? dissociation. Altogether, we show the successful use of peptidomimetic glutathione conjugate analogs as GST inhibitors and MDR-modifiers. As many MDR related enzymes, such as MRP1, glyoxalase 1 and DNA-pk are also inhibited by GSH conjugates, these peptidomimetic compounds can be used as scaffolds for the development of multi-target MDR drugs. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Lupeol, which shows in vitro inhibitory activity against Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 27.7 +/- 0.5 microM, was shown to cause a transformation of the human erythrocyte shape toward that of stomatocytes. Good correlation between the IC50 value and the membrane curvature changes caused by lupeol was observed. Preincubation of erythrocytes with lupeol, followed by extensive washing, made the cells unsuitable for parasite growth, suggesting that the compound incorporates into erythrocyte membrane irreversibly. On the other hand, lupeol-treated parasite culture continued to grow well in untreated erythrocytes. Thus, the antiplasmodial activity of lupeol appears to be indirect, being due to stomatocytic transformation of the host cell membrane and not to toxic effects via action on a drug target within the parasite. A number of amphiphiles that cause stomatocyte formation, but not those causing echinocyte formation, were shown to inhibit growth of the parasites, apparently via a mechanism similar to that of lupeol. Since antiplasmodial agents that inhibit parasite growth through erythrocyte membrane modifications must be regarded as unsuitable as leads for development of new antimalarial drugs, care must be exercised in the interpretation of results of screening of plant extracts and natural product libraries by an in vitro Plasmodium toxicity assay.",

        "abstract": "Objective. The purpose of this study is to assess the survival experience following systematic lymphadenectomy (LNX) in conjunction with primary but optimal cytoreductive surgery in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) patients when followed by intensive chemotherapy Methods. This is a retrospective analysis of all women with OC who were treated in our institution between 1992 and 2000. A total of 98 patients with stages IIIc-IV of OC underwent primary cytoreductive surgery which was 'optimal' (<1 cm residual disease). All patients subsequently received postoperative platinum-containing chemotherapy. Group I, consisting of 51 patients underwent LNX; Group II, consisting of 47 patients did not undergo LNX. The percentage of patients failing to respond to chemotherapy in each group was similar. Each group had statistically equivalent age, stage, regimens of chemotherapy performed, and all other known prognostic factors. Results. No survival benefit could be seen in platinum-sensitive patients. However, in patients who failed to respond to chemotherapy, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) (42.8% vs. 14.3%) and overall survival (OS) (51.2% vs. 28.8%) was quite different. LNX significantly improved those of drug-resistant patients when optimal cytoreductive surgery was performed [P = 0.008, risk ratio (rr) = 2.675, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.251-5.724]. Cox's proportional analysis shows that LNX was one of the three most significant covariate with the tumor grade and the number of postoperative residual lesions. Conclusions. The results show that LNX might be of benefit in patients who have optimal primary cytoreductive surgery and who do not respond to platinum-based chemotherapy. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, a comparison of drug sensitivity and genotypes of clinically isolated strains of levofloxacin (LVFX)-resistant S. pneumoniae obtained from Hong Kong, Okinawa Island and the Japanese main island (Honshu) was performed. MICs of quinolones (LVFX, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and sitafloxacin (STFX)) and other antibiotics (penicillin G, cefcapene, cefditoren, clarithromycin and azithromycin) were determined by a microdilution broth method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Standards. The quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE of these strains were analyzed by PCR-based sequencing. All 40 strains tested had more than one amino-acid substitution in the QRDRs of gyrA, gyrB, parC or parE. Although there seemed to be some clonality in strains obtained from Hong Kong, there was no clonality in strains obtained from Okinawa and Japan. Strains obtained from Hong Kong, Okinawa Island and the Japanese main island were genetically different by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. The range of MIC values of STFX against isolates resistant to LVFX (MIC 4-32 mg l(-1)) was 0.12-0.5 mg l(-1), and MIC(80) values of STFX against LVFX-resistant isolates were 0.25 mg l(-1). This study suggests that LVFX-resistant S. pneumoniae is similar in all three locations and STFX is potent against LVFX-resistant S. pneumoniae with multiple mutations in QRDRs of gyrase A and topoisomerase IV.",

Therapeutic effects ranging from nearly additive to clearly synergistic demonstrated an effective combination, i.e., the cytostatic dose of CDDP could be reduced without a loss in efficacy. To further investigate the cellular response mechanisms of these favorable outcomes, we analyzed the cell-cycle profiles, mRNA expression patterns, and protein levels of several key genes after incubation with BBSKE or CDDP separately and in combination. In appropriate conditions, CDDP induced arrest at the G2/M phase accompanied by the enhanced inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 and the elevated protein expression of cyclin B1. BBSKE downregulated expression of cyclin D1 by increasing mRNA and protein levels of p21, and thus induced G1 phase arrest. BBSKE returned Cdk1 to an activated state, and reduced the protein level of cyclin B1 after incubation in combination with CDDP, which was consistent with the reduction in the percentage of cells in G2/M identified by flow cytometry. By regulating the G1 phase and reversing CDDP-induced G2/M phase arrest, BBSKE increases drug sensitivity of LoVo cells toward CDDP, and probably provides a meaningful anticancer strategy for further clinical studies.",

We studied the relation between additional genetic changes in TEL(ETV6) and AML1(RUNX1) (FISH), drug sensitivity (MTT assay) and clinical outcome in 143 DCOG and COALL-treated t(12;21)-positive ALL patients. Additional genetic changes in TEL and AML1 were present in 83% of the patients, and consisted of (partial) deletion of the second TEL gene (70%), an extra AML1 gene (23%) or an extra der(21)t(12;21) (10%).

Disease-free survival (pDFS) of DCOG patients without additional genetic changes (4 years pDFS +/- s.e. 53 +/- 17%) and of those with an extra der(21)t(12;21) (60 +/- 22%) is poorer than that of compared to patients with other additional genetic changes in TEL or AML1 (79 +/- 6%; P-trend = 0.02). This was mainly due to the occurrence of early relapses within 2.5 years after the first diagnosis. Similar observations were found in the COALL cohort, albeit not significant owing to limited follow-up. Multivariate analysis including age, WBC and genetic abnormalities in TEL and/or AML1 showed that especially, in vitro resistance to prednisolone (hazard ratio 5.78, 95% CI 1.45-23.0; P=0.01) is an independent prognostic factor in DCOG- and COALL-treated t(12;21)-positive ALL.",

These cell lines were derived from a pulmonary blastoma, a small cell lung cancer, three adenocarcinomas and a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung of six Korean lung cancer patients.\\n\\nMETHODS: The histopathology of the primary tumors and their in vitro growth characteristics were described. DNA fingerprinting analysis and genetic alterations in the p53, \u03b2-catenin, TGF\u03b2RII, K-ras and EGFR genes were conducted. mRNA expressions levels of E-cadherin, COX-2, MDR1, MXR, CGA, synatophysin and TTF1 genes were investigated and sensitivity to anticancer drugs was screened.\\n\\nRESULTS: Five cell lines grew as adherent cells and one cell line grew as floating aggregates. All lines were free of mycoplasma or bacteria and were proven unique by DNA fingerprinting analysis. A significant polymorphism at codon 72 (Arg to Pro) of the p53 gene was found in one line (SNU-1327) and a mutation at codon 176 was found in SNU-2292. No mutations in the K-ras, \u03b2-catenin and TGF-\u03b2RII genes were observed. E-cadherin was not expressed in SNU-371 and COX-2 was overexpressed in SNU-1330, SNU-2292 and SNU-2315 cell lines. MDR1 was overexpressed in SNU-371 and SNU-2292 cell lines and MXR was overexpressed in SNU-1327 cell line. Interestingly, the SNU-371 cell line derived from a pulmonary blastoma and which overexpressed MDR1 displayed cross resistance for several anticancer drugs. Neuroendocrine markers, chromogranin A and synaptophysin, were overexpressed in the small cell lung cancer cell line, SNU-963 and thyroid transcription factor-1 was also over expressed in this cell line. Two mutations (p.Glu746_Ser752delinsVal and p.Glu746_Ala750del) in exon 19 of EGFR were found in SNU-1330 and SNU-2315 cell lines, respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: These well-characterized lung cancer cell lines may be useful tools for investigations of the biological characteristics of lung cancers, particularly for investigations related to mutations of EGFR.",

        "abstract": "Background: Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models are more extensive to be better models than two-dimensional (2D) cell culture models due to enriched cellular signaling pathways, cell to-cell contact, more representative of tissue morphology, and predictive of drug responses in vivo. Different drugs screening and various biological responses between 2D and 3D cell culture models have been reported. However, very little information is available on cell function and/or drug susceptibility caused by a difference in methodology of three dimensional culture. Here, we compared drug responses of various cancer cells against distinctive anti-cancer drugs when grown in monolayer, scaffold 3D culture (Matrigel, NanoCuluture Plate (NCP)) or scaffold-free 3D culture models (ultra-low attachment round bottom plate), and also confirmed which method is suitable for high-throughput screening for robust three-dimensional screening model. Method: We examined drug sensitivities of different lung cancer (A549, H226, H1650), breast cancer (SKBR-3, JIMT1), and prostate cancer (DU145) cell lines under monolayer or 3D cell culture conditions against several anti-cancer agents i.e. molecular targeted agent (Gefitinib, Afatinib, Temsirolimus, Vemurafenib, Vismodegib, Sorafenib), demethylation agent (Azacytidine, Decitabine), anti-microtubule agent (Docetaxel), alkylating agent (Cisplatin, Irinotecan), antimetabolite agent (5-FU, Gemcitabine, Methotrexate). The conditions of these assays are optimized for each culture method. Cell proliferation was measured by ATP assay. Furthermore, we analyzed the biological/ morphological differences among 3D culture methods (scaffold or scaffold-free culture models). Result: Large variations in drug responses were observed among the different cell culture models. Cells grown in 3D scaffold culture model (NCP) were more drug sensitive than other cell culture models. Especially docetaxel, 5-FU, and methotrexate showed clear growth inhibition in three dimensional scaffold culture models (NCP) than scaffold-free culture models (round-bottom). Conclusion: In this study, we showed that scaffold 3D culture is appropriate for anti-cancer drug-susceptibility test. We also proposed that NanoCuluture plate which is 3D scaffold culture model, can be used as a sophisticated high-throughput three-dimensional drug screening model.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: BCRP is overexpressed in many tumors and mediates multidrug resistance in breast cancer. In this study, we determined the involvement of miR-302S in the development of drug resistance in breast cancer. METHODS: The differential miRNA expression profiling in parental MCF-7 cells and its derivative mitoxantrone (MX)-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/MX) cells was determined by the microarray analysis. The levels of miR-302S family and BCRP mRNA expression were determined by using Quantitative Real-Time PCR. The targeting effect between the individuals of miR-302S and BCRP mRNA-3'UTR were detected by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Proteins of BCRP are represented by Western blot assay. Cell viability was assessed by MTS assay. Efflux capacity was evaluated using flow cytometry. RESULTS: The miR-302S family including miR-302a, miR-302b, miR-302c, and miR-302d was significantly down-regulated in BCRP-overexpressing MCF-7/MX cells. Luciferase activity assay showed that miR-302 inhibited BCRP expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the BCRP mRNA. Overexpression of miR-302 increased intracellular accumulation of MX and sensitized breast cancer cells to MX. Furthermore, intratumoral injection of miR-302 potentiated the inhibitory effect of MX on tumor growth in mice transplanted with MCF-7/MX cells. Most importantly, miR-302S produced stronger effects than each individual member alone. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that miR-302 inhibits BCRP expression via targeting the 3'-UTR of BCRP mRNA. miR-302 members may cooperatively downregulate BCRP expression to increase chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells. miR-302 gene cluster may be a potential target for reversing BCRP-mediated chemoresistance in breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: In vitro sensitivity assays are promising tools to predict the individual outcome of different chemotherapy regimens. However, a direct association between in vitro and in vivo chemosensitivity has to be shown by clinical studies. This multicenter phase II trial was aimed to investigate the efficacy of a sensitivity-directed, first-line chemotherapy in metastasized melanoma patients, and to prove an association between in vitro sensitivity and therapy outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The primary study end point was objective response; secondary end points were safety, overall survival, and progression-free survival. Viable tumor cells obtained from metastatic lesions were tested for chemosensitivity to seven single drugs and five drug combinations using an ATP-based luminescence viability assay. RESULTS: Out of 82 recruited patients (intention-to-treat), 57 received assay-directed chemotherapy and 53 were evaluable for all study end points (per protocol). The drug combinations used were gemcitabine+treosulfan, paclitaxel+cisplatin, paclitaxel+doxorubicin, and gemcitabine+cisplatin. The per protocol population could be divided into 22 (42%) chemosensitive and 31 (58%) chemoresistant patients by an arbitrary chemosensitivity index. Objective response was 36.4% in chemosensitive patients compared with 16.1% in chemoresistant patients (P=0.114); progression arrest (complete response+partial response+stable disease) was 59.1% versus 22.6% (P=0.01). Chemosensitive patients showed an increased overall survival of 14.6 months compared with 7.4 months in chemoresistant patients (P=0.041). CONCLUSION: In vitro chemosensitivity testing may be worthy of further exploration to see if it could be a useful tool to predict the outcome of melanoma patients treated with a sensitivity-directed chemotherapy. Therefore, these preliminary results will be evaluated by a planned phase III trial using a randomized, standard-regimen controlled setting.",

        "abstract": "The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has emerged as a novel anticancer target. Various EZH2 inhibitors have been developed in recent years. Among these, 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) is known to deplete EZH2 protein expression through an indirect pathway. In contrast, GSK343 directly inhibits enzyme activity through an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-competitive pathway. Therefore, we proposed that DZNep and GSK343 may exert differential effects against cancer cells. In this study, we found that GSK343 but not DZNep induced autophagic cell death of cancer cells. Inhibition of EZH2 expression was not required for GSK343-induced autophagy. In addition, GSK343 enhanced the anticancer activity of a multikinase inhibitor, sorafenib, in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our results show that GSK343 is a more potent anticancer agent than DZNep, and for the first time, we show that it acts as an autophagy inducer.",

        "abstract": "Alterations in the human 13q14 genomic region containing microRNAs mir-15a and mir-16-1 are present in most human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have previously found the development of CLL in the New Zealand Black murine model to be associated with a point mutation in the primary mir-15a/16-1 region, which correlated with a decrease in mature miR-16 and miR-15a levels. In this study, addition of exogenous miR-15a and miR-16 led to an accumulation of cells in G(1) in non-New Zealand Black B cell and New Zealand Black-derived malignant B-1 cell lines. However, the New Zealand Black line had significantly greater G(1) accumulation, suggesting a restoration of cell cycle control upon exogenous miR-15a/16 addition. Our experiments showed a reduction in protein levels of cyclin D1, a miR-15a/16 target and cell cycle regulator of G(1)/S transition, in the New Zealand Black cell line following miR-15a/16 addition. These microRNAs were shown to directly target the cyclin D1 3' untranslated region using a green fluorescent protein lentiviral expression system. miR-16 was also shown to augment apoptosis induction by nutlin, a mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) antagonist, and genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, when added to a B-1 cell line derived from multiple in vivo passages of malignant B-1 cells from New Zealand Black mice with CLL. miR-16 synergized with nutlin and genistein to induce apoptosis. Our data support a role for the mir-15a/16-1 cluster in cell cycle regulation and suggest that these mature microRNAs in both the New Zealand Black model and human CLL may be targets for therapeutic efficacy in this disease.",

We demonstrate here that deficiency of Cwt1 leads to decreased beta1,6-glucan in the cell wall, while mannoproteins are increased in the cell wall of exponentially growing cells and are released into the medium of stationary phase cells. Hyphal morphogenesis of cwt1 mutants is reduced on the surfaces of some inducing media. Unexpectedly, the CWT1/cwt1 heterozygous strains shows some stronger in vitro phenotypes compared to the homozygous mutant. The heterozygous but not the homozygous strain is also strongly impaired for its virulence in a mouse model of systemic infection. We suggest that an intermediate dosage of Cwt1 affects phenotypes profoundly, while its complete absence may elicit compensatory responses of C. albicans.",

        "abstract": "Galactofuranose (Gal. f) is the 5-member-ring form of galactose found in the walls of fungi including Aspergillus, but not in mammals. UDP-galactofuranose mutase (UgmA, ANID_3112.1) generates UDP-Gal. f from UDP-galactopyranose (6-member ring form). UgmA-GFP is cytoplasmic, so the UDP-Gal. f residues it produces must be transported into an endomembrane compartment prior to incorporation into cell wall components. ANID_3113.1 (which we call UgtA) was identified as being likely to encode the A. nidulans UDP-Gal. f transporter, based on its high amino acid sequence identity with A. fumigatus GlfB. The ugtA?? phenotype resembled that of ugmA??, which had compact colonies, wide, highly branched hyphae, and reduced sporulation. Like ugmA??, the ugtA?? hyphal walls were threefold thicker than wild type strains (but different in appearance in TEM), and accumulated exogenous material in liquid culture. Af. glfB restored wild type growth in the ugtA?? strain, showing that these genes have homologous function. Immunostaining with EBA2 showed that ugtA?? hyphae and conidiophores lacked Gal. f, which was restored in the Af. glfB-complemented strain. Unlike wild type and ugmA?? strains, some ugtA?? metulae produced triplets of phialides, rather than pairs. Compared to wild type strains, spore production for ugtA?? was reduced to 1%, and spore germination was reduced to half. UgtA-GFP had a punctate distribution in hyphae, phialides, and young spores. Notably, the ugtA?? strain was significantly more sensitive than wild type to Caspofungin, which inhibits beta-glucan synthesis, suggesting that drugs that could be developed to target UgtA function would be useful in combination antifungal therapy. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Although DNA repair processes have been shown to considerably modulate the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents, little information is available on the role of these mechanisms in chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. Therefore, we have analyzed in detail the DNA repair capacity of primary human hematopoietic cells from cord blood (CB) or bone marrow (BM) by 2 functional assays, the immunocytologic assay (ICA) and single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Besides substantial interindividual differences, we consistently observed significantly lower repair capacity of CD34(+) cells in comparison to CD34(-), CD19(+), or CD33(+) cells of the same donor. After exposure to the alkylating agent ethylnitrosourea (EtNU), the comet assay displayed on average twice as many DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) in CD34(+) cells and a tripled half-life of these lesions in comparison to corresponding CD34(-) cells. Similarly, reduced SSB repair activity in CD34(+) cells was detected following melphalan or cisplatin application. When specific antibodies were used to monitor DNA reaction products of these drugs, adduct levels were significantly higher and lesions persisted longer in the CD34(+) fraction. To assess the contribution of individual pathways to overall DNA repair, modulators blocking defined steps in repair processes were coapplied with alkylating drugs. Similar \"modulation pattern\" in corresponding CD34(+) and CD34(-) cell fractions indicated a generalized reduction in DNA repair capacity of CD34(+) cells, rather than deficiencies in a specific pathway. Because CD34(+) cells also displayed higher frequencies of apoptosis in response to melphalan or cisplatin, these findings may help to explain the myelosuppression after exposure to alkylating agents.",

Among the miRNAs down-regulated in CLL cells, we showed that miR-181a/b expression levels were significantly lower in poor prognostic subgroups defined by unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable status and p53 aberrations. Furthermore, under-expression of miR-181a and miR-181b was associated with shorter overall survival and treatment-free survival in CLL patients. We further evaluated fludarabine-induced apoptosis after transfection of primary CLL cells from 40 patients with miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-34a, miR-181a and miR-181b mimics. Transfection of miR-34a, miR-181a and miR-181b mimics into CLL cells from p53 wild-type patients led to significant increase in apoptosis compared with miRNA control. However, enforced expression of these miRNAs had no effect on B-CLL cells from p53-attenuated patients. We further demonstrated that miR-181a and miR-181b inhibiting BCL-2, MCL-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein by direct binding to 3'UTR. Thus, these results suggest that miR-181a/b may play important roles in the pathogenesis of CLL and may provide a possible therapeutic avenue and a sensitive indicator of the activity of the p53 axis in CLL.",

        "title": "A novel interaction of nucleophosmin with BCL2-associated X protein regulating death evasion and drug sensitivity in human hepatoma cells",
        "abstract": "Death evasion is crucial for both carcinogenesis and resistance to anticancer therapies. Recently, we identified nucleophosmin (NPM) as a key factor counteracting death stimuli in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Here we report the identification of a novel NPM-BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) pathway orchestrating death evasion in human HCC cells. Silencing of NPM expression significantly sensitized HCC cells-particularly those bearing inactivated p53 gene (Huh7, Hep3B, and Mahlavu)-to ultraviolet irradiation, mitomycin C, doxorubicin, cisplatin, sorafenib, and lapatinib. This sensitizing effect was not changed further, as p53 expression had been simultaneously silenced. Following cell stress, NPM and BAX were induced and exported out of the nucleoli and nucleus, respectively. BAX was translocated to cytoplasm in cells with relatively high NPM level, or accumulated in the mitochondria in cells with relatively low NPM level and undergoing apoptosis. Subcellular fractionation revealed that silencing of NPM expression greatly enhanced mitochondrial translocation and oligomerization of BAX in Huh7 and Mahlavu cells. In situ proximity ligation assays and reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation revealed a direct interaction between NPM and BAX in the cytoplasm. Silencing of BAX expression abolished the sensitization effect exerted by silencing of NPM in HCC cells. Clinically, up-regulation of NPM was significantly associated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis. Conclusion: By directly blockading BAX mitochondrial translocation and activation, NPM helps human HCC cells evade death induction independently of p53-mediated cell death. Silencing of NPM significantly sensitized HCC cells to anticancer therapies. NPM is a potential cotarget in combination with other therapies for HCC, particularly those that harbor inactivated p53 gene. Our findings are of clinical significance because NPM up-regulation and p53 mutations are usually found in advanced human cancers, including HCC.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the addition of oxaliplatin (l-OHP) or irinotecan (SN-38) to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) using the collagen gel droplet embedded culture-drug sensitivity test (CD-DST) to establish whether leucovorin plus 5-FU should be administered in combination with l-OHP (FOLFOX) or SN-38 (FOLFIRI) in individualized first-line chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Specimens of primary tumors were obtained from 24 CRC patients who had received no preoperative chemotherapy. CD-DST was performed, and the inhibition rate (IR) was obtained under multiple incubation conditions. The effects of addition of l-OHP or SN-38 were evaluated for the same area under the concentration curve (AUC) of 5-FU based on linear regression analysis. Approximate expression and correlation coefficients (5-FU vs. 5-FU + l-OHP, 5-FU vs. 5-FU + SN-38; AUC of 5-FU=72 and 5-FU vs. 5-FU + l-OHP, 5-FU vs. 5-FU + SN-38; AUC of 5-FU=144) were y=0.94x+8.53 (R(2)=0.95, p<0.0004), y=0.77x+26.18 (R(2)=0.76, p<0.0004) and y= 0.91x+10.90 (R(2)=0.94, p<0.0004), y=0.52x+44.61 (R(2)=0.60, p<0.0004), respectively. Approximate expression of 5-FU vs. 5-FU + l-OHP almost fit the regression line (y=x+b(1)). This suggests that addition of l-OHP yields a constant additive effect, independent of the IR of 5-FU. However, approximate expression of 5-FU vs. 5-FU + SN-38 fit the regression line (y=ax+b(2), a<1, b(2)\u2265b(1)). This suggests that addition of SN-38 yields a greater additive effect due to the lower IR of 5-FU. These results indicate that FOLFIRI should be selected as the first-line chemotherapy for the treatment of poor responders to 5-FU.",

The reasons for this trend and the likely shape of the pharmaceutical industry of the future are discussed here. The principal targets of the approaches that have delivered the majority of the medicines available today are encompassed by the concept of a \u2018receptor\u2019. While this has been a fruitful approach for the past 50 years, the great majority of receptors have now been identified and targeted. Drug discovery is moving into a different phase which will involve a much greater range of potential targets. These new approaches bring their own challenges for drug developers. The impact of these changes on the traditional scheme of drug development is discussed. The UK and EU regulatory framework for the licensing of drugs has changed substantially in recent years. The key concepts and interplay of regulatory bodies and advisory committees is explained. The European Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) has been implemented in the UK and EU and has implications for every healthcare professional involved in clinical research. The practical impact for the practising physician is outlined.",

We demonstrate that MVC-resistant HIV-1 exhibits delayed kinetics of coreceptor engagement and fusion during drug-bound versus free CCR5 infection of cell lines. Antibodies directed against the second extracellular loop (ECL2) of CCR5 had greater antiviral activity against MVC-bound compared to MVC-free CCR5 infection. However, in PBMCs, only ECL2 CCR5 antibodies HGS004 and HGS101, but not 2D7, inhibited infection by MVC resistant HIV-1 more potently with MVC-bound than with free CCR5. In addition, HGS004 and HGS101, but not 2D7, restored the antiviral activity of MVC against resistant virus in PBMCs. In flow cytometric studies, CCR5 binding by the HGS mAbs, but not by 2D7, was increased when PBMCs were treated with MVC, suggesting MVC increases exposure of the relevant epitope. Thus, HGS004 and HGS101 have antiviral mechanisms distinct from 2D7 and could help overcome MVC resistance. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

In phase 1, the proportions of penicillin-sensitive S. pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were 35.4%, 34.8%, and 29.8%, respectively, and the proportions were almost the same in phase 2: 33.1%, 37.0%, and 29.8%, respectively. Comparison of the MIC(90) values of the antibacterial agents for PRSP in phase 1 and phase 2 revealed that these values for cefditoren, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, faropenem, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, meropenem, and vancomycin increased by twofold to fourfold during the 3 years between phase 1 and phase 2. However the MIC(90) of rokitamycin increased more than fourfold. The proportion of S. pneumoniae that were PISP + PRSP remained almost constant over the 3 years between phase 1 and phase 2. The background factors of patient age, previous administration of antibacterial agents, and attendance at a day nursery were examined; we found that in phase 1, the proportion of PISP + PRSP was significantly higher than that of PSSP in patients under 4 years old who had previously received antibacterial agents, but no significant differences were found in any of these background factors in the phase 2 survey. No significant difference was found in the proportions of penicillin-resistant bacteria according to whether or not the child had attended a day nursery.",

We examined the antimicrobial susceptibility for H. influenzae derived from clinical specimens of pediatric patients collected nationwide from 27 institutions during phases 3 (386 strains) and 4 (484 strains). The frequency of (beta)-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant (BLNAR) strains, which rapidly increased from 11.4 % in phase 1 to 43.4 % in phase 2, has gradually decreased from 38.3 % in phase 3 to 37.8 % in phase 4. In contrast, On the other hand, the frequency of (beta)-lactamase-producing strains, which continuously decreased from 8.3 % in phase 1 to 4.4 % in phase 3, has increased to 8.7 % in phase 4. Prevalence of (beta)-lactamase-producing clavulanic acid/amoxicillin-resistant (BLPACR) strains, especially, has increased from 1.6 % in phase 3 to 4.8 % in phase 4. The oral antimicrobial agents with the lowest MIC90 were levofloxacin in both phases, and tosufloxacin in phase 4 ((less-than or equal to)0.063 (mu)g/ml), whereas for intravenous use the corresponding agent was tazobactam/piperacillin in both phases (0.125 (mu)g/ml). There was no increase in the MIC90 of most (beta)-lactams between phase 3 and phase 4. In relationship to sex, age, presence of siblings, attendance at a daycare center, siblings' attendance at a daycare center, and prior administration of antimicrobial agents within 1 month, the frequency of (beta)-lactamase-nonproducing ABPC-intermediately resistant (BLNAI) strains + BLNAR strains was high (P = 0.005) in cases with prior administration of antimicrobial agents in phase 3.

Among all of Haemophilus influenzae, the frequency of Hib strains was 3.6% (14/386 strains) in 2007, 4.8% (23/484 strains) in 2010, 1.2% (5/411 strains) in 2012, and decreasing in 2012.Hib strains were isolated in patients with the following infections: nine patients with respiratory tract infections (upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and pneumonia), three patients with sepsis, one patient with meningitis, and one patient with purulent inflammation of a tendon sheath in 2007; 11 patients with respiratory tract infections (upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and pneumonia), four patients with sepsis, and eight patients with meningitis in 2010, demonstrating a relatively high frequency in patients with invasive infections. However, in 2012, Hib strains were isolated in only four patients with respiratory tract infections (upper respiratory tract infection) and one patient with bronchial asthma. Evaluation of background factors with pediatric patients in whom Hib strains were isolated showed that approximately 70% were male; majority was children under three years of age; and higher detection rates were also related to the background of patients who were attendant to daycare center, had siblings, had received no antimicrobial agents within the previous one month before collecting specimens. Throughout the surveillance between 2007 and 2012, antimicrobial agents with all phases' MICs???1??g/mL were cefditoren, cefcapene, and cefteram in the oral ??-lactams; tazobactam/piperacillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and meropenem in the injectable ??-lactams; azithromycin in the macrolide; and levofloxacin in the quinolone.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In a study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CoALL 06-97 study), the in vitro sensitivity of the patients' cells to prednisolone, vincristine and asparaginase was introduced as a new additional risk parameter for treatment stratification. In parallel in vivo treatment response was assessed by determining the presence and extent of minimal residual disease in a subset of patients (n=224). Here we report the long-term impact of in vitro sensitivity-based risk stratification according to survival and compare the results of in vitro sensitivity with in vivo response. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with a sensitive in vitro profile were treated with a reduced intensity protocol (n=167) whereas patients defined as low risk according to conventional parameters but with a resistant in vitro profile were given intensified therapy (n=47). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 6.8 years event-free survival was 0.80+/-0.03 for patients with a sensitive profile, 0.73+/-0.03 for those with an intermediate profile and 0.67+/-0.08 for those with a resistant profile (P=0.015). Overall, the treatment results of the cases stratified according to in vitro sensitivity were similar to those of the historical control group stratified based on conventional risk factors. Minimal residual disease at the end of induction was a strong predictor of outcome in B-precursor and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. There was no correlation between in vitro and in vivo treatment response in B-precursor leukemia (Spearman's r=0.13; P=0.15) in contrast to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Spearman's r=0.63; P<0.001) CONCLUSIONS: A moderate reduction in treatment intensity for patients with a sensitive in vitro profile was possible without jeopardizing treatment outcome. However, in vitro drug testing was affected by a decrease in risk predictive power over time and was not correlated with in vivo assessment of minimal residual disease in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It was, therefore, abandoned in favor of the assessment of in vivo response in subsequent CoALL trials.",

Human myeloma cells (L363, OPM-1, OPM-2 and U266) and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to EPA and DHA, and effects on mitochondrial function and apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, gene expression and drug toxicity were measured. Exposure to EPA and DHA induced apoptosis and increased sensitivity to bortezomib in MM cells. Importantly, they did not affect viability of normal human peripheral mononuclear cells. Messenger RNA expression arrays showed that EPA and DHA modulated genes involved in multiple signaling pathways including nuclear factor (NF) \u03baB, Notch, Hedgehog, oxidative stress and Wnt. EPA and DHA inhibited NF\u03baB activity and induced apoptosis through mitochondrial perturbation and caspase-3 activation.

This study analyzes the relationship between the mRNA expression of the genes and fusion products involved in t(12;21), in vitro sensitivity to prednisolone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase, and long-term clinical outcome in t(12;21)+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Long-term clinical outcome in 45 t(12;21)+ ALL patients was related to mRNA expression of TEL, AML1, TEL-AML1, and AML1-TEL, determined by real-time quantitative PCR, and the in vitro sensitivity to prednisolone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase, using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. RESULTS: A significant approximately 3.5-fold lower TEL expression in t(12;21)+ compared with t(12;21)- ALL samples (P = 0.006) and normal controls (P = 0.004) was found. Expression of AML1 did not differ between t(12;21)+ and t(12;21)- ALL. However, AML1 expression in the leukemic cells was 2-fold higher compared with normal controls (P = 0.02). The TEL-AML1 fusion product was expressed in all t(12;21)+ cases, whereas the reciprocal fusion product AML1-TEL was expressed in only 76%. High expression levels of TEL-AML1 [hazard ratio (HR), 1.3; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.10-1.57; P = 0.003], AML1-TEL (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.99-12.40; P = 0.001) and AML1 (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.03-1.22; P = 0.006) were associated with a poor long-term clinical outcome within t(12;21)+ ALL. Cellular drug resistance towards prednisolone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase could not explain this predictive value. Multivariate analysis including age and WBC showed that only high AML1-TEL expression is an independent poor prognostic factor in t(12;21)+ childhood ALL. CONCLUSION: High AML1-TEL expression is an independent poor prognostic factor in t(12;21)+ childhood ALL.",

To determine whether the subsequent introduction of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) and reduced CQ-sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine pressure had attenuated parasite drug susceptibility and resistance-associated mutations, these parameters were re-assessed between 2011 and 2013.\\n\\nMETHODS: A validated fluorescence-based assay was used to assess growth inhibition of 52 P. falciparum isolates from children in a clinical trial in Madang Province. Responses to CQ, lumefantrine, piperaquine, naphthoquine, pyronaridine, artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, artemether were assessed. Molecular resistance markers were detected using a multiplex PCR ligase detection reaction fluorescent microsphere assay.\\n\\nRESULTS: CQ resistance (in vitro concentration required for 50% parasite growth inhibition (IC\u2085\u2080) >100 nM) was present in 19% of isolates. All piperaquine and naphthoquine IC\u2085\u2080s were <100 nM and those for lumefantrine, pyronaridine and the artemisinin derivatives were in low nM ranges. Factor analysis of IC\u2085\u2080s showed three groupings (lumefantrine; CQ, piperaquine, naphthoquine; pyronaridine, dihydroartemisinin, artemether, artesunate). Most isolates (96%) were monoclonal pfcrt K76T (SVMNT) mutants and most (86%) contained pfmdr1 N86Y (YYSND). No wild-type pfdhfr was found but most isolates contained wild-type (SAKAA) pfdhps. Compared with 2005-2007, the geometric mean (95% CI) CQ IC\u2085\u2080 was lower (87 (71-107) vs 167 (141-197) nM) and there had been no change in the prevalence of pfcrt K76T or pfmdr1 mutations. There were fewer isolates of the pfdhps (SAKAA) wild-type (60 vs 100%) and pfdhfr mutations persisted.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Reflecting less drug pressure, in vitro CQ sensitivity appears to be improving in Madang Province despite continued near-fixation of pfcrt K76T and pfmdr1 mutations. Temporal changes in IC\u2085\u2080s for other anti-malarial drugs were inconsistent but susceptibility was preserved. Retention or increases in pfdhfr and pfdhps mutations reflect continued use of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in the study area including through paediatric intermittent preventive treatment. The susceptibility of local isolates to lumefantrine may be unrelated to those of other ACT partner drugs.\\n\\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12610000913077 .",

UTH1 or SIM1 inactivation did not affect cell growth, shape or nuclear migration, whereas the double null mutant presented phenotypes of numerous binucleate cells and benomyl sensitivity, suggesting that microtubule function could be altered; the uth1\u0394sim1\u0394 strain also presented defects which could be related to the Ras/cAMP pathway: pet phenotype, heat shock sensitivity, inability to store glycogen, sensitivity to starvation and failure of spores to germinate. These observations suggested that Uth1p could be involved as a connection step between pathways controlling growth and those controlling division. Copyright (C) 2000.",

        "abstract": "Expression of the antiapoptotic protein survivin is associated with cancer cell viability and drug resistance. Thus, control of its expression in cancer cells has significant consequences for cancer therapeutics. Here we have shown that hedamycin, a GC-rich DNA binding drug, down-regulated survivin expression. Using a series of survivin promoter-luciferase constructs, we have identified an 86-bp GC-rich DNA element (-124 to -39) that mediates the ability of hedamycin to down-regulate survivin expression. Furthermore, both in vivo foot-printing and in vitro gel mobility shift experiments revealed that hedamycin bound to a 21-bp GC-rich DNA element (-115 to -95) in the survivin promoter. This drug-DNA interaction abrogated the binding of Sp-1 or Sp1-like proteins to the 21-bp cis-acting DNA element, and mutagenesis of this region consistently diminished survivin promoter activity. Finally, down-regulation of survivin transcription by hedamycin modulated the viability of cancer cells. These data suggest that abrogation of Sp-1 or Sp1-like protein binding to the 21-bp DNA element in the survivin promoter contributes at least in part to the inhibitory effect of hedamycin on survivin gene transcription. Drug-induced modulation of survivin gene expression may provide novel approaches for cancer therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Children with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk for leukemia. The prognosis for DS acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is better than for non-DS AML, but the clinical outcome of DS acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is equal to that of non-DS ALL. Differences in prognosis may reflect differences in cellular drug resistance. In vitro drug resistance profiles were successfully investigated on leukemic cells from 13 patients with DS AML and 9 patients with DS ALL and were compared with reference data from 151 non-DS AML and 430 non-DS B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL. DS AML cells were significantly more sensitive to cytarabine (median, 12-fold), the anthracyclines (2-7-fold), mitoxantrone (9-fold), amsacrine (16-fold), etoposide (20-fold), 6-thioguanine (3-fold), busulfan (5-fold), vincristine (23-fold), and prednisolone (more than 1.1-fold), than non-DS AML cells. Compared with DS ALL, DS AML cells were significantly more sensitive to cytarabine only (21-fold). After short-term exposure to methotrexate, DS AML cells were 21-fold more resistant than non-DS AML cells, but no difference was observed after continuous exposure. DS ALL cells and non-DS BCP-ALL cells were equally sensitive to all drugs, including methotrexate. Normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells from DS and non-DS children without leukemia showed highly resistant drug profiles. It was concluded that the better prognosis of DS AML might, at least partially, be explained by a specific, relatively sensitive drug-resistance profile, reflecting the unique biology of this disease.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tissue samples from patients with pathologic ((p)) stage III colorectal cancer were tested for sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). On the basis of the results, patients were divided into 5-FU-sensitive and 5-FU-resistant groups, and both groups were treated with fluoropyrimidine (UFT) as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Recurrence, 5-year survival rates, and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were compared. METHODS: The anticancer sensitivity test described in this study was carried out using tumor samples obtained surgically from 34 patients with curatively resectable colorectal cancer that had been diagnosed definitively as (p)stage III (IIIa, 23 patients; IIIb, 11 patients). Regardless of tumor sensitivity or resistance to 5-FU, all 34 patients were subsequently treated daily with UFT at 300 mg/day as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment was initiated 3 weeks after surgery and continued for 2 years. RESULTS: Of the 34 patients with (p)stage III colorectal cancer, the tumors of 16 (47%) were 5-FU-sensitive (S group) and 18 (53%) were 5-FU-resistant (R group). The recurrence rates in the S and R groups following postadjuvant therapy with UFT were 25% and 61%, respectively, which is a significantly lower response in the S group (P = .045). The odds ratio of recurrence in the R group vs. the S group was 4.71. The 5-year survival rate was 85.7% in the S group and 46.7% in the R group, but the difference was not significant (P = .066). The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was significantly higher in the S group than in the R groups (71% vs. 32%, P = .010). According to Cox's multivariate analysis of recurrence-free survival, the sensitivity test was significantly predictive.

        "abstract": "Core-binding factor (CBF) leukemias are characterized by a high degree of sensitivity to high-dose cytarabine (ARA-C) treatment and by a relatively favorable prognosis compared with most other forms of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The molecular basis of the response to chemotherapy is still being analyzed. The proteinase 3 (PR3) gene codes for a serine protease with a broad spectrum of proteolytic activity. PR3 is involved in the control of proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells, and when it is abnormally expressed, it confers factor-independent growth to hematopoietic cells. In this study, we analyzed the expression levels of PR3 in 113 AML patients. PR3 is highly expressed in AML, mainly in CBF leukemias in which PR3 is not only expressed, but also abnormally localized within the nuclear compartment. Nuclear PR3 results in cleavage of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65 into an inactive p56 subunit lacking any transcriptional activity. The nuclear localization of PR3 is responsible for increased proliferation, apoptosis arrest and increased sensitivity to high-dose ARA-C. This study provides a new molecular mechanism that is responsible for NF-kappaB inactivation and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy in CBF leukemias.Leukemia advance online publication, 14 January 2010; doi:10.1038/leu.2009.207.",

        "abstract": "The cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway plays a central role in the growth, differentiation, and virulence of pathogenic fungi, including Cryptococcus neoformans. Three upstream signaling regulators of adenylyl cyclase (Cac1), Ras, Aca1, and Gpa1, have been demonstrated to control the cAMP pathway in C. neoformans, but their functional relationship remains elusive. We performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis with a DNA microarray using the ras1Delta, gpa1Delta, cac1Delta, aca1Delta, and pka1Delta pka2Delta mutants. The aca1Delta, gpa1Delta, cac1Delta, and pka1Delta pka2Delta mutants displayed similar transcriptome patterns, whereas the ras1Delta mutant exhibited transcriptome patterns distinct from those of the wild type and the cAMP mutants. Interestingly, a number of environmental stress response genes are modulated differentially in the ras1Delta and cAMP mutants. In fact, the Ras signaling pathway was found to be involved in osmotic and genotoxic stress responses and the maintenance of cell wall integrity via the Cdc24-dependent signaling pathway. Notably, the Ras and cAMP mutants exhibited hypersensitivity to a polyene drug, amphotericin B, without showing effects on ergosterol biosynthesis, which suggested a novel method of antifungal combination therapy. Among the cAMP-dependent gene products that we characterized, two small heat shock proteins, Hsp12 and Hsp122, were found to be involved in the polyene antifungal drug susceptibility of C. neoformans.",

        "abstract": "At the present time, the optimal development of molecularly targeted anticancer agents is limited by the lack of clinically applicable tools to predict drug effects. This study aimed to develop methods that might be useful in predicting the efficacy of targeted agents in a novel model system of human pancreatic cancer. A series of xenografts were established in nude mice by implanting human pancreatic cancer tissue surgically resected from cancer patients. Animals were treated with the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib, the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor temsirolimus, or vehicle. Tumor cells were sampled by fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) before (baseline, day 0) and at the completion of 28 days of treatment. Cells obtained at baseline were exposed to erlotinib or temsirolimus in short-term cell culture conditions (ex vivo). Western blot analysis was done to determine the degree of inhibition in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and S6-ribosomal protein (downstream effectors of epidermal growth factor receptor and mammalian target of rapamycin, respectively) ex vivo and in vivo. Five of six xenografted tumors responded to temsirolimus, whereas only one tumor responded to erlotinib. The results of the ex vivo studies correctly predicted the pharmacodynamic effect of the agents in vivo as well as their gross antitumor effects. Finally, we showed the clinical feasibility of this approach, performing ex vivo assessment of drug-target response in FNAB samples from three patients with pancreatic cancer. Cancer cells obtained by FNAB, an established minimally invasive diagnostic procedure, can be used to test ex vivo the effects of targeted anticancer agents. These effects correlate with antitumor activity in vivo and may therefore provide an important tool applicable to clinical trials. Ultimately, an approach of this nature may facilitate the further refinement of patient selection in favor of individuals with molecular profiles, predicting a greater likelihood of therapeutic benefit.",

        "abstract": "Background: The ??-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Type A receptor deficits that are induced by global or forebrain-specific heterozygous inactivation of the ??2 subunit gene in mouse embryos result in behavior indicative of trait anxiety and depressive states. By contrast, a comparable deficit that is delayed to adolescence is without these behavioral consequences. Here we characterized ??2-deficient mice with respect to hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis abnormalities and antidepressant drug responses. Methods: We analyzed the behavioral responses of ??2+/- mice to desipramine and fluoxetine in novelty suppressed feeding, forced swim, tail suspension, and sucrose consumption tests as well as GABAA receptor deficit- and antidepressant drug treatment-induced alterations in serum corticosterone. Results: Baseline corticosterone concentrations in adult ??2-deficient mice were elevated independent of whether the genetic lesion was induced during embryogenesis or delayed to adolescence. However, the manifestation of anxious-depressive behavior in different ??2-deficient mouse lines was correlated with early onset HPA axis hyperactivity during postnatal development. Chronic but not subchronic treatment of ??2+/- mice with fluoxetine or desipramine normalized anxiety-like behavior in the novelty suppressed feeding test. Moreover, desipramine had antidepressant-like effects in that it normalized HPA axis function and depression-related behavior of ??2+/- mice in the forced swim, tail suspension, and sucrose consumption tests. By contrast, fluoxetine was ineffective as an antidepressant and failed to normalize HPA axis function. Conclusions: Developmental deficits in GABAergic inhibition in the forebrain cause behavioral and endocrine abnormalities and selective antidepressant drug responsiveness indicative of anxious-depressive disorders such as melancholic depression, which are frequently characterized by HPA axis hyperactivity and greater efficacy of desipramine versus fluoxetine. ?? 2010 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",

        "abstract": "Objective We recently determined that the ectopic over-expression of miR-429 and other members of the miR-200 family of microRNAs in ovarian cancer (OC) mesenchymal-like cell lines induces mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) with a concomitant increase in sensitivity to platinum drugs. We sought to determine if metastasizing OC cells isolated from an OC patient could also be induced by miR-429 to undergo MET and become sensitized to established first-line platinum-based therapies. Methods We established and characterized a new primary cell line (OCI-984) from free-floating OC cells isolated from the ascites fluid of an advanced stage OC patient. miR-429 was ectopically over-expressed in these cells. Results The over-expression of miR-429 in OCI-984 cells induced morphological, functional and molecular changes consistent with MET and a concomitant significant increase in the sensitivity of the converted cells to cisplatin. Conclusions Our findings indicate that the miR-200 family of microRNAs, and miR-429 in particular, play a critical role in the functioning of OC metastasizing cells and that targeted delivery of miR-429, and perhaps other miR-200 family members, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapies may be an effective strategy in reducing OC metastasis and tumor recurrence. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (second TKIs) such as nilotinib and dasatinib control the activity of most ABL kinase domain mutations observed in patients with imatinib resistance. Although in vitro data show that both agents can inhibit all mutations except T315I, some discrepancies have been observed in a small subset of mutation clones. Cytogenetic clonal evolution is the important resistance mechanism of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Accordingly, we observed the clinical significance of coexisting with clonal evolution and BCR-ABL mutant in CML patients treated with second TKIs.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We monitored BCR-ABL transcript kinetics, interrelationship of clones expressing non-mutated and mutant transcripts and clonal aberrations within Philadelphia (Ph) positive and negative clones, respectively, in eight patients with CML receiving dasatinib or nilotinib for 3~41 months.\\n\\nRESULTS: Clinical responses were correlated with in vitro sensitivity of the BCR-ABL mutants to the second TKIs in four patients. Four patients showed resistance to the second TKIs as compared to in vitro observations; three of them developed chromosomal abnormalities in the Ph chromosome positive or negative metaphases. Another patient lost the original mutation but acquired a more resistant new mutation and became resistant to the second TKI.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Cytogenetic clonal evolution is an independent poor prognostic factor in CML, which could explain the onset of mechanisms for second TKIs resistance to ABL kinase domain mutations. The results indicate that an additional evaluation of chromosomal abnormalities is warranted when BCR-ABL mutants are more resistant than indicated by in vitro data.",

        "abstract": "Overexpression of the 170 kDa plasma membrane P-glycoprotein (P-gp) represents the most common MDR mechanism in chemotherapy. In this work, specific autoantibodies to fragments from extracellular loops 1, 2, and 4 of the murine MDR1 P-gp were elicited in mice using synthetic palmitoylated peptides reconstituted in liposomes and alum. The highest IgG level was observed after the third immunization and the immune response against lipopeptides was still detected more than 200 days after immunizations. Immunocytochemichal studies revealed that these antibodies were specific for P-gp. When incubated with P-gp-expressing MDR cell lines, serum from immunized mice restored sensitivity to either doxorubicin or vinblastine, or had no effect in a cell type specific manner, suggesting that several mechanisms may occur in the establishment of the MDR phenotype. The expression of mdr1 and mdr3 genes was unchanged in organs from mice immunized with palmitoylpeptides grafted on liposomes. These results suggest that the induction of autoantibodies to P-gp is a safe strategy to overcome MDR in cancer chemotherapy. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway plays a central role in the growth, differentiation, and virulence of pathogenic fungi, including Cryptococcus neoformans. Three upstream signaling regulators of adenylyl cyclase (Cac1), Ras, Aca1, and Gpa1, have been demonstrated to control the cAMP pathway in C. neoformans, but their functional relationship remains elusive. We performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis with a DNA microarray using the ras1Delta, gpa1Delta, cac1Delta, aca1Delta, and pka1Delta pka2Delta mutants. The aca1Delta, gpa1Delta, cac1Delta, and pka1Delta pka2Delta mutants displayed similar transcriptome patterns, whereas the ras1Delta mutant exhibited transcriptome patterns distinct from those of the wild type and the cAMP mutants. Interestingly, a number of environmental stress response genes are modulated differentially in the ras1Delta and cAMP mutants. In fact, the Ras signaling pathway was found to be involved in osmotic and genotoxic stress responses and the maintenance of cell wall integrity via the Cdc24-dependent signaling pathway. Notably, the Ras and cAMP mutants exhibited hypersensitivity to a polyene drug, amphotericin B, without showing effects on ergosterol biosynthesis, which suggested a novel method of antifungal combination therapy. Among the cAMP-dependent gene products that we characterized, two small heat shock proteins, Hsp12 and Hsp122, were found to be involved in the polyene antifungal drug susceptibility of C. neoformans.",

        "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA polymerase contains several conserved regions within the polymerase domain. The conserved regions I, II, III, V, and VII have been shown to have functional roles in the interaction with deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) and DNA. However, the role of conserved region VI in DNA replication has remained unclear due, in part, to the lack of a well-characterized region VI mutant. In this report, recombinant viruses containing a point mutation (L774F) within the conserved region VI were constructed. These recombinant viruses were more susceptible to aphidicolin and resistant to both foscarnet and acyclovir, compared to the wild-type KOS strain. Marker transfer experiments demonstrated that the L774F mutation conferred the altered drug sensitivities. Furthermore, mutagenesis assays demonstrated that L774F recombinant viruses containing the supF marker gene, which was integrated within the thymidine kinase locus (tk), exhibited increased fidelity of DNA replication. These data indicate that conserved region VI, together with other conserved regions, forms the polymerase active site, has a role in the interaction with deoxyribonucleotides, and regulates DNA replication fidelity. The possible effect of the L774F mutation in altering the polymerase structure and activity is discussed",

        "abstract": "Insect voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels are formed by a well-known pore-forming \u03b1-subunit encoded by para-like gene and ancillary subunits related to TipE from the mutation \"temperature-induced-paralysis locus E.\" The role of these ancillary subunits in the modulation of biophysical and pharmacological properties of Na(+) currents are not enough documented. The unique neuronal ancillary subunit TipE-homologous protein 1 of Drosophila melanogaster (DmTEH1) strongly enhances the expression of insect Nav channels when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Here we report the cloning and functional expression of two neuronal DmTEH1-homologs of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana, PaTEH1A and PaTEH1B, encoded by a single bicistronic gene. In PaTEH1B, the second exon encoding the last 11-amino-acid residues of PaTEH1A is shifted to 3'UTR by the retention of a 96-bp intron-containing coding-message, thus generating a new C-terminal end. We investigated the gating and pharmacological properties of the Drosophila Nav channel variant (DmNav1-1) co-expressed with DmTEH1, PaTEH1A, PaTEH1B or a truncated mutant PaTEH1\u0394(270-280) in Xenopus oocytes. PaTEH1B caused a 2.2-fold current density decrease, concomitant with an equivalent \u03b1-subunit incorporation decrease in the plasma membrane, compared to PaTEH1A and PaTEH1\u0394(270-280). PaTEH1B positively shifted the voltage-dependences of activation and slow inactivation of DmNav1-1 channels to more positive potentials compared to PaTEH1A, suggesting that the C-terminal end of both proteins may influence the function of the voltage-sensor and the pore of Nav channel. Interestingly, our findings showed that the sensitivity of DmNav1-1 channels to lidocaine and to the pyrazoline-type insecticide metabolite DCJW depends on associated TEH1-like subunits. In conclusion, our work demonstrates for the first time that density, gating and pharmacological properties of Nav channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes can be modulated by an intron retention process in the transcription of the neuronal TEH1-like ancillary subunits of P. americana.",

Multiple drug concentrations and contact durations, and the area under the concentration curve (AUC) and growth inhibition rate (IR) were combined, resulting in the AUC-IR curve, which was approximated to the logarithmic curve. Moreover, the individualized AUC(IR50), the AUC value which gives 50% growth inhibition, was calculated using the AUC-IR curve. This study aimed to identify responders/non-responders to 5-FU based on the individual AUC(IR50) obtained with CD-DST in order to establish individualized chemotherapy for CRC patients. The individual AUC(IR50) was calculated from each AUC-inhibition rate regression curve in all patients using the CD-DST. The cumulative distribution of the individual AUC(IR50) in CRC patients was evaluated. The cumulative distribution of the individual AUC(IR50) was regressed over the sigmoid curve (logarithmic scale). The approximate expression was almost exactly y=ab^exp(-cx) (a=0.9739, b=1.7096E-21, c=0.8990, the sum of square residuals, 0.0279). In the 80 cases examined, no notable change was observed in the regression curve when the number of patients increased. A standard curve was obtained describing responders to 5-FU among all CRC patients. From this standard curve, we ascertained that non-responders accounted for approximately 5% of all patients. Moreover, we were able to classify responders into good or intermediate responders to 5-FU. The standard curve describing response to 5-FU in CRC patients offers a useful tool in the establishment of individualized chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms by which the anti-HER2 antibodies trastuzumab and its murine equivalent 4D5 inhibit tumor growth and potentiate chemotherapy are not fully understood. Inhibition of signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway may be particularly important. Treatment of breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2 with trastuzumab inhibited HER2-HER3 association, decreased PDK1 activity, reduced Thr-308 and Ser-473 phosphorylation of AKT, and reduced AKT enzymatic activity. To place the role of PI3K-AKT in perspective, gene expression was studied by using Affymetrix microarrays and real time reverse transcription-PCR. Sixteen genes were consistently down-regulated 2.0-4.9-fold in two antibody-treated breast cancer cell lines. Fourteen of the 16 genes were involved in three major functional areas as follows: 7 in cell cycle regulation, particularly of the G(2)-M; 5 in DNA repair/replication; and 2 in modifying chromatin structure. Of the 16 antibody-regulated genes, 64% had roles in cell growth/maintenance and 52% contributed to the cell cycle. Direct inhibition of PI3K with an inhibitor markedly reduced expression of 14 genes that were also affected by the antibody. Constitutive activation of AKT1 blocked the effect of the anti-HER2 antibody on cell cycle arrest and on eight differentially expressed genes. The antibody enhanced docetaxel-induced growth inhibition but did not increase the fraction of apoptotic cells induced with docetaxel alone. In contrast, the antibody plus docetaxel markedly down-regulated two genes, HEC and DEEPEST, required for passage through G(2)-M. Thus, anti-HER2 antibody preferentially affects genes contributing to cell cycle progression and cell growth/maintenance, in part through the PI3K-AKT signaling. Transcriptional regulation by anti-HER2 antibody through PI3K-AKT pathway may potentiate the growth inhibitory activity of docetaxel by affecting cell cycle progression.",

This line is a derivative of the CEM.NKR-CCR5 line, stably transfected to express the luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the HIV-2 LTR. Thus the cells respond to Tat expression during HIV-1 infection by producing luciferase, a protein that can be readily and accurately quantitated in a luminometer. The CEM.NKR-CCR5-Luc line expresses both the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors and can therefore be infected with a range of HIV-1 isolates, irrespective of their tropism properties. This is true of HIV-1 isolates from several genetic subtypes and also of a group O isolate. Furthermore, luciferase expression is also activated by infection of the cells with SIVmac239 or SIVmac251. We show that the CEM.NKR-CCR5-Luc cells can be used in assays of HIV-1 neutralization and also for identifying inhibitors of HIV-1 entry targeted at the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors. The luciferase end point simplifies the performance of neutralization and inhibitor-screening assays compared to the use of more conventional end points such as the detection of extracellular p24 antigen.",

The intracellular DOX concentration in KB-A-1 cells treated with the conjugate was detected in vitro by HPLC. Results showed that the intracellular DOX concentration was 6.4-fold higher in KB-A-1 cells treated with the conjugate when compared with that in the cells treated with DOX alone. In contrast, a 1.8-fold increase in the concentration of DOX was observed when the cells were treated with AS ODN. Reverse transcriptase PCR and Western-blot analysis showed a more significant decrease in the amount of mdr1 (multidrug resistance 1 gene) mRNA and P-glycoprotein in KB-A-1 cells. Chemosensitivity of KB-A-1 cells to DOX was also investigated in vitro. When the cells were first exposed to the conjugate (0.5 microM) for 24 h and then exposed to DOX for 24 h, the IC(50) value of DOX decreased from 21.5 to 2.2 microM, whereas the IC(50) value of DOX decreased only to 16.8 microM when the cells were treated with the mixture of the same concentration of AS ODN.

        "abstract": "Chemoresistance is a biological response of cells to survive toxic stress. During cancer treatment the development of chemoresistance is a major problem. The mechanisms how cells become insensitive, and which downstream pathways are affected are not completely understood. Since it has not been well analysed which and how many regulative disorders are subsummised under the term \"chemoresistance\", we examined and measured arabinosylcytosine (AraC)-mediated desensitation of two mechanisms relevant for tissue homeostasis, cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis induction. MCF-7 cells harbouring ectopic mutated p53 were suitable for this investigation because they activated these mechanisms subsequently and became insensitive to AraC with regard to cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis induction. The major causal mechanism of acquired resistance against AraC was most likely through the inhibition of the first step of AraC phosphorylation within the cell, which is rate limiting for its activation. With regard to cell cycle inhibition AraC-resistant cells were also resistant against 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FdUrd), but fully responsive to 5-FdUrd-induced apoptosis, evidencing that cell cycle and apoptosis are independent of each other. Apoptosis correlated with AIF-activation and was independent of Caspase 7, whereas cell cycle inhibition correlated with cyclinD1 expression but not with induction of p21 or p27. The phosphate conjugated 5-FdUrd-araC heterodimer (5-Fluoro-2'-desoxyuridylyl-(3'-->5')-Arabinocytidine), which is a prodrug of AraC-monophosphate, reactivated AIF and down-regulated cyclin D1 in AraC-resistant cells and circumvented resistance to apoptosis and to cell cycle inhibition. Also, cells which were resistant to 5-FdUrd or doxorubicin were sensitive to 5-FdUrd-araC. This investigation demonstrates that chemoresistance affects apoptosis induction and cell cycle inhibition independently and that detailed knowledge about the affected downstream pathways would enable the design of targeted intervention with small molecules to restore chemosensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP) is released inside the food vacuole of the malaria parasite during the digestion of host cell hemoglobin. FP is detoxified by its biomineralization to hemozoin. This process is effectively inhibited by chloroquine (CQ) and amodiaquine (AQ). Undegraded FP accumulates in the membrane fraction and inhibits enzymes of infected cells in parallel with parasite killing. FP is demonstrably degraded by reduced glutathione (GSH) in a radical-mediated mechanism. This degradation is inhibited by CQ and AQ in a competitive manner, thus explaining the ability of increased GSH levels in Plasmodium falciparum-infected cells to increase resistance to CQ and vice versa, and to render Plasmodium berghei that were selected for CQ resistance in vivo sensitive to the CQ when glutathione synthesis is inhibited. Some over-the-counter drugs that are known to reduce GSH in body tissues when used in excess were found to enhance the antimalarial action of CQ and AQ in mice infected either with P. berghei or Plasmodium vinckei. In contrast, N-acetyl-cysteine which is expected to increase the cellular levels of GSH, antagonized the action of CQ. These results suggest that some over-the-counter drugs can be used in combination with some antimalarials to which the parasite has become resistant.",

The variation and evolution of haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of influenza isolates from Guangdong during 2007-2011 and others from GenBank were analysed using Lasergene 7.1 and MEGA 5.05, and serological analysis of antigens was determined by haemagglutination inhibition (HI). Susceptibility to antiviral drugs was correlated with genetic mutations. Phylogenetic analysis and alignment of HA and NA genes were performed on 18 Guangdong isolates and 26 global reference strains. The non-synonymous (dN) evolutionary rate of HA1 was 3.13 times that of HA2. Compared with the A/Perth/16/2009 vaccine HA gene, homologies of Guangdong isolates were between 98.8-99.7% and 98.0-98\u00b74% in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Amino-acid substitutions were found in five epitopes of HA1 from Guangdong isolates between 2007 and 2011, especially in epitopes B (N160K) and D (K174R/N). The K189E/N/Q and T228A mutations in the receptor-binding site (RBS) occurred in the 2010 strains, which affected the antigenicity of HA1. The antigenicity of the epidemic H3N2 isolates in 2010 was somewhat different from that of A/Perth/16/2009. The Guangdong H3N2 isolates were determined to be oseltamivir-resistant with IC50 of 0.396 \u00b1 0.085 nmol/l (n=17) and zanamivir-resistant with IC50 of 0.477 \u00b1 0.149 nmol/l (n=18). Variations were present in epitopes B and D, two sites in the RBS and two glycosylation sites in the Guangdong H3N2 HA1 gene. The majority of the Guangdong H3N2 isolates were sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Compared to the World Health Organization 2012 vaccine strains, Guangdong H3N2 strains varied genetically and antigenically to some degree.",

The cell-induced regeneration of tissues and organs is achieved by making use of the tissue engineering technology or methodology. Several genetic approaches with virus and non-viral vectors or genetically engineered cells have been attempted to enhance tissue regeneration. The basic idea is to promote the cell proliferation and differentiation as well as the secretion of biological signal molecules for tissue regeneration from cells by gene transfection. For successful gene transfection and expression, it is important to develop drug delivery system (DDS) which allows a therapeutic gene to be delivered specifically to the target cell at an appropriate timing for a certain time period.

        "abstract": "This guidance describes how the FDA evaluates patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments used as effectiveness endpoints in clinical trials. It also describes our current thinking on how sponsors can develop and use study results measured by PRO instruments to support claims in approved product labeling (see appendix point 1). It does not address the use of PRO instruments for purposes beyond evaluation of claims made about a drug or medical product in its labeling. By explicitly addressing the review issues identified in this guidance, sponsors can increase the efficiency of their endpoint discussions with the FDA during the product development process, streamline the FDA's review of PRO endpoint adequacy, and provide optimal information about the patient's perspective of treatment benefit at the time of product approval. A PRO is a measurement of any aspect of a patient's health status that comes directly from the patient (i.e., without the interpretation of the patient's responses by a physician or anyone else). In clinical trials, a PRO instrument can be used to measure the impact of an intervention on one or more aspects of patients' health status, hereafter referred to as PRO concepts, ranging from the purely symptomatic (response of a headache) to more complex concepts (e.g., ability to carry out activities of daily living), to extremely complex concepts such as quality of life, which is widely understood to be a multidomain concept with physical, psychological, and social components. Data generated by a PRO instrument can provide evidence of a treatment benefit from the patient perspective. For this data to be meaningful, however, there should be evidence that the PRO instrument effectively measures the particular concept that is studied. Generally, findings measured by PRO instruments may be used to support claims in approved product labeling if the claims are derived from adequate and well-controlled investigations that use PRO instruments that reliably and validly measure the specific concepts at issue. The glossary defines many of the terms used in this guidance. In particular, the term instrument refers to the actual questions or items contained in a questionnaire or interview schedule along with all the additional information and documentation that supports the use of these items in producing a PRO measure (e.g., interviewer training and instructions, scoring and interpretation manual). The term conceptual framework refers to how items are grouped according to subconcepts or domains (e.g., the item walking without help may be grouped with another item, walking with difficulty, within the domain of ambulation, and ambulation may be further grouped into the concept of physical ability). FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended but not required.

We examined the association of initial nicotine sensitivity with individual difference factors of sex, other drug use history (i.e. cross-tolerance or cross-sensitization), and parental smoking status in young adult nonsmokers (N = 131). Participants engaged in 4 sessions, the first 3 to assess the dose-response effects of nasal spray nicotine (0, 5, 10 ??g/kg) on rewarding, mood, physiological, sensory processing, and performance effects, and the fourth to assess nicotine reinforcement using a choice procedure. Men had greater initial sensitivity than women to some self-reported effects of nicotine related to reward and incentive salience and to impairment in sensory processing, but men and women did not differ on most other effects. Prior marijuana use was associated with greater nicotine reward, nicotine reinforcement was greater in men versus women among those with prior marijuana use, and having parents who smoked was related to increased incentive salience. However, history of other drug use and parental smoking were not otherwise associated with initial nicotine sensitivity. These findings warrant replication with other methods of nicotine administration, especially cigarette smoking, and in more diverse samples of subjects na??ve to nicotine. Yet, they suggest that sex differences in initial sensitivity to nicotine reward occur before the onset of dependence. They also suggest that parental smoking may not increase risk of nicotine dependence in offspring by altering initial nicotine sensitivity, and that cross-tolerance between other drugs and nicotine may not be robust in humans. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "Expert bodies have long advised that use of hypnotic drugs should be limited to short courses for acutely distressed patients and should generally be avoided in elderly people. Despite this, more than 10 million prescriptions for hypnotics continue to be dispensed each year in England alone, mostly for benzodiazepines and drugs with similar actions such as zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone (so called 'Z-drugs'). Around 80% of all such prescriptions are for people aged 65 years or over, and many patients remain on the drugs for months or years. Such prescribing carries many potential hazards for patients, including risk of dependence, accidents and other adverse effects on heath. Here to review how the risks from hypnotic drugs can be minimised.",

        "abstract": "Around 800,000 people in the UK have dementia, about 80% of whom will have behavioural changes or psychological symptoms in the course of the illness. Such features lower quality of life for both patients and carers, and often result in transfer to residential care and higher costs. Currently, no drugs are licensed in the UK specifically for behavioural changes and psychological symptoms in patients with dementia. Nevertheless, antipsychotic medications have been used in people with dementia, both for psychotic symptoms and also for less specific problems such as agitation and aggression. There have been long-standing concerns about the inappropriate use of these drugs in such settings. In 2004, following worries over an increased likelihood of stroke with risperidone and olanzapine, the former UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) advised that these drugs \"should not be used for the treatment of behavioural symptoms of dementia\". However, this led to reports of unsuitable interpretation of the guidance, with groups of patients having their medication withdrawn inappropriately or being switched to other, potentially more harmful, drugs. Here we assess the safety of antipsychotic medication in people with dementia.;",

        "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by blood-dwelling flukes of the genus Schistosoma. While the disease may affect as many as 249 million people, treatment largely relies on a single drug, praziquantel. The near exclusive use of this drug for such a prevalent disease has led to concerns regarding the potential for drug resistance to arise and the effect this would have on affected populations. In this study, we use an in vitro assay of drug sensitivity to test the effect of praziquantel on miracidia hatched from eggs obtained from fecal samples of Kenyan adult car washers and sand harvesters as well as school children. Whereas in a previous study we found the car washers and sand harvesters to harbor Schistosoma mansoni with reduced praziquantel sensitivity, we found no evidence for the presence of such strains in any of the groups tested here. Using miracidia derived from seven car washers to infect snails, we used the shed cercariae to establish a strain of S. mansoni with significantly reduced praziquantel sensitivity in mice. This was achieved within 5 generations by administering increasing doses of praziquantel to the infected mice until the parasites could withstand a normally lethal dose. This result indicates that while the threat of praziquantel resistance may have diminished in the Kenyan populations tested here, there is a strong likelihood it could return if sufficient praziquantel pressure is applied.",

        "abstract": "Spindle poisons/anti-microtubule drugs are established chemotherapy drugs. These drugs primarily target microtubules and mitotic spindles, activate spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), resulting in caspase-mediated cell death. However, the terminal phenotypes of drug-treated cells are surprisingly heterogeneous ranging from mitotic catastrophe to apparent senescence, suggesting that input from a variety of signaling pathways influence the cell death process. In recent years, studies revealed several signaling pathways that modulate the efficacy of spindle poisons. In this review, we discuss the genes and pathways whose inhibition or overexpression modulates spindle poison sensitivity. These genes cluster to (i) microtubule, microtubule associating proteins (MAPS) and actin cytoskeleton regulators, (ii) the SAC components, (iii) signaling proteins, (iv) chaperones, (v) cell cycle regulators, (vi) proteasome components, (vii) transcription factors and nuclear receptors, and (viii) apoptotic factors. These gene products would be potential targets for drugs to be combined with spindle poisons. Expression status of these genes would also serve as a prognostic marker for spindle poison-mediated chemotherapy. Understanding signaling pathways involved in drug efficacy will aid to rationally develop synergistic chemotherapy strategy.",

        "abstract": "(From the chapter) Personality factors, as normally studied, are sources of variation that are stable over time and that derive from underlying properties of an individual more than current changes in their environment. They account for behavioral differences between individuals presented with identical environments that show consistent patterns within that individual across time. As such, an ultimate goal of personality research must be to identify the relatively static biological variables that determine the superficial factor structure evident in behavior and other measures. Gray attributes neurotic disorder to a factor of punishment sensitivity, which he then linked, via his theory of a Behavioral Inhibition System' (BIS), to a detailed neural architecture. Gray's theory of the BIS is primarily an account of state changes. His personality theory, from which modern Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) derives, assumes that the entire BIS is subject to global modulation that accounts for trait/personality variation. As a result, the predictions of his personality theory are strongly related to the details of his account of state changes. This chapter describes recent refinements of the state aspects of the BIS at both the conceptual and neural levels. Much of the revised theory is clarification and repackaging of the old theory. But some changes that are minor at the state level represent significant alterations to the foundations of RST. They demand the reformulation of experimental tests of RST in terms of the revised theory. For research purposes, this revised theory replaces the old theory. The justification for, and main details of, the updated theory are presented in this chapter. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE: Some argue that pharmacological effects trigger corrective regulatory responses of varying strength. If so, some commonly used in vivo measures of initial drug sensitivity are difficult to interpret because the measured effects represent a combination of underlying pharmacological effects and regulatory counter-responses with the relative contribution of each influenced by individual and dose-related factors. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was determine if core temperature (T (core)), a common measure in drug research, can mask the variability both in underlying pharmacological effects and physiological counter-responses during an initial administration of the hypothermia-promoting drug, nitrous oxide (N(2)O). METHODS: T (core) was measured synchronously with its determinants, heat production (HP) and heat loss (HL) during steady-state N(2)O administration. Drug-naive rats received a 90-min exposure to 0, 15, 30, 50, 60, or 75% N(2)O plus a paired control gas exposure (n > or = 8 per group). HP was measured via indirect calorimetry, HL via direct calorimetry, and T (core) via telemetry. RESULTS: T (core) was unaltered by concentrations < or =50% N(2)O, but at 30 and 50% N(2)O, this stability masked significant increases of HL that were offset by increases of HP. On average, hypothermia accompanied 60 and 75% N(2)O inhalation owing to uncompensated increases of HL. However, some rats administered with these doses also exhibited T (core) stability via significant opposing changes of HL and HP. CONCLUSIONS: A common in vivo measure of initial drug sensitivity can fail to disclose underlying pharmacological sensitivity owing to regulatory counter-responses. This concept has implications for understanding relationships between phenotypic variation in initial drug sensitivity and subsequent drug-taking phenotypes.",

Utilizing recent key technological advances in proteomics, particularly antibody array-based methodologies, the current study aimed to examine the benefit of protein expression profiling in an analogous molecular pharmacological context. We performed protein expression analysis in a panel of lung cancer cell lines via an antibody array approach. Using a modified NCI program, we related cell line-specific proteomic profiles to the previously determined cytotoxic activity of a selection of commonly used anticancer agents, namely docetaxel, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), SN38, cisplatin (CDDP) and carboplatin (CBDCA). In addition, we compared these results with those obtained from our prior DNA microarray-based transcriptomic study. In our expression-drug correlation analysis using antibody array, gemcitabine consistently belonged to an isolated cluster. Docetaxel, paclitaxel, 5-FU, SN38, CBDCA and CDDP were gathered together into one large cluster. These results coincided with those generated by the prior transcriptomic study. Various genes were commonly listed that differentiated gemcitabine from the others. The identified factors associated with drug sensitivities were different between both analyses. Our proteomic profiling data provided confirmation of the previous transcript expression-drug sensitivity correlation analysis. These results suggest that chemotherapy regimens that include gemcitabine should be evaluated in second-line chemotherapy in cases where the first-line chemotherapy did not include this drug. Protein expression-drug sensitivity correlations in lung cancer cells in vitro may provide useful information in determining the most appropriate therapeutic options for lung cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "For much of the past century, scientists studying drug abuse labored in the shadows of powerful myths and misconceptions about the nature of addiction. When scientists began to study addictive behavior in the 1930s, people addicted to drugs were thought to be morally flawed and lacking in willpower. Those views shaped society\u2019s responses to drug abuse, treating it as a moral failing rather than a health problem, which led to an emphasis on punishment rather than prevention and treatment. Today, thanks to science, our views and our responses to addiction and other substance use disorders have changed dramatically. Groundbreaking discoveries about the brain have revolutionized our understanding of compulsive drug use, enabling us to respond effectively to the problem. As a result of scientific research, we know that addiction is a disease that affects both the brain and behavior. We have identified many of the biological and environmental factors and are beginning to search for the genetic variations that contribute to the development and progression of the disease. Scientists use this knowledge to develop effective prevention and treatment approaches that reduce the toll drug abuse takes on individuals, families, and communities. Despite these advances, many people today do not understand why people become addicted to drugs or how drugs change the brain to foster compulsive drug use. This booklet aims to fill that knowledge gap by providing scientific information about the disease of drug addiction, including the many harmful consequences of drug abuse and the basic approaches that have been developed to prevent and treat substance use disorders. At the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), we believe that increased understanding of the basics of addiction will empower people to make informed choices in their own lives, adopt science-based policies and programs that reduce drug abuse and addiction in their communities, and support scientific research that improves the Nation\u2019s well-being.",

        "abstract": "The Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plan (PDP) came into existence in 2006 as part of the Medicare prescription drug benefit. It is the most popular plan type among Medicare drug plans and large numbers of plans are available to all beneficiaries. In this article, we present the first analysis of beneficiary price sensitivity in the PDP market. Our estimate of elasticity of enrollment with respect to premium, -1.45, is larger in magnitude than has been found in the Medicare HMO market. This high degree of beneficiary price sensitivity for PDPs is consistent with relatively low product differentiation, low fixed costs of entry in the PDP market, and the fact that, in contrast to changing HMOs, beneficiaries can select a PDP without disrupting doctor-patient relationships.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate whether the effects of anticancer agents are able to be predicted, the results of sensitivity tests on anticancer agents were compared with the results of preoperative chemotherapy. METHODS: Biopsies were taken from 25 patients with esophageal cancer and 10 with gastric cancer, before chemotherapy, and the drug sensitivity was determined after culturing for 1 week. The chemotherapy consisted of low-dose cis-diamino-dichloroplatinum + 5-fluorouracil, and its clinical effect was determined after 3 or 5 weeks. RESULTS: Sensitivity was determined in 20 of the esophageal cancer patients and 8 of the gastric cancer patients, accounting for 80% of all the patients. Of the 11 patients judged to have sensitivity by the histoculture drug response assay (HDRA), 7 had a partial response, and of the 17 judged to have no sensitivity, 16 had a minor response or no change (NC). It was thus demonstrated that predictions of the effect of anticancer agents could be made with considerable accuracy using HDRA. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of the NC patients was poor, and distant metastasis, thought to be an adverse effect, soon appeared. From the viewpoint of both medical costs and patient quality of life, treatments other than preoperative chemotherapy should be selected for patients assessed to have NC. We believe that these sensitivity tests should be introduced clinically.",

Traditionally it has been assumed that gas velocity and fine particles significantly impact on emission levels. Through the use of a simple fluidised bed model, sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the key operating parameters that influence emission rates. It was found that in addition to velocity, density and mid sized particles are the most influential factors for emission rates. Further work is needed to identify how these parameters can be altered during normal operations to reduce catalyst emissions.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - To evaluate the impact of a sub-regional training course in pharmacovigilance on participants' attitudes to ADR reporting, and self-reported application of knowledge gained. Method - The study involved a cross-sectional survey during a sub-regional pharmacovigilance training course in Zimbabwe. Eighteen participants from 10 African countries attended and were asked to complete self-administered pre-course and post-course questionnaires. A follow-up questionnaire was also posted to each participant 2 months after the workshop. Results - After the course, there was a marked difference in the perceived factors discouraging a participant from reporting an ADR with only a few respondents unsure how to report ADRs or worried about confidentiality and legal issues. Only 5.4% of responses were inappropriate after the training when asked what should be reported to a voluntary ADR reporting scheme compared to 19.8% before the course. Half of the respondents to the follow-up questionnaire expected a pharmacovigilance centre to be established in their countries as a result of the training. Conclusion - The training course had a positive effect on attitudes and knowledge of pharmacovigilance and may lead to establishment of pharmacovigilance centres in some of the participating countries. There would be value in holding more of these workshops within the region. Copyright (c) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Beauveria bassiana is an entomopathogenic fungus and is a rare cause of keratitis. We present a case of fungal keratitis caused by B. bassiana that was diagnosed by in vivo confocal microscopy and in vitro corneal cultures. In addition, we determined the temperature- and drug-sensitivities of the isolated strain of B. bassiana. CASE PRESENTATION A 59-year-old Japanese man with a 2-month history of keratitis was examined by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, in vivo confocal microscopy, and histology and cultures of corneal scrapings. The corneal scrapings were used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations of different antifungal drugs and also to determine the temperature-sensitivity. In vivo confocal microscopy and histological examinations showed filamentous fungal keratitis. The characteristics of the fungal growth indicated that the keratitis was caused by B. bassiana. The keratitis responded poorly to systemic and topical voriconazole and to natamycin ointment. However, it was resolved after changing the natamycin to micafungin combined with surgical debridement. The isolated strain was sensitive to itraconazole, miconazole, micafungin, voriconazole, and resistant to flucytosine and fluconazole. It was moderately sensitive to amphotericin B, and natamycin. After 7 days in culture, the isolate grew small white colonies at 25 \u00b0C, very small colonies at 35 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C. CONCLUSION The drug-sensitivity and temperature-sensitivity profiles of B. bassiana should be helpful in the treatment of B. bassiana keratitis. Therapeutic surgery may be helpful for mycotic keratitis poorly responsive to medical therapy alone.",

        "abstract": "An ultra-sensitive laser-based analytical technique, intracavity optogalvanic spectroscopy (ICOGS) providing extremely high sensitivity for detection of (14)C-labeled carbon dioxide has been demonstrated. Obviating the need for scintillation counting and capable of replacing accelerator mass spectrometers (AMS), the technique can quantify zeptomoles of (14)C in sub-micromole CO(2) samples. Based on the specificity of laser resonances, coupled with the sensitivity provided by standing waves in an optical cavity, and detection via impedance variations, limits of detection near 10(-15) (14)C/(12)C ratios have been obtained. With the use of a 15 Watt (14)CO(2) laser, a linear calibration with samples from approximate to 10(-15) to approximate to 10(-11) in (14)C/(12)C ratios was demonstrated. Calibrations become nonlinear over larger concentration ranges due to laser and ICOGS saturation effects and changes in equilibration time constants. Conditions, however, can be chosen to provide near linear response over different dynamic ranges. Drug discovery applications such as radiolabeling studies with extremely low specific activity, microdosing studies, and individualized sub therapeutic tests of drug metabolism typically involve samples having (14)C/(12)C ratios in the approximate range of 1 to 100 x 10(-12). A laboratory instrument for that range will be small (table top), low maintenance and capable of being interfaced to GC or LC inputs.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge in the treatment of cancer is multidrug resistance (MDR) that develops during chemotherapy. Here we demonstrate that tiopronin (1), a thiol-substituted N-propanoylglycine derivative, was selectively toxic to a series of cell lines expressing the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and MRP1 (ABCC1). Treatment of MDR cells with 1 led to instability of the ABCB1 mRNA and consequently a reduction in P-gp protein, despite functional assays demonstrating that tiopronin does not interact with P-gp. Long-term exposure of P-gp-expressing cells to 1 sensitized them to doxorubicin and paclitaxel, both P-gp substrates. Treatment of MRP1-overexpressing cells with tiopronin led to a significant reduction in MRP1 protein. Synthesis and screening of analogues of tiopronin demonstrated that the thiol functional group was essential for collateral sensitivity while substitution of the amino acid backbone altered but did not destroy specificity, pointing to future development of targeted analogues.",

The pH-sensitive PAAm-g-XG copolymer was synthesized by free radical polymerization under the nitrogen atmosphere followed by alkaline hydrolysis. The grafting and alkaline hydrolysis reactions were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction studies were carried out to know the crystalline nature of encapsulated drug. Scanning electron microscopic study revealed that the interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) beads possess porous matrix structure in alkaline pH whereas nonporous matrix structure was observed in acidic pH. The swelling of the beads and drug release was significantly increased when pH of the medium was changed from acidic to alkaline. The results of pulsatile swelling study indicated that the IPN beads changed their swelling behavior when pH of the external medium was altered. As pH of the medium was changed from 1.2 to 7.4, a considerable increase in swelling was observed for all the beads. However, swelling process was slower than the deswelling. At higher pH values, the carboxyl functional groups of hydrogels undergo ionization and the osmotic pressure inside the beads increases resulting in higher swelling. Drug release followed case II transport mechanism in acidic medium whereas anomalous/non-Fickian transport mechanism was observed in alkaline medium.",

In situations when these tests are unavailable, it has been suggested that using commercial drug calibrators on APTT and PT assays would theoretically provide reagent sensitivity to these drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether commercial drug calibrators deliver similar reagent sensitivity information as samples from patients receiving dabigatran or rivaroxaban as part of their routine care. Two laboratory sites tested commercial calibrator material for dabigatran and rivaroxaban (Hyphen Biomedical) using PT and APTT reagents and data was compared to samples collected from patients taking NOACs that were quantified by LC-MS/MS. Correlation statistics and calculating the amount of drug required to double the clotting time of normal plasma were performed. All drug calibrator material correlated more strongly (R(2)> 0.95) for any reagent/drug combination than patient samples (R(2) ranged from 0.29-0.86). Dabigatran calibrator results and patient data were equivalent for SynthASil and PTT-A APTT reagents. The dabigatran and rivaroxaban calibrator material over-estimated drug sensitivity for all PT reagents when compared to sensitivity data calculated based on drug levels obtained by LC-MS/MS from patient samples. In conclusion, drug-specific calibrators overestimated reagent sensitivity which may underestimate in vivo drug concentration in a given patient. Further studies are required to assess whether this method of determining relative sensitivity of NOAC on routine coagulation assays should be recommended.",

        "abstract": "In this study we compared the in silico predictions of the effect of ABCC1 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) with experimental data on MRP1 transport function and response to chemotherapeutics and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) inhibitors. Vectors encoding seven ABCC1 nsSNPs were stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, and levels and localization of the mutant MRP1 proteins were determined by confocal microscopy and immunoblotting. The function of five of the mutant proteins was determined using cell-based drug and inhibitor sensitivity and efflux assays, and membrane-based organic anion transport assays. Predicted consequences of the mutations were determined by multiple bioinformatic methods. Mutants C43S and S92F were correctly routed to the HEK cell plasma membrane, but the levels were too low to permit functional characterization. In contrast, levels and membrane trafficking of R633Q, G671V, R723Q, A989T, and C1047S were similar to wild-type MRP1. In cell-based assays, all five mutants were equally effective at effluxing calcein, but only two exhibited reduced resistance to etoposide (C1047S) and vincristine (A989T; C1047S). The GSH-dependent inhibitor LY465803 (LY465803 [N-[3-(9-chloro-3-methyl-4-oxo-4H-isoxazolo-[4,3-c]quinolin-5-yl)-cyclohexylmethyl]-benzamide)] was less effective at blocking calcein efflux by A989T, but in a membrane-based assay, organic anion transport by A989T and C1047S was inhibited by MRP1 modulators as well as wild-type MRP1. GSH accumulation assays suggest cellular GSH efflux by A989T and C1047S may be impaired. In conclusion, although six in silico analyses consistently predict deleterious consequences of ABCC1 nsSNPs G671V, changes in drug resistance and inhibitor sensitivity were only observed for A989T and C1047S, which may relate to GSH transport differences.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate antibiotic use in five national household surveys conducted with the WHO methodology to identify key determinants of antibiotic use in the community.\\n\\nMETHODS: Data from The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda surveys were combined. We used logistic regression models that accounted for the clustered survey design to identify the determinants of care seeking outside the home and antibiotic use for 2914 cases of recent acute illness.\\n\\nRESULTS: Overall, 95% of individuals with acute illness took medicines, 90% sought care outside their homes and 36% took antibiotics. In multivariate analyses, illness severity was a strong predictor of seeking care outside the home. Among those who sought outside care, the strongest predictor of antibiotic use was the presence of upper respiratory symptoms (OR: 3.02, CI: 2.36-3.86, P<0.001), followed by gastrointestinal symptoms or difficulty breathing, and antibiotics use was less likely if they had fever. The odds of receiving antibiotics were higher when visiting a public hospital or more than one healthcare facility.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The nature and severity of symptoms and patterns of care seeking had the greatest influence on decisions to take antibiotics. Antibiotics were widely available and inappropriately used in all settings. Policies to regulate antibiotics distribution as well as interventions to educate prescribers, dispensers and consumers are needed to improve antibiotic use.",

The current therapies for treating T. cruzi infection and thus preventing Chagas disease often have adverse effects, unpredictable efficacy and require long courses of treatment. Development of new therapies has been very limited, in part due to lack of interest but also as a result of poor support and inappropriate models for discovering and evaluating candidate drugs. The Chagas Drug Discovery Consortium (CDDC) was created with funding from the US National Institutes of Health to help address some of these issues. The goals of the CDDC are to discover and evaluate new candidate drugs and develop rigorous assays of drug efficacy. This report summarizes the second meeting of the CDDC in November 2010.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine rates of cross-sensitivity of rash among commonly used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in patients with epilepsy. METHODS: The incidence of AED-related rash was determined in 1875 outpatients (> or =12 years), taking carbamazepine (CBZ), clobazam (CLB), felbamate (FBM), gabapentin (GBP), levetiracetam (LEV), lamotrigine (LTG), oxcarbazepine (OXC), phenobarbital (PB), phenytoin (PHT), primidone (PRM), tiagabine (TGB), topiramate (TPM), vigabatrin (VGB), valproic acid (VPA), or zonisamide (ZNS). We compared rates of rash for each AED in patients with vs those without a rash to 1) another specific AED; 2) any other AED; 3) any two other AEDs; and 4) any non-epilepsy medication. RESULTS: A total of 14.3% (269/1,875) of patients had a rash attributed to at least one AED; 2.8% had a rash to two or more AEDs. Of patients who had a rash to CBZ and were also prescribed PHT (n = 59), 57.6% had a rash to PHT (abbreviated as CBZ --> PHT: 57.6%); of patients who had a rash to PHT and were also prescribed CBZ (n = 81), rate of rash was 42% (i.e., PHT --> CBZ: 42%). Other results: CBZ --> LTG: 20% (n = 50); LTG --> CBZ: 26.3% (n = 38); CBZ --> OXC: 33% (n = 15); OXC --> CBZ: 71.4% (n = 7); CBZ --> PB: 26.7% (n = 30); PB --> CBZ: 66.7% (n = 12); LTG --> PHT: 38.9% (n = 36); PHT --> LTG: 18.9% (n = 74); PB --> PHT: 53.3% (n = 15); PHT --> PB: 19.5% (n = 41); OXC --> LTG: 37.5% (n = 8); LTG --> OXC: 20% (n = 15). There was evidence of specific cross-sensitivity between CBZ and PHT, and between CBZ and PB. CONCLUSION: Cross-sensitivity rates between certain antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are high, especially when involving carbamazepine and phenytoin. Specific cross-sensitivity rates provided here may be useful for AED selection and counseling in individual patients.",

        "abstract": "A tablet formulation for direct compression has previously been studied using multivariate design. An optimization study of one of the most important tablet properties, disintegration time, revealed that excipients with Principal Properties (PP's) that were predicted as suitable by the model were not represented within the studied material. The feasibility of using mixtures of excipients in the multivariate approach to tablet formulation to solve this problem has been investigated in the present study. By mixing different excipients of the same excipient class, it should be possible to obtain mixtures with the predicted PP's, which in turn should give a formulation with the desired properties. In order to investigate the utility of this approach, separate mixture designs were applied to both binders and fillers (diluents). As reported here, the Partial Least Squares Projections to Latent Structures (PLS) model developed in the previously published screening study has been validated in the sense that the interesting region of the PP space identified in it has been shown to contain excipients, pure or mixed, that give the formulation suitable properties. Formulations with suitable properties were found with the mixture experiments. The local models also offer several alternatives for the composition of the formulation that yield the desired disintegration time.",

This mAb is active in previously treated patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) refractory to alkylating agents and purine nucleoside analogs. Alemtuzumab is also investigated in previously untreated patients with this leukemia. The results of a prospective randomized Phase III study (CAM307 trial) comparing chlorambucil with alemtuzumab in the first-line treatment of progressive B-CLL were recently published. The overall response rate, complete remission rate, and progression-free survival were all superior for alemtuzumab. Moreover, elimination of minimal residual disease occurred in one third of complete responders to alemtuzumab and none to chlorambucil. Adverse events were similar in both arms with the exception of infusion-related reactions and cytomegalovirus infections. In 2001, alemtuzumab was approved in the USA and Europe as a third-line therapy for patients with B-CLL who had been treated with alkylating agents and failed fludarabine therapy. In September 2007, the US FDA, on the basis of CAM307 results, approved alemtuzumab for the treatment of previously untreated patients with B-CLL. Moreover, the European Commission recently granted marketing authorization to alemtuzumab for the treatment of patients with B-CLL for whom fludarabine combination monotherapy is not appropriate.",

However, in order to address these aims it was important to, first, assess whether the test of delayed self-recognition (DSR) is a valid measure for the development of the TES, and, second, to propose and evaluate a theoretical model that describes what factors influence the development of the TES. The validity of the DSR test was verified by comparing the performance of 57 children on the DSR test to their performance on a meta-representational task (modified false belief task) and to a task that was essentially the same as the DSR test but was specifically designed to rely on the capacity to entertain secondary representations (i.e., surprise body task). Longitudinal testing of the children showed that at the mental age (MA) of 2.5 years they failed the DSR test, despite training them to understand the intended functions of the medium used in the DSR test; whereas, with training, children at the MA of 3.0 and 3.5 years exhibited DSR. Children at the MA of 4 years exhibited DSR without any training. Finally, results suggest that children's meta-representational ability was the only factor that contributed to the prediction of successful performance on the DSR test, and thus to the emergence of the TES. Furthermore, prospective longitudinal data revealed that caregiver conversational style was the only factor that contributed to the prediction of level of training required to pass the DSR test. That is, children of low-elaborative caregivers required significantly more training to pass the DSR test than children of high-elaborative caregivers, indicating that children who received more elaborative conversational input from their caregivers had a more advanced understanding of their TES.",

        "abstract": "New drug deployment strategies are imperative to address the problem of drug resistance, which is limiting the management of infectious diseases and cancers. We evolved resistance in Escherichia coli toward 23 drugs used clinically for treating bacterial infections and mapped the resulting collateral sensitivity and resistance profiles, revealing a complex collateral sensitivity network. On the basis of these data, we propose a new treatment framework-collateral sensitivity cycling-in which drugs with compatible collateral sensitivity profiles are used sequentially to treat infection and select against drug resistance development. We identified hundreds of such drug sets and demonstrated that the antibiotics gentamicin and cefuroxime can be deployed cyclically such that the treatment regimen selected against resistance to either drug. We then validated our findings with related bacterial pathogens. These results provide proof of principle for collateral sensitivity cycling as a sustainable treatment paradigm that may be generally applicable to infectious diseases and cancer.",

MiR-122 and negative miRNA expression vectors were constructed and stably transfected into BEL-7402/5-FU cells. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the level of miR-122, Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and P53 mRNA. Western Blotting was used to detect Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and P53 protein expression. Drug sensitivity of the cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was analyzed with MTT and flow cytometry. Compared with negative miRNA transfectants or untreated cells, mRNA and protein expression level of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL in stable miR-122 transfectants were decreased. Accordingly, P53 protein expression showed a significant up-regulation; MTT results showed that after incubation with 5-FU, miR-122 transfectants had higher cell inhibitory rates than negative miRNA or untreated cells; flow cytometry results demonstrated that apoptosis rate increased in miR-122 transfected cells, compared with negative miRNA or untreated cells. After addition of 5-FU (10 and 100 micromol/I), miR-122 transfected cells showed higher apoptosis rate than negative miRNA or untreated cells. MiR-122 can specifically down-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and increase P53 activity in BEL-7402/5-FU cells, which increased cells spontaneous apoptosis and sensitize cells to 5-FU. Therefore, MiR-122 can be used as a potential therapy agent against human hepatoblastoma.",

Compounds that inhibit the drug efflux mechanism can improve efficacy or reverse resistance. Of the eight described ABC transporter subfamilies, those proteins conferring MDR in humans are in subfamilies A, B, C, and G. In nematodes, transporters in subfamilies B and C are suggested to confer resistance to ivermectin. The Brugia malayi ABC transporter superfamily was examined to assess their potential to influence sensitivity to moxidectin. There was an increase in expression of ABC transporters in subfamilies A, B, C, and G following treatment. Co-administration of moxidectin with inhibitors of ABC transporter function did not enhance sensitivity to moxidectin in males; however, sensitivity was significantly enhanced in females and microfilariae. The work suggests that ABC transporters influence sensitivity to moxidectin and have a potential role in drug resistance. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "The drug cisplatin is widely used to treat a number of tumor types. However, resistance to the drug, which remains poorly understood, limits its usefulness. Previous work using Dictyostelium discoideum as a model for studying drug resistance showed that mutants lacking sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) lyase, the enzyme that degrades S-1-P, had increased resistance to cisplatin, whereas mutants overexpressing the enzyme were more sensitive to the drug. S-1-P is synthesized from sphingosine and ATP by the enzyme sphingosine kinase. We have identified two sphingosine kinase genes in D. discoideum-sgkA and sgkB-that are homologous to those of other species. The biochemical properties of the SgkA and SgkB enzymes suggest that they are the equivalent of the human Sphk1 and Sphk2 enzymes, respectively. Disruption of the kinases by homologous recombination (both single and double mutants) or overexpression of the sgkA gene resulted in altered growth rates and altered response to cisplatin. The null mutants showed increased sensitivity to cisplatin, whereas mutants overexpressing the sphingosine kinase resulted in increased resistance compared to the parental cells. The results indicate that both the SgkA and the SgkB enzymes function in regulating cisplatin sensitivity. The increase in sensitivity of the sphingosine kinase-null mutants was reversed by the addition of S-1-P, and the increased resistance of the sphingosine kinase overexpressor mutant was reversed by the inhibitor N,N-dimethylsphingosine. Parallel changes in sensitivity of the null mutants are seen with the platinum-based drug carboplatin but not with doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and etoposide. This pattern of specificity is similar to that observed with the S-1-P lyase mutants and should be useful in designing therapeutic schemes involving more than one drug. This study identifies the sphingosine kinases as new drug targets for modulating the sensitivity to platinum-based drugs.",

        "abstract": "Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have received increasing attention in the field of cancer research. miRNAs play important roles in many normal biological processes; however, the aberrant miRNA expression and its correlation with the development and progression of cancers is an emerging field. Therefore, miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for diagnosis of cancer and prediction of prognosis. Importantly, some miRNAs could regulate the formation of cancer stem cells and the acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which are critically associated with drug resistance. Moreover, some miRNAs could target genes related to drug sensitivity, resulting in the altered sensitivity of cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs. Emerging evidences have also shown that knock-down or re-expression of specific miRNAs by synthetic anti-sense oligonucleotides or pre-miRNAs could induce drug sensitivity, leading to increased inhibition of cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. More importantly, recent studies have shown that natural agents including isoflavone, 3,3???-diindolylmethane, and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate altered miRNA expression profiles, leading to an increased sensitivity of cancer cells to conventional therapeutics. These emerging results suggest that specific targeting of miRNAs by different approaches could open new avenues for cancer treatment through overcoming drug resistance and thereby improve the outcome of cancer therapy. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This later rise was mainly a result of increases in resistance to nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (from 5.4% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2009, P=0.24) and protease inhibitors (1.5% to 2.1%, P=0.12). Thymidine analogue mutations, including T215 revertants, remained the most frequent mutations associated with nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, despite a considerable fall in stavudine and zidovudine use between 2002 and 2009 (from 29.4% of drug regimens in 2002 to 0.8% in 2009, from 47.9% to 8.8%, respectively).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The previously observed decline in the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in HIV-1 infections probably acquired in the UK seems to have stabilised. The continued high prevalence of thymidine analogue mutations suggests that the source of this resistance may be increasingly from patients who have not undergone antiretroviral therapy and who harbour resistant viruses.

This mini-review briefly discusses its currently known functions in apoptosis and drug sensitivity. As an inhibitor of cell proliferation, p21WAF1/Cip1 plays an important role in drug-induced tumor suppression. Nevertheless, a number of recent studies have shown that p21WAF1/Cip1 can assume both pro- or anti-apoptotic functions in response to anti-tumor agents depending on cell type and cellular context. This dual role of p21WAF1/Cip1 in cancer cells complicates using p21WAF1/Cip1 status to predict response to anti-tumor agents. However, it is possible to develop p21WAF1/Cip1-targeted reagents or p21WAF1/Cip1 gene transfer techniques to have a beneficial effect within a well-defined therapeutic context. Better understanding of the roles of p21WAF1/Cip1 in tumors should enable a more rational approach to anti-tumor drug design and therapy.",

Verification of the PT assay was performed by comparison with multidrug-resistant cells and comparison with conventional assays evaluating cell viability, cytochrome c release, apoptosis induction, and cell size. We demonstrate that this system is capable of detecting drug-induced signals at a concentration threshold sensitivity at least seven orders of magnitude better than existing assays.

        "abstract": "The ability to use vitro inactivation kinetic parameters in scaling to in vivo drug-drug interactions (DDIs) for mechanism-based inactivators of human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes was examined using eight human P450-selective marker activities in pooled human liver microsomes. These data were combined with other parameters (systemic C(max), estimated hepatic inlet C(max), fraction unbound, in vivo P450 enzyme degradation rate constants estimated from clinical pharmacokinetic data, and fraction of the affected drug cleared by the inhibited enzyme) to predict increases in exposure to drugs, and the predictions were compared with in vivo DDIs gathered from clinical studies reported in the scientific literature. In general, the use of unbound systemic C(max) as the inactivator concentration in vivo yielded the most accurate predictions of DDI with a mean -fold error of 1.64. Abbreviated in vitro approaches to identifying mechanism-based inactivators were developed. Testing potential inactivators at a single concentration (IC(25)) in a 30-min preincubation with human liver microsomes in the absence and presence of NADPH followed by assessment of P450 marker activities readily identified those compounds known to be mechanism-based inactivators and represents an approach that can be used with greater throughput. Measurement of decreases in IC(50) occurring with a 30-min preincubation with liver microsomes and NADPH was also useful in identifying mechanism-based inactivators, and the IC(50) measured after such a preincubation was highly correlated with the k(inact)/K(I) ratio measured after a full characterization of inactivation. Overall, these findings support the conclusion that P450 in vitro inactivation data are valuable in predicting clinical DDIs that can occur via this mechanism.",

        "title": "Immune hemolytic anemia caused by sensitivity to a metabolite of etodolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immune hemolytic anemia can be caused by sensitivity to many different drugs. In some instances, the sensitizing compound can be identified by in vitro testing, but results are often negative. One reason for this is that a drug metabolite formed in vivo can be the sensitizing agent, but the responsible metabolites have rarely been identified at a chemical level. This report describes a patient who developed severe, Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia on two occasions after taking the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug etodolac. Studies were performed to characterize etodolac metabolites to which this patient was sensitive. CASE REPORT: Serum was tested for antibody in the presence and absence of drug using conventional methods and urine from individuals taking etodolac as a source of drug metabolites. Urinary metabolites of etodolac were identified by high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis. Glucuronide conjugates of etodolac and the 6-OH metabolite of etodolac were synthesized in a rat liver microsomal system to obtain reference standards. RESULTS: The patient's serum gave only trace (+/-) reactions with normal RBCs in the presence of etodolac but reacted strongly (4+) in the presence of urine from an individual taking this drug. The active urinary metabolites were identified as etodolac glucuronide and 6-OH etodolac glucuronide. CONCLUSION: This patient appears to have experienced acute, severe immune hemolytic anemia on two occasions because of sensitivity to the glucuronides of etodolac and 6-OH etodolac. In patients suspected of having drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia, RBC-reactive antibodies can sometimes be detected by using urine from an individual taking the implicated medication as the source of drug metabolites in in vitro reactions. For patients who present with acute immune hemolysis, a careful history of drug exposure should be taken, and, where indicated, confirmatory testing should be performed to identify the sensitizing drug and prevent inadvertent reinduction of hemolysis at a later time.",

        "abstract": "Drug resistance is an obstacle to the effective treatment of ovarian cancer. We and others have shown that the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway is a novel potential target to overcome drug resistance. The purpose of this study was to validate IGF2 as a potential therapeutic target in drug resistant ovarian cancer and to determine the efficacy of targeting IGF2 in vivo. An analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data in the serous ovarian cancer cohort showed that high IGF2 mRNA expression is significantly associated with shortened interval to disease progression and death, clinical indicators of drug resistance. In a genetically diverse panel of ovarian cancer cell lines, the IGF2 mRNA levels measured in cell lines resistant to various microtubule-stabilizing agents including Taxol were found to be significantly elevated compared to the drug sensitive cell lines. The effect of IGF2 knockdown on Taxol resistance was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Transient IGF2 knockdown significantly sensitized drug resistant cells to Taxol treatment. A Taxol-resistant ovarian cancer xenograft model, developed from HEY-T30 cells, exhibited extreme drug resistance, wherein the maximal tolerated dose of Taxol did not delay tumor growth in mice. Blocking the IGF1R (a transmembrane receptor that transmits signals from IGF1 and IGF2) using a monoclonal antibody did not alter the response to Taxol. However, stable IGF2 knockdown using short-hairpin RNA in HEY-T30 effectively restored Taxol sensitivity. These findings validate IGF2 as a potential therapeutic target in drug resistant ovarian cancer and show that directly targeting IGF2 may be a preferable strategy compared with targeting IGF1R alone.",

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of prenatal MA exposure on exploratory behavior and nociception with respect to challenge dose of the same drug. Mothers of the tested offspring received a daily injection of MA (5 mg/kg) or saline throughout the gestation period. Adult male offspring (prenatally MA- or saline-exposed) were divided to groups with challenge dose of MA (1 mg/kg) or saline. A modified Open field test (Laboras) was used to examine behavior in unknown environment. Plantar test was used to measure nociception on forelimbs, hind limbs, and the tail. Conditioned place preference (CPP) test was used to examine drug-seeking behavior. Our results in Laboras demonstrated that prenatal MA exposure sensitized the animals to the challenge dose of MA. Specifically prenatally MA-exposed animals that received the challenge MA in adulthood displayed higher locomotion and rearing activity relative to all the other groups. The Plantar test data suggest analgesic effect of MA (1 mg/kg), which however, did not differ based on the prenatal drug exposure. The results of CPP test showed that MA (5 mg/kg) conditioning resulted in increased drug-seeking behavior, but this effect was not affected by prenatal drug exposure. Thus, our data demonstrate that the effects of prenatal MA exposure and the challenge dose of the same drug in adulthood depend on behavioral model used.",

Detection threshold tests for phenyl-ethylalcohol and menthol served to determine the level of olfactory sensitivity. Moreover, the subjective magnitude of odor pleasantness, unpleasantness, intensity, and familiarity was investigated. Results: The depressive patients showed higher olfactory thresholds than did the control subjects. Additionally, the reduced olfactory sensitivity was correlated with the severity of depression. The depressive patients tended to evaluate the odors as less unpleasant than did the control subjects.

        "abstract": "In cervical cancer, one of the most common malignant tumors in women worldwide, miR-126 has been reported to exhibit decreased expression. However, its role in cervical cancer cell proliferation and drug sensitivity has remained relatively unexplored. Here, we compared the expression of miR-126 in cervical cancer tissues (n = 20) with that in normal cervical tissue (n = 20) using quantitative RT-PCR. The viability of Siha cervical cancer cells was further measured by MTT assay after transfection with miR-126 mimic (Siha-miR-126 mimic) or microRNA mimic negative control (Siha-miR mimic NC) and after treatment with various concentrations of bleomycin (BLM). IC50s were calculated, and the survival rates (SRs) of Siha cells were calculated. miR-126 expression in cervical cancer tissue was significantly decreased compared with that in normal cervical tissue (P < 0.01). The relative SRs of Siha-miR-126 mimic cells were also significantly decreased compared with those of Siha-miR mimic NC cells at 24-96 h after transfection. The IC50 of BLM in Siha-miR-126 mimic cells (50.3 \u00b1 2.02 \u03bcg/mL) was decreased compared with that in Siha-miR mimic NC cells (70.5 \u00b1 4.33 \u03bcg/mL) at 48 h after transfection (P < 0.05). Finally, the SRs of Siha-miR-126 mimic cells were significantly lower than those of Siha- miR mimic NC cells after cultured in medium containing 40 \u03bcg/mL BLM for 24-96 h (P < 0.05). These results suggest that miR-126 is expressed at low levels in cervical cancer. Upregulation of miR-126 inhibited cervical cancer cell proliferation and enhanced the sensitivity to BLM. Thus, miR-126 may represent a novel approach to cervical cancer treatment.",

There have been reports of food additive sensitivity in CIU previously, but the prevalence has not been precisely determined. Objective: To determine the prevalence of reactions to food and drug additives in patients with CIU. Methods: We challenged 100 patients in our allergy/immunology division with CIU to the 11 additives most commonly associated with reactions: tartrazine (FD&C Yellow 5), potassium metabisulfite, monosodium glutamate, aspartame, sodium benzoate, methyl paraben, butylated hydroxy anisole, butylated hydroxy toluene, FD&C Yellow 6, sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite. All of the patients had a history of CIU for longer than 6 weeks, and 43 reported possible history of food or drug additive sensitivity. Single-blind challenges to all of the additives were performed in the clinic and skin scores were recorded. Subjects with positive challenge tests underwent double-blind placebo controlled challenges. Results: Of 100 subjects, only 2 had a positive urticarial response on single-blind challenge. Neither of these patients had a positive urticarial response on double-blind placebo-controlled challenge. There were no gastrointestinal, respiratory, or other symptom, and no patients reported late reactions. Conclusion: We were able to conclude, with 95% confidence intervals that sensitivity to any of the 11 food and drug additives occurs in fewer than 1% of patients with CIU. Food and drug additives appear to be a rare cause of CIU, and avoidance is not recommended. \u00a9 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.",

We describe a plethysmograph-based system which operates in any available gas mixture. A mathematical model of the acoustic microphone used as reference transducer, the microphone preamplifier, and the thermal behaviour of the plethysmograph, is developed to quantify the frequency response of the system. Maximum deviation from a perfect response is less than 1% in amplitude and 1 degree in phase for both pressure and flow measurements over the range 1-100 Hz. Measurements using a pressure transducer mounted on the tip of a catheter indicate that the error due to amplitude and phase variation in the plethysmograph is less than 0.1 dB and 0.4 degrees at 100 Hz.",

Drug resistant cells were isolated from FL/DeltaAkt-1:ER*(Myr(+)) + DeltaRaf-1:AR cells in the presence of doxorubicin. Activation of Raf-1, in the drug resistant FL/DeltaAkt-1:ER*(Myr(+)) + DeltaRaf-1:AR cells, increased the IC(50) for doxorubicin 80-fold, whereas activation of Akt-1, by itself, had no effect on the doxorubicin IC50. However, Akt-1 activation enhanced cell proliferation and clonogenicity in the presence of chemotherapeutic drugs. Thus the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway had profound effects on the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, and Akt-1 activation was required for the long term growth of these cells as well as resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. The effects of doxorubicin on the induction of apoptosis in the drug resistant cells were enhanced by addition of either mTOR and MEK inhibitors. These results indicate that targeting the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways may be an effective approach for therapeutic intervention in drug resistant cancers that have mutations activating these cascades.",

DESIGN AND METHODS: To assess the precision of the Antivirogram and PhenoSense assays, we examined susceptibility results of HIV-1 isolates lacking drug resistance mutations and containing matching patterns of drug resistance mutations. To assess sensitivity, we determined for each assay the proportion of isolates with common patterns of matching drug resistance mutations having reductions in susceptibility greater than those in isolates without drug resistance mutations. RESULTS: We analyzed protease inhibitor (PI) susceptibility results obtained by the Antivirogram assay for 293 isolates and by the PhenoSense assay for 300 isolates. We analyzed reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor susceptibility results obtained by the Antivirogram assay for 202 isolates and by the PhenoSense assay for 126 isolates. For wild-type and mutant isolates, the median absolute deviance of the fold resistance of nucleoside RT inhibitor susceptibility results was significantly lower for the PhenoSense assay than for the Antivirogram assay. The PhenoSense assay was also significantly more likely than the Antivirogram assay to detect resistance to abacavir, didanosine, and stavudine in isolates with the common drug resistance mutations M41L, M184V, and T215Y (+/-L210W). We found no significant differences between the 2 assays for detecting PI and nonnucleoside RT inhibitor resistance. CONCLUSION: The PhenoSense assay is more precise than the Antivirogram assay and superior at detecting resistance to abacavir, didanosine, and stavudine.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new microfluidic platform for screening drugs and their dose response on the locomotion behavior of free living nematodes and parasitic nematodes. The system offers a higher sensitivity drug screening chip which employs a combination of existing and newly developed methods. Real-time observation of the entire drug application process (i.e. the innate pre-exposure locomotion, the transient response during drug exposure and the time-resolved, post-exposure behavior) at a single worm resolution is made possible. The chip enables the monitoring of four nematode parameters (number of worms responsive, number of worms leaving the drug well, average worm velocity and time until unresponsiveness). Each parameter generates an inherently different dose response; allowing for a higher resolution when screening for resistance. We expect this worm chip could be used as a robust cross species, cross drug platform. Existing nematode motility and migration assays do not offer this level of sophistication. The device comprises two principal components: behavioral microchannels to study nematode motility and a drug well for administering the dose and observing drug effects as a function of exposure time. The drug screening experiment can be described by three main steps: (i) 'pre-exposure study'- worms are inserted into the behavioral channels and their locomotion is characterized, (ii) 'dose exposure'- worms are guided from the behavioral microchannels into the drug well and held for a predefined time, during which time their transient response to the dose is characterized and (iii) 'post-exposure study'- worms are guided back into the behavioral microchannels where their locomotion (i.e. their time-resolved response to the dose) is characterized and compared to pre-exposure motility. The direction of nematodes' movement is reliably controlled by the application of an electric field within a defined range. Control experiments (e.g. in the absence of any drug) confirm that the applied electric fields do not affect the worms' motility or viability. We demonstrate the workability of the microfluidic platform on free living Caenorhabditis elegans (wild-type N2 and levamisole resistant ZZ15 lev-8) and parasitic Oesophagotomum dentatum (levamisole-sensitive, SENS and levamisole-resistant, LEVR) using levamisole (a well-studied anthelmintic) as the test drug. The proposed scheme of drug screening on a microfluidic device is expected to significantly improve the resolution, sensitivity and data throughput of in vivo testing, while offering new details on the transient and time-resolved exposure effects of new and existing anthelmintics.",

        "abstract": "Background: We systematically reviewed availability and quality of data on the prevalence of use and dependence on meth/amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and opioids. Methods: Multiple search strategies: (a) peer-reviewed literature searches (1990-2008) using methods recommended by the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group; (b) systematic searches of online databases; (c) Internet searches to find other published evidence of drug use; (d) repeated consultation and feedback from experts around the globe; (e) a viral email sent to lists of researchers in the illicit drug and HIV fields. Data were extracted and graded according to predefined variables reflecting quality of data source. Results: Qualitative evidence of illicit drug use and dependence was found for most countries, which hold over 98% of the world's population aged 15-64 years. Countries where use was identified but prevalence estimates had not been made (evidence of drug supply, trafficking, reports of use, treatment data) were mainly from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Oceania. Estimates of the prevalence of use were located in 77 countries for meth/amphetamine, 95 for cannabis, 86 for cocaine and 89 for opioids. Dependence prevalence estimates existed in very few countries; 9 meth/amphetamine dependence estimates, 7 cannabis dependence estimates, 5 cocaine dependence estimates, and 25 opioid dependence estimates were located. Conclusions: Data on the extent of meth/amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and opioid use and dependence must be improved in quality and coverage. Dependence estimates are lacking even in high income countries that have required resources. Responses to illicit drug dependence require better estimates of its scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Subsequently, four pH-responsive polyion complex (PIC) micelles (denoted as SAD, CDAD, CAD and DMMAD) were prepared through the electrostatic interaction between pH-responsive negatively charged copolymers and positively charged doxorubicin for adjustable intracellular drug delivery. Due to the differences among the acid-sensitive side amide bonds, these micelles were proved to have gradient pH-sensitivity in the following order: SAD < CDAD < CAD < DMMAD. The in vitro drug release rate was consistent with the sensitivity order of the micelles. The intracellular DOX release behaviors and cytotoxicities of the PIC micelles could also be adjusted by the sensitivities of copolymers. All these different characters among the PIC micelles would be further applied for \u201con demand\u201d intracellular targeting chemotherapy in clinics.",

        "abstract": "In an NASA ground study, two forms of cognitive tests were evaluated in terms of their sensitivity to sleepiness induced by the drug promethazine (PMZ). Performance for the two test modes (Y(1) and Y(2)), PMZ concentration, and a self-reported sleepiness using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) were monitored for 12 h post dose. A problem arises when using KSS to establish an association between true sleepiness and performance because KSS scores are discrete and also because they tend to concentrate on certain values. Therefore, we define a latent sleepiness measure X as an unobserved continuous random variable describing a subject's actual state of sleepiness. Under the assumption that drug concentration affects X, which then affects Y(1), Y(2), and KSS, we use Bayesian methods to estimate joint equations that permit unbiased comparison of the performance measures' sensitivity to X. The equations incorporate subject random effects and include a negativity constraint on subject-specific slopes of performance with respect to sleepiness.",

Doxorubicin (DOX) was encapsulated in the nanoparticles to explore the release profile. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were incubated with HepG2 cells to study the in vitro anti-tumor effect. The results showed the sizes of both blank nanoparticles and drug-loaded nanoparticles in pH 7.4 were smaller than those of nanoparticles in pH 5.0, and the mean diameter of drug-loaded nanoparticles was much bigger than that of blank nanoparticles. The PEG-PH-PLLA nanoparticles were nontoxic to both NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HepG2 cells. The release profile showed that the release of DOX in pH 5.0 was much faster than that in pH 7.4. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that the anti-tumor effect of drug-loaded nanoparticles was preferable to free doxorubicin.

As a typical targeted drug, cetuximab is selected in the measurements assisted by the phase SPR biosensor with a sensitivity of 10-6 in terms of refractive index unit (RIU) and stability of 6 \u00d7 10-7 RIU in 80 min. The reaction kinetic constants of cetuximab binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are found as: kd (dissociation constant) = 1.75 \u00b1 0.29 \u00d7 10-3 S-1, kD (equilibrium dissociation constant) = 4.19 \u00b1 0.58 nM. The results of inhibition effect analysis show that cetuximab can block EGFR binding to its two ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EGFR-transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1). This effect has been tested in three cell lines of lung adenocarcinoma, colon cancer and breast cancer. Comparing to other conventional methods, we find that the phase SPR biosensor can determine the cell sensitivity to cetuximab in just 4 h. As a label-free, real-time, high sensitivity and stability biosensor, the phase SPR biosensor is a potential optical technique for targeted drug screening and analysis of cell resistance to drugs with comparative advantages.",

Recent studies have shown that HLA-B*1502 is strongly associated with CBZ-SJS/TEN in Chinese and Southeast Asian populations. Objective\u2002 To evaluate the usefulness of patch tests for patients with carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced SJS, TEN and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and the cross-reactivity in patch tests among the aromatic antiepileptic drugs. Methods\u2002 We measure the frequency of positive patch test reactions and cross-sensitivity to structure-related aromatic anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) for patients after SJS/TEN or DRESS episodes caused by CBZ. CBZ and other structure-related AEDs used for patch testing were prepared in 10% and 30% petrolatum. Secondary measures included the association of HLA-B*1502 genotype and frequency of possible side effects from the patch tests. Results\u2002 Positive patch test reactions to 30% CBZ in the CBZ-SJS/TEN were 62.5% (10/16), and 70% (7/10) in the CBZ-DRESS. None of the 10 healthy controls displayed a positive reaction to tested agents. Cross-sensitivity to other aromatic AEDs was observed in both the CBZ-SJS/TEN and the CBZ-DRESS. Only the HLA-B*1502 genotype was present and strongly associated with the CBZ-SJS/TEN, but not with the CBZ-DRESS. Conclusion\u2002 Drug patch testing is a safe and useful method for the identification of CBZ as the culprit drug of SJS/TEN as well as DRESS. Testing of chemically or pharmacologically related AEDs may provide information on cross-reactivity for these patients.",

Therefore, we investigated the effects of long-term altitude hiking on insulin sensitivity in this special population. Nine males recovering from drug addiction (ex-addicts) (age 28.7 ?? 1.3 years) and 17 control subjects (age 29 ?? 1.1 years) voluntarily participated in a 25-day hiking activity (altitude 2200-3800 M). On the 25th day of hiking, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin response, lean body mass, fat mass, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were measured in all subjects. After the altitude expedition, insulin levels during the OGTT in ex-addicts were similar to controls, suggesting that insulin sensitivity in this special population was normalized by long-term altitude activity. Along with improvements in insulin sensitivity, a significant reduction in WHR, but small increase in lean body mass, was observed. Twenty-five days of altitude activity significantly reverses hyperinsulinemia in the ex-addicts and this improvement appears to be partially associated with the reduction in central fatness. ?? 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Tirapazamine (TPZ) is an anticancer drug that targets topoisomerase II. TPZ is preferentially active under hypoxic conditions. The drug itself is not harmful to cells; rather, it is reduced to a toxic radical species by an NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. Under aerobic conditions, the toxic compound reacts with oxygen to revert back to TPZ and a much less toxic radical species. We have used yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model to better understand the mechanism of action of TPZ. Overexpression of NCP1, encoding the yeast ortholog of the human P450 oxidoreductase, results in greatly increased sensitivity to TPZ. Likewise, overexpression of TOP2 (encoding topoisomerase II) leads to hypersensitivity to TPZ, suggesting that topoisomerase II is also a target of TPZ in yeast. Thus, our data show that yeast mimics human cells in terms of TPZ sensitivity. We have performed robot-aided screens for altered sensitivity to TPZ using a collection of approximately 4600 haploid yeast deletion strains. We have identified 117 and 73 genes whose deletion results in increased or decreased resistance to TPZ, respectively. For example, cells lacking various DNA repair genes are hypersensitive to TPZ. In contrast, deletion of genes encoding some amino acid permeases results in cells that are resistant to TPZ. This suggests that permeases may be involved in intracellular uptake of TPZ. Our discoveries in yeast may lead to a better understanding of TPZ biology in humans.",

The present work investigated the impact of biofield treatment on different pathogenic species of fungi in relation to antifungal sensitivity pattern. Each fungal sample was divided into three parts: C, control; T1, treatment (revived); T2 treatment (lyophilized). Treatment groups received the biofield treatment, and control group was remained as untreated. Mini-API ID32C strip employed for evaluation of antifungal sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The results showed that sensitivity of Candida albicans in T1 cells was changed against itraconazole from intermediate (I) to resistance (R) on day 10. The Candida kefyr exhibited a change in susceptibility against itraconazole in T2 cell from S\u2192I, on day 10. Likewise, Candida krusei showed the alterations in sensitivity against two antifungal drugs: fluconazole from S\u2192I (T1 on day 10) and itraconazole S\u2192I (T1 and T2 on all assessment days). The Cryptococcus neoformans changed from S\u2192I in T1 cell on day 5 and 10, against itraconazole. Sensitivity of Candida tropicalis was also altered from I\u2192R against flucytosine (T1 and T2, on all assessment days). Similarly, Saccharomyces cerevisae altered from S\u2192I (T1) and S\u2192R (T2) on day 10. The MIC values of antifungal drugs were altered in the range of 2-8 folds, as compared to the control. Fungal identification data showed the significant changes in species similarity of few tested fungi as C. albicans changed from 91.9% to 98.5 and 99.9% in T1 and T2 cells, respectively on day 10. C. krusei was changed from 97.9% to 85.9% (T2 day 10), and C. tropicalis was altered from 88.7% to 99.6% (T1 day 5) and 99.0% (T2). These findings suggest that biofield treatment could be applied to alter the susceptibility pattern of antifungal drug therapy in future.",

Subsequently, biopsies were removed and the penetration depths of the particles were analysed using laser scanning microscopy. The obtained results demonstrate that the particles alone achieved a penetration depth of around 900 \u03bcm. Similar results were obtained for the successive application of particles and protease, whereas a release of the fluorescent dye was only observed in the upper 250 \u03bcm corresponding to the penetration depth of the protease. In the case of the simultaneous application, the particles were partly dissolved before application, leading to a reduced particle size and diminished penetration depth.

        "abstract": "Cell culture techniques play a key role in the development of new anticancer drugs by imposing additional constraints on those of receptor interaction alone, such as drug uptake and efflux, interaction with other cellular receptors, and cel- lular metabolism. Clonogenic assays, integrating multiple cell death pathways, are particularly useful in measurement of cell survival following exposure to cytotoxic drugs. On the other hand, microcultures, combined with colorimetric and other methods for measuring antiproliferative effects, have provided the basis for large-scale screening of cytotoxic and cytostatic drugs. The U.S. National Cancer Institute program has made it possible to use 60 or more cell lines to compare the growth inhibition profiles of potential new drugs with those of tens of thousands of previously tested compounds, providing information on mechanism of action as well as an- tiproliferative activity. However, such assays reflect cytoki- netic changes as much as cytotoxic effects, and more work is needed to develop culture methods suitable for modeling the survival characteristics of solid tumors measured with anti- cancer drugs in vivo. Some of the most promising new ap- proaches include the use of three-dimensional cell cultures to allow the measurement of rates of drug diffusion, as well as assessment of the effects of cell contact and tumor microen- vironment on drug sensitivity. In order for culture techniques to facilitate translation of the extensive molecular biology in- formation now available into realistic clinical cancer thera- pies, they must accurately model the processes that control growth in human cancer tissue.",

Data from twelve studies generated in the QT PRODACT project were used in this investigation.

The estimated root squared error of the model, which estimated the slope of the QT-RR relationships for each animal, for all dogs during the pre-dosing period was 5.45%. Using the QT-RR model, the sensitivity and specificity in each cutoff value that judges QT prolongation were estimated based on the experiment errors and measurement errors in the 12 studies. When the cutoff value was 5%, the sensitivity in 10% prolongation was 0.978 and the specificity in 0% was 0.996. In conclusion, it was judged that a 5% cutoff value for changes in heart rate corrected QT interval using the canine telemetry assay is practical, and the sensitivity and specificity of the telemetry assay are very high when using the analytical method presented here. Based upon this information, the canine telemetry assay using the individual subject heart rate correction model is recommended as a sensitive test system for the in vivo assessment of risk for QT interval prolongation.",

The investigation of the resistance mechanisms towards statins may suggest new approaches to improve therapy based on the use of statins. We investigated the susceptibility to lovastatin of S. cerevisiae strains deleted for PDR genes, responsible for exporting hydrophobic and amphiphilic drugs, such as lovastatin. Strains deleted for the genes tested, PDR1, PDR3, PDR5 and SNQ2, exhibited remarkably different phenotypes, with deletion of PDR5 causing the highest sensitivity to lovastatin.

The magnetic hydrogel nanospheres with thermo and pH-sensitivity were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared-spectrometer (FT-IR), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The magnetic hydrogel nanospheres exhibited uniform sphere structures and superparamagnetic property. Finally, the drug loading capacities and the releasing behavior of the magnetic hydrogel nanospheres were investigated with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) as an anticancer drug model. The resulting magnetic hydrogel nanospheres exhibited high encapsulation efficiency (95%) to DOX under an appropriate condition. In vitro release experiments revealed that release was faster at pH 5.3 (37\u00b0C) than at pH 7.4 (25\u00b0C) or pH 7.4 (37\u00b0C). The DOX-loaded magnetic hydrogel nanospheres also showed enhanced anticancer effect compared with the free drug in vitro.

        "abstract": "Arsenicals and antimonials are first line drugs for the treatment of trypanosomal and leishmanial diseases. To create the active form of the drug, Sb(V) must be reduced to Sb(III). Because arsenic and antimony are related metalloids, and arsenical resistant Leishmania strains are frequently cross-resistant to antimonials, we considered the possibility that Sb(V) is reduced by a leishmanial As(V) reductase. The sequence for the arsenate reductase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ScAcr2p, was used to clone the gene for a homologue, LmACR2, from Leishmania major. LmACR2 was able to complement the arsenate-sensitive phenotype of an arsC deletion strain of Escherichia coli or an ScACR2 deletion strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transfection of Leishmania infantum with LmACR2 augmented Pentostam sensitivity in intracellular amastigotes. LmACR2 was purified and shown to reduce both As(V) and Sb(V). This is the first report of an enzyme that confers Pentostam sensitivity in intracellular amastigotes of Leishmania. We propose that LmACR2 is responsible for reduction of the pentavalent antimony in Pentostam to the active trivalent form of the drug in Leishmania.",

Artesunate is a well-tolerated drug approved for malaria therapy which possesses antiviral activity. Objective: The artesunate sensitivity of HHV-6 was analyzed and compared to that of several other human herpesviruses. Study design: Cultured human cells were productively infected with strains of HHV-6 or other human herpesviruses to measure artesunate inhibition of viral protein synthesis (Western blot analysis) or viral genome replication (qPCR), and to determine IC50 values by immunofluorescence or plaque reduction assays. Results: Sensitivity of HHV-6 to artesunate was demonstrated with an IC50 of 3.80 ?? 1.06 ??M. This is in a range similar to IC50 values for HCMV and EBV. Artesunate treatment of HHV-6-infected cells significantly reduced viral early and late protein synthesis that occurred in the absence of drug-induced apoptosis or necrotic cytotoxicity. HHV-6A genome replication was markedly reduced by artesunate. Conclusions: Artesunate possesses anti-HHV-6 activity in vitro and may be useful for treatment of HHV-6 infections. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the analysis of spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was applied to the dynamic assessment of cardiac anticholinergic drug effect in healthy male volunteers. 2. The anticholinergic effects of single intravenous (i.v.) injections of atropine (10 microg kg(-1)), glycopyrrolate (5 microg kg(-1)) and scopolamine (5 microg kg(-1)), as well as a 2-h infusion of glycopyrrolate (5 microg kg(-1) h(-1)) were investigated. Baroreflex sensitivity, a validated measure of cardiac parasympathetic reflex regulation, was repeatedly measured from 5-min recordings of electrocardiogram (ECG) and continuous blood pressure by using the sequence technique, a method based on detection of spontaneous fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. 3. Single injections of atropine, glycopyrrolate and scopolamine decreased the mean BRS by 71 +/- 32, 68 +/- 23 and 27 +/- 45%, respectively, whereas the slow glycopyrrolate infusion gradually decreased BRS (up to 83 +/- 11% reduction) and increased both systolic (SAP) and diastolic arterial pressures (DAP) (on an average, by 9 mmHg). 4. During the withdrawal of the parasympathetic blockade (indicated by increasing BRS), the proportion of baroreflex sequences in the recordings increased transiently from 10 up to 20-25%, probably reflecting the restoration of the baroreflex integrity and the baroreflex-induced attempt to counteract the blood pressure increase. 5. The sequence method to study BRS seems to be feasible in the assessment of cardiac anticholinergic drug effects, and it also provides good time resolution for the dynamic measurements.",

However, there has been some uncertainty about the place of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. In particular, there have been doubts about whether any benefits of aspirin in people with no history of CVD outweigh the risks (e.g. the fact that long-term low-dose aspirin therapy almost doubles the likelihood of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.

Electronic cigarettes, also called \u201ce-cigarettes,\u201d are battery-operated devices that generally contain cartridges filled with nicotine, flavor and other chemicals. The electronic cigarette turns nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. These products are marketed and sold to young people and are readily available online and in shopping malls. They are also available in different flavors, such as chocolate and mint, which may appeal to young people. The FDA\u2019s Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of electronic cigarettes. In one sample, the FDA\u2019s analyses detected diethylene glycol, a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans, and in several other samples, the FDA analyses detected carcinogens, including nitrosamines. These products do not contain any health warnings comparable to FDA-approved nicotine replacement products or conventional cigarettes. Because these products have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, at this time the agency has no way of knowing, except for the limited testing it has performed, the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. Health care professionals and consumers may report serious adverse events (side effects) or product quality problems with the use of e-cigarettes to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program either online, by regular mail, fax or phone.",

        "abstract": "The pharmacological treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), the most common epileptic syndrome in adults, is still unsatisfactory, as one-third of the patients are or become refractory to antiepileptic agents. Refractoriness may depend upon drug-induced alterations, but the disease per se may also undergo a progressive evolution that affects the sensitivity to drugs. mTLE has been shown to be associated with a dysfunction of the inhibitory signaling mediated by GABAA receptors. In particular, the repetitive activation of GABAA receptors produces a use-dependent decrease (rundown) of the evoked currents (I GABA), which is markedly enhanced in the hippocampus and cortex of drug-resistant mTLE patients. This phenomenon has been also observed in the pilocarpine model, where the increased I GABA rundown is observed in the hippocampus at the time of the first spontaneous seizure, then extends to the cortex and remains constant in the chronic phase of the disease. Here, we examined the sensitivity of I GABA to pharmacological modulation. We focused on the antiepileptic agent levetiracetam (LEV) and on the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which were previously reported to attenuate mTLE-induced increased rundown in the chronic human tissue. In the pilocarpine model, BDNF displayed a paramount effect, decreasing rundown in the hippocampus at the time of the first seizure, as well as in the hippocampus and cortex in the chronic period. In contrast, LEV did not affect rundown in the hippocampus, but attenuated it in the cortex. Interestingly, this effect of LEV was also observed on the still unaltered rundown observed in the cortex at the time of the first spontaneous seizure. These data suggest that the sensitivity of GABAA receptors to pharmacological interventions undergoes changes during the natural history of mTLE, implicating that the site of seizure initiation and the timing of treatment may highly affect the therapeutic outcome.",

METHODS: The visco-elastic properties of blank organogels were measured by rheometer. The E2 organogel formulations were optimized using a central composite design. Also, the effect of gelator structure and composition of the gel formulations on release behavior (in vitro and in vivo) had been studied. RESULTS: The change of the gelator structure could affect significantly the stiffness of the implants. The release behavior of gel without N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) was controlled by gel corrosion only. While the drug release of the gel with NMP was controlled by both corrosion and diffusion. The high initial release problems of the organogels were improved by optimizing the formulations. The system consisting by N-Lauroyl L-lysine methyl ester (LLM) derivative in the oil indicated the lowest initial drug release, showed a much lower blood drug level and maintained a steady state for nearly 1 month. CONCLUSION: Organogels based on L-lysine methyl ester derivative were ideal carriers for long-term parenteral administration of E2.",

In order to assess the role of drug uptake and efflux in this phenomenon, we compared the expression of three copper transporters, intracellular platinum accumulation, DNA platination and cytotoxicity of cisplatin in two cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant tumor cell line pairs (ovarian A2780/A2780cis and cervical HeLa/HeLaCK cells). Gene expression of importer CTR1, and ATP7A and ATP7B efflux transporters (with and without cisplatin treatment) was investigated using quantitative real-time PCR and platinum concentrations were determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrometry. After incubation with cisplatin, DNA platination was significantly lower in the resistant variants compared to the respective sensitive cell lines, whereas no obvious difference in DNA repair was found. Accordingly, the resistant variants exhibited lower intracellular platinum concentrations than their respective parental cells (2.5- and 2.9-fold lower in A2780cis and HeLaCK cells, respectively). No differences in efflux were observed. Resistant cells expressed lower levels of CTR1 (1.5-1.8-fold) than their sensitive counterparts. Expression differences of ATP7A and ATP7B between resistant and sensitive cells were cell type-specific. The results highlight the relevance of CTR1 for cisplatin sensitivity as there is a clear relationship between lower CTR1 expression, intracellular concentration, DNA platination and cytotoxicity of cisplatin in both resistant cell lines. Our data provide the basis for a quantitative understanding of alterations in uptake and efflux processes leading to cisplatin resistance and might hence facilitate the development of ex vivo assays that can predict cisplatin sensitivity in tumor specimens of patients. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Paclitaxel has emerged as a front line treatment for aggressive malignancies of the breast, lung, and ovary. Successful therapy of cancer is frequently undermined by the development of paclitaxel resistance. There is a growing need to find other therapeutic targets to facilitate treatment of drug-resistant cancers. Using a proteomics approach, elevated levels of Prohibitin1 (PHB1) and GSTpi were found associated with paclitaxel resistance in discrete subcellular fractions of two drug-resistant sublines relative to their sensitive sublines. Immunofluorescence staining and fractionation studies revealed increased levels of PHB1 on the surface of resistant cell lines. Transiently silencing either PHB1 or GSTpi gene expression using siRNA in the paclitaxel-resistant cancer cell sublines partially sensitized these cells toward paclitaxel. Intriguingly, silencing PHB1 but not GSTpi resulted in activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in response to paclitaxel. Similarly, stably silencing either PHB1 or GSTpi significantly improved paclitaxel sensitivity in A549TR cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that PHB1 is a mediator of paclitaxel resistance and that this resistance may depend on the cellular localization of the protein. We suggest PHB1 as a potential target for therapeutic strategies for the treatment of drug-resistant tumors.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper was to evaluate the role of bcl-2 in the susceptibility of the MCF7 ADR human breast carcinoma line overexpressing the P-170 glycoprotein (P-170) to various drugs. The sensitivity to four multidrug resistance (MDR)-related drugs (doxorubicin (ADR), vincristine (VCR), vinblastine (VBL), actinomycin D (ACTD)) and three MDR-non-related drugs (cisplatin (DDP), bischloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)) was evaluated by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in three bcl-2-overexpressing clones obtained from the MCF7 ADR line. We found that the bcl-2-overexpressing clones show increased resistance to DDP and BCNU, while no difference to 5-FU were observed between the control cells and bcl-2 transfectants. Surprisingly, bcl-2-overexpressing clones displayed an increased sensitivity compared with the control cells to the MDR-related drugs ADR, VCR, VBL and ACTD. Focusing on DDP and ADR, we found that the increased resistance of the bcl-2 transfectants to DDP was correlated to their ability to prevent apoptosis, while the enhanced sensitivity to ADR was associated with an increased ADR accumulation and a decreased ADR efflux. Moreover, while bcl-2 overexpression does not induce changes in P-170 glycoprotein expression, it did induce a reduction of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and basal protein kinase C (PKC) activity, both of which have a crucial role in the regulation of the MDR phenotype. In conclusion, the effect of bcl-2 on antineoplastic sensitivity observed in this study underscores the idea that bcl-2 may have distinct biological effects depending on the anticancer drug used. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

        "abstract": "Sitamaquine (WR6026), an 8-aminoquinoline derivative, is a new antileishmanial oral drug. As a lipophilic weak base, it rapidly accumulates in acidic compartments, represented mainly by acidocalcisomes. In this work, we show that the antileishmanial action of sitamaquine is unrelated to its level of accumulation in these acidic vesicles. We have observed significant differences in sitamaquine sensitivity and accumulation between Leishmania species and strains, and interestingly, there is no correlation between them. However, there is a relationship between the levels of accumulation of sitamaquine and acidotropic probes, acidocalcisomes size, and polyphosphate levels. The Leishmania major AP3delta-null mutant line, in which acidocalcisomes are devoid of their usual polyphosphate and proton content, is unable to accumulate sitamaquine; however, both the parental strain and the AP3delta-null mutants showed similar sensitivities to sitamaquine. Our findings provide clear evidence that the antileishmanial action of sitamaquine is unrelated to its accumulation in acidocalcisomes.",

The transport of doxorubicin (DOX), colchicine (COL), leukotriene C4 and dinitrophenyl S-glutathione (DNP-SG) was analyzed in inside-out vesicles (IOVs) prepared from MEFs. We used immuno-titration of transport activity to determine the contribution of RLIP76, MRP1, and p-glycoprotein (Pgp) towards total transport activity. Loss of RLIP76 alleles resulted in significant sensitization to radiation, DOX, cisplatin, and vinorelbine (VRL). In IOVs prepared from MEFs, we observed a stepwise loss of transport activity. Loss of RLIP76 confers sensitivity to xenobiotics and radiation due to the loss of a common transport mechanism for glutathione-electrophile conjugates and xenobiotics. \u00a9 2008 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.",

Hypertension, obesity or diabetes mellitus are substrate for left atrial remodeling that initiate and sustained atrial fibrillation development. One of the pathophysiologic mechanisms in atrial fibrillation is the presence of a trigger. Gastroesophageal reflux could be only a trigger for this arrhythmia.

Particular emphasis is placed on the ability of stromal cells to confer - to tumour cells - resistance or sensitization to different classes of therapeutics, depending on the specific microenvironmental context. The mechanistic understanding of these microenvironmental interactions can influence the evaluation and selection of candidate agents for various cancers, in both the primary site as well as the metastatic setting. Progress in in vitro screening platforms as well as orthotopic and 'orthometastatic' xenograft mouse models has enabled comprehensive characterization of the impact of the tumour microenvironment on therapeutic efficacy.

It shares many features with depression. Sensitivity to carbon dioxide (CO2), a classic provocation agent in the proto-typical anxiety disorder, panic disorder, has not been tested in PTSD. Twenty rigorously ascertained drug-na\u00efve subjects with PTSD inhaled a single vital capacity inhalation of 35% CO2; before and after the inhalation they completed measures of PTSD and panic anxiety, and were rated for the presence of a panic attack. These results were retrospectively compared with those of 39 healthy volunteers and 17 patients with panic disorder previously studied by the same research group. PTSD symptoms were not exacerbated by CO2. Two out of twenty PTSD subjects panicked. PTSD subjects' responses were indistinguishable from those of healthy volunteers, and differed from those of subjects with panic disorder. The lack of sensitivity to carbon dioxide in PTSD subjects in the present study adds to the literature on the differences between PTSD and other anxiety disorders, and to that on the specificity of the CO2 challenge in panic disorder. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Twenty-four-hour Holter ECGs were analyzed in 66 normal subjects during placebo and moxifloxacin delivery (single oral dose). QT and RR time series were extracted. Three QTc computation methods were used: (1) Fridericia's formula, (2) Fridericia's formula with hysteresis reduction, and (3) a subject-specific approach with transfer function-based hysteresis reduction and three-parameter non-linear fitting of the QT-RR relation. QTc distributions after placebo and moxifloxacin delivery were compared in sliding time windows using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) served as a measure to quantify the ability of each method to detect moxifloxacin-induced QTc prolongation. Results: Moxifloxacin prolonged the QTc by 10.6 \u00b1 6.6 ms at peak effect. The AUC was significantly larger after hysteresis reduction (0.87 \u00b1 0.13 vs. 0.82 \u00b1 0.12, p < 0.01) at peak effect, indicating a better discriminating capability. Subject-specific correction further increased the AUC to 0.91 \u00b1 0.11 (p < 0.01 vs. Fridericia with hysteresis reduction). The performance of the subject-specific approach was the consequence of a substantially lower intra-subject QTc standard deviation (5.7 \u00b1 1.1 ms vs. 8.8 \u00b1 1.2 ms for Fridericia). Conclusion: The ROC curve provides a tool for quantitative comparison of QT heart rate correction methods in the context of detecting drug-induced QTc prolongation. Results support a broader use of subject-specific QT correction. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

However activity data often have variance heterogeneity and periods with zero activity, and thus is usually not normally distributed giving the possibility of false interpretation of the data. We attempt to address this issue by developing and comparing different analysis techniques. These include transforming the data (square root and ln) as well as determining the probability of activity. In order to comprehensively assess these analysis techniques they are applied to a variety of different activity data sets, which have varying pharmacological manipulation or diurnal cycle state. These analyses indicate that activity data can firstly be improved by a square root transform of the data, which reduces variance heterogeneity. A further improved step is to analyse the \"probability of moving\", which is the most sensitive methodology to detect a change in activity. Thus analysis of the powerful non-invasive physiological marker activity and locomotion can be easily and simply modified to improve accuracy and sensitivity in disease or drug detection. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

One use for the approach is the optimization of an experimental design enabling estimation of model parameters with improved accuracy. The primary objective of this study is to conduct a sensitivity analysis of selected target-mediated pharmacokinetic models, ascertain the effect of parameter variations on model predictions, and identify influential model parameters. One linear model (Model 1, control) and 2 target-mediated models (Models 2 and 3) were evaluated over a range of dose levels. Simulations were conducted with model parameters being perturbed at the higher and lower ends from literature mean values. Profiles of free plasma drug concentrations and their partial derivatives with respect to each parameter vs time were analyzed. Perturbations resulted in altered outputs, the extent of which reflected parameter influence. The model outputs were highly sensitive to perturbations of linear disposition parameters in all 3 models. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K(D)) was less influential in Model 2 but was influential in the terminal phase in Model 3, highlighting the role of K(D) in this region. An equation for Model 3 in support of the result for K(D) was derived. Changes in the initial receptor concentration [R(tot) (0)] paralleled the observed effects of initial plasma volume (V(c)) perturbations, with increased influence at higher values. Model 3 was also sensitive to the rates of receptor degradation and internalization. These results suggest that informed sampling may be essential to accurately estimate influential parameters of target-mediated models.",

During gestational days 17-20 dams received 0.0 or 2.0\u00a0g/kg ethanol. On postnatal day 13 pups were administered 0.0, 0.5 or 2.5\u00a0g/kg ethanol prior to assessment of locomotion. One third of the pups were evaluated at 5-10, 30-35 and 60-65\u00a0min after ethanol administration; another third was tested only during the last two post-administration periods; and the remaining third was tested only at 60-65\u00a0min. At 30-35\u00a0min blood ethanol levels were similar to those attained at 60-65\u00a0min. The main results of the study were: (a) The 2.5\u00a0g/kg ethanol dose induced biphasic motor effects: stimulation 5-10\u00a0min after drug administration and sedation after 30-35 or 60-65\u00a0min. (b) Infants exhibited acute tolerance to ethanol's sedative effects. (c) Although pups prenatally treated with ethanol exhibited heightened locomotor activity levels, acute sensitivity and tolerance were not affected by prenatal treatment. In summary, infants are sensitive to biphasic motor consequences of ethanol and readily exhibit acute tolerance to ethanol's sedative effects. In addition, moderate prenatal ethanol exposure was sufficient to induce hyper-reactivity in the offspring without affecting habituation. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Drug-induced ocular disorders",
        "abstract": "While beneficial therapeutically, almost all medications have untoward effects on various body tissues and functions, including the eye in which organ toxic reactions are readily detectable. Every part of the eye and all ocular functions could be affected adversely. In this review, we describe the most commonly recognized drug-induced ocular disorders, their specific clinical features, the medications that can cause the problem, the differential diagnosis and possible mechanisms of action, as well as guidelines for the management of the adverse reactions. The eyelids are most frequently involved in drug toxicity that commonly manifests as inflammation, hypersensitivity reaction or dermatitis. Drug-induced keratoconjunctival disorders present mainly as conjunctival hyperaemia (red eye), with or without superficial corneal involvement. Frequently, drug preservatives in topical ocular medications induce these adverse effects. Treatment of blepharospasm with Botox may lead to drooping of the eyelids and corneal exposure. Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome is a drug-induced reaction in patients treated with tamsulosin and who undergo cataract surgery. Certain sulfa-based drugs can cause swelling of the ciliary body and lead to the development of angle-closure glaucoma. In addition, adrenergic agents, certain beta(2)-adrenergic agonists and anticholinergic agents may induce pupillary dilation and precipitate angle-closure glaucoma in susceptible patients. Glucocorticoids administered systemically, topically or intravitreally are known to increase intraocular pressure, which can lead to the development of open-angle glaucoma in susceptible patients. This painless form of glaucoma has also been associated with the use of the anticancer agents docetaxel and paclitaxel. The toxic effects of systemic and topically applied drugs may manifest as cloudiness of the lens. Long-term use of glucocorticoids produces a characteristic posterior subcapsular cataract and, although the opacities may remain stationary or progress, they rarely regress upon drug withdrawal. Systemic administration of phenothiazines or busulfan induce cataractous changes in the anterior or posterior cortex, respectively. Many systemic drugs reach the retina through the vascular supply. Aminoquinolines induce a characteristic bull's eye maculopathy. Phenothiazines bind to melanin granules and can cause a severe phototoxic retinopathy. Typical tamoxifen retinopathy manifests as crystalline deposits in the inner retina. Some patients treated with retinoids have decreased night vision and abnormal dark-adaptation. Patients on long-term treatment with linezolid may develop an optic neuropathy (swollen or pale optic disc), symmetric painless decrease of visual acuity and colour vision, and bilateral visual field defects. A probable link exists between amiodarone and a bilateral optic neuropathy that is very similar to nonarteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION). The most common adverse effects of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (erectile dysfunction drugs) are changes in colour perception, blurry vision and increased light sensitivity; recently these drugs have been also implicated in the development of NAION. A bilateral, retrobulbar optic neuropathy that manifests as loss of visual acuity or colour vision and visual field defect is associated with the use of ethambutol. Many different kinds of medications can cause similar ocular adverse reactions. Conversely, a single medication may affect more than one ocular structure and cause multiple, clinically recognizable disorders. Clinicians should be mindful of drug-induced ocular disorders, whether or not listed in product package inserts, and, if in doubt, consult with an ophthalmologist.",

        "title": "Clinical Relevance of Drug-Drug Interactions",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Computerised drug interaction surveillance systems (CIS) may be helpful in detecting clinically significant drug interactions. Experience with CIS reveals that they often yield alerts with questionable clinical significance, fail to provide relevant information on risk factors for the adverse reaction of the interaction and fail to detect all significant drug interactions. These problems highlight the importance of transparency and selectivity in choosing the drug interactions to be included in CIS. In The Netherlands, the Working Group on Pharmacotherapy and Drug Information is responsible for maintenance of the CIS of the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy (KNMP). Methods: The Working Group developed an evidence-based procedure for structured assessment of drug-drug interactions and revised all drug interactions in the CIS accordingly. Results: For every drug interaction four core parameters were assessed: (i) evidence on the interaction; (ii) clinical relevance of the potential adverse reaction resulting from the interaction; (iii) risk factors identifying patient, medication or disease characteristics for which the interaction is of special importance; and (iv) the incidence of the adverse reaction. On the basis of this assessment the drug-drug interactions for inclusion in the CIS were selected. After revision of the drug combinations in the KNMP-CIS, the Working Group judged 22% of the combinations to be not interacting and another 12% to be interacting but not requiring action. On the basis of this assessment the subset of drug combinations for which interaction alerts are generated and the information on management of a drug interaction alert for users of the CIS were adapted. When an alert is generated by the CIS, the user of the system is supplied with comprehensive information on the four core parameters, the mechanism of the interaction and critical information for management of the interaction for the individual patient. Discussion: This structured procedure offers the possibility for transparent and reproducible assessment of the clinical relevance of drug interactions. Conclusion: A CIS selectively generating interaction alerts based on this assessment may help in realising the goal of good clinical practice and may offer a methodology to further increase drug safety. 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

The current study determines whether the formerly unsanctioned supervised smoking facility (SSF)-operated by the grassroot  organization, Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU) for the last few years-costs less than the costs incurred for health-care services\u00a0 as a direct consequence of not having such a program in Vancouver, Canada. The data pertaining to the attendance at the SSF was gathered in 2012-2013 by VANDU. By relying on this data, a mathematical model was employed to estimate the number of HCV infections prevented by the  former facility in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES). The DTES SSF's benefit-cost ratio was conservatively estimated at 12.1:1 due to its low operating cost. The study used 70% and 90% initial pipe-sharing rates for sensitivity analysis. At 80% sharing rate, the marginal HCV cases prevented were determined to be 55 cases. Moreover, at 80% sharing rate, the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio ranges from $1,705 to $97,203. The results from both the baseline and sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the establishment of the SSF by VANDU on average had annually saved CAD$1.8 million dollars in taxpayer's money. Funding SSFs in Vancouver is an efficient and effective use of financial resources in the public health domain; therefore, Vancouver Coastal Health should actively participate in their establishment in order to reduce HCV and other blood-borne infections such as HIV within the non-injecting drug users.",

        "abstract": "Background: Interindividual variability in responses to warfarin is attributed to dietary vitamin K, drug interactions, age, or genetic polymorphism in the cytochrome P4502C9 enzyme (CYP2C9) (allelic variants 2C9*2 and 2C9*3) linked with impaired metabolism of the potent enantiomere S-warfarin. Patients and Methods: We quantified the relative effects of age and of simultaneously determined CYP2C9 genotype, plasma warfarin and vitamin K concentrations, and concurrent medications on warfarin maintenance doses in 156 patients at optimized stable anticoagulation. Results: Allele frequencies for CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*3 were 0.84, 0.10, and 0.06. Warfarin doses were 6.5 ?? 3.2, 5.2 ?? 2.4, and 3.3 ?? 2.0 mg/d in the 3 genotype groups (P < .0001). Warfarin doses decreased with age as follows: 7.7 ?? 3.7 versus 4.9 ?? 2.9 mg/d at <50 years and >66 years (P < .001), mainly as a result of decreased plasma warfarin clearance (2.8 ?? 1.4 mL/min versus 1.9 ?? 0.8 mL/min; P < .001). Vitamin K (1.6 ?? 1.1 ng/mL)did not differ among the age or genotype groups. Patients ???66 years old with the CYP2C9*3 allele required only 2.2 ?? 1.2 mg/d compared with 7.9 ?? 3.7 mg/d in those ???65 years old bearing the CYP2Cg*1 allele (P < .001). On multiple regression, warfarin maintenance doses were independently associated with plasma warfarin (reflecting its metabolic clearance) (r\n                        2 = 0.26), age (possibly reflecting increased intrinsic sensitivity) (r\n                        2 = 0.12), and genotype (reflecting S-warfarin levels) (r\n                        2 = 0.10) but not with plasma vitamin K. Conclusions: At optimized steady state, individual sensitivity to warfarin is determined by CYP2C9 genotype and age with no effect of vitamin K. Prospective studies will determine the impact of these findings in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Moxifloxacin is the most widely used positive reference agent in clinical cardiac repolarization studies, but it has not been characterized in common marmosets which are uniquely suited to studies in early-stage development due to their small size and minimal test article requirements. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of the common marmoset to detect moxifloxacin-associated QT interval prolongation. Methods: Eight telemetered common marmosets were monitored for 24. h following oral administration of moxifloxacin by gavage at 0, 10, 30, and 100. mg/kg using a Latin square design. Concurrently, a pharmacokinetic evaluation in 8 non-telemetered animals was conducted. A rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval was derived using an individual probabilistic QT rate-correction. ????QTc (placebo-adjusted QTc change from the individual baseline) was calculated and the relationship between pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) was analyzed. Results: A slight, but not significant, increase in ????QTc was detected with 10mg/kg of moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin at 30 and 100mg/kg elicited dose-dependent increases in ????QTc of 14.0??3.6 and 35.0??6.2ms, respectively, with associated total moxifloxacin C\n                        max values of 6.5??0.5 and 16.5??1.6??g/mL, respectively. From the PK/PD relationship, the plasma concentration which would attain ????QTc of 5 to 10ms was estimated to be 1.67-3.73??g/mL. The results were consistent with typical clinical trial results (????QTc of 6.6-14.8ms at 2.5-3.5??g/mL). Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that the common marmoset is highly sensitive to moxifloxacin-associated changes in cardiac repolarization, assessed as ????QTc. As such, this species is suitable for precise and reliable detection of small, but significant, drug-associated increases in QTc interval. Thus, the common marmoset should be regarded as a validated animal model for the detection of QT risk in early-stage drug development and represents an important addition to the current in vivo armamentarium. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase [PI(3)K] pathway is frequently activated in human cancers and represents a rational target for therapeutic intervention. We have previously shown that enforced expression of Akt, which is a downstream effector of PI(3)K, could promote tumorigenesis and drug resistance in the Emu-myc mouse lymphoma model, and that these tumors were particularly sensitive to inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) with rapamycin when combined with conventional chemotherapy. We now show that reduced dosage of PTEN, a negative regulator of PI(3)K signaling, is sufficient to activate Akt, but has only a modest effect on lymphomagenesis in the same model. Nonetheless, loss of even one PTEN allele resulted in lymphomas that were resistant to conventional chemotherapy yet sensitive to rapamycin/chemotherapy combinations. These effects could be recapitulated by using RNA interference to suppress PTEN expression in lymphomas, which were previously established in the absence of PI(3)K lesions. Finally, the introduction of lesions that act downstream of mTOR (eIF4E) or disable apoptosis (Bcl-2 and loss of p53) into PTEN+/- lymphomas promoted resistance to rapamycin/chemotherapy combinations. Thus, whether activation of the PI(3)K pathway confers sensitivity or resistance to therapy depends on the therapy used as well as secondary genetic events. Understanding these genotype-response relationships in human tumors will be important for the effective use of rapamycin or other compounds targeting the PI(3)K pathway in the clinic.",

In February 2006, the supply process for all forms of home oxygen in England and Wales was changed, with the aim of giving patients more appropriate treatment through proper clinical assessment and correct ordering and monitoring of oxygen therapy.

Secondly, we want to contribute to recent debates on the \u2018movement to technique\u2019 in qualitative research.

        "abstract": "RATIONALE: Impulsivity has long been known as a risk factor for drug dependence, but the mechanisms underpinning this association are unclear. Impulsivity may confer hypersensitivity to drug reinforcement which establishes higher rates of instrumental drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviour, or may confer a propensity for automatic (non-intentional) control over drug-seeking/taking and thus intransigence to clinical intervention.\\n\\nMETHOD: The current study sought to distinguish these two accounts by measuring Barratt Impulsivity and craving to smoke in 100 smokers prior to their completion of an instrumental concurrent choice task for tobacco (to measure the rate of drug-seeking) and an ad libitum smoking test (to measure the rate of drug-taking-number of puffs consumed).\\n\\nRESULTS: The results showed that impulsivity was not associated with higher rates of drug-seeking/taking, but individual differences in smoking uptake and craving were. Rather, nonplanning impulsivity moderated (decreased) the relationship between craving and drug-taking, but not drug-seeking.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that whereas the uptake of drug use is mediated by hypervaluation of the drug as an instrumental goal, the orthogonal trait nonplanning impulsivity confers a propensity for automatic control over well-practiced drug-taking behaviour.",

As control, we employed caspase-3 negative and caspase-3-transfected MCF-7 cells. Whereas mock-transfected MCF-7 cells were resistant to epirubicin, etoposide and paclitaxel (taxol), the same drugs led to breakdown of nuclear DNA in caspase-3-transfected MCF-7 cells. MT1/ADR cells express low levels of wild type caspase-3 but show defective caspase activation and apoptosis upon drug exposure. These cells also display a less efficient activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition. Caspase-3-transfected MT1/ADR clones showed a 2.8-fold increase in the protein level and a 3.7-fold higher specific enzyme activity. Procaspase-3 overexpression was not toxic and did not affect background apoptosis. Interestingly, procaspase-3-transfected MT1/ADR cells were more sensitive to cytotoxic drugs as compared with vector-transfected controls and DNA fragmentation nearly reached the levels of the original drug sensitive MT1 cells. Thus, overexpression of caspase-3 enhances chemosensitivity especially in situations where activation of the mitochondrial apoptosome is disturbed.",

        "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are an important cause of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Many studies have recently considered this issue, but most of them focus only on potential interactions and are often related to the hospital setting. A spontaneous reporting database could be a valuable resource for detection of ADRs associated with DDIs; however, data in the literature are limited.\\n                To detect those patients treated with potentially interacting drugs and the cases where reported adverse reactions are a possible consequence of DDIs, using an Italian spontaneous reporting database.\\n                The data were obtained from a database containing all reports of suspected ADRs from five Italian regions (January 1990 to December 2007) that are the main contributors to the Italian spontaneous reporting system. All reports containing at least two drugs, reported as being suspected of causing the ADR or as concomitant medication, were selected and a list of drug pairs was drawn up. We performed a search to verify which drug pairs are considered a potential DDI, using the Internet version of the DRUGDEX(R) system. For each report containing a potential DDI, we verified whether the description of the adverse reaction corresponded to the interaction effect.\\n                The database contained 45 315 reports, of which 17 700 (39.1%) had at least two reported drugs. We identified 5345 (30.2%) reports with potential DDIs, and in 1159 (21.7%) of these reports a related ADR was reported. The percentage of reports with potential DDIs increased in relation to the number of concomitantly administered drugs, ranging from 9.8% for two drugs to 88.3% for eight or more drugs. The percentages of serious or fatal reports of ADRs associated with a DDI were significantly higher than other reports analysed. The mean age, percentage of male patients and the mean number of drugs were also significantly higher in reports with DDIs than in other reports. In 235 of 1159 reports (20.3%), both interacting drugs were recognized as suspect by the reporter. This percentage varies in relation to the drugs involved, ranging from 2% to about 65%. The most frequently reported interaction was digoxin and diuretics, but no fatal ADRs were reported with this combination. The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents was responsible for the greatest number of serious reactions and deaths.\\n                This study validates that spontaneous reporting, despite its limitations, can be an important resource for detecting ADRs associated with the concomitant use of interacting drugs. Moreover, our data confirm that DDIs could be a real problem in clinical practice, showing that more than one in five patients exposed to a potential DDI experienced a related ADR.",

We reported and characterized substantial heritable differences in sensitivity to PPI-disruptive effects of DA agonists in outbred Sprague Dawley (SDH) versus Long-Evans (LEH) rats. Other strains might yield large group separations and facilitate studies of the neural basis for these strain differences; inbred strains might also allow us to map genes associated with differential PPI sensitivity. Sensitivity to the PPI-disruptive effects of the DA agonist apomorphine (APO) and the NMDA antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) were compared across inbred and outbred strains. APO sensitivity was greatest in SDH and buffalo rats, but the effect in buffalo rats was complicated by significant APO-induced startle suppression. PPI APO sensitivity was least in ACI and LEH rats; F344s exhibited intermediate sensitivity and Lewis rats showed a nonlinear dose response (sensitivity at low but not higher doses). PPI APO insensitivity in ACI rats developed over time, with ACI pups exhibiting robust sensitivity. Substantial strain differences were observed in short-interval (10-30 ms) prepulse effects, and APO-induced increases in short-interval PPI occurred in SDH, LEH, and Lewis rats, but not in F344, ACI, or buffalo rats. Sensitivity to PPI-disruptive effects of PCP was generally greater in outbred than inbred rats. These findings identify strains suitable for comparisons of PPI neural circuitry and others for whom such comparisons would be complex and perhaps less informative. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Drugs for allergy are often taken in combination with other drugs, either to treat allergy or other conditions. In common with many pharmaceuticals, most such drugs are subject to metabolism by P450 enzymes and to transmembrane transport. This gives rise to considerable potential for drug-drug interactions, to which must be added consideration of drug-diet interactions. The potential for metabolism-based drug interactions is increasingly being taken into account during drug development, using a variety of in silico and in vitro approaches. Prediction of transporter-based interactions is not as advanced. The clinical importance of a drug interaction will depend upon a number of factors, and it is important to address concerns quantitatively, taking into account the therapeutic index of the compound.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) drug transporter MgMfs1 of the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola (Fuckel) J Schroeter is a potent multidrug transporter with high capacity to transport strobilurin fungicides in vitro. The data presented in this paper indicate that, in addition to the predominant cause of strobilurin resistance, cytochrome b G143A subsititution, MgMfs1 can play a role in sensitivity of field strains of this pathogen to trifloxystrobin. RESULTS: In a major part of field strains of M. graminicola (collected in the Netherlands in 2004) containing the cytochrome b G143A substitution, the basal level of expression of MgMfs1 was elevated as compared with sensitive strains lacking the G143A substitution. Induction of MgMfs1 expression in wild-type isolates upon treatment with trifloxystrobin at sublethal concentrations proceeded rapidly. Furthermore, in disease control experiments on wheat seedlings, disruption mutants of MgMfs1 displayed an increased sensitivity to trifloxystrobin. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the drug transporter MgMfs1 is a determinant of strobilurin sensitivity of field strains of M. graminicola.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Prediction of in vivo drug-drug interactions (DDIs) from in vitro and in vivo data, also named in vitro in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), is of interest to scientists involved in the discovery and development of drugs. To avoid detrimental DDIs in humans, new drug candidates should be evaluated for their possible interaction with other drugs as soon as possible, not only as an inhibitor or inducer (perpetrator) but also as a substrate (victim). DDI risk assessment is addressed along the drug development program through an iterative process as the features of the new compound entity are revealed. Both in vitro and preclinical/clinical outcomes are taken into account to better understand the behavior of the developed compound and to refine DDI predictions. During the last decades, several equations have been proposed in the literature to predict DDIs, from a quantitative point of view, showing a substantial improvement in the ability to predict metabolism-based in vivo DDIs. Mechanistic and dynamic approaches have been proposed to predict the magnitude of metabolic-based DDIs. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current equations and methods, the pros and cons of each method, the required input data for each of them, as well as the mechanisms (i.e., reversible inhibition, mechanism-based inhibition, induction) underlying metabolic-based DDIs. In particular, this review outlines how the methods (static and dynamic) can be used in a complementary manner during drug development. The discussion of the limitations and advantages associated with the various approaches, as well as regulatory requirements in that field, can give the reader a helpful overview of this growing area.",

        "abstract": "The faecal egg count reduction test (FECR) is the recommended technique to monitor anthelmintic drug efficacy in livestock. However, results are often inconclusive due to the low analytic sensitivity of the diagnostic technique or the conflict in results from FECR formulae. A novel experimental set-up was, therefore, used to compare the impact of analytic sensitivity and formulae on FECR results. Four McMaster techniques (analytic sensitivities 50, 33.3, 15 and 10) and a FLOTAC technique (analytic sensitivity\u2009~\u20091) were used on faecal samples of 30 calves with a FEC of less than 200 eggs per gram. True drug efficacies of 70%, 80% and 90% were experimentally mimicked by comparing FEC before and after dilution (3:10, 2:10 and 1:10, respectively). The FECR was summarized using group (FECR(1)) and individual (FECR(2)) based formulae. There was a significant increase in precision of FECR when the analytic sensitivity increased (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The precision also depended on the formula used, FECR(1) (p\u2009<\u20090.05) resulting in more precise FECR compared to FECR(2). The accuracy of the FECR differed marginally between the two formulae (p\u2009=\u20090.06), FECR(1) being more accurate. In conclusion, the present study describes a novel methodology to compare techniques for the precision and the accuracy of their FECR results. The results underscored that techniques with high analytic sensitivity will improve the interpretation of FECR in animal populations where baseline FEC are low. They also point out that the precision of individual-based formulae is affected by the analytic sensitivity.",

This mini-review briefly discusses its currently known functions in apoptosis and drug sensitivity. As an inhibitor of cell proliferation, p21(WAF1/Cip1) plays an important role in drug-induced tumor suppression. Nevertheless, a number of recent studies have shown that p21(WAF1/Cip1) can assume both pro- or anti-apoptotic functions in response to anti-tumor agents depending on cell type and cellular context. This dual role of p21(WAF1/Cip1) in cancer cells complicates using p21(WAF1/Cip1) status to predict response to anti-tumor agents. However, it is possible to develop p21(WAF1/Cip1)-targeted reagents or p21(WAF1/Cip1) gene transfer techniques to have a beneficial effect within a well-defined therapeutic context. Better understanding of the roles of p21(WAF1/Cip1) in tumors should enable a more rational approach to anti-tumor drug design and therapy.",

The present experiment further compared the reinforcing efficacy of nicotine-containing and de-nicotinized cigarettes by assessing the effects of alternative non-drug reinforcement on self-administration of both cigarette types. Eight human subjects responded on a progressive-ratio schedule in which the number of plunger pulls required for standardized cigarette puffs increased across sessions. Responding for the two types of cigarette was examined when each was available alone and when the concurrent opportunity to earn money was available. Consumption of nicotine-containing and de-nicotinized cigarettes was decreased by both increases in price and by the concurrent availability of money. The two cigarettes types did not differ in their sensitivity to price or alternative non-drug reinforcement. These results replicate our previous report of similar measures of reinforcing efficacy for the two cigarette types when each was presented alone, and extend our previous findings to a choice situation involving an alternative non-drug reinforcer. These data suggest the importance of further examination of non-pharmacological variables in the maintenance of drug taking and the sensitivity of drug taking to alternative non-drug sources of reinforcement. Factors potentially contributing to the maintenance of smoking the de-nicotinized cigarettes (i.e. conditioned reinforcement, primary reinforcement by respiratory stimulation, instructional control, demand characteristics) are also discussed.",

Although many types of drug information have been used to repurpose drugs, drug-drug interaction data, which imply possible physiological effects or targets of drugs, remain unexploited. In this work, similarity of drug interaction was employed to infer similarity of the physiological effects or targets for the drugs. We collected 10\u00a0835 drug-drug interactions concerning 1074 drugs, and for 700 of them, drug similarity scores based on drug interaction profiles were computed and rendered using a drug association network with 589 nodes (drugs) and 2375 edges (drug similarity scores). The 589 drugs were clustered into 98 groups with Markov Clustering Algorithm, most of which were significantly correlated with certain drug functions. This indicates that the network can be used to infer the physiological effects of drugs. Furthermore, we evaluated the ability of this drug association network to predict drug targets. The results show that the method is effective for 317 of 561 drugs that have known targets. Comparison of this method with the structure-based approach shows that they are complementary. In summary, this study demonstrates the feasibility of drug repurposing based on drug-drug interaction data.",

The first episode moved eastward and the second westward, and both caused heavy rainfall in Taiwan. The goal of Part I was to better understand the mechanism and controlling factors for the organization and propagation of the episodes. Here in Part II, the detailed roles played by synoptic conditions and terrain effects are further examined. Three sensitivity tests (at 2.5-km grid spacing) are designed to include only the effects of synoptic evolution (SNP), and those from land-sea distribution-diurnal variations on top of a mean background with/without topography (DIU/DNT). As the benchmark, the control (CTL) experiment captures the 6-day event successfully and is validated in Part I. In SNP, the two episodes are reproduced with overall similarity to CTL and the observation, and this confirms that the general location/time of rainfall are mainly controlled by synoptic forcing in this case, in contrast to typical warm-season conditions in the central United States. Even so, diurnal effects can still exert discernible impacts and modulate local convective development in many instances, particularly an afternoon enhancement over terrain, and the averaged diurnal cycle in CTL over southeastern China resembles those in DIU/DNT rather than that in SNP (with no land). The steep topography of Taiwan is especially important for its rainfall distribution, including the heavy rainfall on 16 June through processes as postulated by Xu et al.</p>",

        "abstract": "Advances in molecular biotechnology coupled with novel technologies such as combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening have led to the discovery of a large number of drugs with macromolecular properties. Macromolecular therapeutics encompasses a variety of approaches including recombinant proteins, genes, antisense, and small interfering RNAs, all of which have larger molecular dimensions than conventional drugs. These macromolecules have emerged as a powerful class of drugs for a wide range of therapeutic indications mainly on the basis of their site-specific activity and reduced side effects. However, these drugs present an enormous challenge for noninvasive delivery as they are poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized in the body. To surmount these obstacles, either the other aspects of the drug may be exploited or novel delivery systems may be developed. Cost-effectiveness suggests that developing an improved delivery system for an existing drug is a better alternative than modifying the chemical structure of the drug or discovering new drug entities. This chapter focuses on macromolecular drugs and their delivery systems including liposomes, polymers, peptides, and nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "DNA topoisomerases I and II (topo I and II) are nuclear enzymes involved in cellular replication and are targets for several anticancer drugs. We showed previously that E1A gene transfer enhanced the sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells to the topo IIalpha targeting agents etoposide and Adriamycin in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether this effect was specific for topo IIalpha, we investigated the effect of E1A gene transfer on cell sensitivity to agents that target topo I and IIbeta. Transfecting TC71 human Ewing's sarcoma cells with an adenoviral vector containing the E1A gene enhanced their sensitivity to the topo IIalpha targeting agents etoposide (16-fold) and Adriamycin (8-fold). By contrast, E1A gene transfer did not affect cellular sensitivity to either amsacrine or camptothecin. Western blot analysis indicated that topo IIalpha protein levels increased 3.1-fold after E1A gene transfer, but topo I and IIbeta protein levels did not change. A plasmid containing topo IIalpha gene promoter with luciferase reporter gene was constructed to determine the effects of E1A gene transfer on the activity of the topo IIalpha promoter. E1A increased the activity of the topo IIalpha gene promoter by 3.5-fold relative to that of cells transfected with Ad-beta-gal. These results suggest that elevated topo IIalpha protein levels and enhanced sensitivity to topo IIalpha targeting agents were secondary to a direct effect of E1A on the topo IIalpha promoter. Combining E1A gene therapy with topo IIalpha targeting anticancer drugs may therefore have therapeutic benefit by increasing tumor cell sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "High levels of variability in cancer-related cellular signalling networks and a lack of parameter identifiability in large-scale network models hamper translation of the results of modelling studies into the process of anti-cancer drug development. Recently global sensitivity analysis (GSA) has been recognised as a useful technique, capable of addressing the uncertainty of the model parameters and generating valid predictions on parametric sensitivities. Here we propose a novel implementation of model-based GSA specially designed to explore how multi-parametric network perturbations affect signal propagation through cancer-related networks. We use area-under-the-curve for time course of changes in phosphorylation of proteins as a characteristic for sensitivity analysis and rank network parameters with regard to their impact on the level of key cancer-related outputs, separating strong inhibitory from stimulatory effects. This allows interpretation of the results in terms which can incorporate the effects of potential anti-cancer drugs on targets and the associated biological markers of cancer. To illustrate the method we applied it to an ErbB signalling network model and explored the sensitivity profile of its key model readout, phosphorylated Akt, in the absence and presence of the ErbB2 inhibitor pertuzumab. The method successfully identified the parameters associated with elevation or suppression of Akt phosphorylation in the ErbB2/3 network. From analysis and comparison of the sensitivity profiles of pAkt in the absence and presence of targeted drugs we derived predictions of drug targets, cancer-related biomarkers and generated hypotheses for combinatorial therapy. Several key predictions have been confirmed in experiments using human ovarian carcinoma cell lines. We also compared GSA-derived predictions with the results of local sensitivity analysis and discuss the applicability of both methods. We propose that the developed GSA procedure can serve as a refining tool in combinatorial anti-cancer drug discovery. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Ectopic expression of mutant forms of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) lacking lipid (G129E) or lipid and protein (C124S) phosphatase activity decreased sensitivity of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which have wild-type PTEN, to doxorubicin and increased sensitivity to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin. Cells transfected with a mutant PTEN gene lacking both lipid and protein phosphatase activities were more resistant to doxorubicin than cells transfected with the PTEN mutant lacking lipid phosphatase activity indicating that the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN was also important in controlling the sensitivity to doxorubicin, while no difference was observed between the lipid (G129E) and lipid and protein (C124S) phosphatase PTEN mutants in terms of sensitivity to rapamycin. A synergistic inhibitory interaction was observed when doxorubicin was combined with rapamycin in the phosphatase-deficient PTEN-transfected cells. Interference with the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN was sufficient to activate Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling. These studies indicate that disruption of the normal activity of the PTEN phosphatase can have dramatic effects on the therapeutic sensitivity of breast cancer cells. Mutations in the key residues which control PTEN lipid and protein phosphatase may act as dominant-negative mutants to suppress endogenous PTEN and alter the sensitivity of breast cancer patients to chemo- and targeted therapies.",

A limitation is the ability to deliver drugs for testing. We report on a novel delivery system for treating Drosophila neurological mutants, direct injection into the circulatory system. Using this method, we show that injection of the antiepileptic drug valproate can ameliorate seizure-sensitive phenotypes in several mutant genotypes in the bang-sensitive (BS) paralytic mutant class, sda, eas, and para(bss1). This drug-injection method is superior to drug-feeding methods that we have employed previously, presumably because it bypasses potent detoxification systems present in the fly. In addition, we find that utilizing blood-brain barrier mutations in the background may further improve the injection results under certain circumstances. We propose that this method of drug delivery is especially effective when using Drosophila to model human pathologies, especially neurological syndromes.",

        "abstract": "The three dimensional (3D) cell culture in polymer-based micro system has become a useful tool for in vitro drug discovery. Among those polymers, polysulfone hollow fiber membrane (PSf HFM) is commonly used to create a microenvironment for cells. However, the target drug may adsorb on the polymeric surface, and this elicits negative impacts on cell exposure due to the reduced effective drug concentration in culture medium. In order to reduce the drug adsorption, PSf membrane were modified with hydrophilic Pluronic (PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO) copolymers, L121, P123 and F127 (PEO contents increase from 10%, 30% to 70%), by physical adsorption. As a result, the hydrophilicity of HFMs increased at an order of PSf < L121 < P123 < F127 HFMs, while the negative surface charge decreased at the order of PSf > F127 > P123 > L121 HFMs. The three modified membrane all showed significant resistance to adsorption of acid/neutral drugs. More importantly, the adsorption of base drugs were largely reduced to an average value of 11% on the L121 HFM. The improved resistance to drug adsorption could be attributed to the synergy of hydrophobic/neutrally charged PPO and hydrophilic PEO. The L121 HFM was further assessed by evaluating the drug hepatotoxicity in 3D culture of hepatocytes. The base drugs, clozapine and doxorubicin, showed more sensitive hepatotoxicity on hepatocytes in L121 HFM than in PSf HFM, while the acid drug, salicylic acid, showed the similar hepatotoxicity to hepatocytes in both HFMs. Our finding suggests that PSf HFM modified by PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO copolymers can efficiently resist the drug adsorption onto polymer membrane, and consequently improve the accuracy and sensitivity of in vitro hepatotoxic drug screening.",

We have previously demonstrated direct interaction between MRP1 and unmodified drugs using photoreactive drug analogues. In this study, we describe the use of [125I]iodoaryl azido-rhodamine123 (IAARh123) - a photoactive drug analogue of rhodamine 123, to study the effects of mild detergents and denaturing agents on MRP1-drug binding in membrane vesicles prepared from HeLa cells transfected with the MRP1 cDNA. Our results show that the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS and a nonionic detergent Brij35 inhibited the photolabeling of MRP1 with IAARh123. Sodium deoxycholate (SDC) and octyl-??-glucoside (OG), structurally similar to CHAPS and Brij35 and disrupting the lipid bilayer, showed a modest increase of MRP1 photolabeling with IAARh123. Proteolytic digestion of IAARh123 photolabeled MRP1 labeled in the presence or absence of various detergents (CHAPS, SDC, or OG) revealed identical photolabeled peptides. Consistent with the drug-binding results, non-toxic concentrations of CHAPS and Brij35 reversed vincristine and etoposide (VP16) toxicity in MRP1 expressing cells. Taken together, the results of this study show that MRP1-drug interaction can occur outside the lipid bilayer environment. However, this interaction is inhibited with certain mild detergents. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Antimalarial Drug Toxicity",
        "abstract": "Malaria, caused mostly by Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. Antimalarial drug toxicity is one side of the risk-benefit equation and is viewed differently depending upon whether the clinical indication for drug administration is malaria treatment or prophylaxis. Drug toxicity must be acceptable to patients and cause less harm than the disease itself. Research that leads to drug registration tends to omit two important groups who are particularly vulnerable to malaria - very young children and pregnant women. Prescribing in pregnancy is a particular problem for clinicians because the risk-benefit ratio is often very unclear. The number of antimalarial drugs in use is very small. Despite its decreasing efficacy against P. falciparum, chloroquine continues to be used widely because of its low cost and good tolerability. It remains the drug of first choice for treating P. vivax malaria. Pruritus is a common adverse effect in African patients. As prophylaxis, chloroquine is usually combined with proguanil. This combination has good overall tolerability but mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal upset are more common than with other prophylactic regimens. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is well tolerated as treatment and when used as intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant African women. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is no longer used as prophylaxis because it may cause toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens Johnson syndrome. Mefloquine remains a valuable drug for prophylaxis and treatment. Tolerability is acceptable to most patients and travellers despite the impression given by the lay press. Dose-related serious neuropsychiatric toxicity can occur; mefloquine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of epilepsy or psychiatric disease. Quinine is the mainstay for treating severe malaria in many countries. Cardiovascular or CNS toxicity is rare, but hypoglycaemia may be problematic and blood glucose levels should be monitored. Halofantrine is unsuitable for widespread use because of its potential for cardiotoxicity. There is renewed interest in two old drugs, primaquine and amodiaquine. Primaquine is being developed as prophylaxis, and amodiaquine, which was withdrawn from prophylactic use because of neutropenia and hepatitis, is a potentially good partner drug for artesunate against falciparum malaria. Atovaquone/proguanil is a new antimalarial combination with good efficacy and tolerability as prophylaxis and treatment. The most important class of drugs that could have a major impact on malaria control is the artemisinin derivatives. They have remarkable efficacy and an excellent safety record. They have no identifiable dose-related adverse effects in humans and only very rarely produce allergic reactions. Combining an artemisinin derivative with another efficacious antimalarial drug is increasingly being viewed as the optimal therapeutic strategy for malaria.",

The photocurrent amplification of LAPS was improved by developing the sensor structure and fabrication processes.

Characteristic test experiments and cellular metabolism experiments were carried out to determine the performance of microphysiometer. The result showed that sensitivity of microphysiometer is significantly enhanced to sense the fluctuation of cellular metabolism rapidly and sensitively in real-time detection of living cells under physiological condition.

We also examined the effect of BGP-15 on streptozotocin-induced changes in the vasorelaxation of the aorta in Sprague-Dawley rats.\\n\\nRESULTS: BGP-15 doses of 10 and 30\u2009mg/kg increased insulin sensitivity by 50% and 70%, respectively, in cholesterol-fed but not in normal rabbits. After 5 days of treatment with BGP-15, the glucose infusion rate was increased in a dose-dependent manner in genetically insulin-resistant GK rats. The most effective dose was 20\u2009mg/kg, which showed a 71% increase in insulin sensitivity compared to control group. Administration of BGP-15 protected against streptozotocin-induced changes in vasorelaxation, which was similar to the effect of rosiglitazone.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the insulin-sensitizing effect of BGP-15 is comparable to conventional insulin sensitizers. This might be of clinical utility in the treatment of T2DM.",

        "abstract": "Urinary retention is a condition in which impaired emptying of the bladder results in postvoidal residual urine. It is generally classified into 'acute' or 'chronic' urinary retention. Because of the complex mechanism of micturition, many drugs can interact with the micturition pathway, all via different modes of action. Although the incidence of urinary retention, in particular acute urinary retention, has been well studied in observational studies and randomized controlled trials, data on the incidence of drug-induced urinary retention are scarce. Data from observational studies suggest that up to 10% of episodes might be attributable to the use of concomitant medication. Urinary retention has been described with the use of drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g. antipsychotic drugs, antidepressant agents and anticholinergic respiratory agents), opioids and anaesthetics, \u03b1-adrenoceptor agonists, benzodiazepines, NSAIDs, detrusor relaxants and calcium channel antagonists. Elderly patients are at higher risk for developing drug-induced urinary retention, because of existing co-morbidities such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and the use of other concomitant medication that could reinforce the impairing effect on micturition. Drug-induced urinary retention is generally treated by urinary catheterization, especially if acute, in combination with discontinuation or a reduction in dose of the causal drug. Studies have been carried out examining the effects of preventive measures for anaesthesia-related urinary retention, both during and after surgery, particularly into the effect of using opioids in combination with non-opioid analgesic drugs on the incidence of postoperative urinary retention. Although combination therapy reduces the opioid-related adverse events, the effect on urinary retention yields contradictory results. This article reviews the literature on drug-induced urinary retention and focuses on its incidence, the different classes of drugs that have been associated with it, and options for its management and prevention. \u00a9 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

        "abstract": "Guanylate kinase is a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of guanosine 5???-triphosphate (GTP) and dGTP and is responsible for the phosphorylation of guanosine 5???-monophosphate (GMP) and dGMP to guanosine 5???-diphosphate (GDP) and dGDP, respectively. As with many nucleotide-metabolizing enzymes, guanylate kinase is involved in antimicrobial and antineoplastic drug activation. This is due to the structural similarities of such agents with nucleobases or nucleosides that are acted upon by endogenous enzymes. Despite the involvement of guanylate kinase in 6-thioguanine, mercaptopurine, and abasic guanosine analog (e.g., ganciclovir) activation, studies have only recently focused on the molecular basis of the structure to function relationship of a mammalian guanylate kinase. As a means to evaluate the details of amino acid side chain involvement in substrate interaction, we have constructed a conditional guanylate-kinase-deficient Escherichia coli strain that requires the presence of a functional, plasmid-borne guanylate kinase for growth under selective conditions. Positive genetic selection provides a rapid mechanism to identify not only functional guanylate kinase mutants but also those that result in drug resistance. This novel strain will be beneficial to assess the role of specific amino acids of guanylate kinase in structure, function, drug activation, and drug resistance. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Background: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a major public health concern, with death as the ultimate adverse drug outcome. Despite the relevance of this, the frequency of fatal ADRs (FADRs) is to a large extent unknown. Although spontaneous reporting data cannot give an exact estimate of the magnitude of drug-related mortality, it may highlight the importance and large dimensions of this public health problem. Objective: To describe the types and pattern of reported FADRs by analysing data from the national spontaneous reporting system in Italy. Methods: The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) runs a pharmacovigilance database where all the individual case safety reports (since January 2001) are stored. We selected and then analysed in detail all the case reports (to the end of December 2006) in which death was reported as the outcome. We included in the study only FADR case reports with a probable or possible causality assessment, according to the criteria established by the WHO. In line with the Italian reporting form, we divided FADR reports into two groups: (i) suspected ADRs that caused death; and (ii) suspected ADRs that contributed to death. Results: In the AIFA database 38 507 suspected ADR case reports were collected, of which 641 (1.66%) had a fatal outcome. We analysed 450 case reports (1.17% of total reports), 159 (35.33%) of them causing the patient's death and 291 (64.67%) contributing to death. The annual percentage of FADR reports followed a constant trend during the 6-year period. The majority of fatal reports (79%) were sent by hospital doctors. In total, 222 different drugs were suspected as causes of FADRs. 'Systemic anti-infective drugs' was the drug category associated with the highest percentage of FADRs (21.9%), followed by antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (18.8%), and then by nervous system drugs (14.8%). Other drug categories involved in the fatal case reports were antithrombotic agents, NSAIDs and contrast media. Conclusions: The drugs most frequently involved in FADRs were drugs of wide usage with a narrow therapeutic range or those that caused serious skin or systemic allergic reactions. Ceftriaxone, ticlopidine and nimesulide were associated with the highest number of fatal case reports; the related FADRs were already known and recognized for each of these drugs. We highlight some cases reflecting probable inappropriate drug use by Italian physicians. This suggests a need for continued clinical pharmacology training and that many FADRs might be preventable through better medical and prescribing practice. \u00a9 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

        "abstract": "A reciprocally permissive interaction occurs between cellular responses elicited by the pleiotropic cytokine tumor necrosis factor-?? (TNF) and ??2-adrenergic receptor activation, such that each may adapt in response to modifications in the other's effects. Changes in presynaptic adrenergic sensitivity as well as neuronal sensitivity to TNF have been implicated in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. The present study examines the influence of ??2-adrenergic receptor activation on levels of TNF in regions of the brain associated with adrenergic function and the expression of mood. Additionally, the role of TNF as a neuromodulator is demonstrated by in vivo microinfusion of rrTNF proximal to the hippocampus. Administration to rats of an ??2-adrenergic receptor agonist (clonidine) decreases levels of TNF in homogenates of rat locus coeruleus and hippocampus within 7.5 min. Chronic (14 days) administration of the antidepressant drugs desipramine or zimelidine transforms ??2-adrenergic receptor-dependent decreases in TNF levels to increases in levels of TNF in the locus coeruleus. This transformation to an increase in total levels of TNF also occurs, although transiently, in the hippocampus following acute (1 day) antidepressant drug administration. The effect of TNF on presynaptic ??2-adrenergic sensitivity was also investigated. Field stimulation of hippocampal slices from rats microinfused with rrTNF proximal to the hippocampus for 14 days demonstrates a decrease in fractional release of [3H]NE and an increase in ??2-adrenergic autoreceptor sensitivity. These data demonstrate a mutual dependence between ??2-adrenergic receptor activation and levels of TNF in the central nervous system that would culminate in an increase in neurotransmitter release following antidepressant drug administration.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inasmuch as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is difficult to diagnose, patients with suspected dementias are often given FDA approved medications, including donepezil, rivastigmine, memantine HCl, or a combination, prior to diagnosis, and some respond with improved cognition. The present study demonstrates how concentrations of a select group of serum protein biomarkers can provide the basis for sensitive and specific differential diagnosis of AD in drug treated patients. Optimization is addressed by taking into account whether the patients and controls have or do not have increased risk of AD die to the presence or absence of Apolipoprotein E4. METHODS: For differential diagnosis of AD, prospectively collected newly drawn blood serum samples were obtained from drug treated Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease patients from a first (39 drug treated DTAD, and 31 age matched normal controls) and second medical center (56 drug treated DTPD, 47 age-matched normal controls). Analytically validated quantitative 2D gel electrophoresis (%CV </= 20%; LOD >/= 0.5 ng/spot, 300 mug/ml of blood serum) was employed with patient and control sera for differential diagnosis of AD. Protein quantitation was subjected to statistical analysis by single variable Dot, Box and Whiskers and Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) plots for individual biomarker performance, and multivariate linear discriminant analysis for joint performance of groups of biomarkers. Protein spots were identified and characterized by LC MS/MS of in-gel trypsin digests, amino acid sequence spans of the identified peptides, and the protein spot molecular weights and isoelectric points. RESULTS: The single variable statistical profiles of 58 individual protein biomarker concentrations of the DTAD patient group differed from those of the normal and/or the disease control groups. Multivariate linear discriminant analysis of blood serum concentrations of the 58 proteins distinguished drug treated Alzheimer's disease (DTAD) patients from drug treated Parkinson's disease (DTPD) patients and age matched normal controls (collectively not-DTAD, DTAD Sensitivity 87.2%, Not-DTAD Specificity 87.2). Moreover, when the patients and controls were stratified into carriers or non-carriers of Alzheimer's high risk Apolipoprotein E 4 allele and/or the Apolipoprotein E4 protein, the DTAD, DTPD and control Apo E4 (+) profiles were more divergent from one another than the corresponding Apo E4 (-) profiles. Multivariate stepwise linear discriminant analysis selected 17 of the 58 biomarkers as optimal and complimentary for distinguishing Apo E4 (+) DTAD patients from Apo E4 (+) DTPD and Apo E4 (+) controls (collectively Apo E4 (+) not-DTAD, DTAD Sensitivity 100%, not-DTAD Specificity 100%) and 22 of the 58 biomarkers for distinguishing Apo E4 (-) DTAD patients from Apo E4 (-) DTPD and Apo E4 (-) controls (collectively Apo E4 (-) not-DTAD, DTAD Sensitivity 94.4%, not- DTAD Specificity 94.4%). Only 6 of the selected proteins were common to both the Apo E4 (+) and the Apo E4 (-) discriminant functions. Recombining of the results of Apo E4 (+) and Apo E4 (-) discriminations provided overall sensitivity for total DTAD of 97.4% and specificity for total not-DTAD of 95.7%. CONCLUSIONS: These results can form the basis of a blood test for differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease patients already under treatment (DTAD) by anti dementia drugs, including donepezil, rivastigmine, memantine HCl, or a combination thereof. Also, the profile differences and the rise in specificity and sensitivity obtained by handling the Apo E4 (+) and Apo E4 (-) groups separately supports the concept that they are different patient and control populations in terms of the \"normal\" physiology, the pathophysiology of disease, and the response to drug treatment. Taking that into account enables increased sensitivity and specificity of differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "As drug-resistant pathogens continue to emerge, combination therapy will increasingly be relied upon to treat infections and to help combat further development of multidrug resistance. At present a dichotomy exists between clinical practice, which favors therapeutically synergistic combinations, and the scientific model emerging from in vitro experimental work, which maintains that this interaction provides greater selective pressure toward resistance development than other interaction types. We sought to extend the current paradigm, based on work below or near minimum inhibitory concentration levels, to reflect drug concentrations more likely to be encountered during treatment. We performed a series of adaptive evolution experiments using Staphylococcus aureus. Interestingly, no relationship between drug interaction type and resistance evolution was found as resistance increased significantly beyond wild-type levels. All drug combinations, irrespective of interaction types, effectively limited resistance evolution compared with monotreatment. Cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity were found to be important factors in the extent of resistance evolution toward a combination. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that resistance to drug combinations was mediated largely by mutations in the same genes as single-drug-evolved lineages highlighting the importance of the component drugs in determining the rate of resistance evolution. Results of this work suggest that the mechanisms of resistance to constituent drugs should be the focus of future resistance evolution work.",

        "abstract": "Polyurethanes are a unique class of biomaterials that are widely used in medical devices. In spite of their easy synthesis and excellent biocompatibility, polyurethanes are less explored for controlled drug delivery due to their slow or lack of degradation. In this paper, we report the design and development of novel acid degradable poly(acetal urethane) (PAU) and corresponding triblock copolymer micelles for pH-triggered intracellular delivery of a model lipophilic anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX). PAU with Mn ranging from 4.3 to 12.3 kg/mol was conveniently prepared from polycondensation reaction of lysine diisocyanate (LDI) and a novel diacetal-containing diol, terephthalilidene-bis(trimethylolethane) (TPABTME) using dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) as a catalyst in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The thiol-ene click reaction of Allyl-PAU-Allyl with thiolated PEG (Mn = 5.0 kg/mol) afforded PEG-PAU-PEG triblock copolymers that readily formed micelles with average sizes of about 90-120 nm in water. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements revealed fast swelling and disruption of micelles under acidic pH. UV/vis spectroscopy corroborated that acetal degradation was accelerated at pH 4.0 and 5.0. The in vitro release studies showed that doxorubicin (DOX) was released in a controlled and pH-dependent manner, in which ca. 96%, 73%, and 30% of drug was released within 48 h at pH 4.0, 5.0, and 7.4, respectively. Notably, MTT assays displayed that DOX-loaded PEG-PAU-PEG micelles had a high in vitro antitumor activity in both RAW 264.7 and drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells. The confocal microscopy and flow cytometry experiments demonstrated that PEG-PAU-PEG micelles mediated efficient cytoplasmic delivery of DOX. Importantly, blank PEG-PAU-PEG micelles were shown to be nontoxic to RAW 264.7 and MCF-7/ADR cells even at a high concentration of 1.5 mg/mL. Hence, micelles based on poly(acetal urethane) have appeared as a new class of biocompatible and acid-degradable nanocarriers for efficient intracellular drug delivery.",

Areas covered in this review: To obtain clinically accurate models, we have developed the technique of surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI) to transplant histologically intact fragments of human cancer, including tumors taken directly from the patient, to the corresponding organ of immunodeficient rodents. SOI allows the growth and metastatic potential of the transplanted tumors to be expressed and reflects clinical cancer of all types. Effective drugs can be discovered and evaluated in the SOI models utilizing human tumor cell lines and patient tumors. Visualization of many aspects of cancer initiation and progression in vivo has been achieved with fluorescent proteins. Tumors and metastases in the SOI models that express fluorescent proteins can be visualized noninvasively in intact animals, greatly facilitating drug discovery. What the reader will gain: This review will provide information on the imageable mouse models of cancer that are clinically relevant, especially regarding metastasis and their use for drug discovery and evaluation. Take home message: SOI mouse models of cancer reproduce the features of clinical cancer.",

        "title": "Role of drug transporters and drug accumulation in the temporal acquisition of drug resistance",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anthracyclines and taxanes are commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer. However, tumor resistance to these drugs often develops, possibly due to overexpression of drug transporters. It remains unclear whether drug resistance in vitro occurs at clinically relevant doses of chemotherapy drugs and whether both the onset and magnitude of drug resistance can be temporally and causally correlated with the enhanced expression and activity of specific drug transporters. To address these issues, MCF-7 cells were selected for survival in increasing concentrations of doxorubicin (MCF-7DOX-2), epirubicin (MCF-7EPI), paclitaxel (MCF-7TAX-2), or docetaxel (MCF-7TXT). During selection cells were assessed for drug sensitivity, drug uptake, and the expression of various drug transporters. RESULTS: In all cases, resistance was only achieved when selection reached a specific threshold dose, which was well within the clinical range. A reduction in drug uptake was temporally correlated with the acquisition of drug resistance for all cell lines, but further increases in drug resistance at doses above threshold were unrelated to changes in cellular drug uptake. Elevated expression of one or more drug transporters was seen at or above the threshold dose, but the identity, number, and temporal pattern of drug transporter induction varied with the drug used as selection agent. The pan drug transporter inhibitor cyclosporin A was able to partially or completely restore drug accumulation in the drug-resistant cell lines, but had only partial to no effect on drug sensitivity. The inability of cyclosporin A to restore drug sensitivity suggests the presence of additional mechanisms of drug resistance. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that drug resistance is achieved in breast tumour cells only upon exposure to concentrations of drug at or above a specific selection dose. While changes in drug accumulation and the expression of drug transporters does occur at the threshold dose, the magnitude of resistance cannot be attributed solely to changes in drug accumulation or the activity of drug transporters. The identities of these additional drug-transporter-independent mechanisms are discussed, including their likely clinical relevance",

        "abstract": "In vitro antimalarial activity tests play a pivotal role in malaria drug research or for monitoring drug resistance in field isolates. We applied two isotopic tests, two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and the SYBR green I fluorescence-based assay, to test artesunate and chloroquine, the metabolic inhibitors atovaquone and pyrimethamine, our fast-acting choline analog T3/SAR97276, and doxycycline, which has a delayed death profile. Isotopic tests based on hypoxanthine and ethanolamine incorporation are the most reliable tests provided when they are applied after one full 48-h parasite cycle. The SYBR green assay, which measures the DNA content, usually requires 72 h of incubation to obtain reliable results. When delayed death is suspected, specific protocols are required with increasing incubation times up to 96 h. In contrast, both ELISA tests used (pLDH and HRP2) appear to be problematic, leading to disappointing and even erroneous results for molecules that do not share an artesunatelike profile. The reliability of these tests is linked to the mode of action of the drug, and the conditions required to get informative results are hard to predict. Our results suggest some minimal conditions to apply these tests that should give rise to a standard 50% inhibitory concentration, regardless of the mechanism of action of the compounds, and highlight that the most commonly used in vitro antimalarial activity tests do not have the same potential. Some of them might not detect the antimalarial potential of new classes of compounds with innovative modes of action, which subsequently could become promising new antimalarial drugs.",

        "abstract": "Individual variability in reward-based learning has been ascribed to quantitative variation in baseline levels of striatal dopamine. However, direct evidence for this pervasive hypothesis has hitherto been unavailable. We demonstrate that individual differences in reward-based reversal learning reflect variation in baseline striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, as measured with neurochemical positron emission tomography. Subjects with high baseline dopamine synthesis in the striatum showed relatively better reversal learning from unexpected rewards than from unexpected punishments, whereas subjects with low baseline dopamine synthesis in the striatum showed the reverse pattern. In addition, baseline dopamine synthesis predicted the direction of dopaminergic drug effects. The D(2) receptor agonist bromocriptine improved reward-based relative to punishment-based reversal learning in subjects with low baseline dopamine synthesis capacity, while impairing it in subjects with high baseline dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum. Finally, this pattern of drug effects was outcome-specific, and driven primarily by drug effects on punishment-, but not reward-based reversal learning. These data demonstrate that the effects of D(2) receptor stimulation on reversal learning in humans depend on task demands and baseline striatal dopamine synthesis capacity.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms by which anti-parasitic drugs alter the physiology and ultimately kill is an important area of investigation. Development of novel parasitic drugs, as well as the continued utilization of existing drugs in the face of resistant parasite populations, requires such knowledge. Here we show that the anti-coccidial drug monensin kills Toxoplasma gondii by inducing autophagy in the parasites, a novel mechanism of cell death in response to an antimicrobial drug. Monensin treatment results autophagy, as shown by translocation of ATG8 to autophagosomes, as well as causing marked morphological changes in the parasites' mitochondria. Use of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine blocks autophagy and mitochondrial alterations, and enhances parasite survival, in monensin-exposed parasites, although it does not block other monensin-induced effects on the parasites, such as late S-phase cell cycle arrest. Monensin does not induce autophagy in a parasite strain deficient in the mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme TgMSH-1 an enzyme that mediates monensin-induced late S-phase arrest. TgMSH-1 therefore either mediates cell cycle arrest and autophagy independently, or autophagy occurs downstream of cell cycle arrest in a manner analogous to apoptosis of cells arrested in G(2) of the cell cycle. Overall, our results point to autophagy as a potentially important mode of cell death of protozoan parasites in response to antimicrobial drugs and indicate that disruption of the autophagy pathway could result in drug resistance.",

        "abstract": "Chronic exposure to cocaine is associated with neuroadaptions in stress and reward circuits that may increase susceptibility to relapse. We examined whether there are alterations in stress response and craving in abstinent cocaine-dependent individuals compared with a demographically matched group of non-addicted socially drinking community controls. Forty treatment-engaged abstinent cocaine patients (17F/23M) and 40 controls (19F/21M) were exposed to a brief 5 min guided imagery of individually calibrated stressful situations, personal drug/alcohol-related situation and a neutral-relaxing situation, one imagery per session, presented in random order. Craving, anxiety, emotion rating scales, and physiological measures were assessed. Cocaine patients reported significantly higher and more persistent stress- and cue-induced drug/alcohol craving, negative emotions, and physiological responses compared with social drinkers. In cocaine patients, stress- and cue-induced drug craving was accompanied by increased anger, fear, sadness, heart rate, and SBP. Controls reported minimal stress-induced craving and only increases in anxiety and SBP during stress exposure. Cue-induced alcohol craving was accompanied only by an increase in relaxed state. Females reported increased stress-induced anxiety and sadness compared with males, while males were emotionally and physiologically more reactive in the cue condition. These findings are the first to document functional alterations in stress- and reward-related affect and physiology in recently abstinent cocaine patients that is marked by an enhanced sensitivity to stress- and drug-related cue exposure. These data suggest that recovery from chronic cocaine abuse could be hampered by a hyper-responsive stress- and drug-craving state that increases cocaine relapse susceptibility.",

We report here on the use of high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC) to examine the compatibility between an experimental drug (Drug A) and common pharmaceutical excipients. Short-term HSDSC experiments (up to 25h) indicated that Drug A was stable in the presence of moisture and was compatible with both lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate in the dry state, but showed degradation in the presence of magnesium stearate and water in combination. These results agreed with conventional stability studies, in which extensive degradation was observed in the Drug A-magnesium stearate system after storage at 40??C/75% RH for 4 weeks but not under other conditions. These results indicate that HSDSC may be used to examine the compatibility of experimental drugs with conventional excipients and, in particular, illustrate the importance of incorporating humidity as an experimental variable in order to fully establish the stability profile of the material under test. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "abstract": "In the present study we analysed the gene expression database provided by the National Cancer Institute in an attempt to correlate activity profiles of geldanamycin, 17AAG and 11 other analogues in 60 human tumor cell lines with their gene expression profiles determined by the cDNA microarray technique. On the basis of the activity profiles two classes of geldanamycin analogues could be distinguished, having geldanamycin and 17AAG, respectively, as prototype compounds (denominated as gelda-like and 17AAG-like classes). Application of the \"soft\" statistical methodology of PLS (partial least squares modelling in latent variables or projections to latent structures) allowed us to evaluate the influence of each gene expression target in determining the therapeutical responses. The transcript encoding the translocating chain-associated membrane protein (TRAM) showed a significant statistical correlation with activity profiles of 17AAG. In order to validate the role of TRAM in determining sensitivity to 17AAG we induced a selective knocking-down of this transcript by the RNA interference methodology in H226 non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line. The efficiency of double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (short-interfering RNAs, siRNAs) was determined by measuring TRAM mRNA levels by quantitative real-time RT-PCR at different times (24-72 hours) after siRNA lipotransfection. A significant increase in chemosensitivity to 17AAG was observed in siRNA-silenced cells. Although a number of factors may affect tumour sensitivity to 17AAG the present methodology allowed us to dissect out a single parameter which may be partly responsible for its activity.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Activating mutations in FLT3 are known to be a frequent transforming event in acute myeloid leukemia. Small molecule-inhibitor therapy targeting the FLT3 kinase is, therefore, an attractive strategy. FLT3 kinase inhibitors, such as PKC412, have already entered clinical trials. Even though results are encouraging, emergence of primary and secondary resistance does occur in the majority of patients. Thus, it will be crucial to carefully characterize the activity of every single compound against different activating and resistance FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations. Here we tested the efficacy of sunitinib and sorafenib to inhibit primary FLT3 activating mutations (ITD and D835Y) and of secondary resistance mutations. Methods: Ba/F3 cell lines stably expressing oncogenic FLT3 mutations were used to calculate cellular IC50 values for sunitinib and sorafenib using cell proliferation assays. Differential IC50 values for sorafenib toward FLT3-ITD and FLT3-D835Y were confirmed by Western blotting. Cell death was measured by propidium-iodide staining and flow cytometry. Results: Sorafenib inhibits FLT3-ITD more potent than FLT3-D835Y, while sunitinib is equally effective against both mutant forms of FLT3. Importantly, sensitivity toward sorafenib and sunitinib varies between the different secondary FLT3-ITD resistance mutations. Conclusions: These results establish sensitivity profiles for the FLT3 inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib. This may help to develop rational treatment strategies for acute myeloid leukemia with these compounds. \u00a9 2007 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.",

METHODS: The behavioral activation system (BAS) was used as a predictive marker of dysfunctional behavior during the Iowa gambling task (IGT). We also tried to relate this motivational system bias to self-reported metacognitive measures (self-knowledge, strategic planning, flexibility, and efficacy) in the decision processes. Thirty-four SUD participants (cocaine dependent) and 39 participants in the control group underwent the IGT. RESULTS: The SUD group was associated with a poorer performance on the IGT and a dysfunctional metacognition ability (unrealistic representation). An increase in the reward sensitivity (higher BAS, BAS reward responsiveness, and BAS reward) was observed in the SUD group compared with the control group and explained (through a regression analysis) the main behavioral deficits. More generally, an increase in the BAS reward responsiveness may be considered a predictive measure of risk-taking and dysfunctional behavior, not only in pathological (SUD) individuals, but also in subclinical individuals (controls).

Laponite (LP) is a synthetic silicate nanoparticle with a nanodisk structure (25 nm in diam. and 0.92 nm in thickness) and neg.-charged surface, which can be used for the encapsulation of doxorubicin (DOX, a cationic drug) through electrostatic interactions and exhibit good pH sensitivity in drug delivery. However, the colloidal instability of LP still limits its potential clin. applications. In this study, we demonstrate an elegant strategy to develop stable Laponite-based nanohybrids through the functionalization of its surface with an amphiphile PEG-PLA copolymer by a self-assembly process. The hydrophobic block of PEG-PLA acts as an anchor that binds to the surface of drug-loaded LP nanodisks, maintaining the core structure, whereas the hydrophilic PEG part serves as a protective stealth shell that improves the whole stability of the nanohybrids under physiol. conditions. The resulting nanocarriers can effectively load the DOX drug (the encapsulation efficiency is 85%), and display a pH-enhanced drug release behavior in a sustained way. In vitro biol. evaluation indicated that the DOX-loaded nanocarriers can be effectively internalized by CAL-72 cells (an osteosarcoma cell line), and exhibit a remarkable higher anticancer cytotoxicity than free DOX. The merits of Laponite/PEG-PLA nanohybrids, such as good cytocompatibility, excellent physiol. stability, sustained pH-responsive release properties, and improved anticancer activity, make them a promising platform for the delivery of other therapeutic agents beyond DOX.

We therefore reanalyzed original patient data from all four pivotal, randomized controlled studies (n = 1205) that compared amisulpride with haloperidol in patients with schizophrenia. The sensitivity of the BPRS vs the CGI-improvement and the CGI-severity scales in detecting between-drug differences was estimated by calculating effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals for both continuous (standardized mean differences) and dichotomous outcomes (odds ratios). The primary end points were the last observation carried forward results at study end points pooling all studies, but the results of the observed cases at different study weeks and the results of the single studies were also examined. The effect sizes derived from the BPRS and from the CGI were similar. When the single studies were pooled, all outcomes analyzed showed a statistically significant superiority of amisulpride compared to haloperidol as early as 2 weeks after initiation of treatment. The CGI may be as sensitive as the BPRS in detecting efficacy differences between antipsychotic drugs, although specific studies with truly independent ratings would be needed for confirmation. The fact that it takes only 1-2 min to fill in the CGI justifies its use in addition to more specific scales in drug trials for schizophrenia. Further development and evaluation of the CGI is warranted.",

        "title": "Correlation between Potassium Channel Expression and Sensitivity to Drug-induced Cell Death in Tumor Cell Lines",
        "abstract": "Plasma membrane (PM) and mitochondrial (mt) ion channels - particularly potassium channels - became oncological targets soon after the discovery that they are involved both in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis. Some members of the Kv Shaker family, namely Kv1.1, Kv1.3, Kv1.5 and Kv11.1 (Herg), and the intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium KCa3.1 (IK) channels have been shown to contribute to apoptosis in various cell lines. Kv1.3, Kv1.5 and IK are located in the plasma membrane but also in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where they participate in apoptotic signalling. Interestingly, an altered protein expression of some of the channels mentioned above has been reported in neoplastic cell lines/tissues, but a systematic quantification addressing the protein expression of the above potassium channels in tumor cell lines of different origin has not been carried out yet. In the present study we investigated whether expression of specific potassium channels, at the mRNA and protein level, can be correlated with cell sensitivity to various apoptotic stimuli, including chemotherapeutic drugs, in a panel of cancer cell lines. The results show correlation between the protein expression of the Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 channels and susceptibility to death upon treatment with staurosporine, C2-ceramide and cis- platin. Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between Kv channel expression and sensitivity to three distinct membrane-permeant Kv1.3 inhibitors, since these drugs have recently been shown to be able to induce apoptosis and also reduce tumor volume in an in vivo model. Higher protein expression of Kv1.3 significantly correlated with lower cell survival upon treatment with clofazimine, one of the Kv1.3 inhibitors. These results suggest that expression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 sensitizes tumour cells of various origins to cytotoxins. Data reported in this work regarding potassium channel protein expression in different cancer cell lines may be exploited for pharmacological manipulation aiming to affect proliferation/apoptosis of cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "Seasonal influenza virus infections cause annual epidemics and sporadic pandemics. These present a global health concern, resulting in substantial morbidity, mortality and economic burdens. Prevention and treatment of influenza illness is difficult due to the high mutation rate of the virus, the emergence of new virus strains and increasing antiviral resistance. Animal models of influenza infection are crucial to our gaining a better understanding of the pathogenesis of and host response to influenza infection, and for screening antiviral compounds. However, the current animal models used for influenza research are not amenable to visualization of host-pathogen interactions or high-throughput drug screening. The zebrafish is widely recognized as a valuable model system for infectious disease research and therapeutic drug testing. Here, we describe a zebrafish model for human influenza A virus (IAV) infection and show that zebrafish embryos are susceptible to challenge with both influenza A strains APR8 and X-31 (Aichi). Influenza-infected zebrafish show an increase in viral burden and mortality over time. The expression of innate antiviral genes, the gross pathology and the histopathology in infected zebrafish recapitulate clinical symptoms of influenza infections in humans. This is the first time that zebrafish embryos have been infected with a fluorescent IAV in order to visualize infection in a live vertebrate host, revealing a pattern of vascular endothelial infection. Treatment of infected zebrafish with a known anti-influenza compound, Zanamivir, reduced mortality and the expression of a fluorescent viral gene product, demonstrating the validity of this model to screen for potential antiviral drugs. The zebrafish model system has provided invaluable insights into host-pathogen interactions for a range of infectious diseases. Here, we demonstrate a novel use of this species for IAV research. This model has great potential to advance our understanding of influenza infection and the associated host innate immune response.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objective: While risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well documented adverse effect of some drugs, few studies have assessed the relationship between drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and AKI. Our objective was to develop an algorithm capable of detecting potential signals on this relationship by retrospectively mining data from electronic health records. Material and methods: Data were extracted from the clinical data warehouse (CDW) of the Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou (HEGP). AKI was defined as the first level of the RIFLE criteria, that is, an increase >50 % of creatinine basis. Algorithm accuracy was tested on 20 single drugs, 10 nephrotoxic and 10 non-nephrotoxic. We then tested 45 pairs of non-nephrotoxic drugs, among the most prescribed at our hospital and representing distinct pharmacological classes for DDIs. Results: Sensitivity and specificity were 50 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 23.66-76.34] and 90 % (95 % CI 59.58-98.21), respectively, for single drugs. Our algorithm confirmed a previously identified signal concerning clarithromycin and calcium-channel blockers (unadjusted odds ratio (ORu) 2.92; 95 % CI 1.11-7.69, p = 0.04). Among the 45 drug pairs investigated, we identified a signal concerning 55 patients in association with bromazepam and hydroxyzine (ORu 1.66; 95 % CI 1.23-2.23). This signal was not confirmed after a chart review. Even so, AKI and co-prescription were confirmed for 96 % (95 % CI 88-99) and 88 % (95 % CI 76-94) of these patients, respectively. Conclusion: Data mining techniques on CDW can foster the detection of adverse drug reactions when drugs are used alone or in combination.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundC reactive protein (CRP) is one of the acute phase proteins that increase during systemic inflammation. It's been suggested that testing CRP levels in the blood may be an additional way to assess cardiovascular disease risk. A more sensitive CRP test, called a highly sensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) assay, is available to determine heart disease risk. However, and the association between CRP and stent thrombosis after drug-eluting stent implantation has not been defined. ObjectiveTo investigate in a follow-up study whether high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) predicts coronary heart disease (CHD) events and stent thrombosis in subjects undergone drug-eluting stent implantation. Methods and resultsWe evaluated 3691 patients treated with drug-eluting stents who had a baseline CRP measurement. The primary outcome was stent thrombosis; secondary outcomes were death, myocardial infarction (MI), death or MI, and target vessel revascularisation. During follow-up (median 2 years), 26 patients had definite or probable stent thrombosis, 146 patients died, 239 had an MI and 206 underwent target vessel revascularisation. In multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models, elevated levels of hs-CRP were significantly associated with increased risk of stent thrombosis. Elevated hs-CRP levels also significantly predicted the risks of death, MI, and death or MI, but not target vessel revascularisation. ConclusionsElevated hs-CRP levels were significantly associated with increased risks of stent thrombosis, death and MI in patients receiving drug-eluting stents, suggesting the usefulness of inflammatory risk assessment with CRP.",

For this reason, it has been used as a powerful animal model to analyze in vivo ototoxicity. In this work, we examined the dose-dependent effects of two potent ototoxic aminoglycosides, neomycin and gentamicin, on the hair cells of two selected neuromasts (L1 and T1, the first of the trunk and the terminal located in the fin, respectively) of the lateral line in the ET4 transgenic zebrafish line. The hair cells of this strain selectively and constitutively display fluorescence. The fish were treated for 24. h at different doses (1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 100. ??M levels) of both aminoglycosides. Immediately after treatment the morphology and the number of cells in L1 and T were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope. The results show that neomycin and gentamicin have different effects on the hair cell death at the same concentration, showing also different toxicity in L1 and T1 neuromasts. The toxicity observed in the hair cells of T1 neuromast was less than in L1 especially for the gentamicin treatment. These results demonstrate different sensitivity of hair cells of the lateral line to ototoxic drugs according to topographical localization and suggest the in vivo assay of the L1 neuromast of zebrafish larva and low doses of neomycin as an ideal model to study ototoxicity induced by aminoglycosides. ?? 2014 Elsevier GmbH.",

We evaluated relations between AS and substance use situations among individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) and concurrent DSM-IV anxiety disorders. We predicted that AS would be most strongly associated with substance use in situations involving negative emotions and interpersonal conflict in substance abusers with anxiety disorders. This group was compared to substance abusers with concurrent mood disorders and substance abusers without other disorders (N = 88). AS was positively related to negative emotion situations substance use for substance abusers with anxiety disorders and for substance abusers without other disorders. Contrary to predictions, significant differences between these groups were not found. The relationship between AS and negative emotion situations substance use remained after controlling trait anxiety in a combined group (anxiety disorders and substance abuse only groups). AS did not predict substance use for participants with concurrent mood disorders. Identification of factors that place anxious patients at risk for substance use problems will have implications for treatment and for the prevention of this form of maladaptive coping. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

        "abstract": "We tested the ability of Fourier Transform (FT) InfraRed (IR) microspectroscopy (microFTIR) in combination with unsupervised Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) in identifying drug-resistance/sensitivity in leukemic cells exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Experiments were carried out in a well-established mouse model of human Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML). Mouse-derived pro-B Ba/F3 cells transfected with and stably expressing the human p210(BCR-ABL) drug-sensitive wild-type BCR-ABL or the V299L or T315I p210(BCR-ABL) drug-resistant BCR-ABL mutants were exposed to imatinib-mesylate (IMA) or dasatinib (DAS). MicroFTIR was carried out at the Diamond IR beamline MIRIAM where the mid-IR absorbance spectra of individual Ba/F3 cells were acquired using the high brilliance IR synchrotron radiation (SR) via aperture of 15 \u00d7 15 \u03bcm(2) in sizes. A conventional IR source (globar) was used to compare average spectra over 15 cells or more. IR signatures of drug actions were identified by supervised analyses in the spectra of TKI-sensitive cells. Unsupervised HCA applied to selected intervals of wavenumber allowed us to classify the IR patterns of viable (drug-resistant) and apoptotic (drug-sensitive) cells with an accuracy of >95%. The results from microFTIR + HCA analysis were cross-validated with those obtained via immunochemical methods, i.e. immunoblotting and flow cytometry (FC) that resulted directly and significantly correlated. We conclude that this combined microFTIR + HCA method potentially represents a rapid, convenient and robust screening approach to study the impact of drugs in leukemic cells as well as in peripheral blasts from patients in clinical trials with new anti-leukemic drugs.",

        "abstract": "Activating mutations and/or overexpression of FGFR3 are common in bladder cancer, making FGFR3 an attractive therapeutic target in this disease. In addition, FGFR3 gene rearrangements have recently been described that define a unique subset of bladder tumors. Here, a selective HSP90 inhibitor, ganetespib, induced loss of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein expression and depletion of multiple oncogenic signaling proteins in RT112 bladder cells, resulting in potent cytotoxicity comparable with the pan-FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor BGJ398. However, in contrast to BGJ398, ganetespib exerted pleiotropic effects on additional mitogenic and survival pathways and could overcome the FGFR inhibitor-resistant phenotype of FGFR3 mutant-expressing 97-7 and MHG-U3 cells. Combinatorial benefit was observed when ganetespib was used with BGJ398 both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, two additional FGFR3 fusion-positive lines (RT4 and SW480) retained sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitor treatment by the ansamycins 17-AAG and 17-DMAG yet displayed intrinsic resistance to ganetespib or AUY922, both second-generation resorcinol-based compounds. Both cell lines, compared with RT112, expressed considerably higher levels of endogenous UGT1A enzyme; this phenotype resulted in a rapid glucuronidation-dependent metabolism and subsequent efflux of ganetespib from SW780 cells, thus providing a mechanism to account for the lack of bioactivity.\\n\\nIMPLICATIONS: Pharmacologic blockade of the molecular chaperone HSP90 represents a promising approach for treating bladder tumors driven by oncogenic gene rearrangements of FGFR3. Furthermore, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme expression may serve as a predictive factor for clinical response to resorcinol-based HSP90 inhibitors. Mol Cancer Res; 12(7); 1-13. \u00a92014 AACR.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the hypoxia-dependent cytotoxicity of AQ4N (banoxantrone) using a panel of 13 cancer cell lines and studied its relationship to the expression of the quinone reductase DT-diaphorase (NQO1), which is widely found in cancer cells. We also investigated pharmacologic treatments that increase tumor hypoxia in vivo and their impact on AQ4N chemosensitivity in a solid tumor xenograft model. AQ4N showed >/=8-fold higher cytotoxicity under hypoxia than normoxia in cultures of 9L rat gliosarcoma and H460 human non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells but not for 11 other human cancer cell lines. DT-diaphorase protein levels and AQ4N chemosensitivity were poorly correlated across the cancer cell line panel, and AQ4N chemosensitivity was not affected by DT-diaphorase inhibitors. The vasodilator hydralazine decreased tumor perfusion and increased tumor hypoxia in 9L tumor xenografts, and to a lesser extent in H460 tumor xenografts. However, hydralazine did not increase AQ4N-dependent antitumor activity. Combination of AQ4N with the angiogenesis inhibitor axitinib, which increases 9L tumor hypoxia, transiently increased antitumor activity but with an increase in host toxicity. These findings indicate that the capacity to bioactivate AQ4N is not dependent on DT-diaphorase and is not widespread in cultured cancer cell lines. Moreover, the activation of AQ4N cytotoxicity in vivo requires tumor hypoxia that is more extensive or prolonged than can readily be achieved by vasodilation or by antiangiogenic drug treatment.",

Using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the novelty-induced grooming test (NGT), we assessed the responses of DRD3-deficient (D(3)(-/-)) mice to the acute treatment (different testing time) with the anxiolytic drug, diazepam. D(3)(-/-) mice treated with diazepam (0.1 or 0.5mg/kg) exhibited a better behavioral response in the EPM than their wild type (WT). Furthermore, in D(3)(-/-) mice, but not in WT, 1mg/kg diazepam induced anxiolytic effects at all testing times. The contribution of DRsD3 in the anxiolytic effects of diazepam was confirmed by similar results obtained in EPM by using the selective DRD3 antagonist U99194A (10mg/kg) in combination with diazepam, in WT animals. D(3)(-/-) mice treated with diazepam (all doses), also showed a decrease in grooming behavior. However, the [(3)H]flunitrazepam autoradiographic analysis revealed no significant changes in D(3)(-/-) mice compared to WT, suggesting that if \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor GABA(A) changes are involved, they do not occur at the level of binding to benzodiazepine site. These data suggest that D(3)(-/-) mice exhibit low baseline anxiety levels and provide the evidence that the DRD3 is involved in the modulation of benzodiazepine anxiolytic effects.",

        "abstract": "FADD has been shown to be phosphorylated at Ser194 at the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. Here we have investigated the contribution of this phosphorylation to apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs in two human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and DU145. Both were arrested at G2/M and FADD was found to be phosphorylated at Ser194 on treatment with paclitaxel. Inhibition of paclitaxel-induced c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation by treatment with a specific inhibitor, SP600125, or overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant form of upstream kinases, MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) 7, significantly reduced the increase in phosphorylated FADD. It is noteworthy that pretreatment with paclitaxel significantly up-regulated MEKK1 expression, resulting in enhancement of etoposide- or cisplatin-induced MEKK1/MKK7-dependent JNK activation and apoptosis in LNCaP and DU145 cells. Interestingly, MEKK1 up-regulation and the synergistic effects of paclitaxel on anticancer drug-induced apoptosis were abolished by overexpression of mutant FADD (Ser194-->Ala). The results clearly show that FADD phosphorylation at Ser194 affects functions both upstream and downstream of the MEKK1/MKK7/JNK1 pathway and is closely associated with chemosensitivity in prostate cancer cells. This is the first report indicating that phosphorylated FADD plays an essential role in the mechanisms of amplifications of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.",

Result: Our approach of virtual screening Drug-likeness, adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity analysis of around 50\u2009000 compounds from Inter Bio Screen (IBS) Database have given us top 5 Lead compounds against ASN289 of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor, a common target of known anesthetic compounds. Out of the top 5 Lead compounds one (Lead 5) was selected for further MDS analysis based on its Binding free energy and number of physical interactions with GABAA. Conclusion: The MDS analysis of Lead 5 reveals the complex to be stable and thus suitable for further in vitro and in vivo analysis.",

        "abstract": "The mechanism by which CYP2B6*6 allele alters drug metabolism in vitro and in vivo is not fully understood. To test the hypothesis that altered substrate binding and/or catalytic properties contribute to its functional consequences, efavirenz 8-hydroxylation and bupropion 4-hydroxylation were determined in CYP2B6.1 and CYP2B6.6 proteins expressed without and with cytochrome b5 (Cyt b5) and in human liver microsomes (HLMs) obtained from liver tissues genotyped for the CYP2B6*6 allele. The susceptibility of the variant protein to inhibition was also tested in HLMs. Significantly higher V(max) and K(m) values for 8-hydroxyefavirenz formation and \u223c2-fold lower intrinsic clearance (Cl(int)) were noted in expressed CYP2B6.6 protein (-b5) compared with that of CYP2B6.1 protein (-b5); this effect was abolished by Cyt b5. The V(max) and Cl(int) values for 4-hydroxybupropion formation were significantly higher in CYP2B6.6 than in CYP2B6.1 protein, with no difference in K(m), whereas coexpression with Cyt b5 reversed the genetic effect on these kinetic parameters. In HLMs, CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype was associated with markedly lower V(max) (and moderate increase in K(m)) and thus lower Cl(int) values for efavirenz and bupropion metabolism, but no difference in catalytic properties was noted between CYP2B6*1/*1 and CYP2B6*1/*6 genotypes. Inhibition of efavirenz 8-hydroxylation by voriconazole was significantly greater in HLMs with the CYP2B6*6 allele (K(i) = 1.6 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcM) than HLMs with CYP2B6*1/*1 genotype (K(i) = 3.0 \u00b1 1.1 \u03bcM). In conclusion, our data suggest the CYP2B6*6 allele influences metabolic activity by altering substrate binding and catalytic activity in a substrate- and Cyt b5-dependent manner. It may also confer susceptibility to inhibition.",

        "abstract": "In 2013, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) drastically lowered the minimum required performance levels (MRPLs) of most doping substances, demanding a substantial increase in sensitivity of the existing methods. For a number of compounds, conventional electron impact ionization gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS/MS) is often no longer sufficient to reach these MRPLs and new strategies are required. In this study, the capabilities of positive ion chemical ionization (PICI) GC-MS/MS are investigated for a wide range of drug related compounds of various classes by injection of silylated reference standards. Ammonia as PICI reagent gas had superior characteristics for GC-MS/MS purposes than methane. Compared to GC-EI-MS/MS, PICI (with ammonia as reagent gas) provided more selective ion transitions and consequently, increased sensitivity by an average factor of 50. The maximum increase (by factor of 500-1000) was observed in the analysis of stimulants, namely chlorprenaline, furfenorex and phentermine. In total, improved sensitivity was obtained for 113 out of 120 compounds. A new GC-PICI-MS/MS method has been developed and evaluated for the detection of a wide variety of exogenous doping substances and the quantification of endogenous steroids in urine in compliance with the required MRPLs established by WADA in 2013. The method consists of a hydrolysis and extraction step, followed by derivatization and subsequent 1??L pulsed splitless injection on GC-PICI-MS/MS (16min run). The increased sensitivity allows the set up of a balanced screening method that meets the requirements for both quantitative and qualitative compounds: sufficient capacity and resolution in combination with high sensitivity and short analysis time. This resulted in calibration curves with a wide linear range (e.g., 48-9600ng/mL for androsterone and etiochanolone; all r20.99) without compromising the requirements for the qualitative compounds.",

        "title": "Paradoxical and bidirectional drug effects",
        "abstract": "A paradoxical drug reaction constitutes an outcome that is opposite from the outcome that would be expected from the drug's known actions. There are three types: 1. A paradoxical response in a condition for which the drug is being explicitly prescribed. 2. Paradoxical precipitation of a condition for which the drug is indicated, when the drug is being used for an alternative indication. 3. Effects that are paradoxical in relation to an aspect of the pharmacology of the drug but unrelated to the usual indication. In bidirectional drug reactions, a drug may produce opposite effects, either in the same or different individuals, the effects usually being different from the expected beneficial effect. Paradoxical and bidirectional drug effects can sometimes be harnessed for benefit; some may be adverse. Such reactions arise in a wide variety of drug classes. Some are common; others are reported in single case reports. Paradoxical effects are often adverse, since they are opposite the direction of the expected effect. They may complicate the assessment of adverse drug reactions, pharmacovigilance, and clinical management. Bidirectional effects may be clinically useful or adverse. From a clinical toxicological perspective, altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics in overdose may exacerbate paradoxical and bidirectional effects. Certain antidotes have paradoxical attributes, complicating management. Apparent clinical paradoxical or bidirectional effects and reactions ensue when conflicts arise at different levels in self-regulating biological systems, as complexity increases from subcellular components, such as receptors, to cells, tissues, organs, and the whole individual. These may be incompletely understood. Mechanisms of such effects include different actions at the same receptor, owing to changes with time and downstream effects; stereochemical effects; multiple receptor targets with or without associated temporal effects; antibody-mediated reactions; three-dimensional architectural constraints; pharmacokinetic competing compartment effects; disruption and non-linear effects in oscillating systems, systemic overcompensation, and other higher-level feedback mechanisms and feedback response loops at multiple levels. Here we review and provide a compendium of multiple class effects and individual reactions, relevant mechanisms, and specific clinical toxicological considerations of antibiotics, immune modulators, antineoplastic drugs, and cardiovascular, CNS, dermal, endocrine, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, haematological, respiratory, and psychotropic agents.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current pharmacosurveillance methods do not provide timely information on drug safety and effectiveness. Real-time surveillance using electronic prescribing systems could address this problem; however, the data collected using these systems has not been validated. We investigated the accuracy of using orders for drug discontinuation and dose change in an electronic prescribing system as a potential source of information for drug safety and effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of an electronic prescribing and drug management system in documenting orders for discontinuation and dose changes of prescription drug treatment, and in identifying the reasons for the drug discontinuation and dose change. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We prospectively assessed the accuracy of electronic prescription orders for drug discontinuation and dose change by comparing them with treatment changes documented by physician-facilitated medical chart review (gold standard). Validity was evaluated in 620 patients of 22 community-based primary care physicians in addition to the reasons for these treatment changes. RESULTS: A total of 141 (41.7%) drug discontinuation orders and 197 (58.3%) changes in drug doses were identified by chart review, the majority of which were for cardiovascular and CNS drugs. Ineffective treatment (30.8%), adjusting dose to optimize treatment (25.1%) and adverse drug reactions (21.9%) were the most common reasons for treatment change. The sensitivity of the electronic prescribing system in identifying physician-initiated drug discontinuations and dose changes was 67.0% (95% CI 54.1, 77.7) and the specificity was 99.7% (95% CI 99.5, 99.9). The positive and negative predictive values of electronic treatment discontinuation and change orders were 97.3% (95% CI 95.6, 98.7) and 95.8% (95% CI 92.9, 97.7), respectively. CONCLUSION: An electronic prescribing and drug management system documents drug discontinuation and dose-change orders with high specificity and moderate sensitivity. Ineffective treatment, dose optimization and adverse drug reactions were the most common reasons for drug discontinuation or dose changes. The electronic prescribing system offers a new method for augmenting pharmacosurveillance.",

        "abstract": "Public communication on safety concerns over medicines and advice on how to prevent medicine-induced patient harm is a decisive challenge for the overall success of those responsible for pharmacovigilance. It was in this spirit that the topic of commu-nication in drug safety was put on the agenda of the 10th Annual Meeting of the International Society of Pharmacovigilance (ISoP) in Accra, Ghana, on 5 November 2010, as a follow-up to the sessions on communications at previous an-nual meetings. The informal environment chosen this time was different and unusual but ideal for the topic at stake; an interactive debate involving all participants in the session with the objective of understanding the characteristics of effective communication. Around 30 participants from all over the world came together and presented views from their various perspectives; community and hospital pharmacy, academia, pharmacovigilance centres and regulatory agencies, as well as international bodies. Much is known in theory about good com-munication practices, particularly with regard to the need for clear messages targeted at different populations. But how to achieve this in practice? Reciprocity was defined as the starting point; an exchange of information based on mutual re-spect and shared interest. Two crude commu-nication levels are to be distinguished; one-to-one communication between patients and healthcare professionals, versus mass communication -with smaller or larger audiences -by those investigat-ing and regulating medicines. Independently of the level, the principles of reciprocity and inter-action should apply, not least in the research and planning stage, before communication takes place. The interactive debate was a free-flowing dis-cussion where almost all participants took the floor and presented examples, bringing the prin-ciples and challenges of their application to life. Patients' misunderstandings as to the indication and adverse effects of medicines seem frequent. This was illustrated by examples, including one on women's fears over adverse effects resulting in infertility and termination of pregnancy. The introduction of a communication protocol for thoroughly informing the women concerned in the presence of a third-party witness or supporter has solved the problem in the setting presented. Other examples related to communication over counterfeit medicines, another difficult area given that many people feel they do not have the finan-cial means for, or easy access to, quality-assured products. 882 Bahri et al. The discussion then turned to the topic of feed-back, a further crucial characteristic of reciprocal communication. In one-to-one settings, this may well be achieved, as a participating pharmacist explained, through actively soliciting from the patient a repetition or rehearsal of what was un-derstood. In mass communication settings, ob-taining feedback is no less essential but more complex, and regulators will have to look into designing participation models accordingly. Other aspects for regulators to look at were identified. Participants in the debate stated that regulators often do not consider in their decision-making the situation of health workers in their local setting (particularly relating to easy access to up-to-date safety information), and that there is a need to build sound, trusting partnerships with patients and healthcare professionals. These partnerships may also provide a framework to develop recommendations for one-to-one com-munications between healthcare professionals and patients on certain safety concerns. The partici-pants highlighted the need for regulators to better explain to the public the rationale for regulatory decisions. Towards the end of the workshop, the experi-ences shared during the discussion helped to iden-tify more accurately what targeted, clear messages mean in practice: \u2022 Messages should address, in clear terms, the information needs of the various audiences, in an appropriate language and by suitable methods and, in particular, fill the respective information gaps. \u2022 Messages should describe the action desired as outcome from the communication, where that action has been agreed between the commu-nicating parties on the basis of shared under-standing and purpose. \u2022 Messages prepared for targeted populations should easily enable further individuahzation for one-to-one communications, taking into account the literacy level, psychology and social environment of the given patient. Implementing these recommendations will re-quire outreach to the healthcare communities and finding ways to engage patients. A comment was raised that thought should also be given to how to strengthen communication with health politi-cians and policy makers, who need information for decision-making on the one hand and shape so much of the communications environment by their decisions on the other.",

        "abstract": "The administration of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is one of the expected cancer therapeutics. However, improvements are required in therapies against TRAIL-resistant tumor cells. We report, here, that the anti-obesity drug orlistat enhances the sensitivity to TRAIL in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) cells through two different pathways. The combination of orlistat and TRAIL remarkably induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant HRPC, DU145 and PC3 cells. Orlistat induced the expression of death receptor (DR) 5, which is one of the TRAIL receptors, at both the mRNA and protein levels. The suppression of DR5 with siRNA reduced the apoptosis induced by the combination of orlistat and TRAIL, suggesting that the apoptosis was at least partially due to the upregulation of DR5. Although the upregulation by orlistat of CHOP at both mRNA and protein levels was observed in both cell lines, the activation of the DR5 promoter in DU145 cells was CHOP-dependent, but that in PC3 cells was CHOP-independent. Moreover, orlistat induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a ROS scavenger diminished the sensitivity to TRAIL through the suppression of CHOP and DR5 expression in both cell lines. These results suggest that there are two pathways of upregulation of DR5 by orlistat, which are the ROS-CHOP pathway and the ROS-direct pathway. In conclusion, orlistat promotes the sensitivity to TRAIL by ROS-mediated pathways in prostate cancer cells, especially in TRAIL-resistant cells. We believe that the combination of orlistat and TRAIL in HRPC is promising as a new chemotherapeutic strategy.",

        "abstract": "Aberrant expression of beta-tubulin isotypes is frequently described in tumor tissues and tubulin-binding agent (TBA)-resistant cell lines. There is limited understanding of the role of specific beta-tubulin isotypes in cellular sensitivity to TBAs, and to gain insights into the functional role of betaII- and betaIVb-tubulin, we examined these isotypes in lung cancer cell lines NCI-H460 (H460) and Calu-6. Drug-treated clonogenic assays revealed that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of either betaII- or betaIVb-tubulin hypersensitized the lung cancer cell lines to Vinca alkaloids, with the effects more pronounced following betaIVb-tubulin knockdown. In contrast, there was no change in paclitaxel sensitivity following knockdown of either isotype. Cell cycle analysis revealed a greater propensity for the betaII- and betaIVb-tubulin knockdown cells to undergo G2-M cell cycle block following 5 nmol/L vincristine treatment, with the betaIVb knockdown cells being more sensitive than the betaII-tubulin knockdown cells compared with control. In contrast to betaII-tubulin knockdown, betaIVb-tubulin knockdown cells showed a significant increase in the sub-G1 population (cell death) following treatment with both 5 and 40 nmol/L of vincristine compared with controls. Importantly, betaIVb-tubulin knockdown in H460 cells caused a significant dose-dependent increase in Annexin V staining in response to vincristine but not paclitaxel. Therefore, increased sensitivity to induction of apoptosis is one mechanism underlying the Vinca alkaloid hypersensitivity. This study provides direct evidence that betaII- or betaIVb-tubulins have functionally distinct roles and expression of these isotypes may serve as strong predictors of Vinca alkaloid response and resistance.",

        "abstract": "This chapter provides a general survey of validated and emerging molecular targets for cancer drug discovery and development, with a focus on those explored for the discovery of molecularly targeted cancer therapeutics. The targeting of oncogenic protein tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways in cancer cells ushered in the molecularly targeted approach to therapeutics. The signaling cascade is initiated by the growth factors binding to their cognate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) at the extracellular domain. Protein and lipid kinases modulate the cellular functions of numerous other proteins and play critical roles in signal transduction pathways of cell growth and proliferation. The chapter explains the major receptor and cytosolic tyrosine kinases identified as novel cancer targets. It is found that, in addition to the HER or erbB family of oncogenic RTKs, several other RTKs constitute potential novel molecular targets for cancer drug discovery such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor has also been shown to be important in cancer progression and angiogenesis. Its overexpression has been correlated with treatment failure and mortality in brain, breast, cervical, esophageal, oropharyngeal, and ovarian cancers.",

        "abstract": "A method to predict a compound's sensitivity toward autoxidation using bond dissociation energies for hydrogen abstraction is described. The methodology is based on quantum mechanics and has been validated with a small molecule test set. Through this work, it has been observed that stabilization of an incipient radical by more than a single functional group is normally required to trigger autoxidation. The method has also been used to understand salt effects, wherein protonation of a basic amine stabilizes proximal C-H bonds to autoxidation. It can be used to support understanding of autoxidation processes and can form a predictive role for propensity to form potentially genotoxic and other degradation products. An automated protocol has been developed that allows the nonspecialist to perform quantum chemical calculations. The protocol is robust to enable general usage such that drug-like molecules can be handled by the tool and give an answer in hours (up to some days) depending on the size of the molecule. The efficiency of the tool makes it possible to perform risk assessment for autoxidation of small lists of molecules and could typically be used for shortlisted candidates before drug nomination, during drug formulation development, and during due diligence for in-licensing compounds.",

        "abstract": "Photo-induced drug eruptions are cutaneous adverse events due to exposure to a drug and either ultraviolet or visible radiation. Based on their pathogenesis, they can be classified as phototoxic or photoallergic drug eruptions, although in many cases it is not possible to determine whether a particular eruption is due to a phototoxic or photoallergic mechanism. In this review, the diagnosis, prevention and management of drug-induced photosensitivity are discussed. Diagnosis is based primarily on the history of drug intake and the clinical appearance of the eruption, primarily affecting sun-exposed areas of the skin. Phototesting and photopatch testing can be useful adjuncts in making a diagnosis. The mainstay of management is prevention, including informing patients of the possibility of increased sun sensitivity and the use of sun protective measures. However, once the eruption has occurred, it may be necessary to discontinue the culprit medication and treat the eruption with a potent topical corticosteroid. Drugs that have been implicated in causing photosensitive eruptions are reviewed. Tetracycline, doxycycline, nalidixic acid, voriconazole, amiodarone, hydrochlorothiazide, naproxen, piroxicam, chlorpromazine and thioridazine are among the most commonly implicated medications. We review the medical literature regarding evidence for the culpability of each drug, including the results of phototesting, photopatch testing and rechallenge testing.",

Drug preference was measured by the method of paired-comparison and personality was measured with the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire-50 CC. Contrary to expectations, high compared with low scorers on Sociability and Impulsive-Sensation Seeking preferred depressants. Surprisingly, low compared with high scorers on neuroticism did not differ in preference for alcohol.

        "abstract": "In vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that the induction or inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) is one of the major mechanisms for some clinically important pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions. Thus, an attempt was made to predict pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions using the pharmacokinetic principles that are used for predicting drug-drug interactions. The expected AUC ratio was mainly dependent on unbound herbal inhibitor concentration ([I]) and inhibition constant (Ki), hepatic fraction (fh), number of inhibitory herbal constituents (n) and metabolic pathway fraction in hepatic metabolism (fm). Herb-drug interactions would be with low risk if sigma(i=1)n [[Ii]/Ki(i)] is less than 0.1, medium risk if it is between 0.1 and 1.0, and high risk if it is greater than 1. For high clearance drugs, the change of fh x fm had minor influence on AUC ratio when sigma(i=1)n [[Ii]/Ki(i)] values were fixed. Similarly, fm did not affect the AUC ratio for low clearance drugs. It appeared likely to predict a herb-drug metabolic interaction when [I], Ki, fh, fm and n could be determined. However, many herb- and drug-related factors may cause difficulties with the prediction, and well-designed human studies are always necessary.",

The most frequently used drugs were ketamine, ecstasy, and cannabis, with the majority of participants using two or more drugs on any one occasion. Club-drug users were more rash-impulsive and reward-driven, and less punishment-sensitive than non-drug users (p < 0.001). Rash impulsivity, but not reward drive or punishment sensitivity, was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with risky drug-related behaviour. There was no association between any personality traits and preferred drug. These findings suggest that, while those who use club drugs are generally more impulsive and less punishment-sensitive, some discrete facets of impulsivity are associated with differing patterns of drug-use behaviour. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "Problems associated with pharmacotherapy (in particular, medication errors and adverse drug events) are frequent and are associated with increased costs for treatment. Analysis of original publications published between 1990 and 2005 on the topics of medication errors and/or adverse drug events in hospitalised patients, focusing on the frequency of, risk factors for and avoidance of such problems associated with pharmacotherapy, indicated that medication errors occurred in a mean of 5.7% of all episodes of drug administration, but with a high variability among the 35 studies retrieved. This variability was explained by the methods by which medication errors were detected (systematic screening of patients versus chart review or spontaneous reporting) and by the way drugs were administered (intravenously administered drugs are associated with the highest error frequencies). Errors occurred throughout the whole medication process, with administration errors accounting for more than half of all errors. Important risk factors included insufficient pharmacological knowledge of health professionals, errors in the patient charts or documentation by nurses and inadequate pharmacy services. Adverse events or reactions, on the other hand, affected 6.1 patients per 100 hospitalised and also showed a high variability among the 46 studies retrieved. This variability could also be explained by the different methods of assessment of the frequency of adverse drug events or reactions, as well as by the different wards on which the studies were performed. Important risk factors for adverse drug events or reactions included polypharmacy, female sex, drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, renal elimination of drugs, age >65 years and use of anticoagulants or diuretics. Since medication errors are strong risk factors for preventable adverse drug events or reactions, strategies have to be put in place for their reduction. Such strategies include ensuring that all persons involved in the medication process (nurses, pharmacists and physicians) have good pharmacological knowledge, computerisation of the entire medication process, and the engagement of a sufficient number of clinical pharmacists on the wards.",

        "abstract": "Malaria, caused mostly by Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. Antimalarial drug toxicity is one side of the risk-benefit equation and is viewed differently depending upon whether the clinical indication for drug administration is malaria treatment or prophylaxis. Drug toxicity must be acceptable to patients and cause less harm than the disease itself. Research that leads to drug registration tends to omit two important groups who are particularly vulnerable to malaria--very young children and pregnant women. Prescribing in pregnancy is a particular problem for clinicians because the risk-benefit ratio is often very unclear. The number of antimalarial drugs in use is very small. Despite its decreasing efficacy against P. falciparum, chloroquine continues to be used widely because of its low cost and good tolerability. It remains the drug of first choice for treating P. vivax malaria. Pruritus is a common adverse effect in African patients. As prophylaxis, chloroquine is usually combined with proguanil. This combination has good overall tolerability but mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal upset are more common than with other prophylactic regimens. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is well tolerated as treatment and when used as intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant African women. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is no longer used as prophylaxis because it may cause toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens Johnson syndrome. Mefloquine remains a valuable drug for prophylaxis and treatment. Tolerability is acceptable to most patients and travellers despite the impression given by the lay press. Dose-related serious neuropsychiatric toxicity can occur; mefloquine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of epilepsy or psychiatric disease. Quinine is the mainstay for treating severe malaria in many countries. Cardiovascular or CNS toxicity is rare, but hypoglycaemia may be problematic and blood glucose levels should be monitored. Halofantrine is unsuitable for widespread use because of its potential for cardiotoxicity. There is renewed interest in two old drugs, primaquine and amodiaquine. Primaquine is being developed as prophylaxis, and amodiaquine, which was withdrawn from prophylactic use because of neutropenia and hepatitis, is a potentially good partner drug for artesunate against falciparum malaria. Atovaquone/proguanil is a new antimalarial combination with good efficacy and tolerability as prophylaxis and treatment. The most important class of drugs that could have a major impact on malaria control is the artemisinin derivatives. They have remarkable efficacy and an excellent safety record. They have no identifiable dose-related adverse effects in humans and only very rarely produce allergic reactions. Combining an artemisinin derivative with another efficacious antimalarial drug is increasingly being viewed as the optimal therapeutic strategy for malaria.",

        "abstract": "Despite advances in contemporary chemotherapeutic strategies, long-term survival still remains elusive for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. A better understanding of the molecular markers of drug sensitivity to match therapy with patient is needed to improve clinical outcomes. In this study, we used in vitro drug sensitivity data from the NCI-60 cell lines together with their Affymetrix microarray data to develop a gene expression signature to predict sensitivity to oxaliplatin. To validate our oxaliplatin sensitivity signature, patient-derived colorectal cancer explants (PDCCE) were developed in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice from resected human colorectal tumors. Analysis of gene expression profiles found similarities between the PDCCEs and their parental human tumors, suggesting their utility to study drug sensitivity in vivo. The oxaliplatin sensitivity signature was then validated in vivo with response data from 14 PDCCEs treated with oxaliplatin and was found to have an accuracy of 92.9% (sensitivity = 87.5%; specificity = 100%). Our findings suggest that PDCCEs can be a novel source to study drug sensitivity in colorectal cancer. Furthermore, genomic-based analysis has the potential to be incorporated into future strategies to optimize individual therapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.",

This ADC is currently in clinical trials for melanoma. In the present investigation, a variety of compounds were examined for their ability to increase the expression of GPNMB by cancer cells. These experiments lead to the identification of three distinct groups of compounds that increased GPNMB, some of which were shown to enhance the sensitivity of melanoma cells to CR011-vcMMAE.

        "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions can be associated with patient morbidity due to either increased toxicity or a potentially ineffective concentration. Because interactions cannot always be anticipated during drug development and actual patients receiving a drug for therapeutic use often differ from those included in clinical trials, postmarketing surveillance is essential. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) databases offer a unique opportunity in this respect. Prerequisites for TDM databases to provide valid information in a pharmacoepidemiological perspective include the following: precise description of exposure to the potentially interacting drugs; measurement of parent compound and active metabolites through accurate and precise analytical techniques; documentation of relevant patient characteristics that may act as confounding factors (e.g. gender, age, smoking habits); repeated assessments over time if possible; and sound pharmacokinetic framework for data selection, analysis and interpretation. The contribution of TDM to the documentation of drug-drug interactions takes advantage of different possible study designs, discussed on the basis of recently published studies. The single case report plays an important role as an alert signal. It is illustrated for a patient on long-term treatment, who displayed an unexpectedly high clozapine concentration rafter the introduction of ciprofloxacin comedication. The prospective on and off comedication panel study shows advantages in terms of carefully selected inclusion criteria and control of treatment modalities. A study of the thioridazine-fluvoxamine interaction is presented, with patients followed on thioridazine monotherapy, after introduction of fluvoxamine and after its discontinuation. The main advantage of the retrospective large-scale TDM database screen is representativeness of patients actually treated, whereas drawbacks are related to quality of data and suitability for valid interpretation. Such an approach is illustrated by a review of data collected over 10 years of routine TDM that allowed documenting induction of nortriptyline metabolism by carbamazepine and inhibition by several phenothiazines. Finally, population pharmacokinetics is well suited to observational data collected for TDM purpose, provided quality is ascertained. Focus is placed on interindividual variability and relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and patient characteristics, including comedication. The population approach is discussed with respect to a study that documented a 32% increase of haloperidol clearance associated with anticonvulsant comedication, in addition to effects of age and bodyweight. Among factors to consider for improved effectiveness in the use of TDM databases for postmarketing surveillance of drug-drug interactions, integration of efficacy and safety data in future studies and communication of expert recommendations to prescribing physicians are essential.",

        "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) enable targeted delivery of therapeutics to cancer cells and offer potential for more selective therapy. Several ADCs are demonstrating promising clinical efficacy, however due to the complexity of human cancer, tumors become refractory to most drug treatments. We hypothesized that cultured tumor cells chronically treated with an ADC would acquire mechanisms of resistance unique to ADC-based therapy. Human breast cancer cell lines were exposed to multiple cycles of an anti-Her2 trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugate (TM) at IC80 concentrations for 3 days followed by \u223c1 week without treatment to simulate a maximally tolerated dose followed by recovery. After \u223c2 months, significant resistance developed in JIMT1 and MDA-MB-361 cell lines. The potency of TM conjugate on drug-selected cell lines was reduced to the activity observed on Her2-negative cells (>20 & >270X in JIMT1 & 361 cell models, respectively). Flow cytometry revealed 58% and 25% decreases in Her2 receptor number in JIMT-TM & 361-TM, respectively. Proteomic profiling of surface proteins in JIMT-TM cells demonstrated significant increases in proteins involved in post-translational modification (e.g., ubiquitinating enzymes, kinases, and phosphatases), as well as elevated levels of endosomal and vesicle proteins (e.g., RAB family members), and proteins mediating microtubule and actin dynamics. Notably, ABC drug transporters were not altered in JIMT-TM cells. In 361-TM cells, an increase in ABCC1 (MRP1) was observed, but no changes in ABCB1 (MDR1) which typically effluxes tubulin inhibitors. These data suggest the acquisition of complex resistance mechanisms upon ADC treatment. The cross-resistance profile of these ADC refractory models was evaluated. Minimal or no resistance (1 - 6X) was observed to free drugs, including maytansine or other standard-of-care tubulin or DNA targeted therapeutics. In JIMT-TM cells, cross-resistance was observed to other trastuzumab-based ADCs, including those containing either non-cleavable or cleavable linkers, and delivering payloads with various biological mechanisms of action. In contrast, 361-TM cells (which were made resistant to an ADC delivering a tubulin inhibitor via a non-cleavable linker) retained significant sensitivity to ADCs containing cleavable linkers, even those containing other tubulin inhibitor-based payloads. Moreover, both 361-TM and JIMT-TM resistant cell lines retained sensitivity to ADCs delivering payloads with alternative (non-tubulin) mechanisms of action. Therefore, despite the reduction in antigen levels observed in both cell lines, modification of the linker and/or the payload was able to overcome resistance mediated by the initial ADC therapy. These data offer the potential to treat refractory tumors with ADCs containing the same antibody vehicle, but delivering alternative linkers or payloads.Citation Format: Xingzhi Tan, Guixian Jin, Jeremy Myers, Veronica Diesl, Max Follettie, My-Hanh Lam, Sylvia Musto, Kiran Khandke, Manoj Charati, Edmund Graziani, Andreas Maderna, Chakrapani Subramanyam, Frank Koehn, Russell Dushin, Kim Arndt, Christopher J.

The activated ester group is employed to attach the DO3A chelating agent, while the aldehyde groups are exploited for DOX conjugation, providing a controlled release mechanism for DOX in acidic environments. DOX/Gd-loaded nanoparticles are rapidly taken up by MCF-7 breast cancer cells, subsequently releasing DOX as demonstrated using in vitro fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). Endosomal, DOX release is observed, using a phasor plot representation of the fluorescence lifetime data, showing an increase of native DOX with time. The MRI properties of the stars are assessed and the relaxivity of Gd loaded in stars is three times higher than conventional organic Gd/DO3A complexes. The DOX/Gd-conjugated nanoparticles yield a similar IC50 to native DOX for breast cancer cell lines, confirming that DOX integrity is conserved during nanoparticle attachment and release.",

        "abstract": "Dollar spot, caused by Sclerotinia homoeocarpa, is a prevalent turfgrass disease, and the fungus exhibits widespread fungicide resistance in North America. In a previous study, an ABC-G transporter, ShatrD, was associated with practical field resistance to demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides. Mining of ABC-G transporters, also known as pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) transporters, from RNA-Seq data gave an assortment of transcripts, several with high sequence similarity to functionally characterized transporters from Botrytis cinerea, and others with closest blastx hits from Aspergillus and Monilinia. In addition to ShatrD, another PDR transporter showed significant over-expression in replicated RNA-Seq data, and in a collection of field-resistant isolates, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. These isolates also showed reduced sensitivity to unrelated fungicide classes. Using a yeast complementation system, we sought to test the hypothesis that this PDR transporter effluxes DMI as well as chemically unrelated fungicides. The transporter (ShPDR1) was cloned into the Gal1 expression vector and transformed into a yeast PDR transporter deletion mutant, AD12345678. Complementation assays indicated that ShPDR1 complemented the mutant in the presence of propiconazole (DMI), iprodione (dicarboximide) and boscalid (SDHI, succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor). Our results indicate that the over-expression of ShPDR1 is correlated with practical field resistance to DMI fungicides and reduced sensitivity to dicarboximide and SDHI fungicides. These findings highlight the potential for the eventual development of a multidrug resistance phenotype in this pathogen. In addition, this study presents a pipeline for the discovery and validation of fungicide resistance genes using de novo next-generation sequencing and molecular biology techniques in an unsequenced plant pathogenic fungus.",

In addition, sequestration of drugs in intracellular vesicles has often been associated with MDR. However, the nature and role of intracellular vesicles in MDR are unclear. We addressed the relationship between MDR and vesicular anthracycline accumulation in the erythroleukemia cell line K562 and a drug-resistant counterpart K562/ADR that overexpresses P-glycoprotein. We used four anthracyclines (all of which are P-glycoprotein substrates): daunorubicin and idarubicin, which have good affinity for DNA and as weak bases can accumulate inside acidic compartments; hydroxyrubicin, which binds to DNA but is uncharged at physiological or acidic pH and thus cannot accumulate in acidic compartments; and WP900, an enantiomer of daunorubicin, which is a weak DNA binder but has the same pKa and lipophilicity as daunorubicin. The intrinsic fluorescence of anthracyclines allowed us to use macro- and micro-spectrofluorescence, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy to characterize their nuclear or intravesicular accumulation in living cells. We found that vesicular accumulation of daunorubicin, WP900 and idarubicin, containing a basic 3'-amine was predominantly restricted to lysosomes in both cell lines, that pH regulation of acidic compartments was not defective in human K562 cells, and that vesicular drug accumulation was much more pronounced in the parental tumor cell line than in the multidrug-resistant cells. These results indicate that vesicular anthracycline sequestration does not contribute to the diminished sensitivity to anthracyclines in multidrug-resistant K562 cells.",

Its pharmacological activity already appears significant at low doses. Unfortunately, the difficulty in determining the drug in serum at low concentrations hampers the completion of accurate pharmacokinetic studies in humans. Only chromatographic methods allow reaching the necessary sensitivities.\\n\\nMETHODS: Almost all of the HPLC methods proposed were based on the preliminary extraction of topiramate from the sample using organic solvents. In our study, the conditions for purifying topiramate through solid-liquid technique in disposable cartridges (SPE) packed with C18 reversed phase were examinated and optimised. After a pre-column derivatization step with 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC-Cl) and internal standard addition, topiramate was analysed on a CN column with sodium phosphate buffer 50 mmol/L (pH 2.5) containing acetonitrile (60:40, v/v) as the mobile phase. The column effluent was monitored with a fluorescence detector (excitation and emission 1 260 and 315 nm, respectively). 122 samples from our routine laboratory work were analysed in order to confirm the existence of a relationship between topiramate dose and serum concentration and to evaluate the effect of concomitant therapies with enzyme-inducing AEDs.\\n\\nRESULTS: Sensitivity (2 ng/mL), precision (CV within assay of 3.8% and between assays of 6.6%), linearity and accuracy of the method were better than other analytical procedures previously reported. Serum topiramate levels in the group with enzyme-inducing AEDs showed a reduction with respect to the group with non-enzyme-inducing AEDs and the correlation between doses and mean serum concentration gives a linear trend (r2 = 0.916).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of SPE extraction together with the method's reliability proved very advantageous for pharmacokinetics studies and, in principle, for therapeutic drug monitoring and toxicological investigations.",

Rv1819c was overexpressed only upon isoniazid exposure (p<0.05). Overexpression of some efflux genes is associated with multidrug resistance in certain clinical isolate of M. tuberculosis.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To develop a technology assessment of chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance assays in order to define the role of these tests in routine oncology practice. METHODS: The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) established a Working Group to develop the technology assessment. The Working Group collaborated with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) Technology Evaluation Center. The Working Group developed independent criteria for selecting articles for inclusion in the ASCO assessment, and developed a structured data abstraction tool to facilitate review of selected manuscripts. One Working Group member and an ASCO staff member independently reviewed the 1,139 abstracts identified by the BCBSA comprehensive literature search, and by an updated literature search performed by ASCO using the BCBSA search strategy (1966 to January 2004). Of the 12 articles included in this technology assessment, eight were identified by the original BCBSA systematic review, one was provided by industry, and three were identified by the ASCO updated literature review. RESULTS: Review of the literature does not identify any CSRAs for which the evidence base is sufficient to support use in oncology practice. RECOMMENDATIONS: The use of chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance assays to select chemotherapeutic agents for individual patients is not recommended outside of the clinical trial setting. Oncologists should make chemotherapy treatment recommendations on the basis of published reports of clinical trials and a patient's health status and treatment preferences. Because the in vitro analytic strategy has potential importance, participation in clinical trials evaluating these technologies remains a priority.",

        "abstract": "Background: The optimal choice of cytotoxic drugs for intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC) in conjunction with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) for treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is poorly defined. We investigated drug sensitivity ex vivo in patient samples of various PC tumor types and correlated clinical outcome to drug sensitivity within the subset of PC from colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: PC tissue samples (n = 174) from mesothelioma, pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP), ovarian cancer, CRC or appendix cancer were analyzed ex vivo for sensitivity to oxaliplatin, cisplatin, mitomycin C, melphalan, irinotecan, docetaxel, doxorubicin and 5-FU. Clinicopathological variables and outcome data were collected for the CRC subset. Results: Mesothelioma and ovarian cancer were generally more drug sensitive than CRC, appendix cancer and PMP. Oxaliplatin showed the most favorable ratio between achievable IPC concentration and ex vivo drug sensitivity. Drug sensitivity in CRC varied considerably between individual samples. Ex vivo drug sensitivity did not obviously correlate to time-to-progression (TTP) in individual patients. Conclusions: Drug-sensitivity varies considerably between PC diagnoses and individual patients arguing for individualized therapy in IPC rather than standard diagnosis-specific therapy. However, in the current paradigm of treatment according to diagnosis, oxaliplatin is seemingly the preferred drug for IPC from a drug sensitivity and concentration perspective. In the CRC subset, analysis of correlation between ex vivo drug sensitivity and TTP was inconclusive due to the heterogeneous nature of the data.",

        "abstract": "This review describes and summarizes current preclinical research revealing important differences between drug and non-drug reinforcers in terms of their effects on behavior. Despite research showing that drugs are not especially strong reinforcers in animals, a number of other behavioral differences potentially relevant to addiction have been reported in studies that have compared drug and non-drug reinforcers. Several of these effects appear only after long-term access to drugs. These include an escalation of drug intake, an increased persistence in responding for the drug, and a decreased sensitivity to the effects of punishers or other suppressors of drug seeking. Further differences between drug and non-drug reinforcers include the effects that reinforcer-paired stimuli have on behavior. Drug cues, as compared to food cues, have been shown to exert greater control over reinforcer-seeking behavior after periods of abstinence. Similarly, behavior previously reinforced by drugs, but not food, has been shown to be susceptible to stress-induced reinstatement after extinction. The behavioral differences between drug and non-drug reinforcers reviewed here may identify special features of drugs that lead to addiction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Abstract: FOXO transcription factors, functioning downstream of the PI3K-PTEN-AKT (PKB) signalling cascade, are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, DNA damage repair and apoptosis. Recent research indicates that the related transcription factor FOXM1 is a direct target of repression by FOXO proteins. Inactivation of FOXO or overexpression of FOXM1 is associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression. In addition, the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of a diverse spectrum of anti-cancer drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, lapatinib, gefitinib, imatinib and cisplatin, are mediated through the activation of FOXO3a and/or the inhibition of its target FOXM1. Paradoxically, FOXO proteins also contribute to drug resistance by driving the expression of genes important for drug efflux as well as DNA repair and cell survival pathways in drug resistant cancers. Given its pivotal roles in drug sensitivity as well as resistance, targeting the FOXO-FOXM1 axis could be a viable strategy for treatment of cancer and for overcoming drug resistance. Studying the expression profiles of the components of the FOXO-FOXM1 axis and their cofactors in cancer patients might also help to predict and monitor their clinical response to chemotherapy. A better understanding of the mechanism by which FOXO and FOXM1 are regulated, as well as their roles in drug sensitivity and resistance, may render these proteins crucial prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer and other malignancies.",

        "abstract": "Many promising therapeutic agents are limited by their inability to reach the systemic circulation, due to the excellent barrier properties of biological membranes, such as the stratum corneum (SC) of the skin or the sclera/cornea of the eye and others. The outermost layer of the skin, the SC, is the principal barrier to topically-applied medications. The intact SC thus provides the main barrier to exogenous substances, including drugs. Only drugs with very specific physicochemical properties (molecular weight < 500\u2009Da, adequate lipophilicity, and low melting point) can be successfully administered transdermally. Transdermal delivery of hydrophilic drugs and macromolecular agents of interest, including peptides, DNA, and small interfering RNA is problematic. Therefore, facilitation of drug penetration through the SC may involve by-pass or reversible disruption of SC molecular architecture.

Determining the activity of drug efflux transport proteins has important implications in the identification of substrates and/or inhibitors.

To improve such characteristics, transdermal drug delivery was brought to existence. This delivery system is capable of transporting the drug or macromolecules painlessly through skin into the blood circulation at fixed rate. Topical administration of therapeutic agents offers many advantages over conventional oral and invasive techniques of drug delivery. Several important advantages of transdermal drug delivery are prevention from hepatic first pass metabolism, enhancement of therapeutic efficiency and maintenance of steady plasma level of the drug. Human skin surface, as a site of drug application for both local and systemic effects, is the most eligible candidate available. New controlled transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) technologies (electrically-based, structure-based and velocity-based) have been developed and commercialized for the transdermal delivery of troublesome drugs. This review article covers most of the new active transport technologies involved in enhancing the transdermal permeation via effective drug delivery system.",

        "abstract": "IMP dehydrogenase is a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of GTP. In mammalian cells it is regulated with respect to growth rate and is the target of numerous therapeutic agents. Mutations in the RNA polymerase II elongation machinery render yeast sensitive to inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase and defective in inducing transcription of one of the IMP dehydrogenase-encoding genes, IMD2. Here we show that loss of IMD2, but not IMD1, IMD3, or IMD4, conferred upon yeast the same drug sensitivity found in elongation mutants. We tested whether the drug sensitivity of elongation mutants is due to their inability to induce IMD2 by providing them with exogenous copies of the gene. In some elongation mutants, overexpression reversed drug sensitivity and a transcriptional defect. Overexpression in mutants with a more severe phenotype partially suppressed drug sensitivity but was inconsequential in reversing a defect in transcription. These findings suggest that the drug sensitivity of elongation mutants is largely but not solely attributable to defects in the ability to induce IMD2, because transcription is compromised even when IMD2 mRNA levels are adequate. We describe two DNA sequence elements in the promoter of the gene that regulate it. We also found that IMD2 mRNA abundance is coupled to cell growth rate. These findings show that yeast possess a conserved system that gauges nucleotide pools and cell growth rate and responds through a uniquely regulated member of the IMD gene family.",

Therefore, we investigated the clinical value of the histoculture drug response assay for ovarian cancer. Tumor specimens were cultured for 7 days on collagen gel sponge in medium containing cisplatin, and the 50% inhibitory concentration was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Then the in vitro sensitivity to cisplatin was compared with the clinical response and survival. Apoptosis of tumor cells was also investigated. Among 173 ovarian cancer patients, 164 were evaluable by the assay, and 29 patients had measurable lesions for which the clinical response could be determined. The 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in patients with chemosensitive tumors than in those with chemoresistant tumors when the cutoff value was set at a 50% inhibitory concentration of 25 microg/mL and the accuracy of the assay was 82.8% (24/29). As chemosensitivity to cisplatin became greater, the number of apoptotic cells also increased. This chemosensitivity assay may help predict the clinical response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, thus improving the survival of ovarian cancer patients.",

However, the identification involving chemoresistant features for cell surface proteins is a challenge. To identify potential cell membrane markers in hematologic cancer MDR, we used a cell- and antibody-based strategy of subtractive immunization coupled with cell surface comparative screening of leukemia cell lines from sensitive HL60 and resistant HL60/DOX cells. Fifty one antibodies that recognized the cell surface proteins expressed differently between the two cell lines were generated. One of them, the McAb-5D12 not only recognizes its antigen but also block its function. Comparative analysis of immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and mass spectrum analysis validated that the membrane antigen of McAb-5D12 is a nucleoprotein-polypyrimidine tract binding protein associated splicing factor, PSF. Our results identified that PSF overexpressed on the membrane of sensitive cells compared with resistant cells and its relocation from the nuclear to the cell surface was common in hematological malignancy cell lines and marrow of leukemia patients. Furthermore, we found that cell surface PSF contributed to cell sensitivity by inhibiting cell proliferation. The results represent a novel and potentially useful biomarker for MDR prediction. The strategy enables the correlation of expression levels and functions of cell surface protein with some cell-drug response traits by using antibodies.",

        "abstract": "The use of stepwise isothermal high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC) as a novel means of detecting excipient incompatibility is described using aspirin mixes with magnesium stearate and stearic acid as model systems. Aspirin, magnesium stearate and stearic acid alone and as mixes were studied in scanning mode using conventional DSC and were then subjected to a stepwise heating programme using HSDSC, whereby the samples were heated to temperatures between 45 and 70??C and held for 1 h, during which the heat flow to or from the sample was measured. The data indicated that while no thermal events were detected for the individual components or mixes with stearic acid other than melting of stearic acid, 50% w/w mixes of magnesium stearate showed a marked endothermic response at temperatures above 55??C. The data were fitted to an adaptation of an existing kinetic model for the degradation process and a reasonable correlation found. Mixes of the drug with the two excipients were then studied at 60??C over 6 h at concentrations between 1 and 50% w/w. Incompatibilities with magnesium stearate concentrations as low as 1% w/w could be detected using this approach. Compacts of magnesium stearate and aspirin were also studied, with considerably more pronounced thermal events taking place compared to the powder mixes. It is concluded from these studies that while the study has highlighted certain limitations of the approach, stepwise isothermal DSC represents a potentially highly useful means of detecting excipient incompatibilities.

        "abstract": "Drug resistance is a major obstacle in successful systemic therapy of metastatic cancer. We analyzed the involvement of cell cycle regulatory proteins in eliciting response to N (phosphonoacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), an inhibitor of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, in two metastatic variants of human cancer cell line MDA-MB-435 isolated from lung (L-2) and brain (Br-1) in nude mouse, respectively. L-2 and Br-l cells markedly differed in their sensitivity to PALA. While both cell types displayed an initial S phase delay/arrest, Br-l cells proliferated but most L-2 cells underwent apoptosis. There was distinct elevation in cyclin A, and phosphorylated Rb proteins concomitant with decreased expression of bcl-2 protein in the PALA treated L-2 cells undergoing apoptosis. Markedly elevated cyclin A associated and cdk2 kinase activities together with increased E2F1-DNA binding were detected in these L-2 cells. Induced ectopic cyclin A expression sensitized Br-l cells to PALA by activating an apoptotic pathway. Our findings demonstrate that elevated expression of cyclin A and associated kinase can activate an apoptotic pathway in cells exposed to DNA antimetabolites. Abrogation of this pathway can lead to resistance against these drugs in metastatic variants of human carcinoma cells.",

        "abstract": "A macromolecular pro-drug of a known anti-viral agent Zidovudine (AZT) was synthesized and evaluated as a sustained drug delivery system. The pro-drug was synthesized by coupling the drug to 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) through a succinic spacer to get a monomeric drug conjugate which was polymerized to obtain the polymeric pro-drug. The pro-drug was subjected for in-vitro drug release study in buffers of pH 1.2 and 7.4. The hydrolytic stability of the pro-drug to pepsin was assessed in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 1.2) and to \u03b1-chymotrypsin in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 7.4). The results showed that the drug release from the polymeric backbone takes place in a sustained manner over a period of 24\u2009h, and the amount of drug released was comparatively higher at pH 7.4. Plasmatic hydrolysis studies of succinylzidovudine showed nearly complete release of AZT. At all pH conditions in the presence and absence of \u03b1-chymotrypsin, AZT was released preferentially in comparison with the succinyl derivative. The in-vivo release studies in rabbits after oral administration of AZT conjugate demonstrated a sustained release of parent drug over a period of 24\u2009h. The pro-drug provided a significant increase in the area under the plasma concentration time curve as compared to free drug and extended the plasma half-life from 1.06\u2009h to 8.08\u2009h. This study suggested that, after oral administration, the drug-polymer conjugate can release AZT for prolonged periods, thus improving the pharmacokinetics of AZT and decreasing the fluctuation in plasma drug levels that can lead to toxicity.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevention of drug-drug interactions requires a systematic approach for which the concept of clinical risk management can be used. The objective of our study was to measure the frequency, nature and management of drug-drug interaction alerts as these occur in daily practice of Dutch community pharmacies. METHODS: In total, 63 Dutch pharmacies collected all drug-drug interaction alerts during 153 research days (on average 2.4 days/pharmacy), as well as variables related to these alerts, such as involved medicines, first time or recurrent drug-drug interaction, same or different prescribers, patient data (age, sex) and information about the management of drug-drug interactions by the pharmacy. The latter was discriminated into internal procedures only and external action, such as communication with the patient, the prescriber or the anticoagulation clinic and prescription modification. All drug-drug interactions were classified into categories of clinical relevance (A-F) and available evidence (0-4). RESULTS: A total of 43,129 prescription-only medicines were dispensed during the study period. On average, 16.8 interaction alerts per day per pharmacy were collected. Approximately 6% of all prescriptions generated a drug-drug interaction alert. Of all alerts (n = 2572), 31.1% occurred for the first time and with 21% two different prescribers were involved. The 20 most frequently occurring drug-drug interaction alerts accounted for approximately 76% of all alerts. Cardiovascular drugs, NSAIDs, oral contraceptives and antibacterials were most frequently involved. External action was taken in response to 27.3% of the alerts, meaning either a modification of one of the concerned prescriptions (n = 65; 9.3%), communication with the prescriber or anticoagulation clinic (n = 90; 12.8%) or communication with the patient or a relative (n = 547; 77.9%). Where there was no external action (n = 1860; 72.3%), pharmacists concluded in about two-thirds of cases that the drug-drug interaction had been managed in the past. Other reasons not to intervene externally were for instance: incorrect alert; acceptable drug-drug interaction; or outcome of the interaction considered irrelevant. Adjusted for several variables, a first alert was found to be a main determinant for external action. After stratifying for first alerts no other significant determinants were found. CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of drug-drug interaction alerts was found. Most concerned recurrent alerts, which were the main reason not to act externally. Concerning the assessment phase in the risk-management process, drug-drug interactions with no or low evidence/relevance should be reconsidered. Concerning the management of drug-drug interactions in pharmacies, the opportunity to actively suppress alerts for a certain period of time should be studied in more detail. There are indicators that the management of patient-orientated advice could be improved and a greater degree of consistency developed for the management of first and recurrent interaction alerts.",

        "abstract": "Drug eruptions are among the most common adverse drug reactions, affecting approximately 3% of hospitalised patients. Although the rate of severe cutaneous adverse reactions to medications is low, these reactions can affect anyone who takes medication, and can result in death or disability. Two general patterns can be distinguished, depending on the type of onset of these cutaneous adverse drug reactions: acute or chronic. Acute-onset events are usually rather specific cutaneous 'syndromes' that constitute emergencies and should therefore be promptly recognised and treated, while chronic-onset events often present as dermatological diseases. The challenge is therefore to recognise the drug aetiology in front of a 'classical' dermatosis such as acne, lichen or pemphigus. Therefore, clinicians should carefully evaluate the signs or symptoms of all adverse reactions thought to be drug related, and discontinue the offending agent when feasible. Erythematous drug eruptions are the most frequent and less severe acute immune drug-induced rashes, and are sometimes difficult to differentiate from viral eruptions. On the other hand, acute urticaria and angioedema are sometimes life-threatening eruptions for which a drug aetiology must be investigated. Photosensitivity, vasculitis and skin necrosis belong to the acute onset reactions, which are not always drug-induced, in contrast to fixed drug eruptions. The early recognition of acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis, DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are of high importance because of the specific mechanisms involved and the different prognosis of each of these diseases. Chronic onset drug-induced disorders include pigmentary changes, drug-induced autoimmune bullous diseases, lupus, pseudo lymphoma and acneiform eruptions; these are discussed, along with specific data on drug-induced hair and nail disorders. As the disorders are numerous, the mechanisms and the drugs involved in the development of these various reactions are multiple. The list of drugs discussed in relation to the different disorders are as accurate as possible at the time of preparation of this review, but will need updating as new drugs emerge onto the market. We emphasize the clinical recognition, pathophysiology and treatment of skin, hair and nail adverse drug reactions, and the role of each doctor involved in the management of these patients in the notification of the adverse drug reaction to health authorities, using the minimal requirement for notification proposed.",

        "abstract": "Nephrotoxicity is an inherent adverse effect of certain anticancer drugs. Renal dysfunction can be categorised as prerenal uraemia, intrinsic damage or postrenal uraemia according to the underlying pathophysiological process. Renal hypoperfusion promulgates prerenal uraemia. Intrinsic renal damage results from prolonged hypoperfusion, exposure to exogenous or endogenous nephrotoxins, renotubular precipitation of xenobiotics or endogenous compounds, renovascular obstruction, glomerular disease, renal microvascular damage or disease, and tubulointerstitial damage or disease. Postrenal uraemia is a consequence of clinically significant urinary tract obstruction. Clinical signs of nephrotoxicity and methods used to assess renal function are discussed. Mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced renal dysfunction generally include damage to vasculature or structures of the kidneys, haemolytic uraemic syndrome and prerenal perfusion deficits. Patients with cancer are frequently at risk of renal impairment secondary to disease-related and iatrogenic causes. This article reviews the incidence, presentation, prevention and management of anticancer drug-induced renal dysfunction. Dose-related nephrotoxicity subsequent to administration of certain chloroethylnitrosourea compounds (carmustine, semustine and streptozocin) is commonly heralded by increased serum creatinine levels, uraemia and proteinuria. Additional signs of streptozocin-induced nephrotoxicity include hypophosphataemia, hypokalaemia, hypouricaemia, renal tubular acidosis, glucosuria, aceturia and aminoaciduria. Cisplatin and carboplatin cause dose-related renal dysfunction. In addition to increased serum creatinine levels and uraemia, electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypomagnesaemia and hypokalaemia, are commonly reported adverse effects. Rarely, cisplatin has been implicated as the underlying cause of haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Pharmaceutical antidotes to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity include amifostine, sodium thiosulfate and diethyldithiocarbamate. Dose- and age-related proximal tubular damage is an adverse effect of ifosfamide. In addition to renal wasting of electrolytes, glucose and amino acids, Fanconi syndrome, rickets and osteomalacia have occurred with ifosfamide treatment. High dose azacitidine causes renal dysfunction manifested by tubular acidosis, polyuria and increased urinary excretion of electrolytes, glucose and amino acids. Haemolytic uraemia is a rare adverse effect of gemcitabine. Methotrexate can cause increased serum creatinine levels, uraemia and haematuria. Acute renal failure is reported following administration of high dose methotrexate. Urinary alkalisation and hydration confer protection against methotrexate-induced renal dysfunction. Dose-related nephrotoxicity, including acute renal failure, are reported subsequent to treatment with pentostatin and diaziquone. Acute renal failure is a rare adverse effect of treatment with interferon-alpha. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome occurs with mitomycin administration. A mortality rate of 50 to 100% is reported in patients developing mitomycin-induced haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Capillary leak syndrome occurring with aldesleukin therapy can cause renal dysfunction. Infusion-related hypotension during infusion of high dose carmustine can precipitate renal dysfunction.",

The US FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research is responsible for ensuring the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of many biologically derived products, including blood intended for transfusion, blood components and derivatives, vaccines and allergenic extracts, and cell, tissue and gene therapy products for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human diseases, conditions or injury. Human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion or transfer into a human recipient are regulated as human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps).",

        "abstract": "This guidance is intended to describe a regulatory framework (Process Analytical Technology, PAT) that will encourage the voluntary development and implementation of innovative pharmaceutical development, manufacturing, and quality assurance. Working with existing regulations, the Agency has developed an innovative approach for helping the pharmaceutical industry address anticipated technical and regulatory issues and questions. This guidance is written for a broad industry audience in different organizational units and scientific disciplines. To a large extent, the guidance discusses principles with the goal of highlighting opportunities and developing regulatory processes that encourage innovation. In this regard, it is not a typical Agency guidance. FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.",

Embryonal carcinoma cells, on the contrary, are stem cells derived from teratomas that give rise to teratocarcinomas and differentiated tissues quite similar to ESCs. What is the difference? Compare the proteomes. Out of 1800 proteins identified and quantitated by Chaerkady et al., roughly 200 showed at least a two-fold difference in abundance by iTRAQ. Among the proteins expressed at high levels in ESCs were factors involved in pluripotency and development. A number of the highly expressed proteins in the ESCs have been found in other systems associated with malignancies.pp. 1359-1373 TALKING TO ITSELF: A CELL MANAGES ITS ADHESION OPTIONS: I once slept on a pillow that squeaked and crunched every time I moved my head. The old chicken feathers just did not want to quit. Perhaps they were plotting where to put the next lump. Cells have a complex system for deciding when to stay or go. Adhesive interactions between cells are critical to development, wound healing and inflammation, etc. They are modulated by membrane receptors that interact with intra- and extracellular ligands. Friedrichs et al. have developed quantitative means to look at how different adhesion receptors on the same cell interact. Using an atomic force microscope, the cantilever is coated with the primary adhesive ligand and the slide with a secondary ligand. A cell to be tested is allowed to attach to the cantilever, then put in contact with the test surface. Analysis of the force-distance profile reveals the presence or absence of communication between the two receptors.pp. 1455-1462 RETRO RECORD SPINNER REVEALS RESIDENCE WITH NURD: DJ-1 was one of those drifters, very often drifting onto the wrong side of the cancer line to be invited to reputable recreation more than once in any tissue. Then, a couple of research posses got her in their sights. What a sight she was when she cleaned up her act. Opsahl et al., using a full set of proteomic tools, found that DJ-1 was a bit of a firefighter (oxidative stress); part-time nurse (staving off death by p53 and daunorubicin); and NuRD master (involved in control of acetylation and deacetylation of proteins by changes in affinity of NuRD complex). The authors characterize DJ-1 as a two-edged sword, able to cut or protect friends and enemies. There are still more lessons to be learned from the number 1 DJ.pp. 1494-1504.",

        "abstract": "Transferrin is a blood-plasma glycoprotein, which is responsible for ferric-ion delivery and which functions as the most important ferric pool in the body. The reversible complexation process of Fe\n                        3+ ions is associated with conformational changes of the three-dimensional structure of the transferrin. This conformational dynamics is attributed to a partial unfolding of the N-lobe of the protein and could be described as a transition between the holo to the apo forms of the transferrin. The aim of the present work is to demonstrate the unprecedented ability of the transferrin to solubilize various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in physiological solution and to explore the impact of these materials on the structure and functionality of the transferrin. The synthesis and characterization of novel materials, consisting of complexes between human transferrin and hydrophobic high-carbon-content compounds, is reported here for the first time. Furthermore, it is shown that the preparation of these complexes from holo-transferrin leads to an irreversible loss of the ferric ions from the protein. Analytical studies of these novel complexes may shed a light on the mechanism by which transferrin could lose its ability to bind and thus to transport and store iron. These findings clearly demonstrate a possible damaging impact of various hydrophobic pollutants, which can enter an organism by inhalation or ingestion, on the functionality of the transferrin. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: HIV-1 infection is a major problem for children in lower income countries. The benefit of early antiretroviral (ARV) therapy started within 12 weeks of life is well documented. Although the development of new drug classes give alternative options for highly treatment experienced patients there is inadequate pharmacokinetic knowledge regarding the already established ARV classes in infants and children. Also, there are many practical challenges to administering these agents to children. METHOD AND RESULTS: The challenges of current widely available treatment regimens in the light of new vertical transmission prevention guidelines are discussed. The dynamic physiological changes affecting pharmacokinetics in infancy and childhood are reviewed. New antiretroviral drugs in the established drug classes are presented. The new drug classes of entry inhibitors (including co-receptor binding inhibitors and fusion inhibitors), integrase inhibitors and other novel drug classes under development are described and relevant pediatric studies are reviewed. Work on novel drug delivery systems with potential to enhance adherence, improve drug exposure and reduce side-effects are discussed. CONCLUSION: The established benefits of ARV therapy in children of all ages can be enhanced by appropriate pharmacokinetic data on established antiretroviral agents and child-friendly drug formulations. Besides new suppressive treatment options in treatment experienced patients with multi-class resistant virus the new drug classes provide potential for novel means of disease modification and reduction of vertical transmission. Novel drug classes and delivery systems in development provide potential for further reduction in vertical transmission of HIV, rapid virological suppression and improved neurological outcomes in children and adults.",

        "abstract": "Ocular drug delivery remains challenging because of the complex nature and structure of the eye. Conventional systems, such as eye drops and ointments, are inefficient, whereas systemic administration requires high doses resulting in significant toxicity. There is a need to develop novel drug delivery carriers capable of increasing ocular bioavailability and decreasing both local and systemic cytotoxicity. Nanotechnology is expected to revolutionize ocular drug delivery. Many nano-structured systems have been employed for ocular drug delivery and yielded some promising results. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have been looked at as a potential drug carrier system since the 1990s. SLNs do not show biotoxicity as they are prepared from physiological lipids. SLNs are especially useful in ocular drug delivery as they can enhance the corneal absorption of drugs and improve the ocular bioavailability of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. SLNs have another advantage of allowing autoclave sterilization, a necessary step towards formulation of ocular preparations. This review outlines in detail the various production, characterization, sterilization, and stabilization techniques for SLNs. In-vitro and in-vivo methods to study the drug release profile of SLNs have been explained. Special attention has been given to the nature of lipids and surfactants commonly used for SLN production. A summary of previous studies involving the use of SLNs in ocular drug delivery is provided, along with a critical evaluation of SLNs as a potential ocular delivery system.",

        "abstract": "Overexpression of oncomiR-21 has been observed in most cancer types, such as leukemia. This miR has been implicated in a number of cellular processes, including chemoresistance, possibly by directly modulating the expression of several apoptotic related proteins. It was recently shown to directly target Bcl-2 mRNA and upregulate Bcl-2 protein expression. Nevertheless, the possible effect of miR-21 in autophagy has never been addressed. This study investigates the effects of targeting miR-21 with antimiRs on chronic myeloid leukemia cellular autophagy and on associated drug sensitivity. We observed that miR-21 downregulation decreased cellular viability and proliferation, although no changes to the normal cell cycle profile were observed. miR-21 downregulation also caused increased programmed cell death and a decrease in the expression levels of Bcl-2 protein, although PARP cleavage was not affected, indicating that apoptosis was not the relevant mechanism underlying the observed results. Treatment with antimiR-21 caused an increase in the autophagy related proteins Beclin-1, Vps34 and LC3-II. Accordingly, autophagic vacuoles were visualized both by monodansylcadaverine (MDC) and acridine orange (AO) staining and also by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, miR-21 downregulation increased K562 and KYO-1 cellular sensitivity to etoposide or doxorubicin. This chemosensitivity was reverted by pre-treating cells with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor. Finally, serum starvation (an autophagy inducer) also increased sensitivity to these drugs, confirming that autophagy sensitized these cells to the effect of these drugs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of autophagy induction via miR-21 targeting and its involvement in drug sensitivity.",

Thus it is important to develop new drug delivery devices to achieve pulsed delivery of a certain amount of drugs in order to mimic the function of the living systems, while minimizing undesired side-effects. Pulsatile delivery, which is meant as the liberation of drugs following programmed lag phases, has drawn increasing interest, especially in view of emerging chronotherapeutic approaches.

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate anxiety-related psychological risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, perceived uncontrollability, emotional avoidance) and their relation to drug of choice and addiction severity in an inpatient residential substance abuse population. Fully detoxified veterans (N=94) meeting criteria for Axis I substance abuse disorders were enrolled in a 28-day residential substance abuse treatment program and completed the following measures at intake and discharge: Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; intake only), and the Anxiety Control Questionnaire (ACQ). Consistent with the expectation, veterans who reported more distress over bodily sensations (anxiety sensitivity, BSQ) and depressive symptoms (BDI) were more likely to avoid experiencing negative affect (AAQ) and perceived themselves as lacking in control (ACQ). Further, extent of avoidance, and to a lesser extent, controllability, discriminated between participants as a function of primary and comorbid diagnostic status, whereas anxiety sensitivity did not. No relation was found between anxiety sensitivity and drug of choice, and relations between assessed psychological factors and domains of addiction severity were mixed. Findings suggest that heightened bodily sensitivity, emotional avoidance, and perceived uncontrollability are common sequelae of patients seeking residential substance abuse treatment, but they do not contribute uniquely to drug of choice and measures of addiction severity. Theoretical and treatment implications are discussed with particular emphasis on approaches that may increase coping with untoward bodily cues, decrease avoidance of negative affect, and improve patient's sense of personal control over their responses and the environment. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The therapeutic index (TI) - which is typically considered as the ratio of the highest exposure to the drug that results in no toxicity to the exposure that produces the desired efficacy - is an important parameter in efforts to achieve this balance. Various types of safety and efficacy data are generated in vitro and in vivo (in animals and in humans), and these data can be used to predict the clinical TI of a drug candidate at an early stage. However, approaches to systematically and quantitatively compare these types of data and to apply this knowledge more effectively are needed. This article critically discusses the various aspects of TI determination and interpretation in drug development for both small molecule drugs and biotherapeutics.",

        "abstract": "The history of United States drug policy is complex, ranging from laissez-faire to strict prohibition. In recent years, there has been little federal interest in drug policy reform and a continuing focus on a prohibitionist deterrence approach. During this period, state initiatives have been in the forefront of drug policy experimentation via ballot initiatives, legislative actions, or judicial and administrative policy decisions. The resulting state-level drug policy landscape includes continued prohibition as well as harm reduction, medicalization, and decriminalization. In addition, there has been considerable state-level policy focus on substance abuse treatment quality. With a new presidential administration, there is some indication that drug policy reform may be a national issue as part of the federal health reform agenda. The authors hope that the results of state policy experiments that provide evidence for the viability of harm reduction, quality treatment, and related approaches can be a viable part of the national policy discussion.",

        "abstract": "Hypokalaemia (defined as a plasma potassium concentration<3.5 mEq/L) is a common electrolyte abnormality in clinical practice. Drugs are a common cause of either asymptomatic or symptomatic hypokalaemia. Drug-induced hypokalaemia is an important problem particularly in the elderly and in patients with cardiovascular, renal or hepatic disease. Hypokalaemia can complicate the use of the drug in the therapeutic concentration range, and can also be precipitated with overdose or conditions leading to drug intoxication. Because the etiologies of hypokalaemia are numerous, the diagnosis of drug-induced hypokalaemia may be overlooked. Physicians should always pay close attention to this common side effect. Evaluation and management of a hypokalaemic patient should include a careful review of medications history to determine if a drug capable of causing or aggravating this electrolyte abnormality is present.",

        "abstract": "Expression of voltage-gated K channel, shaker-related subfamily, member 5 (KCNA5) underlies the human atrial ultra-rapid delayed rectifier K current (I(Kur)). The KCNA5 polymorphism resulting in P532L in the C terminus generates I(Kur) that is indistinguishable from wild type at baseline but strikingly resistant to drug block. In the present study, truncating the C terminus of KCNA5 generated a channel with wild-type drug sensitivity, which indicated that P532 is not a drug-binding site. Secondary structure prediction algorithms identified a probable alpha-helix in P532L that is absent in wild-type channels. We therefore assessed drug sensitivity of I(Kur) generated in vitro in CHO and HEK cells by channels predicted to exhibit or lack this C-terminal alpha-helix. All constructs displayed near-identical I(Kur) in the absence of drug challenge. However, those predicted to lack the C-terminal alpha-helix generated quinidine-sensitive currents (43-51% block by 10 microM quinidine), while the currents generated by those constructs predicted to generate a C-terminal alpha-helix were inhibited less than 12%. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed an alpha-helical signature with peptides derived from drug-resistant channels and no organized structure in those associated with wild-type drug sensitivity. In conclusion, we found that this secondary structure in the KCNA5 C terminus, absent in wild-type channels but generated by a naturally occurring DNA polymorphism, does not alter baseline currents but renders the channel drug resistant. Our data support a model in which this structure impairs access of the drug to a pore-binding site.",

        "abstract": "Membrane transporter proteins may influence the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs that can be recognized as substrates. The purpose of this study was to identify proteins that play a key role in the drug sensitivity of stomach and breast cancer cell lines by measuring the absolute protein expression levels of multiple transporters and other membrane proteins and examining their correlation to drug sensitivity. Absolute protein expression levels of 90 membrane proteins were examined by quantitative targeted absolute proteomics using liquid chromatography-linked tandem mass spectrometry. Among them, 11 and 14 membrane proteins, including transporters, were present in quantifiable amounts in membrane fraction of stomach cancer and breast cancer cell lines, respectively. In stomach cancer cell lines, the protein expression level of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) was inversely correlated with etoposide sensitivity. MK571, an MRP inhibitor, increased both the cell-to-medium ratio of etoposide and the etoposide sensitivity of MRP1-expressing stomach cancer cell lines. In breast cancer cell lines, the protein expression level of reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) was directly correlated with methotrexate (MTX) sensitivity. Initial uptake rate and steady-state cell-to-medium ratio of [(3)H]MTX were correlated with both RFC1 expression level and MTX sensitivity. These results suggest that MRP1 modulates the etoposide sensitivity of stomach cancer cell lines and RFC1 modulates the MTX sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines. Our results indicate that absolute quantification of multiple membrane proteins could be a useful strategy for identification of candidate proteins involved in drug sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions appear during the clinical use of a drug and constitute a health problem, as they are an important cause of patient morbidity and mortality. In addition, they constitute a major drawback for drug development. Intolerance processes occurring after administration of low drug doses are known as idiosyncratic reactions or as hypersensitivity reactions; the most commonly accepted mechanism for immunological activation is the hapten hypothesis. Most drugs are not reactive per se towards proteins, hence in a number of cases bioactivation seems to be a prerequisite for adduct formation and the subsequent hypersensitivity reaction. Although biotransformation is normally associated with a decreased toxicity, metabolites are sometimes more toxic and reactive than the parent drug. Drug metabolizing enzymes develop their activities especially in liver, where reactive metabolites bind to proteins inducing hepatotoxicity, whereas in skin keratinocytes exhibit the highest biotransformation capability. In the present review, some specific examples of the toxicological consequences of drug biotransformation are given. They include nimesulide, metamizol, celecoxib, paracetamol, dapsone, sulfamethoxazole, amodiaquine, nevirapine, troglitazone, zileuton, felbamate, panadiplon, benzbromarone, fipexide and flutamide. In general, these examples are taken from the recent scientific literature, mostly published during the last decade.",

Genomic features of individual tumours contribute significantly to such clinical responses, and these seem to vary tremendously across patients. Additional factors, including pharmacogenomics, the tumour microenvironment and rapidly acquired drug resistance, also contribute to the clinical sensitivity of various cancers, and should be considered and applied in the development and use of new kinase inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: For the elimination of environmental chemicals and metabolic waste products, the body is equipped with a range of broad specificity transporters that are present in excretory organs as well as in several epithelial blood-tissue barriers. Areas covered: ABCC2 and ABCC3 (also known as MRP2 and MRP3) mediate the transport of various conjugated organic anions, including many drugs, toxicants and endogenous compounds. This review focuses on the physiology of these transporters, their roles in drug disposition and how they affect drug sensitivity and toxicity. It also examines how ABCC2 and ABCC3 are coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level by members of the nuclear receptor (NR) family of ligand-modulated transcription factors and how this can be therapeutically exploited. Expert opinion: Mutations in both ABCC2 and ABCC3 have been associated with changes in drug disposition, sensitivity and toxicity. A defect in ABCC2 is associated with Dubin-Johnson syndrome, a recessively inherited disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Pharmacological manipulation of the activity of these transporters can potentially improve the pharmacokinetics and thus therapeutic activity of substrate drugs but also affect the physiological function of these transporters and consequently ameliorate associated disease states.",

Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained. The study collectively consisted of 83 patients (76 males, 7 females, 16-45 years) suspected of having incorporated cocaine drug containers. All underwent radiological imaging; a total of 135 exams were performed: nCT = 35, nDR = 70, nLSDR = 30. An overall calculation of all \"drug mules\" and a specific evaluation of body packers, pushers and stuffers were performed. The gold standard was stool examination in a dedicated holding cell equipped with a drug toilet. Results: There were 54 drug mules identified in this study. CT of all drug carriers showed the highest diagnostic accuracy 97.1%, sensitivity 100% and specificity 94.1%. DR in all cases was 71.4% accurate, 58.3% sensitive and 85.3% specific. LSDR of all patients with internal cocaine was 60% accurate, 57.9% sensitive and 63.4% specific. Conclusions: CT was the most accurate test studied. Therefore, the detection of internal cocaine drug packs should be performed by CT, rather than by conventional X-ray, in order to apply the most sensitive exam in the medico-legal investigation of suspected drug carriers. Nevertheless, the higher radiation applied by CT than by DR or LSDR needs to be considered. Future studies should include evaluation of low dose CT protocols in order to address germane issues and to reduce dosage. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Drug interactions in patients receiving multiple drug regimens are a constant concern for the clinician. With the increased availability of new drugs and their concomitant use with other drugs, there has been a rise in the potential for adverse drug interactions as demonstrated by the recent withdrawals of newly marketed drugs because of unacceptable interaction profiles. Therefore, the interaction potential of a new compound has to be assessed in detail, starting with preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies at candidate selection and continuously followed up through preclinical and clinical development. Since formal in vivo studies of all possible drug interactions are neither practicable nor suggestive, a careful selection of a limited number of drug combinations to be investigated in vivo during the development phase is indicated. Based on knowledge of pharmacokinetic and biopharmaceutical properties, a well balanced link between in vitro investigations and carefully selected in vivo interaction studies allows full assessment of the potential of a new drug to cause clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions, prediction of a lack of interactions and derivation of the proper dose recommendations. Clinical pharmacology plays a number of key roles within the process of collecting information on drug interactions during preclinical and clinical development: addressing issues and/or favourable properties to be expected, thus contributing to the scientific assessment of development potential; setting up a rational in vivo drug-drug interaction programme; performing early mechanistic studies to link in vitro with in vivo information (employing \u2018cocktail\u2019 approaches if possible); reviewing co-medication sections for clinical trials; and conducting labelling-oriented interaction studies after proof of concept. The fact that interactions can occur between various active substances should by itself be a conclusive argument against unnecessary polypharmacy. Prescribing fewer drugs on a rational basis can reduce the risk of adverse effects secondary to drug interactions and may help to improve the quality of drug treatment and to save costs.",

        "abstract": "In the last decades, advances in molecular biology have led to modern pharmacogenetics, which started as a science that focused on investigating drug metabolising enzymes and genetic determinants of pharmacokinetic variability. As more evidence has become available on the structure of drug targets and the genes coding for them, increasing attention has been directed towards pharmacodynamic explanations of variability in therapeutic response as well as in the risk for adverse drug reactions. Traditionally, genetic drug safety research has focused on variations in single genes whose functions are known to be related to given adverse drug reactions. A few such examples, malignant hyperthermia, the long QT syndrome, venous thromboembolic disease, tardive dyskinesia, and drug addiction, are presented in this article. In the future, results from the Human Genome Project together with tools such as DNA microarray technology, high-output screening systems and advanced bioinformatics, will permit a more thorough elucidation than is currently possible of the genetic components of adverse drug reactions. By screening for a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SNP patterns associated with adverse drug reactions can be discovered even though the functions of the SNPs as such are completely unknown. On the basis of these findings, it can be expected that pharmacogenetic research will identify situations where a drug should be avoided in certain individuals in order to reduce the risk for adverse drug reactions. If so, it will be feasible to use molecular diagnostics to select drugs that are safe for the individual patient",

This review will include current mass spectrometric techniques and applications in drug discovery, as well as future prospects.",

Drug-induced hair loss is usually completely reversible and is, in most cases, a consequence of a toxic effect of the drug on the hair follicle matrix. In rare cases alopecia may be permanent. Depending on type of drug, dosage and patient susceptibility, hair loss presents as telogen effluvium, anagen effluvium or both. Telogen effluvium is also commonly observed after discontinuation of drugs that prolong anagen, such as topical minoxidil and oral contraceptives. Although a large number of drugs have been occasionally reported to produce hair loss, only for a few drugs the relation between drug intake and hair loss has been proven.",

        "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions account for between 2 to 5% of all hospital admissions and can prevent the administration of an otherwise effective therapeutic agent. Hypersensitivity or immune-mediated reactions, although less common, tend to be proportionately more serious. There is convincing evidence to implicate the immune system in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions. Our understanding of the way in which the immune system recognises drugs is based on the hapten hypothesis; the onset of hypersensitivity involves drug bioactivation, covalent binding to proteins, followed by uptake, antigen processing and T cell proliferation. Central to this hypothesis is the critical role of drug metabolism, with the balance between metabolic bioactivation and detoxification being one important component of individual susceptibility. The purpose of this review is to classify drug hypersensitivity reactions in terms of their clinical presentation, and also to consider recent advances in our understanding of the chemical, biochemical and, in particular, cellular immunological mechanisms of hypersensitivity. The following topics are reviewed: (i) drug disposition and cellular metabolism; (ii) mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation; (iii) the role of cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules in the induction and maintenance of a polarised immune response; and (iv) the application of the hapten hypothesis, danger hypothesis and serial triggering model to drug hypersensitivity. A greater understanding of the mechanism(s) of hypersensitivity may identify novel therapeutic strategies and help to combat one of the more severe forms of adverse reactions to drugs.

        "abstract": "The requirements for a cell surface molecule to be suitable as an antibody-drug conjugate target are stringent. The notion that antibodies-directed toward targets on the surface of malignant cells could be used for drug delivery is not new. The history of antibody-drug conjugates has been marked by hurdles identified and overcome. Early conjugates used mouse antibodies, drugs that were either not sufficiently potent, were immunogenic (proteins) or were too toxic and linkers that were not sufficiently stable in circulation. Three main avenues have been explored using antibodies to target cytotoxic species to malignant cells, antibody-protein toxin conjugates (or antibody fragment-protein toxin fusion proteins), antibody-small molecule drug conjugates and antibody-enzyme conjugates administered along with small molecule prodrugs requiring metabolism by the conjugated enzyme to release the activate species. This review focuses on cell surface proteins that have been targeted primarily by antibody-small molecule drug conjugates and briefly discusses 34 targets being investigated. While only one antibody-drug conjugate has reached regulatory approval, there are nearly 20 of these in clinical trial. The time may have come for this technology to become a major contributor to improving treatment for cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Despite the availability of the BCG vaccine and chemotherapy, tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading infectious killer worldwide. The recent rise of TB and especially the alarming increase of drug-resistant TB call for urgent need to develop new anti-TB drugs. Lengthy chemotherapy and increasing emergence of drug-resistant strains pose a significant problem for effective control. The need for a lengthy TB therapy is a consequence of the presence of persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, not effectively killed by current anti-TB agents. A list of new drug candidates along with proposed targets for intervention is described. Recent advances in the knowledge of the biology of the organism and the availability of the genome sequence provide a wide range of novel targets for drug design. Gene products involved in controlling vital aspects of mycobacterial metabolism, persistence, virulence and cell wall synthesis would be attractive targets. It is expected that the application of functional genomics tools, such as microarray and proteomics, in combination with modern approaches, such as structure-based drug design and combinatorial chemistry to biology-based targets, will lead to the development of new drugs that are not only active against drug-resistant TB but also can shorten the course of TB therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Relative preference for smaller, sooner rewards over larger, later rewards (\"delay discounting\") is increased by acute ethanol. Additionally, drug-na??ve levels of delay discounting can predict subsequent ethanol consumption. However, it is unknown whether these phenomena are driven by a difference in sensitivity to the reinforcer delay or a difference in sensitivity to the reinforcer magnitude, because typical delay discounting tasks manipulate both parameters simultaneously. Methods: To disambiguate these factors, two tasks were developed in which animals chose between levers with either different delay contingencies (adjusting delay task) or different magnitude contingencies (adjusting magnitude task). When task performance was stable, rats received ethanol (0, 0.6, and 0.9. g/kg, i.p.). Results: Ethanol did not affect sensitivity to delay or sensitivity to magnitude. However, responding was suppressed at the highest dose of ethanol (0.9. g/kg). Less suppression was found in animals exhibiting high levels of drug-na??ve sensitivity to delay. Conclusion: Thus, this study suggests that ethanol's effect on standard delay discounting tasks is not due to an alteration in sensitivity to delay or magnitude. Additionally, these data show that animals with high sensitivity to delay are resistant to the behaviorally suppressant effects of ethanol, which suggests that low tolerance for delayed rewards and low sensitivity to the behaviorally suppressant effects of ethanol may partly be driven by the same underlying mechanism. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Complex interactions exist amongst the various components of the neuroendocrine system in order to maintain homeostasis, energy balance and reproductive function. These components include the hypothalamus-pituitary- adrenal and -gonadal axes, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the sympathetic nervous system and the pancreatic islets. These hormones, peptides and neurotransmitters act in concert to regulate the functions of many organs, notably the liver, muscles, kidneys, thyroid, bone, adrenal glands, adipocytes, vasculature, intestinal tract and gonads, through many intermediary pathways. Endocrine and metabolic disorders can arise from imbalance amongst numerous hormonal factors. These disturbances may be due to endogenous processes, such as increased secretion of hormones from a tumour, as well as exogenous drug administration. Drugs can cause endocrine abnormalities via different mechanisms, including direct alteration of hormone production, changes in the regulation of the hormonal axis, effects on hormonal transport, binding, and signalling, as well as similar changes to counter-regulatory hormone systems. Furthermore, drugs can affect the evaluation of endocrine parameters by causing interference with diagnostic tests. Common drug-induced endocrine and metabolic disorders include disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, electrolyte and calcium abnormalities, as well as drug-induced thyroid and gonadal disorders. An understanding of the proposed mechanisms of these drug effects and their evaluation and differential diagnosis may allow for more critical interpretation of the clinical observations associated with such disorders, better prediction of drug-induced adverse effects and better choices of and rationales for treatment.",

        "abstract": "Colon targeted drug delivery has the potential to deliver bioactive agents for the treatment of a variety of colonic diseases and to deliver proteins and peptides to the colon for their systemic absorption. Various strategies, currently available to target the release of drugs to colon, include formation of prodrug, coating of pH-sensitive polymers, use of colon-specific biodegradable polymers, timed released systems, osmotic systems, and pressure controlled drug delivery systems. Among the different approaches to achieve targeted drug release to the colon, the use of polymers especially biodegradable by colonic bacteria holds great promise. Polysaccharidases are bacterial enzymes that are available in sufficient quantity to be exploited in colon targeting of drugs. Based on this approach, various polysaccharides have been investigated for colon-specific drug release. These polysaccharides include pectin, guar gum, amylose, inulin, dextran, chitosan, and chondroitin sulphate. This family of natural polymers has an appeal to drug delivery as it is comprised of polymers with a large number of derivatizable groups, a wide range of molecular weights, varying chemical compositions, and, for the most part, low toxicity and biodegradability yet high stability. The most favorable property of these materials is their approval as pharmaceutical excipients.",

        "abstract": "The concept of surveillance in pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology has evolved from the concept of surveillance in epidemiology, particularly of infectious diseases. We have surveyed the etymology, usages, and previous definitions of 'surveillance' and its modifiers, such as 'active' and 'passive'. The following essential definitional features of surveillance emerge: (i) surveillance and monitoring are different--surveillance involves populations, while monitoring involves individuals; (ii) surveillance can be performed repeatedly and at any time during the lifetime of a medicinal product or device; (iii) although itself non-interventional, it can adduce any types of evidence (interventional, observational, or anecdotal, potentially at different times); (iv) it encompasses data collection, management, analysis, and interpretation; (v) it includes actions to be taken after signal detection, including initial evaluation and communication; and (vi) it should contribute to the classification of adverse reactions and their prevention or mitigation and/or to the harnessing of beneficial effects. We conclude that qualifiers add ambiguity and uncertainty without enhancing the idea of surveillance. We propose the following definition of surveillance of health-care products, which embraces all the surveyed ideas and reflects real-world pharmacovigilance processes: 'a form of non-interventional public health research, consisting of a set of processes for the continued systematic collection, compilation, interrogation, analysis, and interpretation of data on benefits and harms (including relevant spontaneous reports, electronic medical records, and experimental data).' As a codicil, we note that the purposes of surveillance are to identify, evaluate, understand, and communicate previously unknown effects of health-care products, or new aspects of known effects, in order to harness such effects (if beneficial) or prevent or mitigate them (if harmful).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Many drugs that are used to treat children are either not licensed for use in paediatric patients (unlicensed) or prescribed outside the terms of the product licence (off label). The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of such drugs is yet to be established. This study investigates, for the first time in a German patient population, the impact of unlicensed and off-label drug use on ADRs in paediatric patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An 8-month prospective pharmacoepidemiological cohort-based survey was conducted on a ten-bed paediatric isolation ward at the University Hospital Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. All patients were intensively monitored for ADRs by a pharmacoepidemiological team. ADRs were characterised according to international classification methods. All drug prescriptions were evaluated retrospectively as to unlicensed or off-label use on the basis of the product information. RESULTS: A total of 178 patients were included in the study and 740 drug prescriptions were given to 156 patients (median three prescriptions per patient). In 198 cases (27.7% of all prescriptions) drugs were used in either an unlicensed (n = 3) or off-label (n = 195) manner. A total of 46 ADRs were observed in 31 patients (17.4%). Patients receiving at least one unlicensed or off-label drug prescription during hospitalisation (n = 92) experienced an ADR significantly more frequently (n = 26 patients) than patients receiving only licensed drugs (n = 64 vs 5 patients). ADRs were associated with 29 (5.6%) of the 517 licensed drug prescriptions and with 12 (6.1%) of the 198 unlicensed or off-label drug prescriptions. The majority of ADRs caused by unlicensed and off-label drug use were recognised by the attending physician. However, statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in the number of licensed and unlicensed/off-label drug prescriptions causing ADRs. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that at a paediatric isolation ward the incidence of ADRs caused by unlicensed or off-label drug use was not significantly more than that caused by the licensed drug use. However, patients treated with unlicensed or off-label drugs were shown to possess a significantly increased risk for developing ADRs.",

        "abstract": "Until recently, the drug treatment of epilepsy has been empirical. However, in recent years as a result of improved understanding of seizure neurochemistry and mechanisms of action of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), drug treatment has become somewhat more rational. Nevertheless, it is currently impossible to predict which patient will respond to a particular AED, and which patient will experience adverse drug effects. The only practical way to determine whether a patient will find a drug useful is to try it. The discovery of genetic polymorphism in drug metabolism has contributed significantly to understanding of the variability in dose-concentration relationships, susceptibility to adverse effects, and susceptibility to seizure intractability. The discovery that predisposition to seizure intractability and expression of brain neuromolecules consequent to seizures is under genetic control may allow a more rational approach to AED choice. In the future, treatment may be guided by a series of pharmacogenetic tests, which would serve not only to choose the most appropriate AED (in terms of efficacy and adverse effects) but also to monitor the antiepileptogenic and the evolution status of the disease.",

Most of the clinically important drug-drug interactions of anti-diabetic agents are related to their metabolic pathways, but drugs that compete for renal excretion or impair renal status can also play an important role. In this review, we have examined the clinical implications and underlying mechanisms of drugs that are likely to alter the pharmacologic response of or cause adverse events with antidiabetic drugs, and we have outlined safe and efficacious treatment modalities.",

This review examines the clinical signatures of this problem, signals predictive of its occurrence (particularly of more frequent, reversible, low-grade injury) and the role of monitoring in prevention by examining several recent examples (for example, troglitazone). In addition, the failure of preclinical toxicology to predict idiosyncratic reactions, and what can be done to improve this problem, is discussed. Finally, our current understanding of the pathophysiology of experimental drug hepatotoxicity is examined, focusing on acetaminophen, particularly with respect to the role of the innate immune system and control of cell-death pathways, which might provide targets for exploration and identification of risk factors and mechanisms in humans.",

The leading causes of irreversible blindness in the elderly--age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma--will continue to effect more individuals as the worldwide population continues to age. Although there are therapies for treating glaucoma, as well as ongoing clinical trials of treatments for age-related macular degeneration, there still is a great need for more efficacious treatments that halt or even reverse ocular diseases. The eye has special attributes that allow local drug delivery and non-invasive clinical assessment of disease, but it is also a highly complex and unique organ, which makes understanding disease pathogenesis and ocular drug discovery challenging. As we learn more about the cellular mechanisms involved in age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, potentially, new drug targets will emerge.

Pregnant women enrolled in a comprehensive treatment program with drug-free (n=85) or drug-using (n=82) male sexual partners completed a relationship survey and were compared on partner and psychosocial variables. Compared with male drug-free partners, male drug-using partners had more unemployment and more current legal involvement, less education, were less likely to be supportive of the pregnant woman's recovery efforts and were more likely to give them money to buy drugs. Male drug-free partners also had fewer medical, dental, legal and transportation needs than male drug-using partners. Data from treatment retention suggests that women with male drug-using partners are retained in a comprehensive treatment for a shorter time than women with male drug-free partners. A male partner's drug-using status should be considered when treating pregnant drug dependent women. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Currently, there is a need to assess the clinical consequences of low-frequency drug resistant variants occurring below the detection limit of conventional genotyping. Sensitive detection of drug-resistant subpopulations, however, requires simple and practical methods for routine testing.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY: We developed highly-sensitive and simple real-time PCR assays for nine key drug resistance mutations and show that these tests overcome substantial sequence heterogeneity in HIV-1 clinical specimens. We specifically used early wildtype virus samples from the pre-antiretroviral drug era to measure background reactivity and were able to define highly-specific screening cut-offs that are up to 67-fold more sensitive than conventional genotyping. We also demonstrate that sequencing the mutation-specific PCR products provided a direct and novel strategy to further detect and link associated resistance mutations, allowing easy identification of multi-drug-resistant variants. Resistance mutation associations revealed in mutation-specific amplicon sequences were verified by clonal sequencing.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE: Combined, sensitive real-time PCR testing and mutation-specific amplicon sequencing provides a powerful and simple approach that allows for improved detection and evaluation of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations.",

However, the cochlea is a particularly challenging target for drug therapy, and new technologies will be required to provide safe and efficacious delivery of these compounds. Emerging delivery systems based on microfluidic technologies are showing promise as a means for direct intracochlear delivery. Ultimately, these systems may serve as a means for extended delivery of regenerative compounds to restore hearing in patients suffering from a host of auditory diseases. Areas covered: Recent progress in the development of drug delivery systems capable of direct intracochlear delivery is reviewed, including passive systems such as osmotic pumps, active microfluidic devices and systems combined with currently available devices such as cochlear implants. The aim of this article is to provide a concise review of intracochlear drug delivery systems currently under development and ultimately capable of being combined with emerging therapeutic compounds for the treatment of inner ear diseases. Expert opinion: Safe and efficacious treatment of auditory diseases will require the development of microscale delivery devices, capable of extended operation and direct application to the inner ear. These advances will require miniaturization and integration of multiple functions, including drug storage, delivery, power management and sensing, ultimately enabling closed-loop control and timed-sequence delivery devices for treatment of these diseases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: N-acetyltransferases (NAT) and glutathione S-transferases (GST) are involved in the metabolism of several ubiquitous chemical substances leading to the activation and detoxification of carcinogenic heterocyclic and aromatic amines. Since polymorphisms within these genes are described to influence the metabolism of ubiquitous chemicals, we conducted the present study to determine if individuals with self-reported chemical-related sensitivity differed from controls without self-reported chemical-related sensitivity with regard to the distribution of genotype frequencies of NAT2, GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms. METHODS: Out of 800 subjects who answered a questionnaire of ten items with regard to their severity of chemical sensitivity 521 unrelated individuals agreed to participate in the study. Subsequently, genetic variants of the NAT2, GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 genes were analyzed. RESULTS: The results show significant differences between individuals with and without self-reported chemical-related sensitivity with regard to the distribution of NAT2, GSTM1, and GSTT1 gene variants. Cases with self-reported chemical-related sensitivity were significantly more frequently NAT2 slow acetylators (controlled OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.27-2.59, P = 0.001). GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes were significantly more often homozygously deleted in those individuals reporting sensitivity to chemicals compared to controls (GSTM1: controlled OR 2.08, 95% CI = 1.46-2.96, P = 0.0001; GSTT1: controlled OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.65-4.75, P = 0.0001). Effects for GSTP1 gene variants were observed in conjunction with GSTM1, GSTT1 and NAT2 gene. CONCLUSION: The results from our study population show that individuals being slow acetylators and/or harbouring a homozygous GSTM1 and/or GSTT1 deletion reported chemical-related hypersensitivity more frequently.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of short-term immunotherapy with molecular standardized allergens (STI) has been demonstrated by double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials. The aim of this study was to compare STI with symptomatic drug treatment. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with rhinoconjunctivitis to grass and/or rye pollen were treated either with STI (ALK\n                        7, n = 24) plus anti-allergic drugs or anti-allergic drugs, alone (n = 24) in a prospective, randomized study. Symptoms and use of drugs were reported in patient diaries and titrated nasal provocation and skin prick tests were performed at baseline, before, and after season. RESULTS: Median overall symptom (P = 0.022, U test) and medication scores (P = 0.003) were significantly lower in the STI group, as was the result for a simultaneous analysis of conjunctival, nasal, and bronchial symptom scores and medication (P = 0.005). Sensitivity in the nasal provocation test decreased in the STI group but not in the drug-treated group. These differences became significant directly after STI (P = 0.027) as well as after the grass pollen season (P < 0.001). Skin sensitivity did not change in the STI group but increased in the drug-treated group after season, with a significant difference between the two groups for the erythema (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: STI reduces grass pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and drug use, and specific nasal reactivity and skin sensitivity, more efficiently than a standard symptomatic treatment. ?? 2005 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, Inc.

Unfortunately, there is a paucity of literature describing clinically significant drug-drug interactions occurring in the intensive care unit (ICU). Knowing the clinically significant drug-drug interactions allows the opportunity for prevention through knowledge and computer-assisted programmes. OBJECTIVE: To identify significant potential drug-drug interactions occurring in the cardiovascular ICU (CCU) and the cardiothoracic ICU (CTICU). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational study conducted over a total of 8 weeks in February and March 2009. SETTING: CCU and CTICU in a major academic medical centre (Presbyterian Hospital, University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre). PATIENTS: All adult patients (>or=18 years of age) admitted during 1 month in each ICU. INTERVENTION: Micromedex and Lexi-Interact interaction databases were used to screen each patient's medication profile daily for the presence of potentially interacting drug pairs that would be considered a potential drug-drug interaction. A severity assessment using these databases was completed after a potential drug-drug interaction was identified. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: The frequency of significant drug-drug interactions, including those that were considered major or contraindicated, according to two commercially available interaction databases. RESULTS: Evaluations of 400 patient medication profiles were conducted, resulting in 225 profiles possessing one or more potential drug-drug interactions. A total of 1150 potential interactions were identified, resulting in 287.5 potential interactions per 100 patient-days. Of the 1150 potential drug-drug interactions, 458 were unique interacting drug pairs; 5-9% of the potential interactions were considered major or contraindicated. Many of the significant and frequent potential interactions involved blood coagulation modifiers, potential interactions that could result in QTc prolongation, and cytochrome P450 inhibition. Micromedex and Lexi-Interact agreed on the severity ratings in 20.5% of the potential interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Significant potential drug-drug interactions occur in the CCU and CTICU, highlighting the need for active surveillance to potentially prevent patient harm. Clinicians should also consider using two references for identifying interactions, due to the lack of congruence between sources.",

Methods: This study is a secondary analysis using baseline data from a randomized trial of brief intervention for drug misuse, in which 360 adults with moderate-risk drug use were recruited from two community clinics in New Mexico, USA. The current study compared self-reported drug use on the ASSIST with laboratory analysis of hair samples using a standard commercially available 5-panel test with assay screening and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) confirmation. Both self-report and hair testing covered a 3-month period. Results: Overall concordance between hair testing and self-report was 57.5% (marijuana), 86.5% (cocaine), 85.8% (amphetamines), and 74.3% (opioids). Specificity of hair testing at standard laboratory cut-offs exceeded 90% for all drugs, but sensitivity of hair testing relative to self-report was low, identifying only 52.3% (127/243) of self-disclosed marijuana users, 65.2% (30/46) of cocaine users, 24.2% (8/33) of amphetamine users, and 2.9% (2/68) of opioid users. Among participants who disclosed using marijuana or cocaine in the past 3 months, participants with a negative hair test tended to report lower-frequency use of those drugs (p<. .001 for marijuana and cocaine). Conclusions: Hair testing can be useful in studies with moderate-risk drug users, but the potential for under-identification of low-frequency use suggests that researchers should consider employing low detection cut-offs and using hair testing in conjunction with self-report. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

Three expert workgroups were assembled to address the goals of the conference. The Evidence Workgroup consisted of 18 individuals with expertise in pharmacology, drug information, biomedical informatics, and clinical decision support. Workgroup members met via webinar 12 times from January 2013 to February 2014. Two in-person meetings were conducted in May and September 2013 to reach consensus on recommendations.\\n\\nRESULTS: We developed expert consensus answers to the following three key questions.

Syringe surveillance for HIV yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 89%, respectively, and provided a reasonable estimate of the prevalence of HIV among participants.

        "abstract": "For pediatric cancers like neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor of infancy, p53 mutations are rare at diagnosis, but may be acquired after chemotherapy, suggesting a potential role in drug resistance. Heavy metal-selected neuroblastoma cells were found to acquire an unusually broad multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype but displayed no alterations in genes associated with \"classic\" MDR. These cells had acquired a mutant p53 gene, linking p53 to drug sensitivity in neuroblastoma. We therefore generated p53-deficient variants in neuroblastoma cell lines with wild-type p53 by transduction of p53-suppressive constructs encoding either short hairpin RNA or a dominant-negative p53 mutant. Analysis of these cells indicated that (a) in contrast to previous reports, wild-type p53 was fully functional in all neuroblastoma lines tested; (b) inactivation of p53 in neuroblastoma cells resulted in establishment of a MDR phenotype; (c) p53-dependent senescence, the primary response of some neuroblastoma cells to DNA damage, is replaced after p53 inactivation by mitotic catastrophe and subsequent apoptosis; (d) knockdown of mutant p53 did not revert the MDR phenotype, suggesting it is determined by p53 inactivation rather than gain of mutant function. These results suggest the importance of p53 status as a prognostic marker of treatment response in neuroblastoma. p53 suppression may have opposite effects on drug sensitivity as determined by analysis of isogenic pairs of tumor cell lines of nonneuroblastoma origin, indicating the importance of tissue context for p53-mediated modulation of tumor cell sensitivity to treatment.",

        "abstract": "The stratum corneum forms the outermost layer of the skin and is essentially a multilamellar lipid milieu punctuated by protein-filled corneocytes that augment membrane integrity and significantly increase membrane tortuosity. The lipophilic character of the stratum corneum, coupled with its intrinsic tortuosity, ensure that it almost always provides the principal barrier to the entry of drug molecules into the organism; the only exceptions being highly lipophilic species which might encounter problems at the stratum corneum\u2013viable epidermis interface where they must partition into a predominantly aqueous environment. Drugs can be administered either as suspensions or as solutions and the formulation can range in complexity from a gel or an ointment to a multilayer transdermal patch. In this review we describe the theoretical principles used to describe transdermal release and we show that relatively simple membrane transport models based on the appropriate solution to Fick\u2019s second law of diffusion can be used to explain drug release kinetics into this complex biological membrane.",

The classical aspects of drug metabolism and disposition related to oral administration have been reviewed, but special emphasis has been given to intranasal, cutaneous, transdermal, and ocular administration as well as to the absorption and the subsequent bioavailability of drugs. Drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters present in extrahepatic tissues, such as nasal mucosa and the respiratory tract, have been particularly discussed. As marketed antiallergic drugs include both racemates and enantiomers, aspects of stereoselective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion have been discussed. Finally, a new and promising methodology, microdosing, has been presented, although it has not yet been applied to drugs used in the treatment of allergic diseases. \u00a9 2009 Informa UK Ltd.",

Studies are currently focusing on mechanism-based therapies to prevent or repair DNA damage to epithelial and submucosal cells and the cascade or events that follow to cause tissue damage or analgesics to ease the associated oral cavity pain. Therapeutic limitations also exist for the use of the highly effective antibiotic gentamicin, as it evokes acute renal failure. Mechanistic investigations have shed some light on potential targets: the kallikreins, peroxynitrite-related pathways, superoxide production and the accumulation of aminoglycosides. New antibiotic strategies for trachoma, the leading cause of preventable blindness, are also explored along with studies to aid the development of vaccine candidates. Finally, we discuss the utility of allosteric-potentiating ligands to modulate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, mimicking the reward/addictive effects of nicotine, as potential strategies for smoking cessation.",

Syringe surveillance for HIV yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 89%, respectively, and provided a reasonable estimate of the prevalence of HIV among participants.

        "abstract": "This chapter presents a brief overview of how new drug discovery projects begin, some of the science and business decisions that go into them, what types of projects researchers can expect to see, and how targets are identified and validated. Projects tend to have some commonalities that allow most of them to be divided up into several bins, if the bins are made large enough.. The term target validation can mean different things to different people. To a chemist proposing a new project it might refer to affirmative evidence from a mouse knockout or even just an RNA interference experiment in cells. To a clinician it probably means no less than proven statistically significant efficacy by a drug in large-scale, controlled human trials. Target validation, that is, systematically building up evidence that the interaction of a proposed target with an agent like a small molecule or a monoclonal antibody (mAB) can have a therapeutic effect in a human disease state, is often far from trivial. It represents an ongoing, labor-intensive process that can be rate-limiting, but is necessary to avoid disastrous losses in time, money, and manpower that occur when a clinical drug fails to work because its target is not at all crucial to disease progression or symptoms. Target identification, in this case the process whereby a new target is first proposed based on some minimal evidence, is less cumbersome but still requires devoted resources. The beauty of working on a project based upon an already established target is that both of these steps can be skipped.",

This study was undertaken to classify drug resistance and to detect different mechanisms of resistance to beta lactam antibiotics in gram positive and gram negative bacteria by single plate sensitivity testing. Method: The bacterial isolates were collected and all non-repeat resistant isolates were classified as Multi drug resistant (MDR), extensively drug resistant (XDR) and Pan drug resistant (PDR). Novel single plate sensitivity testing was done to detect extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), AmpC beta-lactamases (AmpC) and metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) among MDR, XDR and PDR isolates. Result: A total of 3176 clinical samples were obtained of which 472 and 756 were gram positive cocci (GPC) and gram negative bacilli (GNB) respectively. Among GPC 45% isolates were Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The percentage of MDR was high in both GPC and GNB isolates when compared to XDR and PDR. Among the MDR isolates of GNB, 64% were ESBL producers, 8% were AmpC producers and coexistence of both ESBL and AmpC was found in 5%. Amongst the XDR isolates, 49% were ESBL and 21% were AmpC producers, 2% were MBL producers and13% were both ESBL and AmpC positive. In PDR isolates, 0.2% were MBL producers. Conclusion: Previous literature documented increase of MDR isolates and recent studies have shown the emergence of XDR. It has to be controlled before it shifts to PDR.",

        "abstract": "The chapter focuses on various pathways that positively and negatively regulate the cell death process in response to anticancer-drug induced damage. Currently used anticancer drugs simultaneously activate several pathways that either positively or negatively regulate cell death induction. The main pathway from specific damage induced by these drugs to apoptosis involves activation of caspases in the cytosol by proapoptotic molecules, such as cytochrome c, released from the mitochondria under the control of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Anticancer drugs modulate this pathway by modifying the expression of Bcl-2 proteins, their activity, and their subcellular localization. Anticancer drugs can also up-regulate the expression of death receptors, such as Fas (APO-1/CD95) and TRAIL receptors, and sensitize tumor cells to their cognate ligands. The Fas\u2013FasL interaction could amplify early steps of drug-induced apoptosis while up-regulation of TRAIL receptors offers the opportunity for a synergistic administration of an anticancer drug and TRAIL. In addition, anticancer drugs activate in tumor cells several lipid-dependent signal transduction pathways that either increase or decrease their ability to die by apoptosis. Better understanding of apoptotic pathways and their modulation by various negative and positive signals simultaneously activated by anticancer agents may prove particularly valuable in cancer therapy. Proteins involved in cell death regulation could be used as new targets for anticancer drugs, and simultaneous signals may be manipulated to increase the efficacy of classical anticancer drugs and radiation.",

        "abstract": "In laboratory animals, exposure to priming injections of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produced drug seeking following extinction of MDMA self-administration. This study aimed to evaluate whether the magnitude of drug seeking was related to latency to acquisition of MDMA self-administration and increases in striatal dopamine, as measured by in-vivo microdialysis. Rats were given daily access to MDMA self-administration until they earned a total of 240 infusions (total intake of 165 mg/kg MDMA). Twelve of the 20 rats acquired self-administration within the temporal limits of the study and the latency to meet the criterion ranged from 9 d to 37 d. An experimenter-administered injection of MDMA (10.0 mg/kg i.p.) produced drug seeking in these rats, and the number of responses was significantly higher than responses produced by rats that failed to meet the criterion or by yoked control rats that received the drug passively. For rats that met the criterion, drug seeking was negatively correlated with the number of days to self-administer the criterion number of MDMA infusions and positively correlated with MDMA-produced dopamine in the dorsal striatum. Importantly, MDMA-produced dopamine overflow was greater for the rats that met the criterion. These findings suggest that drug seeking is influenced by initial sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of MDMA and to drug-produced increases in striatal dopamine.",

        "abstract": "Herbal medicines and their active ingredients are widely used worldwide, and they have become an important part of clinical medicine. The combined use of herbs and drugs has increased the possibility of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the combined use of herbs and drugs can enhance or attenuate the drug efficacy and toxicity. The herb-drug combinations may reduce a drug efficacy and lead to treatment failure when long-term administration. Case reports detailing serious clinical adverse reactions have promoted studies on the interactions between herbs and drugs. This review highlights recent knowledge to discuss herb-drug interactions involving metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. Drug transporters are widely present in body and play an important role in the absorption, distribution, excretion and metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity of drugs. Investigation of transporters has developed rapidly since 1990s, the effects of many transporters on the pharmacokinetics of drugs and herb-drug interactions have been reported. Some concepts on drug transporters issued experimentally and clinically drug-drug and herb-drug interactions have applied in many studies. Methodology studies are very important for understanding the mechanism, considerations and evaluation of experiments and clinical studies on drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters in drug-drug interactions.",

        "abstract": "The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family is a major target for drug discovery, and most, if not all, GPCRs can couple to Ca2+ signaling. Consequently, there are a number of cellbased, primary, high-throughput screening (HTS) assays used for drug discovery that assess changes in intracellular Ca2+ as a functional readout of GPCR activation. Historically, changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels have been readily detected using fluorescent dyes that emit light in proportion to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. An alternative approach to indirectly measure changes in Ca2+ concentrations involves the use of recombinantly expressed biosensor photoproteins, of which aequorin is a prototypic example. These biosensors have the advantage that they provide an intense luminescent signal in response to elevations in intracellular Ca2+. This exquisite sensitivity, the high signal-to-noise ratios, and the ability to target expression to discrete subcellular sites (in order to detect Ca2+ microdomains) have made photoproteins a principal choice in a wide range of GPCR drug discovery programs. Photoproteins are also finding increasing use in detecting activation of other molecular target classes such as ligand-gated ion channels and transporters. This review focuses upon the use of calcium photoproteins principally for use in GPCR drug discovery and HTS.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Little is known about the biological functions of CA125/MUC16 tumor antigen. Here, we examined the role of CA125/MUC16 in regulating the sensitivity of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) cells to different drugs. Methods: An endoplasmic reticulum targeted single-chain antibody (scFv) was used to down-regulate cell surface expression of CA125/MUC16 in NIH:OVCAR3 cells and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of MUC16 was ectopically expressed in CA125-negative SKOV3 cells. Sensitivity to genotoxic agents and to inhibitors of microtubule depolymerization was examined in NIH:OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cell sublines. Cell viability was determined by XTT assay, apoptosis by propidium iodide staining and caspase activation by Western blot and fluorogenic assay. Results: Down-regulation of cell surface MUC16 decreases cisplatin IC50 by 5-fold in NIH:OVCAR3 cells but does not affect paclitaxel IC50. We found that the sensitivity to other genotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine and etoposide was also increased by down-regulation of MUC16. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation also significantly augmented in cisplatin-treated NIH:OVCAR3 cells expressing the anti-MUC16 scFv. Ectopic expression of MUC16 CTD has the opposite effect. Cisplatin sensitivity and caspases activation are decreased by the ectopic expression of MUC16 CTD in SKOV3 cells. Conclusions: CA125/MUC16 selectively modulates the sensitivity of EOC cells to genotoxic agents. The MUC16 CTD appears to be sufficient to promote cisplatin resistance. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The choice of using a particular viability or cytotoxicity assay technology may be influenced by specific research goals. Objective: Although the high-throughput screening (HTS) utility is typically dependent upon sensitivity and scalability, it is also impacted by signal robustness and resiliency to assay interferences. Further consideration should be given to data quality, ease-of-use, reagent stability, and matters of cost-effectiveness. Methods: Here we focus on three main classes of assays that are at present the most popular, useful, and practical for HTS drug discovery efforts. These methods measure: i) viability by metabolism reductase activities; ii) viability by bioluminescent ATP assays; or iii) cytotoxicity by enzymes 'released' into culture medium. Multi-parametric technologies are also briefly discussed. Results/conclusion: Each of these methods has its relative merits and detractions; however multi-parametric methods using both viability and cytotoxicity markers may mitigate the inherent shortcomings of single parameter measures.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: There is a growing need for inexpensive and highly sensitive methods in high-throughput format for measuring drug-target interactions. Cantilever biosensors are ultra-high sensitive electromechanical sensors that have been successfully used for label-free detection of a large number of biological entities. They are emerging as a technology that appears attractive for high-throughput drug discovery applications. Therefore, a brief description of this technology is provided here. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The objective of this review is to present an overview of the development in cantilever biosensor field reported to date and examine applications of cantilever biosensors for biomolecular interaction characterization and drug discovery. The subareas included in the review are: cantilever measurement principles, various interactions measured such as DNA-DNA, protein-protein, membrane protein-ligand and DNA-protein. Discussion on biomarker detection is also included. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: We analyze the recent publications on cantilever biosensors with an emphasis on drug discovery and biomarker detection. The reader will become informed on the detection sensitivity and limit of detection achieved to date. A description of ongoing commercial activity that is likely to result in a practical instrument for researchers is also included. Technical issues that concern current researchers in the field of cantilever biosensors are also summarized. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The cantilever biosensors provide an extraordinarily sensitive method for binding affinity measurement using label-free reagents. They can be fabricated in array format for high-throughput applications using semiconductor manufacturing techniques. When they become commercially available in future, it is anticipated that they will be cost-competitive and easy to use in a research bioanalytical laboratory.",

COMPARE, the gateway to the NCI's anticancer drug screen database, allows users to correlate drug-sensitivity profiles with a functional genomic database. However, most drugs of known molecular mechanism turn out to be uncorrelated with their molecular-target gene expression. Based on a novel statistical concept, liquid association, we develop an on-line system to identify candidate genes that intervene, confound and weaken the drug-gene correlation. The system takes queries and returns button-clickable tables of functionally associated genes for rerouting to knowledgebases such as Locus Link, OMIM and PubMed. We report results that link methotrexate resistance to DNA component biosynthesis, and taxol sensitivity to genes associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection. The drug-sensitivity database can be synergistically coanalyzed with gene expression data to study proteins of poorly understood physiological roles. When applied to the human prion, a cellular context embroidered with the gene expression network of Alzheimer disease is revealed.",

        "abstract": "Orlistat, an anti-obesity drug, is a potent and specific inhibitor of intestinal lipases. In light of the recent US FDA approval of the over-the-counter sale of orlistat (60 mg three times daily), clinicians need to be aware that its use may be associated with less well known, but sometimes clinically relevant, adverse effects. More specifically, the use of orlistat has been associated with several mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as oily stools, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and faecal spotting. A few cases of serious hepatic adverse effects (cholelithiasis, cholostatic hepatitis and subacute liver failure) have been reported. However, the effects of orlistat on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are beneficial. Orlistat-induced weight loss seems to have beneficial effects on blood pressure. No effect has been observed on calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, copper or zinc balance or on bone biomarkers. Interestingly, the use of orlistat has been associated with rare cases of acute kidney injury, possibly due to the increased fat malabsorption resulting from the inhibition of pancreatic and gastric lipase by orlistat, leading to the formation of soaps with calcium and resulting in increased free oxalate absorption and enteric hyperoxaluria. Orlistat has a beneficial effect on carbohydrate metabolism. No significant effect on cancer risk has been reported with orlistat.Orlistat interferes with the absorption of many drugs (such as warfarin, amiodarone, ciclosporin and thyroxine as well as fat-soluble vitamins), affecting their bioavailability and effectiveness. This review considers orlistat-related adverse effects and drug interactions. The clinical relevance and pathogenesis of these effects is also discussed.",

Design: Retrospective and prospective assessment of viruses obtained from people recently infected with HIV. Setting: Multiple centres (patients enrolled in the UK register of seroconverters) and a single large HIV clinic (active case ascertainment). Participants: 69 patients infected with HIV between June 1994 and August 2000. Main outcome measures: Prevalence of key mutations associated with drug resistance in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes of HIV-1, by year of infection. Results: Between June 1994 and August 2000, 10 (14%) of 69 newly infected patients had one or more key HIV-1 mutations associated with drug resistance. The risk of being infected with drug resistant virus increased over time (adjusted relative risk per year 1.74 (95% confidence interval 0.93 to 3.27), P=0.06). The estimated prevalence of drug resistance in those infected in 2000 was 27% (12% to 48%). Conclusions: Transmission of drug resistant HIV-1 in the United Kingdom seems to be increasing. New approaches to encourage safer sexual behaviour in all sectors of the population are urgently needed.  What is already known on this topic The emergence of HIV drug resistance in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy is common Transmission of virus variants resistant to anti-HIV drugs has been documentedWhat this paper adds The prevalence of transmitted HIV drug resistance in the United Kingdom is increasing, exceeding 20% in 2000 New approaches to encourage safer sexual behaviour are urgently needed",

Drug courts have moved from providing diversion programs for first-time offenders charged with drug possession to developing tracks for more complex clients. Many of these new drug court participants have extensive criminal histories, including histories of violent crime. Drug court decision-makers thus confront the difficulty of balancing the needs of treatment versus corrections by attempting to target offenders whose criminal histories suggest that their candidacy in a drug court would not pose a risk to public safety. To date, little is known about whether drug courts are appropriate for offenders with lengthy criminal histories that often include violence. The research presented here explores correlates of drug court graduation for seriously crime- involved offenders, most of whom have a history of violence.",

This National Inst on Drug Abuse funded paper reviews the literature describing the growth, operations, and evaluations of drug courts. It concludes that, contrary to most \"models,\" drug courts emphasize punishment (e.g., graduated sanctions) and make limited positive, or at least inconsistent, use of reinforcement to promote behavior change and abstinence from drug use. Contingency management techniques that involve the systematic application of reinforcement based on the performance of specified behaviors are presented and reviewed. The success of this model in promoting pro-social behavior and abstinence from illicit drug use suggests that drug courts could benefit substantially from the integration of contingency management-based interventions.

One striking feature is the relatively constant historical rate of target innovation (the rate at which drugs against new targets are launched); however, the rate of developing drugs against new families is significantly lower. The recent approval of drugs that target protein kinases highlights two additional trends: an emerging realization of the importance of polypharmacology, and also the power of a gene-family-led approach in generating novel and important therapies.",

Methods: Test the changes in sensitivity of seven colorectal cancer cell strains that have been/not been subject to DAC treatment to CPT-11, analyze its correlation with CES2, UGT1A1 and GUSB mRNA expression according to IC50; screen the effective interference sequence of UGT1A1 siRNA, test the changes in cytotoxicity of CPT-11 after UGT1A1 siRNA is transfected, select RK0 cells and make them transfected with the chemosynthetic UGT1A1 siRNA after their UGT1A1 expression is restored with or without demethylation treatment. Results: The sensitivity of different colorectal cancer cell strains to CPT-11 showed difference (P<0.05), UGT1A1 expression in colorectal cell lines had a negative correlation with the IC50 (r=0.790648, P<0.05), the interference efficiency of the screened UGT1A1 siRNA was up to 78%. The IC50 value of siRNA decreased by nearly one time after transfected with HT-29 (P<0.01); which of methylated RK0 cells of UGT1A1 gene increased instead after the demethylation treatment. However, the IC50 value of the demethylation treatment group increased compared with the non-demethylation treatment group after UGT1A1 siRNA was transfected. Conclusions: The cytotoxicity of CPT-11 to colorectal cancer cells has a negative correlation with UGT1A1 expression, and positive correlation with CES2 and GUSB. The specific silencing UGT1A1 gene of siRNA could significantly increase the sensitivity of CPT-11 to the chemotherapy of colorectal cancer cells.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and an important cause of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. A myriad of drugs can induce AF. However, drug-induced AF (DIAF) receives little attention. Thus, this review is an attempt to attract the attention on this adverse effect. AREAS COVERED: Published reports of drug-induced AF (DIAF) are reviewed in this paper, from January 1974 to December 2011, using the PubMed/Medline database and lateral references. EXPERT OPINION: In most cases, DIAF is paroxysmal and terminates spontaneously, but sometimes AF persists and it is necessary to perform a cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm and avoid progression to persistent AF. Because of the short duration of DIAF, in addition to physicians/patients not being knowledgeable about this side effect, the real incidence and clinical consequences of DIAF are presently unknown. DIAF is an increasing problem, as some widely prescribed drugs can present this adverse effect. The risk is expected to increase in the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. It is important that physicians understand the significance of DIAF, to increase the collaboration between cardiac and non-cardiac professionals, and to educate patients to make them aware of this adverse side effect.",

        "abstract": "Drug metabolism refers to the biochemical transformation of a compound into another more polar chemical form. Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion comprise an integral part in understanding the safety and efficacy of a potential new drug. Detailed in-depth knowledge of the Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism of a new drug entity is considered a prerequisite to know the appropriate route of administration, correct dose etc. Sometimes there is (are) different/unwanted effect(s) of certain drugs in different populations. This is particularly true for the drug having narrow therapeutic index. Often these different effects are detrimental to an individual, thus termed as adverse drug reactions. After the raw draft of human genome has evolved, it has become increasingly clear that change(s) in the drug response between individuals, is due to the occurrence of genetic polymorphisms in the Phase I and II drug metabolizing enzymes, due to which distinct subgroups in the population differ in their ability to perform certain drug biotransformation reactions. The study about the occurrence of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes is termed as Pharmacogenetics/ Pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenetic characterization of particular drug can be both phenotypically or genotypically conducted in population groups. The study is very important to check the post-marketed drug withdrawal, if a particular percentage of population suffers from adverse drug reactions, and thus a lot of revenue be saved. The study also helps to find out Right Medicine for Right Individual or Individualized Medicine.",

Ten subjects received metformin glycinate (1,050.6 mg) once daily during the first month and force-titrated twice daily during the second month. Ten additional patients received placebo as the control group. Before and after the intervention, metabolic profile including A1C and insulin sensitivity (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique) was estimated.\\n\\nRESULTS: A1C concentrations decreased significantly with metformin glycinate administration (8.0 \u00b1 0.7% vs. 7.1 \u00b1 0.9%, P = 0.008) before and after the intervention, respectively. There were significant differences in changes from baseline of A1C between groups (0.0 \u00b1 0.7% vs. -1.0 \u00b1 0.5% for placebo and metformin glycinate groups, respectively; P = 0.004). A reduction of \u22651% in A1C levels was reached in 60.0% of patients with metformin glycinate administration (P = 0.02). Insulin sensitivity was not modified by the intervention.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Administration of metformin glycinate during a 2-month period showed a greater decrease in A1C concentrations than placebo in a selected group of drug-naive adult patients with T2DM.",

        "abstract": "Background: Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, excluding heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, is a rare adverse drug reaction for which the evidence about frequency, relative risk and risk factors mainly originates from case reports and case studies. This study aims to quantify the risk for thrombocytopenia following exposure to drugs that are most often reported to cause thrombocytopenia in the general population. Methods: A retrospective, case-control study was conducted within the PHARMO record linkage system. Cases were defined as patients hospitalised for thrombocytopenia in the period 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2002. For each case, up to four controls were matched based on age, sex and geographical area. Exposure on the index date to anticonvulsants, \u03b2-lactam antibacterials, cinchona alkaloids, disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), diuretics, NSAIDs, sulfonamide antibacterials and tuberculostatics was assessed and categorised into mutually exclusive groups of current, recent, past and non-use. The risk was quantified with multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis. Results: The study population comprised 705 cases and 2658 controls. Current use of \u03b2-lactam antibacterials was associated with an increased risk for thrombocytopenia (adjusted odds ratio 7.4, 95% CI 1.8, 29.6). Increased risk estimates, although not significant, were found for current exposure to DMARDs and the sulfonamide antibacterial cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). No increased risk was found for anticonvulsants, cinchona alkaloids, diuretics, NSAIDs or tuberculostatics. Conclusion: More evidence for an increased risk for thrombocytopenia in current use of \u03b2-lactam antibacterials in the general population was provided. The expected increase in risk could not be confirmed for the other drugs investigated, which is possibly a result of the limited statistical power. Future studies including more patients and with laboratory data should confirm our findings before drawing definite conclusions. \u00a9 2006 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Preventing and managing drug-induced anaphylaxis",
        "abstract": "Drug-induced anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions have increased in frequency with more widespread use of pharmaceutical agents. Anaphylaxis is a systemic, severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction caused by immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated immunological release of mediators of mast cells and basophils. An anaphylactoid reaction is an event similar to anaphylaxis but is not mediated by IgE. The incidence of anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions differs amongst classes of medications. Antibacterials are the most usual offenders, and penicillins are the most studied. Other compounds commonly causing reactions include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anaesthetics, muscle relaxants, latex and radiocontrast media. Prevention, if possible, is the purpose of detailed patient history taking and physical examination. Simple strategies can be employed to decrease the risk of anaphylaxis. These include consideration of the route of drug administration, identification of patients with known causes of anaphylaxis, and the knowledge that certain medications cross react and are contraindicated in those with known history of anaphylaxis. Tests are available, and include IgE-specific skin tests and radioallergosorbent tests. Penicillins are the only compounds whose antigenic determinants are well documented, it is therefore difficult to determine the negative predictive value of other compounds tested. Oral challenge remains an alternative, though entails risk. Desensitisation procedures, as well as gradual dose escalation protocols, are available and can be implemented based on patient history and diagnostic testing. The management of anaphylaxis is based on control of the airway, breathing and circulation. Treatment consists of epinephrine (adrenaline) and supportive measures. Rapid diagnosis and intervention are important in these life-threatening reactions. After stabilisation, all individuals with a documented history of anaphylaxis require a Medic-Alert bracelet or necklace, and an identification card for their wallet or purse.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this review was to estimate the extent of under-reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to spontaneous reporting systems and to investigate whether there are differences between different types of ADRs. A systematic literature search was carried out to identify studies providing a numerical estimate of under-reporting. Studies were included regardless of the methodology used or the setting, e.g. hospital versus general practice. Estimates of under-reporting were either extracted directly from the published study or calculated from the study data. These were expressed as the percentage of ADRs detected from intensive data collection that were not reported to the relevant local, regional or national spontaneous reporting systems. The median under-reporting rate was calculated across all studies and within subcategories of studies using different methods or settings. In total, 37 studies using a wide variety of surveillance methods were identified from 12 countries. These generated 43 numerical estimates of under-reporting. The median under-reporting rate across the 37 studies was 94% (interquartile range 82-98%). There was no significant difference in the median under-reporting rates calculated for general practice and hospital-based studies. Five of the ten general practice studies provided evidence of a higher median under-reporting rate for all ADRs compared with more serious or severe ADRs (95% and 80%, respectively). In comparison, for five of the eight hospital-based studies the median under-reporting rate for more serious or severe ADRs remained high (95%). The median under-reporting rate was lower for 19 studies investigating specific serious/severe ADR-drug combinations but was still high at 85%. This systematic review provides evidence of significant and widespread under-reporting of ADRs to spontaneous reporting systems including serious or severe ADRs. Further work is required to assess the impact of under-reporting on public health decisions and the effects of initiatives to improve reporting such as internet reporting, pharmacist/nurse reporting and direct patient reporting as well as improved education and training of healthcare professionals.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are now recognized as a major category of iatrogenic illness in terms of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To describe the type and frequency of avoidable ADRs spontaneously reported to a regional drug monitoring centre following inappropriate prescribing, as a basis for preventive actions. METHODS: A prospective, observational study of ADRs reported to the Regional Drug Monitoring Centre of Tours, France, between 26 November 2002 and 28 November 2003. The outcome measure was ADRs secondary to inappropriate prescribing that were defined as entirely or partly avoidable, i.e. at least one of the recommendations in various sections of the summary of product characteristics (SPC; indication, route of administration, dose, duration of treatment, dose adaptation, precautions for use, monitoring of treatment, absolute contraindications and contraindicated interactions) had not been respected. The link between the lack of conformity of the drug prescription with the SPC and occurrence of the ADR was evaluated by a working group using two criteria: (i) is nonconformity of the prescription of this drug a known and validated risk factor for this ADR?; and (ii) are there other aetiologies or other risk factors for this ADR? RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty ADRs in 294 adults and 66 children were analysed. The prescription was considered inappropriate for 213 of the 659 (32%) drugs implicated in ADRs, corresponding to 161 patients (45%). The ADR was adjudged entirely avoidable for 32 (9%) patients, partly avoidable for 28 (8%) patients and unavoidable for 300 (83%) patients. Not taking into account a history of allergy or altered renal function and not respecting the recommended dose were the most frequent causes of entirely avoidable ADRs. Allopurinol and lamotrigine were the drugs most frequently involved in serious avoidable ADRs. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive actions should focus on more systematic allergy checks when prescribing drugs and on dose adaptation in cases of altered renal function.",

        "abstract": "Our previous report showed that L754.394 and valspodar (PSC833) are potent inhibitors of midazolam hydroxylation in human jejunum microsomes and vectorial transport of vinblastine in Caco-2 cells, respectively. In the present study, to directly examine the interactions of these compounds as well as other substrates with CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), we performed in vitro inhibition studies using recombinant CYP3A4-expressed microsomes and an MDR1-transfected cell line, LLC-MDR1, respectively. In CYP3A4-expressed microsomes, both L754.394 and ketoconazole, at a concentration less than 0.5 microM, are the most potent inhibitors of the formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam, a major metabolite of midazolam formed by CYP3A4. The greatest inhibitory effect on the transcellular transport of digoxin in LLC-MDR1 cells was observed in the presence of valspodar (<0.1 microM), followed by verapamil. From a comparison of the IC(50) values, it was shown that L754.394 and valspodar exhibited the highest selectivity for CYP3A4 and P-gp, respectively. To demonstrate such specificity, both midazolam hydroxylation and digoxin transport were observed in CYP3A4 transfected Caco-2 cells, which coexpress both P-gp and CYP3A4, in the presence or absence of L754.394 (0.5 microM) and valspodar (1.0 microM). L754.394 almost completely inhibited midazolam hydroxylation, but not digoxin transport, whereas almost complete inhibition of digoxin transport was observed in the presence of valspodar, but inhibition of the hydroxylation was minimal. Thus, the present study has demonstrated that L754.394 has a specific inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, whereas valspodar is specific for P-gp.",

        "abstract": "Although several anticancer drugs have been introduced as chemotherapeutic agents, the effective treatment of cancer remains a challenge. Major limitations in the application of anticancer drugs include their nonspecificity, wide biodistribution, short half-life, low concentration in tumor tissue and systemic toxicity. Drug delivery to the tumor site has become feasible in recent years, and recent advances in the development of new drug delivery systems for controlled drug release in tumor tissues with reduced side effects show great promise. In this field, the use of biodegradable polymers as drug carriers has attracted the most attention. However, drug release is still difficult to control even when a polymeric drug carrier is used. The design of pharmaceutical polymers that respond to external stimuli (known as stimuli-responsive polymers) such as temperature, pH, electric or magnetic field, enzymes, ultrasound waves, etc. appears to be a successful approach. In these systems, drug release is triggered by different stimuli. The purpose of this review is to summarize different types of polymeric drug carriers and stimuli, in addition to the combination use of stimuli in order to achieve a better controlled drug release, and it discusses their potential strengths and applications. A survey of the recent literature on various stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems is also provided and perspectives on possible future developments in controlled drug release at tumor site have been discussed.",

However, the BBB is not simply a physical barrier, but a complex interface that is in intimate communication with the rest of the central nervous system (CNS) and influenced by peripheral tissues. This review examines three aspects of the BBB in AD. First, it considers how the BBB may be contributing to the onset and progression of AD. In this regard, the BBB itself is a therapeutic target in the treatment of AD. Second, it examines how the BBB restricts drugs that might otherwise be useful in the treatment of AD and examines strategies being developed to deliver drugs to the CNS for the treatment of AD. Third, it considers how drug penetration across the AD BBB may differ from the BBB of normal aging. In this case, those differences can complicate the treatment of CNS diseases such as depression, delirium, psychoses, and pain control in the AD population.",

        "abstract": "Background: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are of great concern, as they are known to be related to adverse drug reactions and hospitalisations. In addition, many DDIs are regarded as predictable and avoidable; therefore, they may be considered as targets for education and interventions. Objective: To analyse the relationship between number of dispensed drugs and the probability of potential DDIs among the elderly by using the new Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Methods: We analysed data on age, sex and dispensed drugs for people aged =75 years who were registered in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register from October to December 2005, and constructed a list of current prescriptions for every individual on the arbitrarily chosen date of 31 December 2005. Thereafter, we included those who had at least two dispensed drugs to capture the elderly population at risk of being exposed to DDIs (n = 630 743). The main outcome measures were potentially clinically relevant DDIs (type C), which may require dose adjustment, and potentially serious DDIs (type D), which should be avoided. Results: The prevalence of type C potential DDIs was 26% and of type D potential DDIs 5% in the study population. There was a strong association between number of dispensed drugs and the probability of type C potential DDIs and an even stronger association for type D potential DDIs, after adjustment for age and sex. In addition, the probability of type D potential DDIs decreased with increasing age, and women had a lower probability of type D potential DDIs than men. Conclusion: There seems to be a strong relationship between number of dispensed drugs and potential DDIs, especially for potentially serious DDIs, which has implications for the importance of trying to minimise the number of drugs prescribed in the elderly. Our findings that the probability of potentially serious DDIs decreases with increasing age among the elderly and that elderly women have a lower probability of potentially serious DDIs than elderly men need to be verified and investigated by further research.

        "title": "Detecting Adverse Drug Reactions on Paediatric Wards",
        "abstract": "Background: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) contribute significantly to patient morbidity and mortality, as well as to costs for healthcare systems. Our aim was to evaluate the type and incidence of ADRs in a paediatric hospital population, comparatively ascertained by two different methodological approaches. Methods: Our prospective study enrolled all patients admitted to two of the general children wards (46 beds) and the paediatric intensive care unit (6 beds) at the HELIOS Klinikum Wuppertal teaching hospital in Germany, over the study period of 3 months. We used two methods to detect ADRs. The intensified surveillance system relied on a trained physician conducting ward rounds and assessing patient charts. The computer-assisted screening of pathological laboratory parameters used values slightly below or above the age-specific normal range as a trigger signal for a potential ADR, which was subsequently assessed by trained personnel. Results: By applying both methods simultaneously we observed that 14.1% of children experienced an ADR while they were hospitalised and 2.7% of children were admitted to hospital because of the ADR. Intensified surveillance resulted in the detection of 101 ADRs in 11.9% of patients, predominantly presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms, skin and CNS disorders; computer-assisted screening identified 45 ADRs in 5.7% of patients, mainly with drug-induced blood dyscrasia and liver damage. Furthermore, the ADRs detected by the intensified method were more severe, affected younger children and showed a closer causal attributability to the reaction than the ADRs observed by the computerised method. The spectra of drugs involved were similar, with the anti-infectives being suspected most frequently. The sensitivities of the intensified surveillance system and the computerised surveillance screening came to 67.2% and 44.8%, respectively, with computer-assisted screening having a specificity of 72.8%. The mean positive predictive value of the pathological laboratory values under surveillance by computer-assisted screening was 18.6%. Approximately 25% of ADR-related drugs administered were used for off-label indications. Conclusion: Using the published literature for comparison, we found that ADRs occur as frequently in paediatric patients as in adult patients. Intensified surveillance and computerised surveillance applied in the paediatric setting show substantial differences in their detection specificities. A higher number of and more severe ADRs can be detected by intensified surveillance than by computerised surveillance, but require higher personnel resources. \u00a9 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

Confounders that require detailed information on clinical parameters, lifestyle, or over-the-counter medications are often not measured in such datasets, causing residual confounding bias. OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a systematic approach to sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of residual confounding in pharmacoepidemiologic studies that use health care utilization databases. METHODS: Four basic approaches to sensitivity analysis were identified: (1) sensitivity analyses based on an array of informed assumptions; (2) analyses to identify the strength of residual confounding that would be necessary to explain an observed drug-outcome association; (3) external adjustment of a drug-outcome association given additional information on single binary confounders from survey data using algebraic solutions; (4) external adjustment considering the joint distribution of multiple confounders of any distribution from external sources of information using propensity score calibration. CONCLUSION: Sensitivity analyses and external adjustments can improve our understanding of the effects of drugs and biologics in epidemiologic database studies. With the availability of easy-to-apply techniques, sensitivity analyses should be used more frequently, substituting qualitative discussions of residual confounding.",

There are numerous drug-drug interactions (DDIs) related to a loss of therapeutic efficacy and many of these are caused by pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated transcriptional activation of drug-metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters. Evaluation of PXR activation and subsequent induction of proteins involved in drug elimination and distribution have become routine in drug discovery and drug development. The assays used to evaluate PXR directly are high throughput and provide useful information on the ability of a drug's potential to precipitate a DDI. In addition, they may serve as useful tools to support structure-activity or structure-liability relationships to eliminate or minimize the potential of new drug candidates to cause induction and, ultimately, a DDI.",

In the present study, we have found that p53 family member p73 as well as 14-3-3?? is down-regulated in response to adriamycin (ADR) in ADR-resistant human breast cancer-derived MBA-MD-436 cells which carry p53 mutation. Like p53, 14-3-3?? was transactivated by p73 and, in turn, stabilized p73. Luciferase reporter analysis and colony formation assays demonstrated that 14-3-3?? has an ability to enhance the p73-mediated transcriptional activity as well as its pro-apoptotic function. Furthermore, enforced expression of 14-3-3?? increased the ADR sensitivity of MBA-MD-436 cells. Taken together, our present results strongly suggest that p73-dependent induction of 14-3-3?? plays an important role in the regulation of chemo-sensitivity of breast cancers bearing p53 mutation. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Abstract Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of gums involving the degeneration of periodontal ligaments, creation of periodontal pocket and resorption of alveolar bone, resulting in the disruption of the support structure of teeth. According to WHO, 10-15% of the global population suffers from severe periodontitis. The disease results from the growth of a diverse microflora (especially anaerobes) in the pockets and release of toxins, enzymes and stimulation of body's immune response. Various local or systemic approaches were used for an effective treatment of periodontitis. Currently, controlled local drug delivery approach is more favorable as compared to systemic approach because it mainly focuses on improving the therapeutic outcomes by achieving factors like site-specific delivery, low dose requirement, bypass of first-pass metabolism, reduction in gastrointestinal side effects and decrease in dosing frequency. Overall it provides a safe and effective mode of treatment, which enhances patient compliance. Complete eradication of the organisms from the sites was not achieved by using various surgical and mechanical treatments. So a number of polymer-based delivery systems like fibers, films, chips, strips, microparticles, nanoparticles and nanofibers made from a variety of natural and synthetic materials have been successfully tested to deliver a variety of drugs. These systems are biocompatible and biodegradable, completely fill the pockets, and have strong retention on the target site due to excellent mucoadhesion properties. The review summarizes various available and recently developing targeted delivery devices for the treatment of periodontitis.",

It is most frequently referred to as hyaluronan because it exists in vivo as a polyanion and not in the protonated acid form. HA is distributed widely in vertebrates and presents as a component of the cell coat of many strains of bacteria. Initially the main functions of HA were believed to be mechanical as it has a protective, structure stabilizing and shock-absorbing role in the body. However, more recently the role of HA in the mediation of physiological functions via interaction with binding proteins and cell surface receptors including morphogenesis, regeneration, wound healing, and tumor invasion, as well as in the dynamic regulation of such interactions on cell signaling and behavior has been documented. The unique viscoelastic nature of hyaluronan along with its biocompatibility and nonimmunogenicity has led to its use in a number of cosmetic, medical, and pharmaceutical applications. More recently, HA has been investigated as a drug delivery agent for ophthalmic, nasal, pulmonary, parenteral, and dermal routes. The purpose of our review is to describe the physical, chemical, and biological properties of native HA together with how it can be produced and assayed along with a detailed analysis of its medical and pharmaceutical applications.",

        "abstract": "Highly active antiretroviral therapies consisting of reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs and protease inhibitor drugs, which can rapidly suppress HIV below the limit of detection, are currently the most effective treatment for HIV infected patients. In spite of this, many patients fail to achieve viral suppression, probably due to existing or developing drug resistance, poor adherence, pharmacokinetic problems and other clinical factors. In this paper, we develop a viral dynamic model to evaluate how time-varying drug exposure and drug susceptibility affect antiviral response. Plasma concentrations, in turn, are modeled using a standard pharmacokinetic (PK) one-compartment open model with first order absorption and elimination as a function of fixed individual PK parameters and dose times. Imperfect adherence is considered as missed doses in PK models. We discuss the analytic properties of the viral dynamic model and study how time-varying treatment efficacies affect antiviral responses, specifically viral load and T cell counts. The relationship between actual failure time (the time at which the viral growth rate changes from negative to positive) and detectable failure time (the time at which viral load rebounds to above the limit of detection) is investigated. We find that an approximately linear relationship can be used to estimate the actual rebound failure time from the detectable rebound failure time. In addition, the effect of adherence on antiviral response is studied. In particular, we examine how different patterns of adherence affect antiviral response. Results suggest that longer sequences of missed doses increase the chance of treatment failure and accelerate the failure. Simulation experiments are presented to illustrate the relationship between antiviral response and pharmacokinetics, time-varying adherence and drug resistance. The proposed models and methods may be useful in AIDS clinical trial simulations. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.",

Insulin sensitivity was improved (p=0.00002) and urinary albumin excretion rate was better controlled (p=0.0096) in lisinopril-treated patients when compared with the combination treatment in diabetic pool. Serum creatinine levels increased significantly in non-diabetic patients (p=0.00004) receiving combination treatment. In addition, creatinine clearance (CLCR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly higher in diabetic (CLCR: p<0.00001; BUN: p=0.0098) as well as in non-diabetic (CLCR: p<0.00001; BUN: p=0.03) patients treated with combination treatment. The alterations in serum electrolytes, reduction in % platelet aggregation activity and improvement in lipid profile was more profound with combination treatment in comparison to lisinopril alone.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The antihypertensive efficacy and insulin sensitivity improving property of lisinopril along with the renal function might get worse in hypertensive osteoarthritic patients receiving concomitant treatment of oral diclofenac sodium with lisinopril. In addition to this, close monitoring of serum electrolytes is also suggested to rule out any long-term detrimental effect.",

        "abstract": "A novel type of waist cross-linked micelle (WCM) was developed as an intelligent drug carrier via the self-assembly guiding free radical polymerization of an amphiphilic oligomer: octadecyl{,} polyethylene glycol butenedioates (O-B-EGs). By changing the concentration of O-B-EG reaction solution{,} WCMs with monolayer{,} compound and vesicle-like morphologies were obtained. These WCMs showed controllable temperature responsive properties. DLS and UV-vis analyses indicate that the critical temperatures at which WCMs show an abrupt change in particle size evidently increases with the increase in the molecular weight of the PEG chains. Direct switching of the release of pyrene in WCMs is also realized by a slight change of temperature. Pyrene is released rapidly at the temperatures around the critical temperature of the WCMs{,} but a further increase in temperature shuts down the release of pyrene. More importantly{,} these WCMs exhibit reversible and rapid pyrene releasing-absorbing behavior. We suggest that these excellent properties endow WCMs with great potential in drug encapsulation and controlled release",

The phase transition temperature of PLP 1 with lower lactide content in distilled water showed around 35 ??C. Upon adding 0.15 M NaCl to PLP 1, a significant difference in the transmittance was observed when comparing the non-additive salt condition. The total amount of released doxorubicin (DOX) from the DOX-loaded PLP nanogels increased with increasing temperature for 50 h. A noticeable difference in the initial release by PLP 1 was observed between 37 and 42 ??C. In the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC\n                        50) analysis, the IC\n                        50 values of DOX released from PLP 1 were approximately 5.9 and 9.3 ??g/mL at 37 and 42 ??C, respectively.

However, the conventional drug delivery systems often offer a limited by their inability to drug delivery which consists of systemic toxicity, narrow therapeutic window, complex dosing schedule for long term treatment etc. Therefore, there has been a search for the drug delivery system that exhibit broad enhancing activity for more drugs with less complication. More recently, some elegant study has noted that, a new type of micro-electrochemical system or MEMS-based drug delivery systems called microchip has been improved to overcome the problems related to conventional drug delivery. Moreover, micro-fabrication technology has enabled to develop the implantable controlled released microchip devices with improved drug administration and patient compliance. In this article, we have presented an overview of the investigations on the feasibility and application of microchip as an advanced drug delivery system. Commercial manufacturing materials and methods, related other research works and current advancement of the microchips for controlled drug delivery have also been summarized.",

        "abstract": "The generation of autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus has been associated with the use of certain drugs in humans. Early reports suggested that procainamide and hydralazine were associated with the highest risk of developing lupus, quinidine with a moderate risk and all other drugs were considered low or very low risk. More recently, drug-induced lupus has been associated with the use of the newer biological modulators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 inhibitors and interferons. The clinical features and laboratory findings of TNF\u03b1 inhibitor-induced lupus are different from that of traditional drug-induced lupus or idiopathic lupus, and standardized criteria for the diagnosis of drug-induced lupus have not been established. The mechanism(s) responsible for the development of drug-induced lupus may vary depending on the drug or even on the patient. Besides lupus, other autoimmune diseases have been associated with drugs or toxins. Diagnosis of drug-induced lupus requires identification of a temporal relationship between drug administration and symptom development, and in traditional drug-induced lupus there must be no pre-existing lupus. Resolution of symptoms generally occurs after cessation of the drug.In this review, we will discuss those drugs that are more commonly associated with drug-induced lupus, with an emphasis on the new biologicals and the difficulty of making the diagnosis of drug-induced lupus against a backdrop of the autoimmune diseases that these drugs are used to treat. Stimulation of the immune system by these drugs to cause autoimmunity may in fact be associated with an increased effectiveness in treating the pathology for which they are prescribed, leading to the dilemma of deciding which is worse, the original disease or the adverse effect of the drug. Optimistically, one must hope that ongoing research in drug development and in pharmacogenetics will help to treat patients with the maximum effectiveness while minimizing side effects. Vigilance and early diagnosis are critical. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most recent developments in our understanding of the incidence, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of drug-induced lupus. \u00a9 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

Other novel drugs include oral platinum compounds as well as those that antagonize the tumor proliferation genes in the Hedgehog pathway, and that target folic acid receptors which are expressed by ovarian cancer cells. In addition, studies are underway with oral agents that inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity associated with two oncogenes (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER-2/neu). Finally, emerging technologies in clinical trials include nanotechnology to enhance delivery of chemotherapy to ovarian tumors, drug resistance/sensitivity assays to guide therapy, and agents that mobilize and induce proliferation of hematopoetic progenitor cells to aid in red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet recovery following chemotherapy.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Dogs are commonly used in cardiovascular drug safety assessment, and implanted telemetry models include subcutaneous or epicardial electrocardiogram (ECG) electrode placements. The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a canine telemetry model with intravenous ECG lead placement: the negative ECG lead (solid tip) inserted into the jugular vein and the positive lead sutured to the diaphragm. Reference drugs were administered to test the sensitivity to drug-induced changes. Methods: Twenty-four dogs were implanted with PCT or PCTP transmitters [Data Sciences International (DSI)]. Three reference drugs were administered: sotalol to eight PCT and milrinone to eight PCTP transmitter-implanted dogs. Twenty-four dogs received moxifloxacin (12 dogs/transmitter type). Telemetry data were collected for 25. h and analyzed using double Latin squares for sotalol and milrinone data or a 4. \u00d7. 4 or 3. \u00d7. 6 parallel design for moxifloxacin data. Evaluated parameters were PR, QT, corrected QT (QTc), QRS, heart rate, left ventricular function, and hemodynamic data. Various correction factors for QTc interval were tested. Retrospective power analysis was performed to detect minimal absolute changes comparing a single to a double Latin square or the two parallel designs. Results: Expected changes on ECG and hemodynamic parameters were observed after administration of all reference drugs. The individual animal corrected QT (QTci) interval provided the optimal correction factor. Retrospective power analysis confirmed detection of smaller differences in double versus single Latin squares. Minimal detectable differences were smaller in both Latin squares compared to parallel designs, with smaller detectable differences in a 3. \u00d7. 6 compared to a 4. \u00d7. 4 parallel design. Discussion: The solid tip intravenous ECG lead configuration in dogs is a viable radiotelemetry model to detect drug-induced changes with high sensitivity. This model yields comparable signal quality and represents a refinement over epicardial ECG leads and allows for possible reduction in the number of animals if study design and size are selected based on needed assay sensitivity. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

Methods: We test the hypothesis that an improvement in the employment prospects, as measured by a decline in unemployment, strengthens the intrinsic motivation of an unemployed drug user to enter treatment. Our hypothesis is that the \"payoff\" of entering treatment increases when the unemployed drug user has a greater probability of finding a job. We reviewed the literature and found considerable evidence to substantiate this effect. We tested the hypothesis econometrically using two different data sets, one EU-wide and one German data set. Results: Our main findings were that unemployment has a significant negative effect on the number of drug users entering treatment, i.e. when unemployment declines (increases) the number of drug treatment clients increases (declines). We also found that unemployed drug users entering treatment are most sensitive to variations in the economy-wide unemployment rate. Employed drug users, in contrast, are not influenced by these variations when deciding to enter treatment. Conclusion: Our empirical results confirm that the creation of job prospects adds significantly to the willingness of unemployed drug users to enter treatment. This lends support to the idea that drug treatment should be embedded in programmes to improve the job prospects of drug users. ?? 2011.",

These molecules possess a cage-like supramolecular structure, comparable with the structures of crown ethers, cryptands, spherands, cyclophanes, or calixarenes. However, it took 50 years to establish the molecular structure of CDs. Owing to their capability to form inclusion complexes with a variety of guest molecules, CDs are considered as the most important supramolecular host family among all supramolecular structures mentioned above. They can form complexes with various types of molecules including inorganic, organic, or organometallic that can be radical, cationic, anionic, or neutral molecules. This phenomenon bears the name \"molecular recognition,\" while the selectivity in the formation of complexes with enantiomeric species as guests is called \"chiral recognition.\" In addition, the properties of the molecules forming the complexes with CDs can be modified significantly. As such, a large number of scientists have attempted to elaborate and evaluate various CD derivatives that are able to complex a variety of drugs, enhancing by this way their in vivo solubility and activity. Moreover, a large number of publications describe CD uses in other fields such as foods, textile, cosmetics, or agriculture.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Direct reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to authorities is increasing, but questions remain about how patients identify suspected ADRs and their ability to distinguish between ADRs and other symptoms.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine how reporters to the Yellow Card Scheme (YCS) identify ADRs.\\n\\nMETHODS: We carried out a qualitative analysis of data from three sources, obtained as part of a larger evaluation of patient reporting to the UK YCS: responses to open questions in postal questionnaires sent to all reporters during March 2008-January 2009 (method 1); telephone interviews with a purposive sample of these reporters (method 2); and the free-text field from completed Yellow Card reporting forms submitted during October 2005-September 2007 (method 3).\\n\\nRESULTS: Method 1 involved 1362 questionnaire respondents (67.8% of the 2008 patient reporters during the study period), 1167 of whom explained how they decided they had experienced an ADR. Temporality was the most common reason for the perceived association, given by 820 (70.2%) respondents. 478 (41.0%) provided information on two or more aspects of temporality, such as onset, changes with dose and re-challenge. A total of 383 (32.8%) respondents used information sources, such as patient information leaflets or discussions with health professionals to confirm associations, including 145 (12.4%) who had also reported a temporal association. Telephone interviews with 27 reporters (method 2) provided detailed explanations of temporal associations, particularly experiences of rechallenge, and data from 230 Yellow Card reports (method 3) showed that, although reporters are not required to explain reasons for their suspicions, 74.8% of submitted reports included a temporal association. These reports also showed evidence of causal theorizing and differential diagnosis.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: In our study sample, most reporters to the YCS feel able to identify suspected ADRs adequately and describe processes of assessing causality that mirror those in standard algorithms designed for use by health professionals. These findings should help to reduce concerns among health professionals about the ability of patients to identify suspected ADRs when reporting to authorities.",

        "title": "Intraoral Drug Delivery",
        "abstract": "The oral availability of many drugs is poor because of the pH of the stomach, the presence of enzymes, and extensive first-pass metabolism. Traditionally, these drugs have been administered as parenteral drug delivery systems, which invariably leads to poor patient compliance. This has made the pharmaceutical industry look for alternative routes of drug delivery. One possible route is via the oral cavity. This review compares the many different and novel drug delivery systems that have been developed for absorption through the oral cavity as well as those that undergo quick disintegration or dissolution in the oral cavity. Systems for oral delivery include mucoadhesive patches, films and tablets, as well as quick-disintegrating wafers, tablets and films. There are many examples of drugs that have been formulated into intraoral absorptive drug delivery systems as well as quick-disintegrating drug delivery systems. The fact that most of the research being conducted on intraoral drug delivery systems is driven by pharmaceutical manufacturers demonstrates the need for such drug delivery systems. As we begin to discover more about oral mucosal drug delivery, and develop much more sophisticated drug delivery systems, many more drugs will be formulated as intraoral systems. There is no doubt that the need for these systems is real, and many classes of drugs could benefit from this noninvasive type of drug delivery. The challenge now is to synthesize drug moieties that exhibit increased absorption across the oral mucosa and are more potent in their action. Intraoral drug delivery systems are possibly one of the very few drug delivery systems that seem to be ahead of the development of new drug compounds that are effectively absorbed across tissue membranes.",

        "abstract": "Molecular imaging techniques are increasingly being used as valuable tools in the drug development process. Radionuclide-based imaging modalities such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) have proven to be useful in phases ranging from preclinical development to the initial stages of clinical testing. The high sensitivity of these imaging modalities makes them particularly suited for exploratory investigational new drug (IND) studies as they have the potential to characterize in vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the compounds using only a fraction of the intended therapeutic dose (microdosing). This information obtained at an early stage of clinical testing results in a better selection among promising drug candidates, thereby increasing the success rate of agents entering clinical trials and the overall efficiency of the process. In this article, we will review the potential applications of SPECT imaging in the drug development process with an emphasis on its applications in exploratory IND studies.",

Protein\u2013nanoparticle (NP) complexes have gained importance as vehicles for targeted drug delivery due to increased ease of administration, stability and half-life of drug, and reduced toxic side effects. Designing of phospholipid\u2013bovine serum albumin (BSA) complexes and stealth NPs with BSA has paved the way for drug delivery carriers with prolonged blood circulation times. Preformed albumin corona has shown to decrease non-specific association and thereby reduce the clearance rate. Albumin corona has enabled the localization of drug carriers in specific tissues such as liver and heart, thus regulating biodistribution. Tailored albumin\u2013NP conjugates have also enabled controlled degradation of NP and drug release. However, the binding of albumin with NP is associated with conformational and functional modulations in protein as observed with silver, gold and superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs. In this review, we highlight the various potential albumin\u2013NP hybrids as nano drug carriers. Read More: http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10717544.2015.1048488",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a well known risk factor for adverse drug reactions. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins') are a cornerstone in the treatment of dyslipidaemia and patients with dyslipidaemia are concomitantly treated with a variety of additional drugs. Since DDIs are associated with adverse reactions, we performed a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of potentially critical drug-drug and drug-statin interactions in an outpatient adult population with dyslipidaemia. METHODS: Data from patients with dyslipidaemia treated with a statin were collected from 242 practitioners from different parts of Switzerland. The medication list was screened for potentially harmful DDIs with statins or other drugs using an interactive electronic drug interaction program. RESULTS: We included 2742 ambulatory statin-treated patients (mean age +/- SD 65.1 +/- 11.1 years; 61.6% males) with (mean +/- SD) 3.2 +/- 1.6 diagnoses and 4.9 +/- 2.4 drugs prescribed. Of those, 190 patients (6.9%) had a total of 198 potentially harmful drug-statin interactions. Interacting drugs were fibrates or nicotinic acid (9.5% of patients with drug-statin interactions), cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (70.5%), digoxin (22.6%) or ciclosporin (cyclosporine) [1.6%]. The proportion of patients with a potential drug-statin interaction was 12.1% for simvastatin, 10.0% for atorvastatin, 3.8% for fluvastatin and 0.3% for pravastatin. Additionally, the program identified 393 potentially critical non-statin DDIs in 288 patients. CONCLUSIONS: CYP3A4 inhibitors are the most frequent cause of potential drug interactions with statins. As the risk for developing rhabdomyolysis is increased in patients with drug-statin interactions, clinicians should be aware of the most frequently observed drug-statin interactions and how these interactions can be avoided.",

        "abstract": "Reports of emerging resistance to first-line artemisinin antimalarials make it critical to define resistance mechanisms and identify in vitro correlates of resistance. Here we combine unique in vitro experimental and analytical approaches to mimic in vivo drug exposure in an effort to provide insight into mechanisms of drug resistance. Tightly synchronized parasites exposed to short drug pulses exhibit large stage-dependent differences in their drug response that correlate with hemoglobin digestion throughout most of the asexual cycle. As a result, ring-stage parasites can exhibit >100-fold lower sensitivity to short drug pulses than trophozoites, although we identify a subpopulation of rings (2-4 h postinvasion) that exhibits hypersensitivity. We find that laboratory strains that show little differences in drug sensitivity in standard in vitro assays exhibit substantial (>95-fold) difference in sensitivity when exposed to short drug pulses. These stage- and strain-dependent differences in drug sensitivity reflect differential response lag times with rings exhibiting lag times of up to 4 h. A simple model that assumes that the parasite experiences a saturable effective drug dose describes the complex dependence of parasite viability on both drug concentration and exposure time and is used to demonstrate that small changes in the parasite's drug response profile can dramatically alter the sensitivity to artemisinins. This work demonstrates that effective resistance can arise from the interplay between the short in vivo half-life of the drug and the stage-specific lag time and provides the framework for understanding the mechanisms of drug action and parasite resistance.",

A brief, four-item screening instrument, called the rapid drug problems screen (RDPS), was developed from a similar instrument for alcohol use disorders, the rapid alcohol problems screen (RAPS). Performance of the RDPS was evaluated against DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for drug dependence and for dependence or abuse in a sample of 703 emergency department patients in Mexico City. Among males, sensitivity and specificity were 91 and 96%, respectively, for dependence and 93 and 96%, respectively, for dependence or abuse. Neither of the two females meeting diagnostic criteria for dependence or abuse were identified by the RDPS. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve indicates an optimum cut point of 1. The data suggest that the RDPS may hold promise as a brief screening instrument for substance use among males, but should be tested in larger populations of females meeting diagnostic criteria for drug use disorders, and across ethnic subgroups in other geographic locales. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "Cancer chemoprevention is a new approach in the management of cancer. Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic approaches cannot cure most advanced solid malignancies. Chemoprevention can be defined as the use of non-cytotoxic drugs and natural agents to block the progression to invasive cancer. Chemoprevention can either prevent DNA damage that initiates the neoplastic transformation process or reverses the progression of pre-invasive lesions. Epidemiological observations, experimental evidence from animal carcinogenesis models, knock-out models, cancer cell lines and clinical trials have shown the efficacy of this approach. Recent advances in our understanding of carcinogenesis have led to the synthesis of new drugs that target specific receptors. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs target the prostaglandin pathway. The identification of the role of cyclooxygenase-2 in epithelial carcinogenesis led to the synthesis of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (Celecoxib). Celecoxib was subsequently approved for the prevention of colon polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis after the completion of a randomized clinical trial. The large chemoprevention clinical trial with the selective estrogen receptor modulator, tamoxifen, showed the benefit of tamoxifen in the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk women. Retinoids and rexinoids target the retinoid receptors and have a role in chemoprevention of aerodigestive, hepatic and cervical neoplasia. Selenium, an inhibitor of the glutathione peroxidase system, is being tested in the chemoprevention of prostate cancer and lung cancer. The different isoforms of vitamin E (tocopherols) may be chemopreventive. Recent evidence indicates that gamma-tocopherol may be a more powerful chemopreventive than the alpha-tocopherol. The review details the rationale, experimental and clinical evidence and the drug targets of the chemopreventive agents that are currently in various phases of clinical development.",

        "abstract": "KB-R7943 (2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea methanesulfonate) is a potent and selective Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange (NCX) inhibitor that is 3-fold more inhibitory to NCX3 than to NCX1 or NCX2. Here we searched for amino acid residues that may form the KB-R7943 receptor in the exchanger by analyzing the function of chimeras between NCX1 and NCX3 as well as of their site-directed mutants. We found that the highly conserved alpha-2 repeat of the exchanger is almost exclusively responsible for the difference in drug response of the isoforms. Such difference was mostly reproduced by single substitutions of residues in the alpha-2 repeat (V820G or Q826V in NCX1 and A809V or A809I in NCX3), suggesting their importance in drug sensitivity. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis of the alpha-2 repeat of NCX1 identified one residue (Gly833) that caused a large (> or = 30-fold) reduction in drug sensitivity. We found that the Gly-to-Thr substitution caused even larger reduction in drug sensitivity. Interestingly, extracellularly applied KB-R7943 at 0.8 microM markedly inhibited the whole-cell outward exchange current, whereas the drug applied intracellularly at 30 microM did not. These results suggest that KB-R7943 inhibits the exchanger from the external side in intact cells and that a region of the alpha-2 repeat of NCX1 containing Gly833 may participate in the formation of the drug receptor. Because we suggested previously that Gly833 is accessible from the inside of a cell, the results raised an interesting possibility that this residue may alter its position during Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange in such a way that it becomes accessible to external drug.",

Using temperature-sensitive liposomes (TSLs) is one way to achieve this; the liposome acts as a protective carrier, allowing increased drug to flow through the bloodstream by minimizing clearance and non-specific uptake. On reaching microvessels within a heated tumor, the drug is released and quickly penetrates. A major advance in the field is ThermoDox\u00ae (Celsion), demonstrating significant improvements to the drug release rates and drug uptake in heated tumors (\u223c 41\u00b0C). Most recently, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been combined with TSL drug delivery to provide localized chemotherapy with simultaneous quantification of drug release within the tumor.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: In this article the field of hyperthermia-induced drug delivery is discussed, with an emphasis on the development of TSLs and their combination with hyperthermia (both mild and ablative) in cancer therapy. State-of-the-art image-guided heating technologies used with this combination strategy will also be presented, with examples of real-time monitoring of drug delivery and prediction of efficacy.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The specific delivery of drugs by combining hyperthermia with TSLs is showing great promise in the clinic and its potential will be even greater as the use of image-guided focused ultrasound becomes more widespread - a technique capable of penetrating deep within the body to heat a specific area with improved control. In conjunction with this, it is anticipated that multifunctional TSLs will be a major topic of study in this field.",

Methods: QTc (Fridericia correction) was calculated from bipolar transventricular electrograms. Hearts were exposed to escalating concentrations of 26 compounds thought to lengthen, and 13 compounds thought not to lengthen, QTc in humans. Results: In this preparation, QTc was found to lengthen in 26 of 26 compounds thought to be positive (sensitivity 1.00) and not to lengthen or to lengthen insignificantly in 13 of 13 compounds thought to be negative (specificity 1.0) in man. Probucol and ontazolast could not be studied because of limited solubility. Successful experiments were conducted on over 98% of guinea pigs anesthetized. Discussion: We believe that the isolated perfused guinea pig heart is an in vitro preparation that could be utilized early in preclinical testing for identifying a liability to lengthen QTc in humans, but we do not believe - as is true also for other in vitro methods - that the concentration at which the liability is demonstrated in vitro necessarily predicts the concentration at which a liability exists in man. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Together with drug metabolising enzymes, transmembrane transporters are important determinants of drug metabolism and drug clearance by the liver. Hepatic uptake of organic anions, cations, prostaglandins and bile salts is supported by dedicated transporter proteins in the basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane of hepatocytes: OATPs, OATs, OCTs, PGTs and NTCP, respectively. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes mediate the hepatic efflux of drugs, bile salts and metabolites against a steep concentration gradient from liver to bile. This transport is driven by ATP hydrolysis. Drugs, endogenous metabolites, bile salts and cytokines affect the expression levels of these transporters. They act through a family of ligand-activated transcription factors, the nuclear hormone receptors. Consequently, the levels of the various transporter proteins are subject to genetic polymorphism in the encoding genes as well as in these transcription factors. Adverse drug reactions may be caused by genetic or disease-induced variations of transporter expression or drug-drug interactions at the level of these transporters.",

        "abstract": "Even though the therapeutic efficacy of numerous antimicrobial drugs has been well established, inefficient delivery can result in an inadequate therapeutic index. Gold nanoparticles have unique physicochemical properties such as large surface area to mass ratio and functionalizable structure. These properties can be applied to facilitate the administration of antimicrobial drugs, thereby overcoming some of the limitations in traditional antimicrobial therapeutics. In this study, gold nanospheres were used as a drug carrier system for gentamicin delivery to Staphylococcal infected foci. Conjugation of gentamicin with gold nanospheres was performed in HEPES buffer. The attachment of gentamicin to gold nanospheres was confirmed by UV/Vis spectroscopy. The HPLC and atomic absorption spectrometer analyses showed that 347 gentamicin molecules were attached to each gold nanosphere. Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration studies showed the enhanced antibacterial effect of gentamicin-gold nanospheres complex in comparison with free gentamicin. The biodistribution study showed the localization of the complex at the site of Staphylococcal infection foci with high sensitivity in mouse model.",

        "abstract": "The terms 'adverse drug effects' and 'adverse drug reactions' are commonly used interchangeably, but they have different implications. Adverse drug reactions arise when a compound (e.g. a drug or metabolite, a contaminant or adulterant) is distributed in the same place as a body tissue (e.g. a receptor, enzyme, or ion channel), and the encounter results in an adverse effect (a physiological or pathological change), which results in a clinically appreciable adverse reaction. Both the adverse effect and the adverse reaction have manifestations by which they can be recognized: adverse effects are usually detected by laboratory tests (e.g. biochemical, haematological, immunological, radiological, pathological) or by clinical investigations (e.g. endoscopy, cardiac catheterization), and adverse reactions by their clinical manifestations (symptoms and/or signs). This distinction suggests five scenarios: (i) adverse reactions can result directly from adverse effects; (ii) adverse effects may not lead to appreciable adverse reactions; (iii) adverse reactions can occur without preceding adverse effects; (iv) adverse effects and reactions may be dissociated; and (v) adverse effects and reactions can together constitute syndromes. Defining an adverse drug reaction as \"an appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product\" suggests a definition of an adverse drug effect: \"a potentially harmful effect resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product, which constitutes a hazard and may or may not be associated with a clinically appreciable adverse reaction and/or an abnormal laboratory test or clinical investigation, as a marker of an adverse reaction.\"",

        "abstract": "Cancer patients often show heterogeneous drug responses such that only a small subset of patients is sensitive to a given anticancer drug. With the availability of large-scale genomic profiling via next-generation sequencing, it is now economically feasible to profile the whole transcriptome and genome of individual patients in order to identify their unique genetic mutations and differentially expressed genes, which are believed to be responsible for heterogeneous drug responses. Although subtyping analysis has identified patient subgroups sharing common biomarkers, there is no effective method to predict the drug response of individual patients precisely and reliably. Herein, we propose a novel computational algorithm to predict the drug response of individual patients based on personal genomic profiles, as well as pharmacogenomic and drug sensitivity data. Specifically, more than 600 cancer cell lines (viewed as individual patients) across over 50 types of cancers and their responses to 75 drugs were obtained from the genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer database. The drug-specific sensitivity signatures were determined from the changes in genomic profiles of individual cell lines in response to a specific drug. The optimal drugs for individual cell lines were predicted by integrating the votes from other cell lines. The experimental results show that the proposed drug prediction algorithm can be used to improve greatly the reliability of finding optimal drugs for individual patients and will, thus, form a key component in the precision medicine infrastructure for oncology care.",

        "abstract": "Several reports in the literature present the utility and value of in vitro drug-metabolizing enzyme inhibition data to predict in vivo drug-drug interactions in humans. A retrospective analysis has been conducted for 26 GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) drugs and drug candidates for which in vitro inhibition parameters have been determined, and clinical drug interaction information, from a total of 46 studies, is available. The dataset, for drugs with a diverse range of physiochemical properties, included both reversible and potentially irreversible cytochrome P450 inhibitors for which in vitro inhibition parameters (IC(50) or K(I)/k(inact) as appropriate) were determined using standardized methodologies. Mechanistic static models that differentiated reversible and metabolism-dependent inhibition, and also considered the contribution of intestinal metabolism for CYP3A4 substrates, were applied to estimate the magnitude of the interactions. Several pharmacokinetic parameters, including total C(max), unbound C(max), as well as estimates of hepatic inlet and liver concentration, were used as surrogates for the inhibitor concentration at the enzyme active site. The results suggest that estimated unbound liver concentration or unbound hepatic inlet concentration, with consideration of intestinal contribution, offered the most accurate predictions of drug-drug interactions (occurrence and magnitude) for the drugs in this dataset. When used with epidemiological information on comedication profiles for a given therapeutic area, these analyses offer a quantitative risk assessment strategy to inform the necessity of excluding specific comedications in early clinical studies and the ultimate requirement for clinical drug-drug interaction studies. This strategy has significantly reduced the number of clinical drug interaction studies performed at GSK.",

        "abstract": "Given the limitations of self-reports on drug use, testing for drugs of abuse is important for most clinical and forensic toxicological situations, both for assessing the reality of the intoxication and for evaluation of the level of drug impairment. It is generally accepted that chemical testing of biological fluids is the most objective means of diagnosis of drug use. The presence of a drug analyte in a biological specimen can be used to document exposure. The standard in drug testing is the immunoassay screen, followed by the gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric confirmation conducted on a urine sample. In recent years, remarkable advances in sensitive analytical techniques have enabled the analysis of drugs in unconventional biological specimens such as hair. The advantages of this sample over traditional media, like urine and blood, are obvious: collection is noninvasive, relatively easy to perform, and in forensic situations it may be achieved under close supervision of law enforcement officers to prevent adulteration or substitution. The window of drug detection is dramatically extended to weeks, months or even years when testing hair. It seems that the value of alternative specimen analysis for the identification of drug users is steadily gaining recognition. This can be seen from its growing use in preemployment screening, in forensic sciences, in clinical applications and for doping control. Hair analysis may be a useful adjunct to conventional drug testing in urine. Methods for evading urinalysis do not affect hair analysis. The aim of this review is to document toxicological applications of hair analysis in drug detection",

In this study, we designed primer/probe sets targeting repetitive Alu repeats or Alu-equivalent sequences in the human, Chinese hamster and murine genomes. When used in quantitative polymerase chain reactions (Q-PCRs), these primer/probe sets showed high species specificity and gave significantly higher sensitivity compared to those targeting the low copy number GAPDH gene. This allowed for detection of residual host cell DNA of much lower concentrations and, for some samples, eliminated the need for DNA extraction. By combining the high sensitivity Alu Q-PCR with high throughput automated DNA extraction using an automated MagMAX magnetic particle processor, we successfully developed and qualified a highly accurate, specific, sensitive and efficient method for the quantitation of residual host cell DNA in process intermediates and drug substances of multiple therapeutic proteins purified from cells of multiple species. Compared to the previous method using manual DNA extraction and primer/probe sets targeting the GAPDH gene, this new method increased our DNA extraction throughput by over sevenfold, and lowered the lower limit of quantitation by up to eightfold. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

The effects of long-term treatment with imipramine or mirtazapine, two antidepressant drugs with different mechanisms of action, on the response of cortical cholinergic neurons to foot-shock stress or to the anxiogenic drug FG 7142 were investigated in freely moving rats. Chronic treatment with imipramine or mirtazapine reduced the increase in cortical acetylcholine output induced by foot-shock stress by ???50%. The same treatment also reduced the sensitivity of cortical cholinergic neurons to the stimulatory effect of acute administration of FG 7142. In contrast, the administration of a single dose of either antidepressant 40 min before foot shock or FG 7142 injection failed to increase the threshold of excitability of cortical cholinergic neurons. These results demonstrate that long-term treatment with either imipramine or mirtazapine reduces the sensitivity of cortical cholinergic neurons to stress or to an anxiogenic drug with an efficacy similar to that of acute administration of benzodiazepines. The neurochemical mechanism responsible for regulation of cholinergic neuron sensitivity might contribute to the modulation of cognitive function associated with emotional and affective disorders. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Consideration of some of the key issues and concerns derived from these efforts suggests that three major hurdles loom in front of using xenobiotic metabolism databases more effectively in the future. These hurdles include: the need for an improved treatment of chemical structure in three-dimensions (3D); a better quantitative accounting of competitive and complementary biotransformation pathways; and, the critical need for a comprehensive, human drug metabolism database (hDMdb) that can serve as a bio/chemoinformatic resource pertaining to drug metabolism and drug metabolism-related drug-drug interactions in general. Approaches that might be taken to traverse each of these hurdles are discussed herein where: the first involves maturation of chemical structures from simple 2D entries into more sophisticated 3D displays that can also account for interactions with relevant biological surfaces; the second involves a systematic, pair-wise comparison of various metabolic options in a statistically driven manner relative to chemical structure descriptors; and, the third involves mounting a hDMdb on the Internet in a user-friendly manner that it is available via a non-profit format.",

        "abstract": "Unidimensional subscales for assessment of major depression may be more sensitive to antidepressant drug effects than the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). To further examine this possibility, we analyzed pooled data from eight comparable, well-controlled clinical trials of venlafaxine and compared such subscales and the 17-item HAM-D (HAM-D17) based on effect size and number of patients required for 80% power. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the HAM-D among intent-to-treat patients (2045) randomly assigned to receive venlafaxine (immediate release, n=474; extended release, n=377), one of several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (n=748), or placebo (n=446) for up to 8 weeks. With SSRIs or venlafaxine vs. placebo, subscales yielded effect sizes (0.328-0.528) 16 to 76% larger than the HAM-D17 did (0.237 and 0.396, respectively), and required 31 to 64% fewer patients for 80% power. With venlafaxine vs. SSRIs, the subscales showed no advantage over the HAM-D17; all devices yielded comparable, positive effect sizes (0.183-0.195). Final subscale scores significantly predicted (all P<0.05) whether patients met criteria for remission (eg, HAM-D17 score of ???7). These findings suggest that unidimensional subscales are more sensitive to antidepressant drug effects than the HAM-D17 is, but only in active agent/placebo comparisons. Our data further suggest the subscales can predict the presence of remission. Given these findings, prudent use of these subscales may be appropriate, cost-effective, and informative. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The 5-HT3 receptor is rapidly potentiated by ethanol and mediates fast excitatory serotonin (5-HT) transmission that modulates dopamine release in the reward circuitry. The 5-HT transporter regulates synaptic 5-HT availability. Functional polymorphisms in genes encoding the transporter and receptor may therefore influence addiction vulnerability. In this study, 360 treatment-seeking African American male patients with single and comorbid DSM-IV lifetime diagnoses of alcohol, cocaine and heroin dependence and 187 African American male controls were genotyped for the triallelic 5-HTTLPR functional polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter gene (SLC6A4) and 16 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across HTR3B (including the functional rs1176744 Tyr129Ser) and HTR3A, genes encoding 5-HT3 receptors. The HTR3B rs1176744 gain-of-function Ser129 allele predicted alcohol dependence (P=0.002) and low 5-HTTLPR activity predicted cocaine/heroin dependence (P=0.01). Both the HTR3B Ser129 allele (P=0.014, odds ratio (OR)=1.7 (1.1-2.6)) and low 5-HTTLPR activity (P=0.011, OR=2.5 (1.3-4.6)) were more common in men with alcohol+drug dependence compared with controls. Moreover, the HTR3B Ser129 allele and low 5-HTTLPR activity had an additive (but not an interactive) effect on alcohol+drug dependence (OR=6.0 (2.1-16.6)) that accounted for 13% of the variance. One possible explanation of our findings is that increased synaptic 5-HT coupled with increased 5-HT3 receptor responsiveness may result in enhanced dopamine transmission in the reward pathway, a predictor of increased risk for addiction. Our results may have pharmacogenetic implications for 5-HT3 therapeutic antagonists such as ondansetron.",

        "abstract": "ErbB2 is frequently activated in tumors, and influences a wide array of cellular functions, including proliferation, apoptosis, cell motility and adhesion. HKI-272 (neratinib) is a small molecule pan-kinase inhibitor of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and shows strong antiproliferative activity in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. We undertook a genome-wide pooled lentiviral RNAi screen to identify synthetic lethal or enhancer (synthetic modulator screen) genes that interact with neratinib in a human breast cancer cell line (SKBR-3). These genes upon knockdown would modulate cell viability in the presence of subeffective concentrations of neratinib. We discovered a diverse set of genes whose depletion selectively impaired or enhanced the viability of SKBR-3 cells in the presence of neratinib. We observed diverse pathways including EGFR, hypoxia, cAMP, and protein ubiquitination that, when co-treated with RNAi and neratinib, resulted in arrest of cell proliferation. Examining the changes of these genes and their protein products also led to a rationale for clinically relevant drug combination treatments. Treatment of cells with either paclitaxel or cytarabine in combination with neratinib resulted in a strong antiproliferative effect. The identification of novel mediators of cellular response to neratinib and the development of potential drug combination treatments have expanded our understanding of neratinib's mode-of-action for the development of more effective therapeutic regimens. Notably, our findings support a paclitaxel and neratinib phase III clinical trial in breast cancer patients.",

Since the restenosis process involves several different biological responses, the ability to deliver the right drugs at the right times is critical for further development of the second generation of DESs. As the type of drugs that can be delivered from DESs varies, it is imperative to understand the drug delivery mechanisms and the approaches available for drug coating on the stents.

Immunocytes (including mononuclear phagocytes (dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages), neutrophils and lymphocytes) are highly mobile; they can migrate across impermeable barriers and release their drug cargo at sites of infection or tissue injury. Thus, immune cells can be exploited as Trojan horses for drug delivery.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This paper reviews how immunocytes laden with drugs can cross the blood-brain or blood-tumor barriers to facilitate treatments for infectious diseases, injury, cancer, or inflammatory diseases. The promises and perils of cell-mediated drug delivery are reviewed, with examples of how immunocytes can be harnessed to improve therapeutic end points.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Using cells as delivery vehicles enables targeted drug transport and prolonged circulation times, along with reductions in cell and tissue toxicities. Such systems for drug carriage and targeted release represent a new disease-combating strategy being applied to a spectrum of human disorders. The design of nanocarriers for cell-mediated drug delivery may differ from those used for conventional drug delivery systems; nevertheless, engaging different defense mechanisms in drug delivery may open new perspectives for the active delivery of drugs.",

As we demonstrate, molecules are not 'frozen statues' but 'dancing ballerinas', and several of their computable physicochemical properties are conformation-dependent and lead to the concept of property spaces. Molecular sensitivity (namely, how much a given computable physicochemical property varies as a function of flexibility) appears as a promising descriptor to encode some of the information contained in molecular property spaces.",

        "abstract": "Preclinical Research Cellular proteins are the mediators of multiple organism functions being involved in physiological mechanisms and disease. By discovering lead compounds that affect the function of target proteins, the target diseases or physiological mechanisms can be modulated. Based on knowledge of the ligand-receptor interaction, the chemical structures of leads can be modified to improve efficacy, selectivity and reduce side effects. One rational drug design technology, which enables drug discovery based on knowledge of target structures, functional properties and mechanisms, is computer-aided drug design (CADD). The application of CADD can be cost-effective using experiments to compare predicted and actual drug activity, the results from which can used iteratively to improve compound properties. The two major CADD-based approaches are structure-based drug design, where protein structures are required, and ligand-based drug design, where ligand and ligand activities can be used to design compounds interacting with the protein structure. Approaches in structure-based drug design include docking, de novo design, fragment-based drug discovery and structure-based pharmacophore modeling. Approaches in ligand-based drug design include quantitative structure-affinity relationship and pharmacophore modeling based on ligand properties. Based on whether the structure of the receptor and its interaction with the ligand are known, different design strategies can be seed. After lead compounds are generated, the rule of five can be used to assess whether these have drug-like properties. Several quality validation methods, such as cost function analysis, Fisher's cross-validation analysis and goodness of hit test, can be used to estimate the metrics of different drug design strategies. To further improve CADD performance, multi-computers and graphics processing units may be applied to reduce costs. 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Research into the biology of aging is generating many novel targets for drug development that may delay all age-related diseases and be used long term by the entire population. Drugs that successfully delay the aging process will clearly become \"blockbusters.\" To date, the most promising leads have come from studies of the cellular pathways mediating the longevity effects of caloric restriction (CR), particularly target of rapamycin and the sirtuins. Similar research into pathways governing other hormetic responses that influence aging is likely to yield even more targets. As aging becomes a more attractive target for drug development, there will be increasing demand to develop biomarkers of aging as surrogate outcomes for the testing of the effects of new agents on the aging process.",

Among the different forms of drug interactions that are known, inhibition of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes is the most common cause of drug-drug or drug-botanical interactions. Therefore, a rapid and comprehensive mass spectrometry-based in vitro high-throughput P450 cocktail inhibition assay was developed that uses 10 substrates simultaneously against nine CYP isoforms. Including probe substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and two probes targeting different binding sites of CYP3A4/5, this cocktail simultaneously assesses at least as many P450 enzymes as previous assays while remaining among the fastest due to short incubation times and rapid analysis using ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method was validated using known inhibitors of each P450 enzyme and then shown to be useful not only for single-compound testing but also for the evaluation of potential drug-botanical interactions using the botanical dietary supplement licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) as an example.",

        "abstract": "Recently there has been an increase in Australian public funds for drug education. The accompanying rhetoric asserts that it is to enable\u00a0 abstinence among young people. This contradicts some State Government education guidelines endorsing harm minimization. A literature search of the key electronic databases, drug agency libraries, the Internet and\u00a0 reference lists identified evaluation research in school-based drug education. There is little evidence to support the new public rhetoric. The predictors of adolescent drug use are social and personal; schools can have little effect on these. Four models of drug education are described. Schools, however, mix-and-match activities from different models, and exposure is too slight for major effects on behaviours. Although methodological difficulties affect findings, none of the drug education models show consistent behavioural effects over time. There is a mismatch between the new public rhetoric and the\u00a0 evaluation research literature. Reasons for this are explored, including that there are two stakeholder groups, one with exaggerated ideological anti-drug messages and the other with more realistic perspectives about what schools can reasonably achieve. The paradox is that the rhetoric is needed for continued funding, yet this same rhetoric sets up criteria which doom drug education to failure.",

AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the current status and utilization of various micro- as well as nanocarriers like microspheres/microparticles, liposomes, nanoparticles, dendrimers, niosomes, and carbon nanotubes for targeted delivery of bioactives to the macrophages. EXPERT OPINION: The design of nanocarriers for cell-mediated drug delivery may differ from those used for conventional drug delivery systems. The literature review shows that nanocarriers could supplement sustained drug delivery to the macrophages, extended duration of action, reduced therapeutic dose, improved patient compliance, and reduced adverse effects of highly toxic, potent drugs. There is still a need to identify more specific receptors that are responsible for macrophage targeting. The identification of such receptors may also facilitate drug targeting to further specific parts of the body containing different types of macrophages.",

Matching drugs and cancer patients has proven to be a complex challenge, due in large part to the substantial molecular heterogeneity inherent to human cancers. This is not only a major hurdle to the improvement of the use of current treatments but also for the development of novel therapies and the ability to steer them to the relevant clinical indications. In this commentary we discuss recent studies from Kuo et al., published this month in BMC Medicine, in which they used a panel of cancer cell lines as a model for capturing patient heterogeneity at the genomic and proteomic level in order to identify potential biomarkers for predicting the clinical activity of a novel candidate chemotherapeutic across a patient population. The findings highlight the ability of a 'systems approach' to develop a better understanding of the properties of novel candidate therapeutics and to guide clinical testing and application.See the associated research paper by Kuo et al: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/7/77.",

Network science studies their parameters, or quantitative indicators; its instruments make it possible to draw and analyze networks from a mathematical perspective. The present study is an attempt to apply network science techniques to the drug prescription process, a typical subject of Epidemiology for Public Health studies. METHODS: A drug prescription network was created using the set of drug prescriptions written during a 6-month period by a group of 99 general practitioners (GPs) operating in Italy. In this network, named co-prescription network, each drug represented a node, and different drugs prescribed to the same patient at the same moment were considered linked together. Drug prescription data for a total of 42 965 patients and 631 232 drug packages were studied. A number of co-prescription networks were obtained and analyzed on the basis of different subsets of patients by age and gender. The network parameters were measured and compared for the various subsets. RESULTS: All the drug prescription networks studied showed scale invariance behavior. The age- and gender-related co-prescription networks showed different patterns, with different levels of complexity. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that the drug prescription process has specific network aspects and dynamics and, more generally, that it is possible to apply instruments of network science to study public health phenomena from a new, different perspective. Further studies should be encouraged and performed.",

        "title": "Integrins as novel drug targets for overcoming innate drug resistance.",
        "abstract": "Acquired drug resistance continues to be one of the major obstacles hindering the successful treatment of many forms of cancer. Compounds utilized as antagonists of these cytoprotective mechanisms have, for the most part, proven to be ineffective at overcoming clinical resistance to cytotoxic drugs. Recently, the tumor cell microenvironment has been found to have a significant bearing on the survival of tumor cells following exposure to a wide variety of anti-neoplastic agents, prior to the acquisition of known drug resistance mechanisms. Specifically, interactions between cell surface integrins and extracellular matrix components have been shown to be responsible for this phenomenon of innate drug resistance, which we have termed Cell Adhesion Mediated Drug Resistance, or CAM-DR. Following its discovery using a multiple myeloma cell line model, evidence for CAM-DR has been found in a multitude of other human tumor cell types. In contrast to many other drug resistance mechanisms, integrin-mediated cell signaling is capable of protecting against death induced by an extremely wide variety of structurally and functionally diverse agents from traditional DNA damaging agents to the promising novel kinase inhibitor STI-571. This review examines the role of integrins in regard to their ability to protect tumor cells from drug- and radiation-induced apoptosis through numerous intracellular mechanisms. Current and future antagonists of specific integrin heterodimers may have the potential to sensitize tumor cells when used in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens. Specific signal transduction pathways initiated by integrin ligation will also be discussed as potential bridge points for inhibiting cell survival during cytotoxic drug exposure.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe non-curable illness of the brain with serious consequences if not properly treated and kept under control. Antipsychotic drugs have revolutionised the therapy and management of schizophrenia. However, patient compliance rates are notoriously poor due to the nature of the disease and troublesome side-effects, and are major causes of symptom recurrence. Although some new antipsychotic agents have been marketed to offer broader efficacy with much reduced side-effect profiles, the drug delivery systems for antipsychotics are still in the stage of conventional dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules and solutions, and need to be dosed at the frequency of 2-4 times daily. Doubtless. novel drug delivery systems, such as sustained and controlled release systems, will be useful for antipsychotics. They should reduce the frequency of dosing. enhance drug bioavailability and improve patient compliance. In this article, the specificity and characterisation of schizophrenia and pathophysiology. drug therapy. and the development and future prospects of neuroleptic drug delivery systems are reviewed.",

The microcapsules also have a mucoadhesive property. Ion-exchange resin particles can be loaded with bicarbonate followed by acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) and coated with CAB by emulsion solvent evaporation method. The drug concentration was monitored to maintain the floating property and minimum effective concentration. The effect of CAB: drug-resin ratio (2:1, 4:1, 6:1 w/w) on the particle size, floating time, and drug release was determined. Cholestyramine microcapsules were characterized for shape, surface characteristics, and size distribution; cholestyramine/acetohydroxamic acid interactions inside microcapsules were investigated by X-ray diffractometry. The buoyancy time of CAB-coated formulations was better than that of uncoated resin particles. Also, a longer floating time was observed with a higher polymer:drug resin complex ratio (6:1). With increasing coating thickness the particle size was increased but drug release rate was decreased. The drug release rate was higher in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) than in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). The in vivo mucoadhesion studies were performed with rhodamine-isothiocyanate (RITC) by fluorescent probe method. The amount of CAB-coated cholestyramine microcapsules that remained in the stomach was slightly lower than that of uncoated resin particles. Cholestyramine microcapsules were distributed throughout the stomach and exhibited prolonged gastric residence via mucoadhesion. These results suggest that CAB-coated microcapsules could be a floating as well as a mucoadhesive drug delivery system. Thus, it has promise in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori.",

The fluorescence, (1)H NMR, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques were utilized to confirm the formation of micelles. The optical transmittance and US-DSC measurements demonstrated that the micelles performed the reversible dispersion/aggregation behavior in response to temperature through the outer PNIPAAm polymer shell. The micelles loaded with daidzein showed a very rapid drug release speed at temperatures above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) due to the temperature-induced structural change of the polymeric micelles.",

Assembly of the capsular systems consisted of push, active and plug tablet arranged from bottom to top in hard gelatin capsule. The capsule system was coated with a semi-permeable membrane of cellulose acetate and drilled towards plug side in cap. A three-factor, three-level central composite design (CCD) with alpha = 1 was introduced to execute the experiments and quadratic polynomial model was generated to predict and assess the independent variables with respect to the dependent variables. The composition of optimal formulation was determined as weight of push tablet 138 mg (coded value: +0.59), plug tablet 60 mg (coded value: +0.49) and coating weight gain of 8.4 mg (coded value: -0.82). The results showed that the optimal formulation of PRCs had lag time of 4.5 h, release at 6 and 12 h are 61.95% and 96.29%, respectively. The X-ray radiographic imaging study was carried out to monitor the in vivo behavior of developed barium sulfate-loaded PRCs in rabbits under fasting conditions. In vivo pharmacokinetic study revealed Tmax of 2 h for marketed tablets; however 7 h for PRCs with initial lag time of 4 h. Thus designed capsular system may be helpful for patients with episodic attack of asthma in early morning and associated allergic rhinitis.",

Dissolution profiles were evaluated by the Weibull parameters and the modified fit factor, f^(1,area). The in vitro-in vivo relationship of CBZ tablets was examined. Compared with the results from the USP and Chinese Pharmacopoeia monograph, the proposed system provides a superior discriminatory method. Since the dissolution method in pharmacopoeia for CBZ tablets is unable to distinguish between a good and a bad product, the method presented here can be used for the quality control testing of CBZ tablets.",

A central composite design was applied for optimization of the formulation parameters and for studying the effects of three independent variables: PLGA concentration, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) concentration and organic solvent removal rate on the particle size and the entrapment efficiency (response variables). Second-order models were obtained to adequately describe the influence of the independent variables on the selected responses. The analysis of variance showed that the three independent variables had significant effects (p < 0.05) on the responses. The experimental results were in perfect accordance with the predictions estimated by the models. Using the desirability approach and overlay contour plots, the optimal preparation area can be highlighted. It was found that the optimum values of the responses could be obtained at higher concentration of PLGA (5%, w/v) and PVA (6%, w/v); and faster organic solvent removal rate (700 rpm). The corresponding particle size was 256.2 nm and the entrapment efficiency was 62.19%. FTIR investigation confirmed that the L-DOPA and PLGA polymer maintained its backbone structure in the fabrication of nanoparticles. The scanning electron microscopic images of nanoparticles showed that all particles had spherical shape with porous outer skin. The results suggested that PLGA nanoparticles might represent a promising formulation for brain delivery of L-DOPA. The preparation of L-DOPA loaded PLGA nanoparticles can be optimized by the central composite design.",

        "abstract": "The triple receptor-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype is characterized by the lack of expression of both hormone receptors as well as lack of over-expression and/or lack of gene amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Approximately 10--15% of breast carcinomas are known to be of the TNBC subtype, which constitutes approximately 80% of all `basal-like tumours'. Risk factors for TNBC include young age at breast cancer diagnosis, young age at menarche, high parity, lack of breast feeding, high body mass index and African American ethnicity. The majority of BRCA1 tumours are TNBC. TNBC has a worse prognosis and tends to relapse early compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Conversely, it displays increased chemosensitivity compared with other breast tumour subtypes. Several agents are currently being investigated as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of women with TNBC including agents targeted against EGFR, anti-angiogenic agents, multityrosine kinase inhibitors and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. This review focuses on the epidemiology of TNBC, its pathological features, natural history and recurrence patterns as well as current and future management options.",

Here we review the informatics approaches required to build a complete catalogue of known drug targets. Objective: Using Pfizer's internal target database as a narrative, we review the steps involved in the construction of an integrated, enterprise target-informatics system. We consider how compiling the drug target universe requires integration across several resources such as competitor intelligence and pharmacological activity databases, as well as input from techniques such as text-mining. In particular, we address data standards and the complexities of representing targets in a structured ontology as well as opportunities for future development. Conclusion: Drug target-orientated databases address important areas of drug discovery such as chemogenomics, drug/candidate repurposing and business intelligence. As research in industry and academia drives continued expansion of the druggable genome, it is crucial that such systems be maintained to provide an accurate picture of the landscape. This power of this information stretches beyond drug discovery and into the wider scientific community where small molecule tool compounds can enable the dissection of complex cellular pathways.",

Overuse or misuse especially of newer and higher antimicrobials (AM) is of particular concern, as this contributes to development of resistance among microorganisms. To check this trend, the Reserve Drug Indent Form (RDIF) was introduced in our hospital and its impact on AM consumption, cost of therapy and the sensitivity pattern was studied in the medical intensive care unit (MICU).\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study in the medical ICU of a tertiary care hospital from July 2012 to August 2013. From March 2013, RDIF was made mandatory to be filled up prior to prescribing reserve antimicrobials. AM consumption (expressed as DDD/100 bed days) and sensitivity pattern (expressed in percentage) six months prior to and six months after implementation of the form were analysed.\\n\\nRESULTS: The total Reserve AM consumption was 125.79 per 100 bed days during the study period. Average occupancy index was 0.50 and length of ICU stay was 6 days. The total consumption reduced from 85.55/100 to 40.24/100 bed days after the introduction of the RDIF. However, Imipenem usage increased from 11.35/100 to 23.94/100 bed days, which can be attributed to sensitivity profile to Imipenem (82.1%) compared to Meropenem (65.7%). Cost of therapy reduced from Rs 6,27,951 to 4,20,469.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Reserve AM consumption showed a declining trend after introduction of the RDIF. Hence, the RDIF served as an important tool to combat inappropriate use, reducing the cost burden and also helped to improve the sensitivity to reserve drugs.",

        "abstract": "Along with minimal toxicity, good drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) properties are essential for the clinical success of a drug candidate. A major cause of failure of orally administered drugs during their development is the discovery that in humans they have low intestinal absorption and/or high clearance causing low and variable bioavailability. In addition, drug interactions and the presence of active metabolites can prevent or complicate their successful development. With poor pharmacokinetics it can be difficult to achieve a suitable dosage regimen for the required pharmacodynamic action. The main role of DMPK in discovery is, therefore, the prediction of human pharmacokinetics and metabolism. Reducing the rate of attrition during drug discovery and development is now considered essential, particularly as it is now possible to screen an ever-greater number of compounds.",

The water uptake capacity depended on the nature of beads (coated or uncoated) and pH of test medium. The number of coatings given to the beads influenced ciprofloxacin release rate. The coating significantly decreased the drug release from the beads in comparison to uncoated beads (p < 0.001). When the beads were given three coatings, viz., alginate, chitosan, and again alginate, the drug release appeared to follow the pattern exhibited by colon-targeted drug delivery systems with time dependent release behavior. The increase in coating formed a barrier for easy ingress of dissolution medium into the bead matrix, reducing the diffusion of drug.",

        "abstract": "Expression and activity of several key drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and transporters are altered in various pathophysiological conditions, leading to altered drug metabolism and disposition. This can have profound impact on the pharmacotherapy of widely used clinically relevant medications in terms of safety and efficacy by causing inter-individual variabilities in drug responses. This review article highlights altered drug disposition in inflammation and infectious diseases, and commonly encountered disorders such as cancer, obesity/diabetes, fatty liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. Many of the clinically relevant drugs have a narrow therapeutic index. Thus any changes in the disposition of these drugs may lead to reduced efficacy and increased toxicity. The implications of changes in DMEs and transporters on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of clinically-relevant medications are also discussed. Inflammation-mediated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) are known to play a major role in down-regulation of DMEs and transporters. Although the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear, several studies have shown that inflammation-associated cell-signaling pathway and its interaction with basal transcription factors and nuclear receptors in regulation of DMEs and transporters play a significant role in altered drug metabolism. Altered regulation of DMEs and transporters in a multitude of disease states will contribute towards future development of powerful in vitro and in vivo tools in predicting the drug response and opt for better drug design and development. The goal is to facilitate a better understanding of the mechanistic details underlying the regulation of DMEs and transporters in pathophysiological conditions.",

Method: The inpatient EMR database of internal medicine department was utilized for a period of one year, adult patients prescribed at least one of the ten signals, were included in the study, recipient patients of antidote signals were assessed for the occurrence of an ADR by Naranjo's tool of ADR evaluation. PPVs of each antidote signal were verified. Result: PPV of Methylprednisolone and Phytonadione was 0.28, Metoclopramide and Potassium Chloride - 0.29, Dextrose 50%, Promethazine, Sodium Polystyrene and Loperamide - 0.30, Protamine and Acetylcysteine - 0.33. In comparison of confirmed ADRs of antidote signals with other methods, Dextrose 50%, Metoclopramide, Sodium Polystyrene, Potassium Chloride, Methylprednisolone and Promethazine seem to be extremely significant (P value. 0.0001), while ADRs of Phytonadione, Protamine, Acetylcysteine and Loperamide were insignificant. Conclusion: Antidote medication signals have definitive discerning evaluation value of ADRs over routine methods of ADR detection with a high detection rate with a minimum cost; Their integration with hospital EMR database and routine patient safety surveillance enhances transparency, time-saving and facilitates ADR detection.",

Culturing cells between layers of collagen in a three-dimensional (3D) \"sandwich\" is reported to restore hepatic phenotype. This report examines how 3D culturing affects accumulation of fluorophores, the cytotoxic response to bile acids and drugs, and whether cell to cell differences in fluorescent anion accumulation correlate with differences in cytotoxicity. Hepatocytes were found to accumulate fluorescent bile acid (FBA) at significantly higher levels than the related fluorophores, carboxyfluorescein diacetate, (4.4-fold), carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (4.8-fold), and fluorescein (30-fold). In 2D culture, FBA accumulation decreased to background levels by 32 h, Hoechst nuclear accumulation strongly decreased, and nuclear diameter increased, indicative of an efflux phenotype. In 3D culture, FBA accumulation was maintained through 168 h but at 1/3 the original intensity. Cell to cell differences in accumulated FBA did not correlate with levels of liver zonal markers L-FBAP (zone 1) or glutamine synthetase (zone 3). Cytotoxic response to hydrophobic bile acids, acetaminophen, and phalloidin was maintained in 3D culture, and cells with higher FBA accumulation showed 12-18% higher toxicity than the total population toward hydrophobic bile acids (P < 0.05). Long-term imaging showed oscillations in the accumulation of FBA over periods of hours. Overall, the studies suggest that high accumulation of FBA can indicate the sensitivity of cultured hepatocytes to hydrophobic bile acids and other toxins.",

        "abstract": "The structural complexity of a PBPK model is usually accompanied with significant uncertainty in estimating its input parameters. In the last decade, the global sensitivity analysis, which accounts for the variability of all model input parameters simultaneously as well as their correlations, has gained a wide attention as a powerful probing technique to identify and control biological model uncertainties. However, the current sensitivity analysis techniques used in PBPK modeling often neglect the correlation between these input parameters. We introduce a new strategy in the PBPK modeling field to investigate how the uncertainty and variability of correlated input parameters influence the outcomes of the drug distribution process based on a model we recently developed to explain and predict drug distribution in tissues expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp). As direct results, we will also identify the most important input parameters having the largest contribution to the variability and uncertainty of model outcomes. We combined multivariate random sampling with a ranking procedure. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed on the PBPK model with eighteen model input parameters. Log-normal distributions were assumed for these parameters according to literature and their reported correlations were also included. A multivariate sensitivity analysis was then performed to identify the input parameters with the greatest influence on model predictions. The partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCC) were calculated to establish the input-output relationships. A moderate variability of predicted C(last) and C(max) was observed in liver, heart and brain tissues in the presence or absence of P-gp activity. The major statistical difference in model outcomes of the predicted median values has been obtained in brain tissue. PRCC calculation confirmed the importance for a better quantitative characterisation of input parameters related to the passive diffusion and active transport of the unbound drug through the blood-tissue membrane in heart and brain. This approach has also identified as important input parameters those related to the drug metabolism for the prediction of model outcomes in liver and plasma. The proposed Monte-Carlo/PRCC approach was aimed to address the effect of input parameters correlation in a PBPK model. It allowed the identification of important input parameters that require additional attention in research for strengthening the physiological knowledge of drug distribution in mammalian tissues expressing P-gp, thereby reducing the uncertainty of model predictions.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the frequency, severity and preventability of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in paediatric patients during the 6-year period from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1999. METHODS: Data on patient demographics, documented allergies, suspected drug, American Hospital Formulary Service drug classification and dosage regimen were collected retrospectively from ADRs reported to a hospital surveillance programme. ADRs were categorised by severity, preventability and causality. Analysis was conducted by Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann-Whitney) tests. RESULTS: During the 6-year period, 565 ADRs were reported at a rate of 0.85 ADRs per 100 admissions. The mean patient age was 9.6 years. No history of allergies was documented in 87.4% of the cases, although 2.8% of patients had a documented allergy to the suspected medication. Opioids (narcotics) [n = 65, 11.5%], anticonvulsants (n = 67, 11.9%) and antibiotics (n = 149, 26.4%) were the most frequently implicated drug classes. Over 50% of the reported ADRs resulted in treatment intervention and/or temporary patient harm and of these, 73% required drug therapy. Causality was classified as 'definite' (44.1%), 'probable' (49.9%) or 'possible' (6.0%). Of the reported ADRs, 20.7% were preventable. CONCLUSIONS: ADRs resulted in treatment intervention or temporary patient discomfort in >50% of patients. The incidence of preventable ADRs is similar to that found in adult literature. No single drug caused >5% of reported ADRs. Opioids, anticonvulsants and antibiotics were the most common drug classes associated with ADRs. Thus, strategies targeting these drug classes and interventions during the medication ordering and administration processes may reduce the number of ADRs and possibly the associated costs. Even though preventable ADRs may not be entirely eliminated, the goal should be to increase ADR awareness and encourage early detection and intervention to minimise patient discomfort.",

        "abstract": "Class III antiarrhythmic drugs, especially amiodarone (a broad-spectrum antiarrhythmic agent), have gained popularity for use in clinical practice in recent years. Other class III antiarrhythmic drugs include bretylium, dofetilide, ibutilide and sotalol. These agents are effective for the management of various types of cardiac arrhythmias both atrial and ventricular in origin. Class III antiarrhythmic drugs may interact with other drugs by two major processes: pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions. The pharmacodynamic interaction occurs when the pharmacological effects of the object drug are stimulated or inhibited by the precipitant drug. Pharmacokinetic interactions can result from the interference of drug absorption, metabolism and/or elimination of the object drug by the precipitant drug. Among the class III antiarrhythmic drugs, amiodarone has been reported to be involved in a significant number of drug interactions. It is mainly metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and it is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4. In addition, amiodarone may interact with other drugs (such as digoxin) via the inhibition of the P-glycoprotein membrane transporter system, a recently described pharmacokinetic mechanism of drug interactions. Bretylium is not metabolised; it is excreted unchanged in the urine. Therefore the interactions between bretylium and other drugs (including other antiarrhythmic drugs) is primarily through the pharmacodynamic mechanism. Dofetilide is metabolised by CYP3A4 and excreted by the renal cation transport system. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (such as erythromycin) and/or the renal transport system (such as triamterene) may interact with dofetilide. It appears that the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between ibutilide and other drugs is low. This is because ibutilide is not metabolised by CYP3A4 or CYP2D6. However, ibutilide may significantly interact with other drugs by a pharmacodynamic mechanism. Sotalol is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. The potential for drug interactions due to hepatic enzyme induction or inhibition appears to be less likely. However, a number of drugs (such as digoxin) have been reported to interact with sotalol pharmacodynamically. If concurrent use of a class III antiarrhythmic agent and another drug cannot be avoided or no published studies for that particular drug interaction are available, caution should be exercised and close monitoring of the patient should be performed in order to avoid or minimise the risks associated with a possible adverse drug interaction.",

METHODS The chosen drug groups were the intravenous induction agents, the neuromuscular blocking drugs and neostigmine, the inhalational anaesthetic agents and nitrous oxide, local anaesthetic agents and a selection of analgesics agents, naloxone and midazolam and its antagonist flumazenil. From each drug file, the number and type of reactions were analysed. Mortality was calculated as a percentage of the number of deaths against patient reports. RESULTS A total of 11,199 reactions were analysed from 6603 patients of whom 620 (9%) died. Few drug records reported reactions from multiple constituent formulations. The majority of reactions were not allergic. The highest mortality was in the inhalational anaesthetic group. Although the greatest number of fatal events was associated with halothane, this drug is no longer used. Nevertheless the percentage remains high because cardiovascular mortality is still being reported. Local anaesthetic use was associated with the smallest percentage mortality (3%). The highest reported number of reactions was associated with the intravenous induction agents and idiosyncratic neurological and peripheral vascular reactions were linked with the use of etomidate. CONCLUSIONS The reporting of allergic reactions was low. The data demonstrate that induction of anaesthesia presents the highest risk of adverse drug reaction; there is also mortality from newer drugs for example, desflurane, remifentanil as well as from drugs for which there is no alternative, for example, suxamethonium.",

METHODS: Retrospective observational study of hospitalized adults receiving systemic antifungal treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in the infectious diseases unit (IDU) of the University Hospital of Bordeaux, France between 1996 and 2001. All treatment episodes with antifungal agent were examined and all prescribed concomitant medication identified for potential drug-drug interactions (PDDI)-serious events occurring during treatment were adjudicated for clinical DDI. RESULTS: There were 150 treatment episodes with antifungal agent in 105 patients. Fluconazole was used in 48% of the treatment episodes, amphotericin B in 46%, itraconazole in 4.7% and flucytosine in 1.3%. One hundred and sixteen PDDIs were identified related to the use of amphotericin B (81.0%), fluconazole (17.2%) or itraconazole (1.7%). Of these, 22 were associated with a clinical evidence of adverse interaction (hypokalemia, increased creatininemia or nephrotoxicity). All these clinical drug-drug interactions (CDDIs) were with amphotericin B. They were due to furosemide (36.4%), cyclosporine (31.8%) and hydrocortisone (18.2%). PDDIs were mostly associated with leukaemia (40.4%), HIV infection (24.6%) and cancer (10.5%). CONCLUSIONS: In ICU and IDU, systemic antifungal treatments lead to many PDDIs, mainly related to the type of antifungal used and to the pathology treated. Clinical DDI seem more common with amphotericin.",

The incorporation of the gut is commonly associated with a reduced number of false negative predictions; however, in some instances a trend for over-prediction is apparent. This differential success is highly dependent on the initial model assumptions and parameter estimates used (often inconsistent between the datasets) and cannot be associated exclusively with the incorporation of the intestine. The current review provides an assessment of the contribution of intestinal inhibition and induction in conjunction with different perpetrator and victim drug-related properties, focusing in particular on victim drugs with high intestinal first-pass extraction (>75%). Recommendations are given in order to avoid significant over-estimation of true positives and increased number of false positive predictions. This review discusses advantages and limitations of different in vitro and in vivo methods for assessing intestinal availability and associated inter-individual variability, due to the sensitivity of the DDI prediction models to the F(G).",

The frequency of cardiopulmonary drug-drug interactions was compared among women who did, and did not, receive aminoglycoside antibiotics, antacids/laxatives, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, diuretics, neuromuscular blocking agents, and vitamin D analogs, all of which were contraindicated for patients receiving MgSO4.Overall, 683 women received intrapartum MgSO4 during the study period. A total of 219 MgSO4 potentially interacting drugs were identified among 155 (23\\%) unique patients. The most commonly identified potentially interacting agents included calcium channel blockers (26\\%), diuretics (25\\%), and antacids/laxatives (19\\%). Longer hospital stays were significantly associated with increasing numbers of MgSO4 interacting drugs (P < 0.001). Three of 53 (6\\%) women who received furosemide experienced a cardiac arrest, compared with 0 of 618 (0\\%) women who did not receive furosemide (Fisher exact test, P < 0.001).Intrapartum administration of drugs that interact with MgSO4 is common and associated with prolonged hospital stays and potentially cardiopulmonary drug-drug interactions. Caution is warranted when prescribing MgSO4 in combination with known interacting medications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Topical route of administration is the most commonly used method for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases. However, presence of several layers of permeation barriers starting from the tear film till the inner layers of cornea make it difficult to achieve the therapeutic concentrations in the target tissue within the eye. In order to circumvent these barriers and to provide sustained and targeted drug delivery, tremendous advances have been made in developing efficient and safe drug delivery systems. Liposomes due to their unique structure prove to be extremely beneficial drug carriers as they can entrap both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. The conventional liposomes had several drawbacks particularly their tendency to aggregate, the instability and leakage of entrapped drug and susceptibility to phagocytosis. Due to this reason, for a long time, liposomes as drug delivery systems did not attract much attention of researchers and clinicians. However, over recent years development of new generation liposomes has opened up new approaches for targeted and sustained drug delivery using liposomes and has rejuvenated the interest of researchers in this field. In this review we present a summary of current literature to understand the anatomical and physiological limitation in achieving adequate ocular bioavailability of topically applied drugs and utility of liposomes in overcoming these limitations. The recent developments related to new generation liposomes are discussed.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A triple-blind, parallel design, randomized clinical trial was conducted on 30 healthy, young adults who received either a placebo or etoricoxib. The drugs were administered 1 h before the bleaching process and after 24 h. Treatment was performed with 35 % hydrogen peroxide gel. The TS was recorded on three scales: VAS, 0-4, and 0-100. Shade evaluations were performed before and 30 days after bleaching with a visual shade guide and a spectrophotometer. The percentage of patients who reported TS at least once during treatment and the TS intensity were evaluated by Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests, respectively. Tooth color changes were evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the percentage of patients with TS, intensity of TS, and color between the groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The anti-inflammatory medication etoricoxib 60 mg was unable to reduce the presence and intensity of TS. NCT01300780 (protocol No. 17838/2010).",

Now, the conceptual and methodological advances associated with optogenetic approaches are providing fresh momentum to neuroscience drug discovery, particularly in areas that are stalled on the concept of 'fixing the brain chemistry'. Optogenetics is beginning to translate and transit into drug discovery in several key domains, including target discovery, high-throughput screening and novel therapeutic approaches to disease states. Here, we discuss the exciting potential of optogenetic technologies to transform neuroscience drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Quercetin has been confirmed to possess antihistamine, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant properties. Herein, we evaluated their antitumor activity in vitro by using KB/VCR oral cancer cells. We found that quercetin at 25 to 100\u00a0\u03bcmol/L effectively inhibited the migration and invasion of KB/VCR cells. Quercetin at dose ranging from 25 to 100\u00a0\u03bcmol/L significantly inhibited the growth of the KB/VCR cells and at 50\u00a0\u03bcmol/L arrested cells at the G1 phase and decreased the amount of cells in the S and G2 phase. Apoptosis analysis showed that quercetin at 50 or 100\u00a0\u03bcmol/L induced apoptosis of KB/VCR cells by suppressing expression of Bax and inducing the expression of Caspase-3 and Bcl-2. Furthermore, we also confirmed that quercetin from 25 to 100\u00a0\u03bcmol/L reversed gene-encoded Pglycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated MDR in KB/VCR cells by inhibiting the expression of P-gp. For combination treatment with vincristin (0.375\u00a0\u03bcmol/L) and quercetin (50\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), the proliferation rate significantly decreased and apoptosis rate significantly increased. This study provided evidence that quercetin induced apoptosis and reversed drug resistance in oral tumor cells and may be a potential candidate for other tumors treatment.",

        "abstract": "Plants have developed numerous mechanisms to store hormones in inactive but readily available states, enabling rapid responses to environmental changes. The phytohormone auxin has a number of storage precursors, including indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), which is apparently shortened to active indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in peroxisomes by a process similar to fatty acid beta-oxidation. Whereas metabolism of auxin precursors is beginning to be understood, the biological significance of the various precursors is virtually unknown. We identified an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant that specifically restores IBA, but not IAA, responsiveness to auxin signaling mutants. This mutant is defective in PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE8 (PDR8)/PENETRATION3/ABCG36, a plasma membrane-localized ATP binding cassette transporter that has established roles in pathogen responses and cadmium transport. We found that pdr8 mutants display defects in efflux of the auxin precursor IBA and developmental defects in root hair and cotyledon expansion that reveal previously unknown roles for IBA-derived IAA in plant growth and development. Our results are consistent with the possibility that limiting accumulation of the IAA precursor IBA via PDR8-promoted efflux contributes to auxin homeostasis.",

The extent of adverse drug-related events and the need for quality information on drug transfer is stated. Section 2 describes the physiology of lactation and the effects of drugs that stimulate or decrease milk production. Section 3 deals with transport mechanisms for drug passage into milk and factors that may modify the infant's exposure to drugs. The critical descriptors of 'absolute' and 'relative' infant dose are defined to give an objective measure of infant exposure to drugs in milk. Section 4 reviews new or commonly used drugs under the headings of analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents, neurological, endocrine, psychotropic and antihypertensive drugs. Section 5 concludes with an expert opinion of the drug industry and drug use in lactation, herbal preparations, the process of 'risk-benefit' analysis, minimising infant exposure, understanding drug-related adverse events and fostering good experimental design for drugs in lactation studies. \u00a9 2005 Ashley Publications Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Genetic toxicology data is used as a surrogate for long-term carcinogenicity data during early drug development. The aim of genotoxicity testing is to identify potentially hazardous drug candidates. Results from genetic toxicology tests in combination with acute and subchronic animal data are used as the basis to approve clinical trials of drug candidates. With few exceptions, mutagenic compounds are dropped from development and clastogenic compounds result in unfavorable labeling, require disclosure in clinical trial consent forms, and can impact the marketability of a new drug. Therefore, genetic toxicology testing in drug discovery and optimization serves to quickly identify mutagens and remove them from development. Additionally, clastogenicity can delay drug development by requiring additional testing to determine in vivo relevance of in vitro clastogenic responses. Clastogenicity screening is conducted so any additional testing can be planned and perhaps integrated into other toxicity studies to expedite progression of drugs into the clinic. Commercially available genotoxicity and carcinogenicity predictive software systems used for decision support by ICSAS, FDA/CDER is described along with the strengths and weakness of each system. The FDA has concentrated on using a consensus approach to maximize certainty for positive predictions at the expense of sensitivity. The consensus approach consists of requiring 2 complementary software packages, such as MC4PC and MDL QSAR models, to agree that a compound has a genotoxic or carcinogenic liability. Mutagenicity and clastogenicity screening tests are described along with advantages and disadvantages of each test. Several testing strategies are presented for consideration.",

Recapitulation and adaptation of the older science to modern drug discovery processes can bring renewed interest to the pharmaceutical world and offer unique therapeutic solutions for a wide range of human disorders. Eventhough time-tested evidences vouch immense therapeutic benefits for ayurvedic herbs and formulations, several important issues are required to be resolved for successful implementation of ayurvedic principles to present drug discovery methodologies. Additionally, clinical examination in the extent of efficacy, safety and drug interactions of newly developed ayurvedic drugs and formulations are required to be carefully evaluated. Ayurvedic experts suggest a reverse-pharmacology approach focusing on the potential targets for which ayurvedic herbs and herbal products could bring tremendous leads to ayurvedic drug discovery. Although several novel leads and drug molecules have already been discovered from ayurvedic medicinal herbs, further scientific explorations in this arena along with customization of present technologies to ayurvedic drug manufacturing principles would greatly facilitate a standardized ayurvedic drug discovery.",

        "title": "An evaluation of the THIN database in the OMOP common data model for active drug safety surveillance",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There has been increased interest in using multiple observational databases to understand the safety profile of medical products during the postmarketing period. However, it is challenging to perform analyses across these heterogeneous data sources. The Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) provides a Common Data Model (CDM) for organizing and standardizing databases. OMOP's work with the CDM has primarily focused on US databases. As a participant in the OMOP Extended Consortium, we implemented the OMOP CDM on the UK Electronic Healthcare Record database-The Health Improvement Network (THIN).\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the implementation of the THIN database in the OMOP CDM and explore its use for active drug safety surveillance.\\n\\nMETHODS: Following the OMOP CDM specification, the raw THIN database was mapped into a CDM THIN database. Ten Drugs of Interest (DOI) and nine Health Outcomes of Interest (HOI), defined and focused by the OMOP, were created using the CDM THIN database. Quantitative comparison of raw THIN to CDM THIN was performed by execution and analysis of OMOP standardized reports and additional analyses. The practical value of CDM THIN for drug safety and pharmacoepidemiological research was assessed by implementing three analysis methods: Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Univariate Self-Case Control Series (USCCS) and High-Dimensional Propensity Score (HDPS). A published study using raw THIN data was selected to examine the external validity of CDM THIN.\\n\\nRESULTS: Overall demographic characteristics were the same in both databases. Mapping medical and drug codes into the OMOP terminology dictionary was incomplete: 25 % medical codes and 55 % drug codes in raw THIN were not listed in the OMOP terminology dictionary, representing 6 % condition occurrence counts, 4 % procedure occurrence counts and 7 % drug exposure counts in raw THIN. Seven DOIs had <0.3 % and three DOIs had 1 % of unmapped drug exposure counts; each HOI had at least one definition with no or minimal (\u22640.2 %) issues with unmapped condition occurrence counts, except for the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) ulcer hospitalization cohort. The application of PRR, USCCS and HDPS found, respectively, a sensitivity of 67, 78 and 50 %, and a specificity of 68, 59 and 76 %, suggesting that safety issues defined as known by the OMOP could be identified in CDM THIN, with imperfect performance. Similar PRR scores were produced using both CDM THIN and raw THIN, while the execution time was twice as fast on CDM THIN. There was close replication of demographic distribution, death rate and prescription pattern and trend in the published study population and the cohort of CDM THIN.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated that information loss due to incomplete mapping of medical and drug codes as well as data structure in the current CDM THIN limits its use for all possible epidemiological evaluation studies. Current HOIs and DOIs predefined by the OMOP were constructed with minimal loss of information and can be used for active surveillance methodological research. The OMOP CDM THIN can be a valuable tool for multiple aspects of pharmacoepidemiological research when the unique features of UK Electronic Health Records are incorporated in the OMOP library.",

However, acquired and/or intrinsic resistance still represent a major limitation. Lately, in particular mechanisms leading to impaired uptake and/or decreased cellular accumulation of platinum compounds have attracted attention. In this review, we focus on the role of active platinum uptake and efflux systems as determinants of platinum sensitivity and -resistance and their contribution to platinum pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). First, the three mostly used platinum-based anticancer agents as well as the most promising novel platinum compounds in development are put into clinical perspective. Next, we describe the presently known potential platinum transporters--with special emphasis on organic cation transporters (OCTs)--and discuss their role on clinical outcome (i.e. efficacy and adverse events) of platinum-based chemotherapy. In addition, transporter-mediated tumour resistance, the impact of potential platinum transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions, and the role of drug transporters in the renal elimination of platinum compounds are discussed",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prescription drugs or drug classes that are most frequently associated with death in the US might be identifiable from death certificate data. OBJECTIVE: To identify the drugs/drug classes associated with the greatest numbers of deaths in the US that might be considered as possible targets for prevention. STUDY DESIGN: US vital statistics data were accessed in order to identify International Classification of Diseases (10th Revision) [ICD-10] codes indicating that prescription drugs had caused or contributed to death and diseases with significant drug-related mortality. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: ICD-10 codes for primarily prescription drugs that were listed as the underlying cause or as 'total mentions' on death certificates and were implicated in >or=1000 deaths in any one year were selected. The annual number of deaths by ICD-10 code was obtained from the Division of Vital Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics. Codes for diseases with significant drug-related aetiologies and involvement in >or=1000 deaths in any one year were also identified and analysed separately. RESULTS: For the selected ICD-10 codes, a total of 25 031 deaths were listed as having a prescription drug as the underlying cause in 2003, compared with 16 135 in 1999, a 55% increase. Total mentions of these codes increased from 46 523 in 1999 to 72 080 in 2003, also a 55% increase. Most codes involved 'poisonings' (overdose or the wrong substance given or taken in error that is accidental, intentional or with undetermined intent). Drugs associated with poisoning deaths had central nervous system effects. Among the codes associated with specified drug classes, poisonings and accidental poisonings involving narcotics, hallucinogens, psychoactive substances and opioids (other than opium and heroin) were associated with the largest numbers of deaths. Drug-related codes associated with the largest percentage increases in deaths between 1999 and 2003 included poisoning due to methadone (275%); poisoning by other and unspecified antidepressants (primarily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [130%]; and poisoning by psychostimulants with potential for abuse (amfetamines and drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) [117%]. Anticoagulants were associated with the largest numbers of deaths with codes involving \"adverse effects in therapeutic use\". Among diseases with significant drug-related aetiologies, Clostridium difficile enterocolitis (associated primarily with antibacterials) had the largest percentage increase in total mentions, with a 203% rise between 1999 and 2003. CONCLUSIONS: Deaths due to overdoses are the most prominent cause of drug-related mortality in death certificate data. Certain drugs and drug classes, especially the opioids (e.g. narcotics, methadone), psychoactive drugs (e.g. antidepressants, amfetamines), anticoagulants and antibacterials (which cause or contribute to C. difficile enterocolitis) are associated with large and increasing numbers of deaths and preventive strategies should be considered.",

        "abstract": "Tumor-initiating cells are a subpopulation in aggressive cancers that exhibit traits shared with stem cells, including the ability to self-renew and differentiate, commonly referred to as stemness. In addition, such cells are resistant to chemo- and radiation therapy posing a therapeutic challenge. To uncover stemness-associated functions in glioma-initiating cells (GICs), transcriptome profiles were compared to neural stem cells (NSCs) and gene ontology analysis identified an enrichment of Ca2+ signaling genes in NSCs and the more stem-like (NSC-proximal) GICs. Functional analysis in a set of different GIC lines regarding sensitivity to disturbed homeostasis using A23187 and Thapsigargin, revealed that NSC-proximal GICs were more sensitive, corroborating the transcriptome data. Furthermore, Ca2+ drug sensitivity was reduced in GICs after differentiation, with most potent effect in the NSC-proximal GIC, supporting a stemness-associated Ca2+ sensitivity. NSCs and the NSC-proximal GIC line expressed a larger number of ion channels permeable to potassium, sodium and Ca2+. Conversely, a higher number of and higher expression levels of Ca2+ binding genes that may buffer Ca2+, were expressed in NSC-distal GICs. In particular, expression of the AMPA glutamate receptor subunit GRIA1, was found to associate with Ca2+ sensitive NSC-proximal GICs, and decreased as GICs differentiated along with reduced Ca2+ drug sensitivity. The correlation between high expression of Ca2+ channels (such as GRIA1) and sensitivity to Ca2+ drugs was confirmed in an additional nine novel GIC lines. Calcium drug sensitivity also correlated with expression of the NSC markers nestin (NES) and FABP7 (BLBP, brain lipid-binding protein) in this extended analysis. In summary, NSC-associated NES+/FABP7+/GRIA1+ GICs were selectively sensitive to disturbances in Ca2+ homeostasis, providing a potential target mechanism for eradication of an immature population of malignant cells.",

        "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) contains important cellular barriers that maintain homeostasis by protecting the brain from circulating toxins and through the elimination of toxic metabolites generated in the brain. The barriers that limit the concentration of toxins and xenobiotics in the interstitial fluids of the CNS are the capillary endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the epithelial cells of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Both of these barriers have cellular tight junctions and express transport systems which serve to actively transport nutrients into the brain, and actively efflux toxic metabolites and xenobiotics out of the brain. This review will focus on the expression and function of selected drug efflux transporters in these two barriers, specifically the multidrug resistance transporter, p-glycoprotein, and various organic anion transporters, such as multidrug resistance-associated proteins, organic anion transporter polypeptides, and organic anion transporters. These transport systems are increasingly recognized as important determinants of drug distribution to, and elimination from, different compartments of the CNS. Consequences of drug efflux transporters in barriers of the CNS include limiting the distribution of substrates that are beneficial to treat CNS diseases, and increasing the possibility of drug-drug interactions that may lead to untoward toxicities. Therefore, the study of these transporters is important in examining the various determinants of drug delivery to the CNS.",

The findings were correlated to clinical response and survival. Twenty-three patients had a complete remission and 10 a partial remission. A drug sensitivity index based on the cell survival for three major drugs in NHL treatment was derived empirically and proliferation was expressed as low-, intermediate- or high. In 5 out of 8 drugs tested, cell survival ex vivo was higher in clinical non-responders than that in responders. Using the median drug sensitivity index as a cut-off, the sensitivity and specificity for tumour response were 58% and 100%, respectively, and was similar for the proliferation index. Both indices combined increased the sensitivity to 73% at retained specificity. Intermediate/high proliferation was significantly associated with impaired survival, whereas the drug sensitivity index was not predictive of survival. Thus, ex vivo assessments of drug sensitivity and proliferation seem to provide prognostic information in aggressive NHL.",

We show that any change in either ergosterol composition by conditionally disrupting ERG1 or in sphingolipid composition by homozygously disrupting its biosynthetic gene IPT1 leads to improper surface localization of a major ABC (ATP-binding cassette) drug efflux protein, Cdr1p. Results suggest that sterol/sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains play an important role in positioning and functional maintenance of the integral efflux protein. The impaired ability of erg1/ipt1 mutant cells to efflux drugs mediated through Cdr1p appears to be the main cause of increased drug sensitivity of Candida cells.",

Due to the high specific surface areas of nanocarriers, different mechanisms such as ion pairing and hydrophobic interaction need to be explored for achieving sustained release. Recently, we developed a three-parameter model that considers reversible drug-carrier interaction and first-order drug release from liposomes. A closed-form analytical solution was obtained. Here, we further explore the ability of the model to capture the release of bioactive molecules such as drugs and growth factors from various nanocarriers. A parameter study demonstrates that the model is capable of resembling major categories of drug release kinetics. We further fit the model to 60 sets of experimental data from various drug release systems, including nanoparticles, hollow particles, fibers, and hollow fibers. Additionally, bootstrapping is used to evaluate the accuracy of parameter determination and validate the model in selected cases. The simplicity and universality of the model and the clear physical meanings of each model parameter render the model useful for the design and development of new drug delivery systems.",

Both CYP3A4, the major phase I drug metabolizing enzyme in humans, and the multidrug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), are present at high levels in the villus enterocytes of the small intestine, the primary site of absorption for orally administered drugs. Moreover, these proteins are induced by many of the same compounds and demonstrate a broad overlap in substrate and inhibitor specificities, suggesting that they act as a concerted barrier to drug absorption. Clinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated intestinal metabolism can significantly improve the oral bioavailability of a wide range of drugs. Intestinal P-gp is a major route of elimination for both orally and intravenously administered anticancer drugs in animal models, and experiements with the Caco-2 cell line have provided strong evidence that inhibition of intestinal P-gp is another means by which oral drug bioavailability could be enhanced. \u00a9 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that occur via mechanism-based inactivation of cytochrome P450 are of serious concern. Although several predictive models have been published, early risk assessment of MBIs is still challenging. For reversible inhibitors, the DDI risk categorization using [I]/K(i) ([I], the inhibitor concentration; K(i), the inhibition constant) is widely used in drug discovery and development. Although a simple and reliable methodology such as [I]/K(i) categorization for reversible inhibitors would be useful for mechanism-based inhibitors (MBIs), comprehensive analysis of an analogous measure reflecting in vitro potency for inactivation has not been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the term \u03bb/k(deg) (\u03bb, first-order inactivation rate at a given MBI concentration; k(deg), enzyme degradation rate constant) would be useful in the prediction of the in vivo DDI risk of MBIs. Twenty-one MBIs with both in vivo area under the curve (AUC) change of marker substrates and in vitro inactivation parameters were identified in the literature and analyzed. The results of this analysis show that in vivo DDIs with >2-fold change of object drug AUC can be identified with the cutoff value of \u03bb/k(deg) = 1, where unbound steady-state C(max) is used for inhibitor concentration. However, the use of total C(max) led to great overprediction of DDI risk. The risk assessment using \u03bb/k(deg) coupled with unbound C(max) can be useful for the DDI risk evaluation of MBIs in drug discovery and development.",

        "abstract": "Buccal formulations have been developed to allow prolonged localised therapy and enhanced systemic delivery. The buccal mucosa, however, while avoiding first-pass effects, is a formidable barrier to drug absorption, especially for biopharmaceutical products (proteins and oligonucleotides) arising from the recent advances in genomics and proteomics. The buccal route is typically used for extended drug delivery, so formulations that can be attached to the buccal mucosa are favoured. The bioadhesive polymers used in buccal drug delivery to retain a formulation are typically hydrophilic macro-molecules containing numerous hydrogen bonding groups. Newer second-generation bioadhesives have been developed and these include modified or new polymers that allow enhanced adhesion and/or drug delivery, in addition to site-specific ligands such as lectins. Over the last 20 years a wide range of formulations has been developed for buccal drug delivery (tablet, patch, liquids and semisolids) but comparatively few have found their way onto the market. Currently, this route is restricted to the delivery of a limited number of small lipophilic molecules that readily cross the buccal mucosa. However, this route could become a significant means for the delivery of a range of active agents in the coming years, if the barriers to buccal drug delivery are overcome. In particular, patient acceptability and the successful systemic delivery of large molecules (proteins, oligonucleotides and polysaccharides) via this route remains both a significant opportunity and challenge, and new/improved technologies may be required to address these.",

        "abstract": "Nanoparticle-based drug delivery (NDD) has emerged as a promising approach to improving upon the efficacy of existing drugs and enabling the development of new therapies. Proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the potential for NDD systems to simultaneously achieve reduced drug toxicity, improved bio-availability, increased circulation times, controlled drug release, and targeting. However, clinical translation of NDD vehicles with the goal of treating particularly challenging diseases, such as cancer, will require a thorough understanding of how nanoparticle properties influence their fate in biological systems, especially in vivo. Consequently, a model system for systematic evaluation of all stages of NDD with high sensitivity, high resolution, and low cost is highly desirable. In theory, this system should maintain the properties and behavior of the original NDD vehicle, while providing mechanisms for monitoring intracellular and systemic nanocarrier distribution, degradation, drug release, and clearance. For such a model system, quantum dots (QDots) offer great potential. QDots feature small size and versatile surface chemistry, allowing their incorporation within virtually any NDD vehicle with minimal effect on overall characteristics, and offer superb optical properties for real-time monitoring of NDD vehicle transport and drug release at both cellular and systemic levels. Though the direct use of QDots for drug delivery remains questionable due to their potential long-term toxicity, the QDot core can be easily replaced with other organic drug carriers or more biocompatible inorganic contrast agents (such as gold and magnetic nanoparticles) by their similar size and surface properties, facilitating translation of well characterized NDD vehicles to the clinic, maintaining NDD imaging capabilities, and potentially providing additional therapeutic functionalities such as photothermal therapy and magneto-transfection. In this review we outline unique features that make QDots an ideal platform for nanocarrier design and discuss how this model has been applied to study NDD vehicle behavior for diverse drug delivery applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract To further develop cholesterol-modified pullulan self-aggregated nanoparticles (CHSPNs) as a drug nanocarrier, CHSP was synthesized and characterized. Its cholesterol degree determined by (1)H NMR was 5.2 cholesterol groups per hundred glucose units. CHSPNs were prepared in aqueous media and characterized by dynamic laser light-scattering (DLS), zeta potential and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These nanoparticles were almost spherical in shape, and the zeta potentials of CHSPNs were near zero in aqueous media. CHSPNs can be stable at least 2 months with no significant size and zeta potential changes. Single dose toxicity test in mice was investigated for the safety evaluation of CHSPNs as a drug nanocarrier, and the result showed CHSPNs were well tolerated at the dose of 200\u2009mg/kg in mice. Epirubicin (EPI)-loaded CHSPNs (EPI-CHSPNs) were prepared and the in vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution were studied. Compared with the EPI solution, EPI-CHSPNs have exhibited higher plasma drug concentration, longer half-life time (t1/2) and the larger area under-the-curve (AUC). Moreover, the drug level of EPI-CHSPNs increased in liver and decreased in heart. The results indicated that CHSPNs were stable, safe and may be a promising drug delivery carrier.",

The needles are in the hundreds of micron length range and therefore allow relatively little or no pain. For example, biodegradable MNs have been researched in the literature and have several advantages compared with solid or hollow MNs, as they produce non-sharp waste and can be designed to allow rapid or slow release of drugs. However, they also pose a disadvantage as successful insertion into the stratum corneum layer of the skin relies on sufficient mechanical strength of the biodegradable material. This review looks at the various technologies developed in MN research and shows the rapidly growing numbers of research papers and patent publications since the first invention of MNs (using time series statistical analysis). This provides the research and industry communities a valuable synopsis of the trends and progress being made in this field.",

        "abstract": "Many studies investigating cognitive outcomes in children of women with epilepsy report an increased risk of mental impairment. Verbal scores on neuropsychometric measures may be selectively more involved. While a variety of factors contribute to the cognitive problems of children of women with epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) appear to play a major role. The mechanisms by which AEDs affect neurodevelopmental outcomes remain poorly defined. Animal models suggest that AED-induced apoptosis, altered neurotransmitter environment, and impaired synaptogenesis are some of the mechanisms responsible for cognitive and behavioral teratogenesis. AEDs that are known to induce apoptosis, such as valproate, appear to affect children\u2019s neurodevelopment in a more severe fashion. Fetal valproate exposure has dose-dependent associations with reduced cognitive abilities across a range of domains, and these appear to persist at least until the age of 6. Some studies have shown neurodevelopmental deficiencies associated with the use of phenobarbital and possibly phenytoin. So far, most of the investigations available suggest that fetal exposures to lamotrigine or levetiracetam are safer with regard to cognition when compared with other AEDs. Studies on carbamazepine show contradictory results, but most information available suggests that major poor cognitive outcomes should not be attributed to this medication. Overall, children exposed to polytherapy prenatally appear to have worse cognitive and behavioral outcomes compared with children exposed to monotherapy, and with the unexposed. There is an increase risk of neurodevelopmental deficits when polytherapy involves the use of valproate versus other agents. \u00a9 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland",

        "abstract": "Drug-eluting stents (DESs) have been associated with adverse clinical effects. Moreover, recent publications have shown that the coating of DESs suffers from defects. The purpose of this contribution is to examine a three-step process for surface modification as a means of improving the durability of DESs. In the first step, 4-(2-bromoethyl)benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate was electrografted onto a stainless steel (SS) stent. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the modified stent confirmed the formation of the organic layer. In the second step, methyl methacrylate was polymerized onto the grafted surface by atom-transfer radical polymerization. XPS, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and contact-angle measurements were used to characterize the polymer brushes. The last step involved spray-coating of the stent with a drug-in-polymer matrix poly(n-butyl methacrylate)/poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) + paclitaxel. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the considerably improved durability of the drug-in-polymer matrix. Bare controls showed greater cracking and delamination of the coating than did the two-step modified stents after incubation under physiological (37 \u00c2C) and accelerated (60 \u00c2C) conditions. Finally, paclitaxel controlled release from the modified SS DESs was moderate compared with that of nontreated samples. In conclusion, the proposed method significantly improves the durability of drug-in-polymer matrixes on a SS DESs.",

Danshen is indexed in the 2010 Chinese Pharmacopoeia, with more than 35 formulations and concoctions containing Danshen water-extracts, ethanolic extracts or their combination, which are rich in phenolic acids and different levels of tanshinones. There are rare reports on the adverse effects of Danshen preparations. It is, however, well-known that Danshen leads the anticoagulation failure of warfarin. The Danshen-warfarin interaction may be mediated via both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic mechanisms. This review does not summarize recent progress, but the effects of Danshen and its active ingredients on the interactions of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and drug transporters, as well as the analysis of ingredients, and the metabolism and pharmacokinetics that are related to these interactions. Tanshinones play significant roles in the inhibition and induction of several CYP450 isozymes. It can be concluded that precautions should be taken when using Danshen preparations rich in tanshinones for CYP-related herb-drug interactions.",

        "abstract": "Meta-analysis has increasingly been used to identify adverse effects of drugs and vaccines, but the results have often been controversial. In one respect, meta-analysis is an especially appropriate tool in these settings. Efficacy studies are often too small to reliably assess risks that become important when a medication is in widespread use, so meta-analysis, which is a statistically efficient way to pool evidence from similar studies, seems like a natural approach. But, as the examples in this paper illustrate, different syntheses can come to qualitatively different conclusions, and the results of any one analysis are usually not as precise as they seem to be. There are three reasons for this: the adverse events of interest are rare, standard meta-analysis methods may not be appropriate for the clinical and methodological heterogeneity that is common in these studies, and adverse effects are not always completely or consistently reported. To address these problems, analysts should explore heterogeneity and use random-effects or more complex statistical methods, and use multiple statistical models to see how dependent the results are to the choice of models.",

For validation, the same study was performed independently on a second panel of tumour cell lines, JFCR-45.\\n\\nMETHODS: Both SNPs were identified in cell DNA using PCR-RFLP techniques confirmed by direct sequencing and by pyrosequencing. For the analysis of the results, the mutational status of p53 was taken into account.\\n\\nRESULTS: In the NCI-60 panel, the TP53 rare-allele frequency was 32% and the MDM2 rare-allele frequency 39%. The MDM2 alleles were distributed according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium whereas this was only found, for the TP53 alleles, in p53 non-mutated cell lines. Comparable results were obtained in the JFCR-45 validation set. The TP53 SNP had low impact on anticancer drug cytotoxicity in either panel. In contrast, the MDM2 gene polymorphism had a major impact on anticancer drug cytotoxicity, essentially in p53 non-mutated cell lines. Presence of the rare allele was associated to significantly higher MDM2 protein expression and to increased sensitivity to DNA-interfering drugs. In the JFCR-45 panel, a similar effect of the MDM2 gene polymorphism was observed, but was less dependent on the p53 mutational status.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We hypothesised that cell lines harbouring the MDM2 G allele presented a lower availability of p53 for DNA repair, translating into higher sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents.",

Forty-seven nondiabetic patients with impaired glucose tolerance were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of treatment with 200 or 400 mg of BGP-15 or placebo. Insulin resistance was determined by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique and homeostasis model assessment method, and beta-cell function was measured by intravenous glucose tolerance test. Each BGP-15 dose significantly increased whole body insulin sensitivity (M-1, p=0.032), total body glucose utilization (M-2, p=0.035), muscle tissue glucose utilization (M-3, p=0.040), and fat-free body mass glucose utilization (M-4, p=0.038) compared to baseline and placebo. No adverse drug effects were observed during treatment. BGP-15 at 200 or 400 mg significantly improved insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant, nondiabetic patients during treatment compared to placebo and was safe and well-tolerated.

Factors independently associated with depressant use include recent participation in a drug treatment program, recent injection of heroin, and frequency of injection. Factors independently associated with opioid use include frequency of injection and history of incarceration. NMPD depressant use increased the odds of a nonfatal overdose in the past year. The authors' findings represent a first step toward creating an epidemiologic profile of NMPD use that may be useful for targeting the implementation of interventions that are effective in reducing overdoses, a significant cause of mortality among IDUs worldwide.",

However, certain limitations are associated with SMEDDS formulations which include in vivo drug precipitation, formulation handling issues, limited lymphatic uptake, lack of predictive in vitro tests and oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. These limitations restrict their potential usage. Inclusion of polymers or precipitation inhibitors within lipid based formulations helps to maintain drug supersaturation after dispersion. This, thereby, improves the bioavailability and reduces the variability on exposure. Also, formulating solid SMEDDS helps to overcome liquid handling and stability problems. Usage of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and suitable antioxidants to minimize oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids are few of the steps to overcome the limitations associated with SMEDDS.

        "abstract": "Sensitivity of human fibroblasts derived from Down's syndrome (DS) individuals (S-240, T-158, T-74, T-164) and normal donors (S-126, WA-1) to anticancer antibiotic - mitoxantrone (1,4-dihydroxy-5,8-bis((2-((2-hydroxy-ethyl)amino)ethyl)amino)-9,10- anthracenedione dihydrochloride; MIT) and its relationship to the transport rate, cellular distribution and interaction with cell membrane were studied. The survival assay showed that MIT was more toxic to trisomic fibroblast lines than to normal cells. Studies of transport kinetics indicated that the amount of drug taken up and extruded by DS cells was diminished, compared to control cells. In contrast, the cellular level of MIT associated with DNA was greater in trisomic than in normal cells. The fluorescence anisotropy measurements of TMA-DPH and 12-AS demonstrated that the fluidity of the polar region of the outer lipid monolayer of DS cell membrane was decreased in comparison with normal cells. MIT treatment decreased fluidity of the inner hydrophobic region of plasma membrane, but only slightly influenced the fluidity of the outer surface of the cell membrane. Finally, we concluded that lowered membrane fluidity, diminished amount of MIT extruded by cells and the enhanced level of the drug associated with DNA could be responsible for the enhanced sensitivity of DS fibroblasts to the MIT treatment. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "abstract": "Cancer has become one of the most difficult health challenges of our time, accounting for millions of deaths yearly. Systemic chemotherapy is the most common therapeutic approach; however, considerable limitations exist including toxicities to healthy tissues and low achievable drug concentrations at tumor sites. More than 85% of human cancers are solid tumors, which can greatly benefit from localized delivery. This approach allows for high drug concentrations at the target site, lower systemic toxicity, and extended drug exposure which may be beneficial for cell cycle-specific drugs. Polymers have been widely considered in the development of localized delivery systems. This review focuses on both natural and synthetic biodegradable polymers that have been explored for localized chemotherapy, exploring their advantages, disadvantages, and clinical potential while citing examples of their use in pre-clinical development.",

        "abstract": "Voriconazole is a triazole antifungal developed for the treatment of life-threatening fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. The drug, which is available for both oral and intravenous administration, has broad-spectrum activity against pathogenic yeasts, dimorphic fungi, and opportunistic molds. Voriconazole has a nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile with a wide inter- and intraindividual variety. This variability is caused by many factors such as gender, age, genotypic variation, liver dysfunction, the presence of food, and so on. Another important factor influencing voriconazole1/4s pharmacokinetic profile is drug-drug interactions with CYP450 inhibitors as well as inducers. Variability in plasma concentrations, as a result of the previously mentioned aspects, may lead to variability in efficacy or toxicity. Determination of plasma concentrations is indicated in situations to guide dosing and to individualize and improve the treatment options resulting in better therapeutic outcome or fewer side effects. In this article, we review factors influencing voriconazole pharmacokinetic profile, the data supporting exposure-effect and exposure-toxicity relationships, review the gaps in current knowledge, which make broad recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring difficult for voriconazole, provide the indications in which therapeutic drug monitoring is reasonable based on currently available data (eg, children), and outline the ways in which this problem could be solved. We provide a summary of the problem so that further research can be conducted to address this are of clinical need. Copyright \ufffd 2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",

        "abstract": "Successful homing of drugs to the desired biological compartment of the host usually depends on the intrinsic properties of the drug molecules. However, it can always be manipulated by appropriate designing of the carrier/delivery system, as little can be done to influence the target and its surroundings. Various carrier systems have emerged to deliver drugs to macrophages, albeit the efficacy, reliability and selectivity of these carriers are still in question. To date, the most extensively studied carriers are liposomes and microspheres. In fact, physicochemical properties of these carriers can alter their efficacy and specificity to a great extent. These properties include hydrophilicity, surface charge, composition, concentration, and presence of various target specific ligands on their surface. Incidentally, the particulate nature of these vehicles may facilitate passive homing of the entrapped drug molecules to the macrophages, which may harbour many of the important pathogens in their intracellular compartments, such as Mycobacterium sps, Leishmania and dengue virus etc., belonging to three different major classes of microbes. Moreover, macrophages upon interaction with particulate drug delivery vehicles may act as secondary drug depot, thus helping in localized delivery of the drug at the infected site. In the present article, a comprehensive review of literature is presented on the suitability of some lipid-based and polymeric materials as vehicles in delivery of drugs to macrophages in parasitic infections.",

        "abstract": "Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol that is often used as a food supplement. Many positive health effects, including cardio protection, tumor suppression, and immune modulation, are associated with the intake of resveratrol. Resveratrol is well tolerated in healthy subjects without any comedication. However, supplemental doses of resveratrol in the range of 1 g/day or above by far exceed the natural intake through food. Whether resveratrol-drug interactions can be harmful in patients taking additional medications remains unknown. Recent in vivo studies and clinical trials indicate a possible drug-drug interaction potential using high-dosage formulations. In this review, the known in vitro and in vivo effects of resveratrol on various cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes are summarized. They are discussed in relation to clinically relevant plasma concentrations in humans. We conclude that resveratrol may lead to interactions with various CYPs, especially when taken in high doses. Aside from systemic CYP inhibition, intestinal interactions must also be considered. They can potentially lead to reduced first-pass metabolism, resulting in higher systemic exposure to certain coadministrated CYP substrates. Therefore, patients who ingest high doses of this food supplement combined with additional medications may be at risk of experiencing clinically relevant drug-drug interactions.",

It has been proposed to guide therapy in pregnant women, in whom physiological changes may lead to altered pharmacokinetics resulting in difficulty in predicting the appropriate drug dosage. Ideally, TDM may play a role in enhancing the effectiveness of treatment while minimizing toxicity of both the mother and fetus. Monitoring of drug levels may also be helpful in assessing adherence to prescribed therapy in selected cases. Limitations exist as therapeutic ranges have only been defined for a limited number of drugs and are based on data obtained in nonpregnant patients. TDM has been suggested for anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antiretroviral drugs, based on pharmacokinetic studies that have shown reduced drug concentrations. However, there is only relatively limited (and sometimes inconsistent) information regarding the clinical impact of these pharmacokinetic changes during pregnancy and the effect of subsequent dose adjustments. Further studies are required to determine whether implementation of TDM during pregnancy improves outcome and is associated with any benefit beyond that achieved by clinical judgment alone. The cost effectiveness of TDM programs during pregnancy also remains to be examined.",

In the immunosuppressed host, such as those treated with immunosuppressive drugs or infected with human immunodeficiency virus particularly at advanced stages of the disease, microsporidia can produce a wide range of clinical diseases. The most common manifestation is gastrointestinal tract infection; however, encephalitis, ocular infection, sinusitis, myositis and disseminated infection have also been described. In addition, these organisms have been reported in immune competent individuals. Multiple genes are involved in these infections and different organisms can result in distinct clinical pictures. Differences in clinical and parasitologic response to various therapeutic agents have emerged from clinical, as well as in vitro and in vivo studies. Currently there are no precisely defined guidelines for the optimal treatment of microsporidial infections.

These terpolyesters, especially those with LA:CL:GA composition of 3:1:1, provided good coating integrity following spraying onto bare metal stents. The semi-synthetic macrolide immunosuppressant, everolimus, was incorporated into the terpolyester coating, and its release from the stent was evaluated. Unlike PLLA homopolymers, which are immiscible with the drug and non-optimal for controlled release, these terpolymers gave excellent control in a screening study, by tuning terpolymer molecular weight, relative monomer ratio, and drug-to-polymer ratio. Adjusting the polymer properties to improve drug solubility (or miscibility) in the polymer coating was found beneficial to the release profile.",

In general, however, systemically administered drugs may reach not only targeted tissues but also other tissues, resulting in unwanted side effects. Also, to maintain therapeutic levels of the drugs in targeted tissues, frequent administration for an extended period of time is required. To solve these problems, drug delivery systems targeted to the CNV are being developed. Anatomic characteristics of CNV tissues resemble those of tumor vasculature, exhibiting enhanced permeability and retention effect. Drug targeting to CNV may be feasible in the same manner as it is to tumors. In this review, we describe two approaches of drug targeting to CNV: passive targeting and active targeting.",

        "abstract": "It has already been demonstrated that pitavastatin, a novel potent HMG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is taken up into human hepatocytes mainly by organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1. Because OATP2B1 is also localized in the basolateral membrane of human liver, we took two approaches to further confirm the minor contribution of OATP2B1 to the hepatic uptake of pitavastatin. Western blot analysis revealed that the ratio of the band density of OATP2B1 in human hepatocytes to that in our expression system is at least 6-fold lower compared with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The uptake of pitavastatin in human hepatocytes could be inhibited by both estrone-3-sulfate (OATP1B1/OATP2B1 inhibitor) and estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide (OATP1B1/OATP1B3 inhibitor). These results further supported the idea that OATP1B1 is a predominant transporter for the hepatic uptake of pitavastatin. Then, to explore the possibility of OATP1B1-mediated drug-drug interaction, we checked the inhibitory effects of various drugs on the pitavastatin uptake in OATP1B1-expressing cells and evaluated whether the in vitro inhibition was clinically significant or not. As we previously reported, we used the methodology for estimating the maximum unbound concentration of inhibitors at the inlet to the liver (I(u,in,max)). Judging from I(u,in,max) and inhibition constant (K(i)) for OATP1B1, several drugs (especially cyclosporin A, rifampicin, rifamycin SV, clarithromycin, and indinavir) have potentials for interacting with OATP1B1-mediated uptake of pitavastatin. The in vitro experiments could support the clinically observed drug-drug interaction between pitavastatin and cyclosporin A. These results suggest that we should pay attention to the concomitant use of some drugs with pitavastatin.",

        "abstract": "Carfilzomib, an irreversible proteasome inhibitor, has a favorable safety profile and significant antitumor activity in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Here we summarize the clinical pharmacokinetics (PK), metabolism, and drug-drug interaction (DDI) profile of carfilzomib. The PK of carfilzomib, infused over 2-10 minutes, was evaluated in patients with solid tumors or MM. Metabolites of carfilzomib were characterized in patient plasma and urine samples. In vitro drug metabolism and DDI studies were conducted in human liver microsomes and hepatocytes. A clinical DDI study was conducted in patients with solid tumors to evaluate the effect of carfilzomib on CYP3A activity. Plasma concentrations of carfilzomib declined rapidly and in a biphasic manner after intravenous administration. The systemic half-life was short and the systemic clearance rate was higher than hepatic blood flow. Carfilzomib was cleared largely extrahepatically via peptidase cleavage and epoxide hydrolysis. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism played a minor role, suggesting that coadministration of P450 inhibitors or inducers is unlikely to change its PK profile. Carfilzomib showed direct and time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A in human liver microsome preparations and exposure to carfilzomib resulted in reductions in CYP3A and 1A2 gene expression in cultured human hepatocytes. However, administration of carfilzomib did not affect the PK of midazolam in patients with solid tumors, and there were no safety signals indicative of potential drug interactions. We conclude that the rapid systemic clearance and short half-life of carfilzomib limit clinically significant DDI.",

        "abstract": "The time course and duration of action of drugs used in cancer chemotherapy are greatly influenced by the molecular and biochemical properties of enzymes associated with their metabolism. Variation in the response of individual patients to cancer chemotherapeutic agents is in large measure due to genetic and environmental factors that impinge on specific enzymes belonging to the two major classes of drug metabolizing enzymes. Current knowledge of the molecular biology and biochemistry of phase I drug metabolizing enzymes (cytochrome P450, flavin-containing and xanthine oxidases, NADPH quinone reductase, and aldehyde and dihydropyridine dehydrogenases), and phase II enzymes (glucuronosyl-, sulfo-, N-acetyl-, and glutathione transferases, and hydrolases) is reviewed briefly. Advances in understanding genetic and environmental factors that influence activities of phase I and phase II pathways of drug metabolism are discussed in the first sections of this review followed by a consideration of the influence of drug metabolism on the actions of agents currently used in the treatment of cancer. Emphasis is given to drugs that have recently been introduced into the armamentarium of cancer chemotherapy including: inhibitors of chromatin function, target-based inhibitors of signal transduction and cyclin-dependent kinases, and angiogenesis inhibitors acting on metalloproteinases, epithelial cell growth, angiogenesis stimulation, and endothelial-specific integrins.",

Chloride channels are involved in a wide range of biological functions, including epithelial fluid secretion, cell-volume regulation, neuroexcitation, smooth-muscle contraction and acidification of intracellular organelles. Mutations in several chloride channels cause human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, macular degeneration, myotonia, kidney stones, renal salt wasting and hyperekplexia. Chloride-channel modulators have potential applications in the treatment of some of these disorders, as well as in secretory diarrhoeas, polycystic kidney disease, osteoporosis and hypertension. Modulators of GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid A) receptor chloride channels are in clinical use and several small-molecule chloride-channel modulators are in preclinical development and clinical trials.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to develop novel intestinal specific drug delivery systems with pH-sensitive swelling and drug release properties. Acryloyl ester of 5-[4-(hydroxy phenyl) azo] salicylic acid (HPAS) as an azo derivative of 5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA) was prepared under mild conditions. The HPAS was covalently linked with acryloyl chloride, abbreviated as APAS. Cubane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (CDA), linked to two 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) groups, was the cross-linking agent (CA). Methacrylic-type polymeric prodrugs were synthesized by free radical copolymerization of methacrylic acid, poly(ethyleneglycol monomethyl ether methacrylate), and APAS in the presence of cubane cross-linking agent. The effect of copolymer composition on the swelling behavior and hydrolytic degradation were studied in simulated gastric (SGF, pH 1) and intestinal fluids (SIF, pH 7.4). The composition of the cross-linked three-dimensional polymers was determined by FTIR spectroscopy. The hydrolysis of drug-polymer conjugates was carried out in cellophane membrane dialysis bags containing aqueous buffer solutions (pH 1 and pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C. Detection of the hydrolysis product by UV spectroscopy shows that the azo prodrug (HPAS) was released by hydrolysis of the ester bond located between the HPAS and the polymer chain. Drug release studies showed that the increasing content of MAA in the copolymer enhances hydrolysis in SIF. These results suggest that pH-sensitive systems could be useful for preparation of a muccoadhesive system and controlled release of HPAS as an azo derivative of 5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA).",

        "abstract": "Abstract Context: The ocular perceivers are the most voluntarily accessible organs in terms of location in the body, yet drug distribution to these tissues is one of the most intriguing and challenging endeavors and problematic to the pharmaceutical scientist. The most of ocular diseases are treated with topical application of conventional formulation, i.e. solutions, suspensions and ointment. Typically on installation of these conventional formulations, only <5% of the applied dose penetrates the cornea and reaches intraocular tissues, while a major fraction of the instilled dose is wastage due to the presence of many ocular barriers like external barriers, rapid loss of the instilled solution from the precorneal area and nasolacrimal drainage system. Systemic absorption caused systemic side effects varying from mild to life-threatening events. Objective: The main objective of this review is to explore the role of colloidal delivery of drug to minimize the drawbacks associated with them. Methods: This review provides an insight into the various constraints associated with ocular drug delivery, summarizes recent findings and applications of colloidal delivery systems, i.e. nanoparticles, nanosuspensions, liposomes, niosomes, dendrimers and contact lenses containing nanoparticles have the capacity to distribute ocular drugs to categorical target sites and hold promise to revolutionize the therapy of many ocular perceiver diseases and minimized the circumscription of conventional delivery. Conclusion: Form the basis of literature review, it has been found that the novel delivery system have greater impact to maximize ocular drug absorption, and minimize systemic absorption and side effects.",

Its acetylation degree determined by the proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) was 2.6. PANs were prepared by the solvent diffusion method and characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), size distribution, and zeta potential techniques. PANs had nearly spherical shape with a size range of 200-450 nm and low zeta potentials both in distilled water and in 10% FBS. The storage stability of PANs was observed in distilled water. PANs were stored for at least 2 months with no significant size and zeta potential changes. The safety of PANs was studied through single dose toxicity test in mice, and the result showed that PANs were well tolerated at the dose of 200 mg/kg in mice. Epirubicin-loaded PANs (PA/EPI) were also prepared and characterized in this study. Moreover, the in vivo pharmacokinetics of PA/EPI was investigated. Compared with the free EPI group, the PA/EPI group exhibited higher plasma drug concentration, longer half-life time (t(1/2)) and the larger area under the curve (AUC). All results suggested that PANs were stable, safe, and showed a promising potential on improving the bioavailability of the loaded drug of the encapsulated drug.",

OBJECTIVE: To identify patient factors that could increase the risk of MDIS. METHOD: Inpatient records over a 5-year period were captured from an electronic prescribing system to identify patients with at least one documented drug allergy. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to compare the rates of MDIS across age, sex, weight, ethnicity, history of atopy or psychological disorders, and previous admissions. RESULTS: A total of 25,695 patients had a documented drug intolerance, 4.9% of whom had MDIS. MDIS was significantly more likely in women (p < 0.001), patients with multiple comorbidities (p < 0.001), and patients with previous hospital admissions (p < 0.001). With the exception of penicillin (p = 0.749), MDIS was more frequent in those with allergies to other drugs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: MDIS was associated with female gender, multiple comorbidities, and previous hospital admissions. A documented allergy to penicillin did not increase the likelihood of MDIS.",

        "abstract": "Drug safety is not a matter for healthcare professionals alone. Patients are also involved, at three different levels: (i) in the behaviours patients adopt to reduce the adverse effects of the drugs; (ii) in regard to what some doctors say to their patients about drug risks; and (iii) in what the pharmaceutical industry says about self-medication and risks. This article will examine these aspects on the basis of information gathered in France during anthropological studies on drug use. (i) Patients' concerns about reducing adverse effects give rise to a series of behaviours relating to drug use. Patients start with the identification of what they regard as a risk inherent in the substances or linked to the uncontrolled use of drugs, and try to neutralize the risk by modifying or modulating the prescriptions in line with various parameters. Dimensions as varied as the nature of the prescribed drugs, the quantity, the dosage and the preservation of certain functions or organs are taken into account, and patients follow their own rules of conduct in order to reduce risks. These dimensions bring into play characteristics of both the drug and the individual, and take into account the effects or the risks of drugs in their physical, psychic, behavioural and social aspects. (ii) Doctors' discourse towards patients regarding the risks and possible effects of drugs is examined, in particular the discourse of those who choose to hide the undesirable effects of drugs from their patients with the aim of not jeopardizing the patient's compliance. This situation involves comparing two logics: ethics of care versus ethics of information. (iii) Regarding the pharmaceutical industry's discourse on self-medication and risks, although on the one hand it promotes self-medication on the basis of patients' growing desire for autonomy and competency, on the other hand it discourages the use of the home medicine cabinet for reasons of safety, which questions the ability of patients to use drugs properly. This article aims to demonstrate that the various behaviours and discourses relating to the risks of drugs are embedded with symbolic, ethical and cultural logics. As a consequence, above and beyond work carried out on the question of pharmacovigilance, examining the issue of safe drug use involves studying the human - social and cultural - aspects that govern part of the behaviours and practices relating to drug safety.",

The objective of the present investigation was to develop cost-effective nanoemulsion as nanocarreir for enhanced and sustained delivery of amphotericin B into the skin. Methods and characterizations: Different oil-in-water nanoemulsions were developed by varying the composition of hydrophilic (Tween \u00d5 80) surfactants and co-surfactant by the spontaneous titration method. The developed formulation were characterized, optimized, evaluated and compared for the skin permeation with commercial formulation (fungisome 0.01% w/w). Optimized formulations loaded with amphotericin B were screened using varied concentrations of surfactants and co-surfactants as decided by the ternary phase diagram. Results and discussion: The maximum % transmittance obtained were 96.9 AE 1.0%, 95.9 AE 3.0% and 93.7 AE 1.2% for the optimized formulations F-I, F-III and F-VI, respectively. These optimized nanoemulsions were subjected to thermodynamic stability study to get the most stable nanoemulsions (F-I). The results of the particle size and zeta potential value were found to be 67.32 AE 0.8 nm and \u20133.7 AE 1.2 mV for the final optimized nanoemulsion F-I supporting transparency and stable nanoemulsion for better skin permeation. The steady state transdermal flux for the formulations was observed between 5.89 AE 2.06 and 18.02 AE 4.3 mg/cm 2 /h whereas the maximum enhancement ratio were found 1.85-and 3.0-fold higher than fungisome and drug solution, respectively, for F-I. The results of the skin deposition study suggests that 231.37 AE 3.6 mg/cm 2 drug deposited from optimized nanoemulsion F-I and 2.11-fold higher enhancement ratio as compared to fungisome. Optimized surfactants and co-surfactant combination-mediated transport of the drug through the skin was also tried and the results were shown to have facilitated drug permeation and skin perturbation (SEM). Conclusion: The combined results suggested that amphotericin B nanoemulsion could be a better option for localized topical drug delivery and have greater potential as an effective, efficient and safe approach.",

        "abstract": "Ketamine, the phencyclidine derivative described in 1965, is an intravenous anesthetic with a variety of applications. The enthusiasm following its initial release subsided due to side effects from the central nervous system. New anesthetics limited the role of ketamine in anesthetic practice. However, its hemodynamically stable profile, along with its beneficial respiratory properties and analgesic potency, rendered the drug invaluable in battlefield medicine, sedation of the uncooperative child, analgesia, and sedation in burn units. Reevaluation, though, of analgesic properties of ketamine resulted in new interest regarding its use in perioperative and chronic pain management. Moreover, recent studies in the effects of the substance on intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow led to revising the recommendation against its use in brain injury. Furthermore, the bronchodilating effects of the substance led to increasing interest for potential use in asthma treatment. In addition, separation of the 2 enantiomers and subsequent separate studies indicated beneficial results of the S(+) one. Thus, new controlled multicentered clinical trials are to be conducted to justify approval for new uses of ketamine and take advantage of its unique range of applications.",

        "abstract": "Normal renal function depends upon an intact glomerular apparatus. Many drugs and chemicals are capable of damaging the glomerulus, causing its increased permeability to large molecules. Glomerular lesions are usually responsible for proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome. This also holds true for the drug-induced glomerulopathies, of which membranous glomerulonephritis is the most frequent type of lesion encountered. Apart from this, several cases of different glomerular changes such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and crescentic glomerulonephritis have also been reported. The drug-induced glomerulopathies are probably immune mediated. This is, for instance, reflected in the fact that patients with drug-induced nephritic syndrome frequently have the HLA-B8 and DR3 antigens. In depth information is provided for the previously mentioned disorders. (copyright) 2006 Ashley Publications.",

        "abstract": "Oral drug delivery to the colon has attracted significant attention during the past 20 years. Colon targeting is recognised to have several therapeutic advantages, such as the oral delivery of drugs that are destroyed by the stomach acid and/or metabolised by pancreatic enzymes. Sustained colonic release of drugs can be useful in the treatment of nocturnal asthma, angina and arthritis. Local treatment of colonic pathologies, such as ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer and Crohn's disease, is more effective with the delivery of drugs to the affected area. Likewise, colonic delivery of vermicides and colonic diagnostic agents requires smaller doses. This article aims to provide an insight into the design and manufacturing considerations, and an evaluation of colonic drug delivery systems in order to understand why there are still few delivery technologies that have reached the market, despite intensive research in this field. For this purpose, various approaches to colon-specific drug delivery are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Nine proteins of the ABC superfamily (P-glycoprotein, 7 MRPs and BCRP) are involved in multidrug transport. Being localised at the surface of endothelial or epithelial cells, they expel drugs back to the external medium (if located at the apical side [P-glycoprotein, BCRP, MRP2, MRP4 in the kidney]) or to the blood (if located at the basolateral side [MRP1, MRP3, MRP4, MRP5]), modulating thereby their absorption, distribution, and elimination. In the CNS, most transporters are oriented to expel drugs to the blood. Transporters also cooperate with Phase I/Phase II metabolism enzymes by eliminating drug metabolites. Their major features are (i) their capacity to recognize drugs belonging to unrelated pharmacological classes, and (ii) their redundancy, a single molecule being possibly substrate for different transporters. This ensures an efficient protection of the body against invasion by xenobiotics. Competition for transport is now characterized as a mechanism of interaction between co-administered drugs, one molecule limiting the transport of the other, potentially affecting bioavailability, distribution, and/or elimination. Again, this mechanism reinforces drug interactions mediated by cytochrome P450 inhibition, as many substrates of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 are common. Induction of the expression of genes coding for MDR transporters is another mechanism of drug interaction, which could affect all drug substrates of the up-regulated transporter. Overexpression of MDR transporters confers resistance to anticancer agents and other therapies. All together, these data justify why studying drug active transport should be part of the evaluation of new drugs, as recently recommended by the FDA.",

        "abstract": "Chemotherapy is widely used for cancer treatment; however, it causes unwanted side effects in patients. To avoid these adverse effects, nanocarriers have been developed, which can be loaded with the chemotherapeutic agents, directed to the cancer site and, once there, be exposed to stimuli that will trigger the drug release. Liposomes can be chemically modified to increase their circulation time, their stability, and their sensitivity to specific stimulus. Additionally, ligands can be conjugated to their surface, allowing for their specific binding to receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells and the subsequent internalization via endocytosis. Using a triggering mechanism, including temperature, ultrasound, enzymes or a change in pH, the release of the drug is controlled and induced inside the cells, hence avoiding drug release in systemic circulation, which in turn reduces the undesired side effects of conventional chemotherapy. Ultrasound has been widely studied as a drug release trigger from liposomes, due to its well-known physics and previous uses in medicine. This review focuses on liposome-based drug delivery systems, using different trigger mechanisms, with a focus on ultrasound. The physical mechanisms of ultrasound release are also investigated and the results of in vitro and in vivo studies are summarized.",

        "abstract": "Mammalian Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) isoforms are differentially sensitive to inhibition by several distinct classes of pharmacological agents, including amiloride- and benzoyl guanidinium-based derivatives. The determinants of drug sensitivity, however, are only partially understood. Earlier studies of the drug-sensitive NHE1 isoform have shown that residues within the fourth membrane-spanning helix (M4) (Phe(165), Phe(166), Leu(167), and Gly(178)) and a 66-amino acid segment encompassing M9 contribute significantly to drug recognition. In this report, we have identified two residues within M9, one highly conserved (Glu(350)) and the other non-conserved (Gly(356)), that are major determinants of drug sensitivity. In addition, residues in the second exomembrane loop between M3 and M4 (Gly(152), Phe(157), and Pro(158)) were also found to modestly influence drug sensitivity. A double substitution of crucial sites within M4 and M9 of NHE1 with the corresponding residues present in the drug-resistant NHE3 isoform (i.e. L167F/G356A) greatly reduced drug sensitivity in a cooperative manner to levels nearing that of wild type NHE3. The above mutations did not appreciably affect Na(o)(+) affinity but did markedly decrease the catalytic turnover of the transporter. These data suggest that specific sites encompassing M4 and M9 are critical determinants of both drug recognition and cation translocation.",

        "abstract": "Many mathematical models for in vitro to in vivo prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) of orally administered victim drugs have been developed. However, to date, none of these models have been applicable to all intravenously administered victim drugs. We derived and conducted a sensitivity/error analysis of a modification to the existing multiple mode interaction prediction model such that it is applicable to all intravenously administered victim drugs. Using this model we showed that ignoring the hepatic extraction ratio (EH) (as low as 0.3) of intravenously administered victim drugs can result in 1) substantial underestimation of f(m, CYPi) (the fraction of hepatic clearance of the victim drug via a given enzymatic pathway) and 2) error in dissecting the contribution of intestinal and hepatic components of DDIs for orally administered drugs. Using this model we describe DDI boundaries (degree of inhibition or induction) at which ignoring the EH of commonly used victim drugs results in \u226530% error in the predicted area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) ratio or contribution of intestinal interaction to a DDI (CYP3A probes only). For the most widely used victim drug midazolam, these boundaries for AUC ratio are net inhibition (I/K(i) or \u03bb/k(deg)) \u22651.3 or fold induction \u22652.1; for intestinal contribution the boundaries are 0.37 and 1.5, respectively. To accurately predict the intravenous AUC ratio, intestinal contribution, or f(m, CYPi) 1) for all induction DDIs irrespective of EH of the victim drug and 2) for modest to potent inhibition DDIs even when the EH is moderate (\u22650.3), we propose that our model be used.",

        "abstract": "As the prevalence of polypharmacy increases with our aging population, the propensity for adverse drug-drug interactions arising from the altered metabolism of co-administered medicines remains an important consideration for drug development. Mechanism-based inactivation (MBI) of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system is responsible for many clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) due to the irreversible and long-lasting effects of the enzyme inactivation. Unlike competitive inhibition, MBI persists after the inactivator has been cleared from the system, since de novo enzyme synthesis is required to restore metabolic activity. Recognizing the potential severity of DDIs arising from MBI, there is increasing need for predictive methodologies that can enable prospective risk assessment for the likelihood of a clinical DDI. Steady-state models, which simplify the system to a single inactivator concentration and assume static, equilibrium conditions, are important tools for assessing the potential for DDIs. More sophisticated, physiologically-based models offer advantages over the static models by taking into account changing inactivator concentration over time, in addition to incorporating population variability into the prediction. Despite the differences between the static and dynamic approaches, a key consideration for both is the sensitivity of the models to the input parameters. These inputs include inactivator-specific kinetic parameters describing MBI in terms of potency (K(I)) and inactivation rate (k(inact)), the unbound inactivator concentration (I(u)), and the enzyme degradation rate, (k(deg)). This commentary investigates the impact of the selection of input parameters, and the uncertainty in their assessment, on the prediction for DDIs arising from MBI and the relevance to risk-assessment.",

        "title": "Polymorphic Drug Metabolism in Anaesthesia",
        "abstract": "A substantial part of the interindividual variability in response to drugs and xenobiotics is related to genetically-determined impairment in drug metabolism. Several drug-metabolising enzymes are polymorphic in humans and often polymorphisms are strongly related to altered drug biodisposition and to the risk of developing adverse effects. Drugs used in general anaesthesia undergo polymorphic metabolism. Among these, halothane is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP3A4 and CYP2A6. CYP2E1 also plays a key role in the metabolism of isoflurane, sevoflurane, enflu-rane and desflurane. CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 play a relevant role in the metabolism of ketamine. The enzymes involved in the metabolism of thiopental and etomidate remains to be elucidated. Propofol is metabolized mainly by glucuronidation by uridine diphos-phate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and by hydroxylation by CYP2B6 and CYP2C enzymes. The enzymes SULT1A1 and NQO1 participate in later steps in propofol metabolism. All the above-mentioned anaesthetic-metabolising enzymes are polymorphic in man. The present review analyzes the importance of en-zymes in the metabolism of anaesthetics and common polymorphisms related to the biotransformation of general anaesthetics and it raises hypotheses on genetic and non-genetics factors related to altered response to anaesthetics that require further investigation. Based on functional relevance and allele frequencies, we identify the most promising targets for the clinical use of pharmacogenomic techniques in anaesthesia to prevent altered pharmacokinetics or adverse drug effects.",

Among the natural polymers, chitosan and alginate have been studied extensively for preparation of hydrogel nanoparticles and from synthetic group, hydrogel nanoparticles based on poly (vinyl alcohol), poly (ethylene oxide), poly (ethyleneimine), poly (vinyl pyrrolidone), and poly-N-isopropylacrylamide have been reported with different characteristics and features with respect to drug delivery. Regardless of the type of polymer used, the release mechanism of the loaded agent from hydrogel nanoparticles is complex, while resulting from three main vectors, i.e., drug diffusion, hydrogel matrix swelling, and chemical reactivity of the drug/matrix. Several crosslinking methods have been used in the way to form the hydrogel matix structures, which can be classified in two major groups of chemically- and physically-induced crosslinking.",

However, the action of pharmaceutical agents is limited by various factors, including their degradation, their interaction with other cells, and their incapacity to penetrate tissues as a result of their chemical nature. For these reasons, new formulations are being studied to achieve a greater pharmacological response; among these, polymeric systems of drug carriers are of high interest. These systems are an appropriate tool for time-and distribution-controlled drug delivery. The mechanisms involved in controlled release require polymers with a variety of physicochemical properties. Thus, several types of polymers have been tested as potential drug delivery systems, including nano-and micro-particles, dendrimers, nano-and micro-spheres, capsosomes, and micelles. In all these systems, drugs can be encapsulated or conjugated in polymer matrices. These polymeric systems have been used for a range of treatments for antineoplastic activity, bacterial infections and inflammatory processes, in addition to vaccines. 2012 Bentham Science Publishers",

        "abstract": "The success of transdermal drug delivery has been severely limited by the inability of most drugs to enter the skin at therapeutically useful rates. Recently, the use of micron-scale needles in increasing skin permeability has been proposed and shown to dramatically increase transdermal delivery, especially for macromolecules. Using the tools of the microelectronics industry, microneedles have been fabricated with a range of sizes, shapes and materials. Most drug delivery studies have emphasized solid microneedles, which have been shown to increase skin permeability to a broad range of molecules and nanoparticles in vitro. In vivo studies have demonstrated delivery of oligonucleotides, reduction of blood glucose level by insulin, and induction of immune responses from protein and DNA vaccines. For these studies, needle arrays have been used to pierce holes into skin to increase transport by diffusion or iontophoresis or as drug carriers that release drug into the skin from a microneedle surface coating. Hollow microneedles have also been developed and shown to microinject insulin to diabetic rats. To address practical applications of microneedles, the ratio of microneedle fracture force to skin insertion force (i.e. margin of safety) was found to be optimal for needles with small tip radius and large wall thickness. Microneedles inserted into the skin of human subjects were reported as painless. Together, these results suggest that microneedles represent a promising technology to deliver therapeutic compounds into the skin for a range of possible applications.",

        "abstract": "The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a druggable target for cancer therapy. By and large, theoncogenic activation of ALK in human tumors is known to occur by gene rearrangement (e.g. EML4-ALK, NMP-ALK, etc.). Clinical use of ALK inhibitors for \"ALK-rearranged\" lung cancers has remarkably improved patient survival. To date, much has been known about ALK gene rearrangement in human carcinogenesis and its drug sensitivity relationship. However, emerging genomic data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, USA)are now revealing common ALK point mutations (~3.06%) in various cancer types other than lung cancer. Importantly, several recent studies have demonstrated that ALK point mutations, independent of ALK-gene rearrangement, can be oncogenic. Thus, ALK mutations can be pathogenically and perhaps therapeutically important for various cancer types.Here, we summarized the latest ALK mutation frequencies and mutation patterns across 17 human cancer types stemming from TCGA. Unlike many other oncogenes with high frequency hotspot mutations, ALK point mutations tend to span along the entire gene. Up till now, several recurrent mutations (G263, R401, R551, P968 and E1242) and mutation-rich cluster regions have beenidentified, but their functional effects remain unknown. We also conducted a comprehensive review of all ALK-mutated human cancer cell lines (from the Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the NCI-60 panel), which can be used as model systems for ALKmutation biology and drug screening studies. Lastly, we summarized both the preclinical and clinical findings of ALK mutations on carcinogenesis and drug sensitivity, which may provide important insight into new treatment strategies and prompt future ALK mutation studies in various cancer types.",

The Global Research in Paediatrics (GRiP)-Network of Excellence aims to develop pediatric-specific methods that can be applied to these data sources. A reference set of positive and negative drug-event associations is required.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a pediatric-specific reference set of positive and negative drug-event associations.\\n\\nMETHODS: Considering user patterns and expert opinion, 16 drugs that are used in individuals aged 0-18 years were selected and evaluated against 16 events, regarded as important safety outcomes. A cross-table of unique drug-event pairs was created. Each pair was classified as potential positive or negative control based on information from the drug's Summary of Product Characteristics and Micromedex. If both information sources consistently listed the event as an adverse event, the combination was reviewed as potential positive control. If both did not, the combination was evaluated as potential negative control. Further evaluation was based on published literature.\\n\\nRESULTS: Selected drugs include ibuprofen, flucloxacillin, domperidone, methylphenidate, montelukast, quinine, and cyproterone/ethinylestradiol. Selected events include bullous eruption, aplastic anemia, ventricular arrhythmia, sudden death, acute kidney injury, psychosis, and seizure. Altogether, 256 unique combinations were reviewed, yielding 37 positive (17 with evidence from the pediatric population and 20 with evidence from adults only) and 90 negative control pairs, with the remainder being unclassifiable.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: We propose a drug-event reference set that can be used to compare different signal detection methods in the pediatric population.",

        "abstract": "In the treatment of health related dysfunctions, it is desirable that the drug reaches its site of action at a particular concentration and that this therapeutic dose range remains constant over a sufficiently long period of time to alter the process. However, the action of pharmaceutical agents is limited by various factors, including their degradation, their interaction with other cells, and their incapacity to penetrate tissues as a result of their chemical nature. For these reasons, new formulations are being studied to achieve a greater pharmacological response; among these, polymeric systems of drug carriers are of high interest. These systems are an appropriate tool for time- and distribution-controlled drug delivery. The mechanisms involved in controlled release require polymers with a variety of physicochemical properties. Thus, several types of polymers have been tested as potential drug delivery systems, including nano- and micro-particles, dendrimers, nano- and micro-spheres, capsosomes, and micelles. In all these systems, drugs can be encapsulated or conjugated in polymer matrices. These polymeric systems have been used for a range of treatments for antineoplastic activity, bacterial infections and inflammatory processes, in addition to vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Transport molecules can significantly affect the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs. An important transport molecule, the 170 kDa P-glycoprotein (Pgp), is constitutively expressed at several organ sites in the human body. Pgp is expressed at the blood-brain barrier, in the kidneys, liver, intestines and in certain T cells. Other transporters such as the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and MRP2 also contribute to drug distribution in the human body, although to a lesser extent than Pgp. These three transporters, and especially Pgp, are often targets of drugs. Pgp can be an intentional or unintentional target. It is directly targeted when one wants to block its function by a modifier drug so that another drug, also a substrate of Pgp, can penetrate the cell membrane, which would otherwise be impermeable. Unintentional targeting occurs when several drugs are administered to a patient and as a consequence, the physiological function of Pgp is blocked at different organ sites. Like Pgp, MRP1 also has the capacity to mediate transport of many drugs and other compounds. MRP1 has a protective role in preventing accumulation of toxic compounds and drugs in epithelial tissue covering the choroid plexus/cerebrospinal fluid compartment, oral epithelium, sertoli cells, intesticular tubules and urinary collecting duct cells. MRP2 primarily transports weakly basic drugs and bilirubin from the liver to bile. Most compounds that efficiently block Pgp have only low affinity for MRP1 and MRP2. There are only a few effective and specific MRP inhibitors available. Drug targeting of these transporters may play a role in cancer chemotherapy and in the pharmacokinetics of substrate drugs.",

        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of in vivo hepatic drug clearance using in vitro assays is important to properly estimate clinical dosing regimens. Clearance of low turnover compounds is especially difficult to predict using short-lived suspensions of un-pooled primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and functionally declining PHH monolayers. Micropatterned co-cultures (MPCCs) of PHHs and 3T3-J2 fibroblasts have been previously shown to display major liver functions for several weeks in vitro. In this study, we first characterized long-term activities of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in MPCCs created from un-pooled cryopreserved PHH donors. Then, MPCCs were utilized to predict the clearance of 26 drugs that exhibit a wide range of turnover rates in vivo (0.05-19.5 mL/min/kg). MPCCs predicted 73%, 92% and 96% of drug clearance values for all tested drugs within 2-fold, 3-fold and 4-fold of in vivo values, respectively. There was good correlation (R2=0.94, slope=1.05) of predictions between the two PHH donors. On the other hand, suspension hepatocytes and conventional monolayers created from the same donor had significantly reduced predictive capacity (i.e. 30-50% clearance values within 4-fold of in vivo), and were not able to metabolize several drugs. Finally, we modulated drug clearance in MPCCs by inducing or inhibiting CYPs. Rifampin-mediated CYP3A4 induction increased midazolam clearance by 73%, while CYP3A4 inhibition with ritonavir decreased midazolam clearance by 79%. Similarly, quinidine-mediated CYP2D6 inhibition reduced clearance of dextromethorphan and desipramine by 71% and 22%, respectively. In conclusion, MPCCs created using cryopreserved un-pooled PHHs can be utilized for drug clearance predictions and to model drug-drug interactions.",

There is, thus, a need for the development of alternate drug delivery systems of PTX to enhance its solubility, permeability and stability and further to promote a sustained, controlled and targeted delivery that will increase its therapeutic effects and reduce its side effects.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review is focused on recent developments of the various PTX delivery systems such as prodrugs, micelles, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanoparticles of biodegradable polymers, dendrimers, nanohydrogels, as well as PTX-eluting stents.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Pharmaceutical nanotechnology can provide solutions to solve the problems encountered in drug formulation and drug delivery and may change the way drugs are made. The various nanocarriers could have high efficiency in drug encapsulation and cellular uptake, escape from elimination by microphages due to their appropriate size and surface modification and realize with ligand conjugation-targeted delivery.",

        "abstract": "Translational research is a continuum between clinical and basic research where the patient is the center of the research process. It brings clinical research to a starting point for the drug discovery process, permitting the generation of a more robust pathophysiological hypothesis essential for a better selection of drug targets and candidate optimization. It also establishes the basis of early proof for clinical concept studies, preferably in phase I, for which biomarkers and surrogate endpoints can often be used. Systems biology is a prerequisite approach to translational research where technologies and expertise are integrated and articulated to support efficient and productive realization of this concept. The first component of systems biology relies on omics-based technologies and integrates the changes in variables, such as genes, proteins and metabolites, into networks that are responsible for an organism's normal and diseased state. The second component of systems biology is in the domain of computational methods, where simulation and modeling create hypotheses of signaling pathways, transcription networks, physiological processes or even cell- or organism-based models. The simulations aim to show the origin of perturbations of the system that lead to pathological states and what treatment could be achieved to ameliorate or normalize the system. This review discusses how translational research and systems biology together could improve global understanding of drug targets, suggest new targets and approaches for therapeutics, and provide a deeper understanding of drug effects. Taken together, these types of analyses can lead to new therapeutic options while improving the safety and efficacy of new and existing medications.",

A systematic literature search was carried out in three electronic databases up to June 2004. Information about case reports classified as St John's wort drug interactions was retrieved from the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring and from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in June 2003. Against the background of proven efficacy in mild to moderate depressive disorders and an excellent tolerability profile in monotherapy, there is sufficient evidence from interaction studies and case reports to suggest that St John's wort may induce the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme system and the P-glycoprotein drug transporter in a clinically relevant manner, thereby reducing efficacy of co-medications. Drugs most prominently affected and contraindicated for concomitant use with St John's wort are metabolised via both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein pathways, including HIV protease inhibitors, HIV non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (only CYP3A4), the immunosuppressants ciclosporin and tacrolimus, and the antineoplastic agents irinotecan and imatinib mesylate. Efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be impaired as reflected by case reports of irregular bleedings and unwanted pregnancies. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored more closely when St John's wort is added, discontinued or the dosage is changed. The St John's wort constituent hyperforin is probably responsible for CYP3A4 induction via activation of a nuclear steroid/pregnane and xenobiotic receptor (SXR/PXR) and hypericin may be assumed to be the P-glycoprotein inducing compound, although the available evidence is less convincing. Combinations of St John's wort with serotonergic agents and other antidepressants should be restricted to prescription-only, by experienced clinicians, due to potential central pharmacodynamic interactions. In conclusion, providing certain precautions and contraindications are followed, and adequate information is given to healthcare professionals and patients, the safe and effective use of quality-tested St John's wort products can be ensured.",

Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) we showed that the phase transition temperature (Tn - i) of K15 and K21 were 34.2 degrees C and 41.5 degrees C respectively. However, the thermogram of K15 and K21 blends with different ratios was shown to be a single endothermic peak similar to that of pure TLCs. K15 and K21 blends did not behave as a physical blend of two thermotropic liquid crystals with different Tn - i. However, they are rather mixed together in such ways that behave like a single unit TLC. The Tn - i of these TLC mixtures was linearly proportionate to the ratio of K15:K21. Using appropriate ratio of K15:K21 TLC, a mixture with desirable phase transition temperature was obtained. A triple layer of cellulose nitrate membranes containing a 50:50 mixture of K15 and K21 was used for drug permeation studies. This composite membrane showed good pulsatile permeation of drug molecules in response to temperature changes below and above the Tn - i of the K15 and K21 blends in a reproducible and reversible manner. Paracetamol and methimazole were chosen as hydrophobic and hydrophilic drug models, respectively. Methimazole permeability through the TLC membrane was much higher (36.0 x 10(-5) cm/s) at temperatures above the phase transition temperature of liquid crystal blends than that (7.2 x 10(-5) cm/s) at temperatures below the phase transition temperature of liquid crystal blends (38.1 degrees C).",

Metformin has a relatively low oral bioavailability (about 50-60%). Although the major effect of metformin is to decrease hepatic glucose output as an antihyperglycemic agent, its inhibitory effects on the proliferation of some cancer cells (e.g. prostate, breast, glioma cells) have been demonstrated in the cell culture studies. Development of novel formulation (e.g. microparticles, nanoparticles) strategies for metformin might be useful to improve its bioavailability, to reduce the dosing frequency, to decrease gastrointestinal side effects and toxicity and to be helpful for effective use of metformin in cancer treatment.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The main aim of this review is to summarize metformin HCl-loaded micro- and nanoparticulate drug delivery systems.\\n\\nMETHOD: The literature was rewieved with regard to the physicochemical, pharmacological properties of metformin, and also its mechanism of action in type 2 diabetes and cancer. In addition, micro- and nanoparticulate drug delivery systems developed for metformin were gathered from the literature and the results were discussed.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Metformin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent and also has potential antitumorigenic effects. The repeated applications of high doses of metformin (as immediate release formulations) are needed for an effective treatment due to its low oral bioavailability and short biological half-life. Drug delivery systems are very useful systems to overcome the difficulties associated with conventional dosage forms of metformin and also for its effective use in cancer treatment.",

In the past few decades, considerable attention has been focused on the development of self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) for herbal drugs.  SEDDS is isotropic and thermodynamically stable solutions consisting of oil, surfactant, co-surfactant and drug that can spontaneously form oil-in-water micro/nanoemulsion when mixed with water under gentle stirring.  The formulation can be a viable alternative to classical formulations to take advantage of their lipophilic nature and to solve their problems of poor solubility, poor bioavailability, low oral absorption and instability.  The mechanism of self-emulsification, solubility studies, construction of phase diagram, optimization and characterization of herbal drugs-loaded SEDDS formulation and in situ absorption evaluation of herbal drugs in rat intestine are presented in our article.[on SciFinder (R)]",

        "abstract": "Abstract Significant progress has been made in nanoscale drugs and delivery systems employing diverse chemical formulations to facilitate the rate of drug delivery and to improve its pharmacokinetics. Biocompatible nanomaterials have been used as biological markers, contrast agents for imaging, healthcare products, pharmaceuticals, drug-delivery systems as well as in detection, diagnosis and treatment of various types of diseases. The classification of drug delivery nanosystems (DDnSs) is a crucial issue and fundamental efforts on this subject are missing from the literature. This article deals with the classification of DDnSs with a modulatory controlled release profile (MCR) denoted as modulatory controlled release nanosystems (MCRnSs). Conventional (c) and advanced (a) DDnSs are denoted by the acronyms cDDnSs and aDDnSs, and can be composed of a single or more than one biomaterials, respectively. The classification was based on their characteristics such as: surface functionality (f), the nature of biomaterials used and the kind of interactions between biomaterials. The aDDnSs can be classified as hybridic (Hy-) or chimeric (Chi-) based on the nature - same or different respectively - of biomaterials and inorganic materials used. The nature of the elements used for producing advanced biomaterials is of great importance and medicinal chemistry contributes effectively to the production of aDDnSs.",

        "abstract": "Vaccinations are recommended throughout life to reduce the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases and their sequelae. Vaccines are often administered in patients with chronic diseases who are likely to be treated with several drugs. A growing number of clinical observations have indicated the possibility of interactions between vaccines and drugs, leading to changes in drug metabolism after vaccination. These interactions represent a significant concern because of the increasing use of vaccines in older patients who are likely to be treated with several drugs. Because of the possible implications of adverse reactions in terms of public health, several studies were performed to verify the risk posed by these interactions and to clarify the biologic mechanisms that drive these events. Of the several mechanisms proposed to be at the basis of vaccine-drug interactions, the most convincing evidence suggests a role of inflammatory cytokines on the regulation of specific cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Differences in the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of these drugs could explain these contrasting results and provide important insights to fully understand the clinical importance of these events. Further studies are required to verify whether vaccine-drug interactions may occur in other clinical settings, especially the ones for which patients are required to be vaccinated against specific diseases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patient safety and the life cycle of a drug are negatively influenced by the still increasing occurrence of potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Clinical risk management of potential DDIs is required in patients using drugs to influence the benefit-risk profile positively. Information about laboratory test results, in particular, may be useful in the assessment of potential DDIs for the individual patient. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the frequency and nature of laboratory tests required for the assessment of the clinical relevance of potential DDIs in Dutch community pharmacies. In addition, the nature and clinical relevance of these potential DDIs is analysed. METHODS: All patients from 100 Dutch community pharmacies using, according to dispensing information, two or more drugs concomitantly on a specified date (Wednesday, 4 April 2007), were included (n = 223,019). The anonymous dispensing data of the included patients were analysed against a list of DDIs requiring laboratory tests for the assessment of their clinical relevance. The number of patients at risk for these potential DDIs with severe adverse reactions was calculated. The frequency of potential DDIs requiring laboratory tests were stratified by age, sex and degree of polypharmacy. RESULTS: Of the included patients, 24.4% had one or more potential DDIs (n = 54,427). In 9.0% of the included patients, one or more laboratory tests for the assessment of clinical relevance of the potential DDI were required (n = 19,968). The frequency of DDIs requiring laboratory tests increased with increasing age and number of drugs, but was not related to sex. The most commonly required laboratory tests were for renal function (42.2%), electrolytes (20.1%) and coagulation (13.1%). The percentage of patients at risk for potential DDIs requiring laboratory tests with adverse reaction category F (serious, irrecoverable disablement or death) was 2.5%; category E (increased risk of failure of life-saving therapy) was 0.6%; and category D (inconvenience with residual symptom and failure of therapy concerning serious but non-fatal diseases) was 3.8%. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of patients in Dutch community pharmacies are at risk for potential DDIs requiring laboratory tests for the assessment of the clinical relevance of the interaction. There is a strong relationship between the frequency of DDIs requiring laboratory tests and age and the number of drugs concomitantly used. In the clinical risk management of potential DDIs, information about laboratory test results is of additional value. Future research is necessary in order to obtain more evidence on using laboratory tests in terms of which tests should be linked to pharmacy data, in which patients they should be done, how often and what actions should be taken when an abnormal value is found.",

Materials and methods: Niosomes were prepared by a modified ethanol injection method, using Span 60, Tween 60 and Tween 65 as well as cholesterol with various cholesterol:surfactant molar ratios. The prepared vesicles were characterized for entrapment efficiency (EE), particle size, zeta potential and in vitro release study. Skin permeation studies were conducted using modified Franz diffusion cell, and excised rat skin was treated with niosomal, liposomal and conventional Carbopol 914 gel of Ibuprofen. Results and discussion: The results showed that the type of surfactant and molar ratio of cholesterol:surfactant altered the EE, size and in vitro drug release of niosomes. Higher EE was obtained with the niosomes prepared with cholesterol and Span 60 at molar ratio of 0.5:1. It has been observed that both niosomal and liposomal formulations enhanced the drug permeation and the percentage of accumulated dose in the skin compared to control conventional gel formulation. However, niosomes prepared by Span 60 and Tween 65 exhibited higher permeation and retention of Ibuprofen, respectively. Conclusion: Our results suggested that niosomal formulations could be used as a promising carrier for the Ibuprofen transdermal delivery system.",

Standard processes and tools are needed to ensure continuous data quality across a network of disparate databases, and to ensure that procedures used to extract-transform-load (ETL) processes maintain data integrity. Currently, there is no consensus or standard approach to evaluate the quality of the source data, or ETL procedures.\\n\\nMETHODS: We propose a framework for a comprehensive process to ensure data quality throughout the steps used to process and analyze the data. The approach used to manage data anomalies includes: (1) characterization of data sources; (2) detection of data anomalies; (3) determining the cause of data anomalies; and (4) remediation.\\n\\nFINDINGS: Data anomalies included incomplete raw dataset: no race or year of birth recorded. Implausible data: year of birth exceeding current year, observation period end date precedes start date, suspicious data frequencies and proportions outside normal range. Examples of errors found in the ETL process were zip codes incorrectly loaded, drug quantities rounded, drug exposure length incorrectly calculated, and condition length incorrectly programmed.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Complete and reliable observational data are difficult to obtain, data quality assurance processes need to be continuous as data is regularly updated; consequently, processes to assess data quality should be ongoing and transparent.",

        "abstract": "The present study was to investigate the potentials of DNA/chitosan nanocomplexes as a carrier for small drug delivery. Two highly water-soluble chitosans (87 kDa and 18 kDa) were prepared and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). DNA/chitosan nanocomplexes were prepared by mixing salmon testes DNA and the FITC labeled chitosan (FITC-chitosan) and their biophysical properties and biodistribution in vivo were then investigated. The molecular weight of chitosan and the ratio of the positive amino group of chitosan to the negative phosphate group of DNA (N/P ratio) influenced the physical properties of the nanocomplexes. The fluorescence intensity of both types of the free FITC-chitosan decreased rapidly within 4 hr post-injection. In contrast, the DNA/chitosan nanocomplexes were accumulated in the liver and kidneys and remained at a relatively high stable level in these tissues and in blood up to 24 hr post-injection. This study also assessed the stability of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) when it was conjugated to chitosan to form a chitosan-doxorubicin conjugate (chi-DOX), which was then mixed with DNA to form a DNA/chitosan-doxorubicin nanocomplex (DNA/chi-DOX). Both the chi-DOX and DNA/chi-DOX complexes exerted cytotoxic effects on HeLa, HepG2, QGY-7703, and L02 cells, while the non-malignant L02 cells were less sensitive to the DNA-containing complex than to the chi-DOX complex, suggesting possible selectivity. Studies in tumor-bearing animals demonstrated that DNA/chi-DOX could efficiently deliver doxorubicin to the tumor and liver, implying that the DNA/chitosan nanocomplex may represent a novel drug carrier.",

Pin1 is overexpressed in many human cancer tissues, including breast, prostate and lung cancer. Its expression correlates with cyclin D1 levels, which contribute to cell transformation. Overexpression of Pin1 promotes tumor growth, while inhibition of Pin1 causes tumor cell apoptosis. Pin1 plays an important role in oncogenesis and therefore may serve as an effective anticancer target. Many inhibitors of Pin1 have been discovered, including several classes of designed inhibitors (alkene isosteres, reduced amides, indanyl ketones) and natural products (juglone, pepticinnamin E analogues, PiB and its derivatives obtained from a library screen). Pin1 inhibitors could be used as a novel type of anticancer drug by blocking cell cycle progression. Therefore, Pin1 represents a new diagnostic and therapeutic anticancer drug target.",

        "abstract": "Alginates are established among the most versatile biopolymers, used in a wide range of applications. The conventional use of alginate as an excipient in drug products generally depends on the thickening, gel-forming, and stabilizing properties. A need for prolonged and better control of drug administration has increased the demand for tailor-made polymers. Hydrocolloids like alginate can play a significant role in the design of a controlled-release product. At low pH hydration of alginic acid leads to the formation of a high-viscosity \"acid gel.\" Alginate is also easily gelled in the presence of a divalent cation as the calcium ion. Dried sodium alginate beads reswell, creating a diffusion barrier decreasing the migration of small molecules (e.g., drugs). The ability of alginate to form two types of gel dependent on pH, i.e., an acid gel and an ionotropic gel, gives the polymer unique properties compared to neutral macromolecules. The molecule can be tailor-made for a number of applications. So far more than 200 different alginate grades and a number of alginate salts are manufactured. The potential use of the various qualities as pharmaceutical excipients has not been evaluated fully, but alginate is likely to make an important contribution in the development of polymeric delivery systems. This natural polymer is adopted by Ph.Eur. It can be obtained in an ultrapure form suitable for implants. This review discusses the present use and future possibilities of alginate as a tool in drug formulation.",

Over the past decade, the use of \"Bare metallic stents\" during Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) has become a common practice for treating the coronary arterial stenosis. However, the restenosis is common problem in patients receiving stents. Recently, Drug-Eluting Stents (DES) with synthetic polymer coatings which act as drug reservoirs and elute drugs over a period of several weeks or months have emerged to tackle restenosis. The polymer coatings on these stents contain various drugs like immunosuppressive drugs, anti-neoplastic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, migration inhibitor drugs and enhanced healing drugs that inhibit thrombus formation, inflammation or cellular proliferation which in turn prevent restenosis. Different methods like dip coating, dip spin coating, ultrasonic spray coating and ink-jet coating help to coat stent uniformly. Drug from the stent can be released by diffusion, dissolution or ion exchange mechanism. There are some disadvantages of the polymer coated stents and hence they are being superseded by completely bioabsorbable stents. Such stents are heading for clinical trials and may hit the market soon. This review gives a glimpse over DES and the future prospects of DES.",

        "abstract": "Drug-induced torsade de pointes (TdP) has proved to be a significant iatro-genic cause of morbidity and mortality and a major reason for the withdrawal of a number of drugs from the market in recent times. Enzymes that metabolise many of these drugs and the potassium channels that are responsible for cardiac repolarisation display genetic polymorphisms. Anecdotal reports have suggested that in many cases of drug-induced TdP, there may be a concealed genetic defect of either these enzymes or the potassium channels, giving rise to either high plasma drug concentrations or diminished cardiac repolarisation reserve, respectively. The presence of either of these genetic defects may predispose a patient to TdP, a potentially fatal adverse reaction, even at therapeutic dosages of QT-prolonging drugs and in the absence of other risk factors. Advances in pharmacogenetics of drug metabolising enzymes and pharmacological targets, together with the prospects of rapid and inexpensive genotyping procedures, promise to individualise and improve the benefit/risk ratio of therapy with drugs that have the potential to cause TdP. The qualitative and the quantitative contributions of these genetic defects in clinical cases of TdP are unclear because not all of the patients with TdP are routinely genotyped and some relevant genetic mutations still remain to be discovered. There are regulatory guidelines that recommend strategies aimed at uncovering the risk of TdP associated with new chemical entities during their development. There are also a number of guidelines that recommend integrating pharmacogenetics in this process. This paper proposes a strategy for integrating pharmacogenetics into drug development programmes to optimise association studies correlating genetic traits and endpoints of clinical interest, namely failure of efficacy or development of repolarisation abnormalities. Until pharmacogenetics is carefully integrated into all phases of development of QT-prolonging drugs and large-scale studies are undertaken during their post-marketing use to determine the genetic components involved in induction of TdP, routine genotyping of patients remains unrealistic. Even without this pharmacogenetic data, the clinical risk of TdP can already be greatly minimised. Clinically, a substantial proportion of cases of TdP are due to the use of either high or usual dosages of drugs with potential to cause TdP in the presence of factors that inhibit drug metabolism. Therefore, choosing the lowest effective dose and identifying patients with these non-genetic risk factors are important means of minimising the risk of TdP. In view of the common secondary pharmacology shared by these drugs, a standard set of contraindications and warnings have evolved over the last decade. These include factors responsible for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug interactions. Among the latter, the more important ones are bradycardia, electrolyte imbalance, cardiac disease and co-administration of two or more QT-prolonging drugs. In principle, if large scale prospective studies can demonstrate a substantial genetic component, pharmacogenetically driven prescribing ought to reduce the risk further. However, any potential benefits of pharmacogenetics will be squandered without any reduction in the clinical risk of TdP if physicians do not follow prescribing and monitoring recommendations.",

The behaviour of erythrocytes as a delivery system for several classes of molecules (i.e., proteins, including enzymes and peptides, therapeutic agents in the form of nucleotide analogues, glucocorticoid analogues) has been studied extensively as they possess several properties, which make them unique and useful carriers. Furthermore, the possibility of using carrier erythrocytes for selective drug targeting to differentiated macrophages increases the opportunities to treat intracellular pathogens and to develop new drugs. Finally, the availability of an apparatus that permits the encapsulation of drugs into autologous erythrocytes has made this technology available in many clinical settings and co-mpetitive with other drug delivery systems.",

However, there is limited information available regarding the genetic variables affecting the disposition or mechanism of action of most commonly used medications. These genetic factors must be identified to enable pharmacogenomic testing to be routinely used in the clinic.

On a newly modified \"drug\" fluency task, individuals with cocaine use disorders who tested positive for cocaine at study day named more drug-related words than control subjects. The number of words provided on the classical semantic fluency task (animals and fruits/vegetables) did not differ between the groups. While the individuals with cocaine use disorders who tested negative for cocaine at study day did not differ from the control subjects in total words named on this task, a qualitative analysis indicated that both cocaine subgroups provided significantly more words pertaining to the experience of using drugs (paraphernalia, administration) than the matched control subjects. These results demonstrate that compared to classical neurocognitive assessment tools, newly tailored measures may be more sensitive to cocaine use disorders, psychopathologies that are often characterized by mild neuropsychological deficits but a well-circumscribed attentional bias to drug-related cues. Future studies are needed to probe the exact cognitive processes and neural circuitry underlying performance on this cue-sensitive 1-min measure. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the metabolic and pharmacokinetic fate of a drug in humans is a key factor in its development and registration, as well as in the elaboration of new therapeutic agents. To carry out these studies, stable isotope labeling techniques have been effectively used by drug metabolism scientists and toxicologists in order to gain better understanding of drugs' disposition, bioavailability and toxicity in in vivo studies. Among the different analytical techniques used, mass spectrometry (MS) coupled to separation techniques has become the detection method of choice due to its high sensitivity and selectivity. In vitro quantification of metabolite levels in biofluids by MS is often difficult if a proper internal standard is not available due to the inherent problems associated with the technique (e.g. chromatographic coelutions, ion suppression, low reproducibility etc.). Stable isotope coding approaches alleviate these drawbacks and allow comparative drug metabolomics studies similarly to the differential proteomic techniques developed in the last decade. This review describes a selection of methodological improvements in the use of stable isotopes labeling in combination with MS to detect drug metabolites. In the first part of the paper, the application of labeled compounds to study the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology of drugs (ADMET) in addition to the elucidation of metabolic pathways is presented. In the second part, recent developments of stable isotope coded tags for the in vitro relative metabolite quantification in biofluids are presented.",

        "abstract": "The ability to use vitro inactivation kinetic parameters in scaling to in vivo drug-drug interactions (DDIs) for mechanism-based inactivators of human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes was examined using eight human P450-selective marker activities in pooled human liver microsomes. These data were combined with other parameters (systemic C(max), estimated hepatic inlet C(max), fraction unbound, in vivo P450 enzyme degradation rate constants estimated from clinical pharmacokinetic data, and fraction of the affected drug cleared by the inhibited enzyme) to predict increases in exposure to drugs, and the predictions were compared with in vivo DDIs gathered from clinical studies reported in the scientific literature. In general, the use of unbound systemic C(max) as the inactivator concentration in vivo yielded the most accurate predictions of DDI with a mean -fold error of 1.64. Abbreviated in vitro approaches to identifying mechanism-based inactivators were developed. Testing potential inactivators at a single concentration (IC(25)) in a 30-min preincubation with human liver microsomes in the absence and presence of NADPH followed by assessment of P450 marker activities readily identified those compounds known to be mechanism-based inactivators and represents an approach that can be used with greater throughput. Measurement of decreases in IC(50) occurring with a 30-min preincubation with liver microsomes and NADPH was also useful in identifying mechanism-based inactivators, and the IC(50) measured after such a preincubation was highly correlated with the k(inact)/K(I) ratio measured after a full characterization of inactivation. Overall, these findings support the conclusion that P450 in vitro inactivation data are valuable in predicting clinical DDIs that can occur via this mechanism.",

With the aim of developing a culture system close to in vivo conditions for testing new drugs, we characterized an ex vivo three-dimensional culture system based on a hyaluronic acid-rich hydrogel and compared it with classical two-dimensional culture conditions. U87-MG glioblastoma cells and seven primary cell cultures of human glioblastomas were subjected to radiation therapy and chemotherapy drugs. It appears that 3D hydrogel preserves the original cancer growth behavior and enables assessment of the sensitivity of malignant gliomas to radiation and drugs with regard to inter-tumoral heterogeneity of therapeutic response.

The gelator molecules immobilise large volumes of liquid following their self-assembly into a variety of aggregates such as rods, tubules, fibres and platelets. The many interesting properties of these gels, such as their thermoreversibility, have led to much excitement over their industrial applications. However, only a few organogels are currently being studied as drug/vaccine delivery vehicles as most of the existing organogels are composed of pharmaceutically unacceptable organic liquids and/or unacceptable/untested gelators. In this paper a brief overview of organogels is presented, followed by a more in-depth review of the gels that have been investigated for drug and/or vaccine delivery. These include microemulsion-based gels and lecithin gels (studied for transdermal delivery), sorbitan monostearate organogels and amphiphilogels (studied as vaccine adjuvants and for oral and transdermal drug delivery, respectively), gels composed of alanine derivatives (investigated as in situ forming gels) and Eudragit organogels (studied as a matrix for suppositories). Finally, pluronic lecithin organogels, descendents of lecithin gels but which are not really organogels, are briefly discussed for their interesting history, their root and the wide interest in these systems.",

        "abstract": "A voluntary reporting system of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is fun- damental to drug safety surveillance but under-reporting is its major limita- tion. This bibliographic review sought to assess the influence of personal and professional characteristics on ADR reporting and to identify knowledge and attitudes associated with ADR reporting. A systematic review was conducted using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. We included papers that were published in English, French and Spanish, and covered a study population made up of health professionals. In each case, the following data were extracted: study population; work- place; study type; sample size; type of questionnaire; type of scale for measuring knowledge; response rate; personal and professional factors; and knowledge and attitudes (based on Inman's 'seven deadly sins') assoeiated with reporting. Based on a search of computerized databases, we identified a total of 657 papers in MEDLINE and 973 in EMBASE. In all, the review covered 45 papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Medical specialty was the pro- fessional characteristic most closely associated with under-reporting in 76% of studies involving physicians. Other factors associated with under-reporting were ignorance (only severe ADRs need to be reported) in 95%; diffidence (fear of appearing ridiculous for reporting merely suspected ADRs) in 72%; lethargy (an amalgam of procrastination, lack of interest or time to find a report card, and other excuses) in 77%; indifference (the one case that an individual doctor might see could not contribute to medical knowledge) and insecurity (it is nearly impossible to determine whether or not a drug is res- ponsible for a particular adverse reaction) in 67%; and complacency (only safe drugs are allowed on the market) in 47% of studies. While personal and professional factors display a weak influence, the knowledge and attitudes of health professionals appear to be strongly related with reporting in a high proportion of studies. This result may have im- portant implications in terms of public health, if knowledge and attitudes are viewed as potentially modifiable factors.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an uncommon adverse drug reaction of increasing importance to the medical community, pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies and the general public. OBJECTIVES: The Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established to advance understanding and research into DILI by initiating a prospective registry of patients with bona fide DILI for future studies of host clinical, genetic, environmental and immunological risk factors. The DILIN was also charged with developing standardized nomenclature, terminology and causality assessment instruments. METHODS: Five clinical sites, a data coordinating centre and senior scientists from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases initiated the DILIN prospective study in September 2004. Eligible patients are required to meet minimal laboratory or histological criteria within 6 months of DILI onset and have other competing causes of liver injury excluded. Patients in the general community setting with pre-existing HIV, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infections and/or abnormal baseline liver biochemistries are eligible for enrollment. In addition, subjects with liver injury due to herbal products are eligible to participate. Control patients without DILI are also to be recruited in the future. RESULTS: All referred subjects undergo an extensive review of available laboratory, pathology and imaging studies. Subjects who meet pre-defined eligibility criteria at the 6-month study visit are followed for 2 years to better define the natural history of chronic DILI. Causality assessment is determined by a panel of three hepatologists who independently assign a causality score ranging from 1 (definite) to 5 (unlikely) as well as a severity score ranging from 1 (mild) to 5 (fatal). During the first 3 years, 367 subjects were enrolled into the DILIN prospective study. CONCLUSION: DILIN is a multicentre research network charged with improving our understanding of the aetiologies, risk factors and outcomes of DILI in the US. The network is meeting the targeted enrollment of ten patients per month and is developing a repository of clinical data and biological samples for future studies of DILI pathogenesis and outcome.",

Their use is controversial due to serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) like extrapyramidal disorders (EPD) and QT prolongation. Objectives: To calculate reporting odds ratios (RORs) of ADRs related to prokinetics in children using WHO Individual Case Safety Reports.Describe time and age-dependent prescription patterns of prokinetics in children in the Netherlands (NL) and Italy (IT). Methods: All paediatric non vaccine related spontaneous reports (N = 812 526) received by the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre until 2006 were analyzed. RORs were calculated stratified for age. A retrospective population-based study was conducted to describe drug use using data from 2 primary care databases in NL (IPCI) and IT (Pedianet). The study period ran from 1995 to 2006 for NL and from 2001 to Jun 2008 for IT. Annual prevalence of use was calculated (users/1000 PY) and stratified by age and gender. Results: RORs for EPD and QT prolongation are highest in children <2yr (284 [95% CI 223, 361]; 25 [95% CI 15, 40]). EPD was mainly reported for metoclopramide (ROR 171 [95% CI 161, 181]) and QT prolongation for cisapride (ROR 35 [95% CI 29, 43]). During the study period, prescribing of prokinetics more than halved bothinNL(27-13/1000 PY)and IT(43-12/1000 PY). This was mainly due to a drop in domperidone prescriptions. Cisapride prescriptions decreased to nil from 2000 on. Prokinetics are mainly prescribed to the youngest except for metoclopramide in NL (>12 yr). Gender difference could only be observed after puberty where prescription of prokinetic drugs is 3 times higher in girls compared to boys (25 vs. 8/1000 PY). Conclusions: Prescription of prokinetics decreased dramatically, probably due to raised safety concerns. EPD and QT prolongation are associated with high RORs in children <2 yr. In line with a recent FDA boxed warning EPD is mainly seen in metoclopramide. Since RORs are hypothesis generating reporting bias could influence the estimates.

Of all ADRs reported for children and adolescents within VigiBase, vaccine-ADR pairs comprise more than half of the reports. ADRs concerning vaccines differ with respect to type and seriousness from other drugs, and therefore may influence signal detection for non-vaccine drugs if not accounted for appropriately. The potential influence of vaccines on safety signal detection for drugs was recently raised by the CIOMS Working Group VIII, who proposed that it may be appropriate to undertake automatic signal detection using both medicines and vaccines, and some analysis using vaccines only. However, it has not described for which types of ADRs or drugs subgroup analysis is beneficial.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to study the methodological aspects concerning the influence of a high prevalence of vaccine-related ADRs on signal detection within paediatric ADR data. Methods: We analysed all paediatric Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) received by VigiBase between 2000 and 2006, and calculated the reporting odds ratio (ROR) for all unique drug-ADR pairs with at least three reports. The ROR was additionally calculated in subgroups of vaccine-ADR pairs and non-vaccine-ADR pairs and further in different age groups. A proportional change in the ROR for the different subgroups was calculated and the change in the number of signals of disproportional reporting (SDRs) after subgroup analysis was assessed.\\n\\nRESULTS: Of all paediatric ICSRs (N\u2009=\u2009218\u2009840, of which 117\u2009877 were vaccine-related), a total of 26\u2009203 unique drug-ADR pairs were eligible for inclusion (5586 vaccine-related). A total of 1637 vaccine-related SDRs and 13\u2009375 non-vaccine-related SDRs were detected in the crude analysis. Subgroup analysis by restricting to either vaccines or non-vaccines revealed 494 additional SDRs for vaccines (+30.2%) and 821 additional SDRs for non-vaccines (+6.1%). Subgroup analyses were only beneficial for non-vaccines if the ADR of interest was reported uncommonly for non-vaccines and beneficial for vaccines if the ADR was reported uncommonly for vaccines. Subgroup analysis for ADRs that were reported commonly for either vaccines or non-vaccines led to the disappearance of 272 SDRs for vaccines and 2721 SDRs for non-vaccines. We could empirically derive a model that predicts the change in ROR in the subgroups based on the proportion of vaccines within the total dataset.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The high proportion of vaccine-related reports within paediatric ADR data has a large and mathematically predictable impact on signal detection in paediatric ADR data. Subgroup analysis reveals new SDRs that potentially represent genuine safety signals. The most inclusive and sensitive signal detection method would be the combination of a crude and subgroup-based data mining approach, based on the ratio between the proportion of vaccines within the ADR of interest and within all other ADRs.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a brain tumour characterised by a remarkably high chemoresistance and infiltrating capability. To date, chemotherapy with temozolomide has contributed only poorly to improved survival rates in patients. One of the most important mechanisms of chemoresistance comes about through the activity of certain proteins from the ATP-binding cassette superfamily that extrudes antitumour drugs, or their metabolites, from cells. We identify an increased expression of the multiple drug resistance-associated protein 1 (Mrp1) in glioblastoma multiforme biopsies and in T98G and G44 cell lines. The activity of this transporter was also confirmed by measuring the extrusion of the fluorescent substrate CFDA. The sensitivity of GBM cells was low upon exposure to temozolomide, vincristine and etoposide, with decreases in cell viability of below 20% seen at therapeutic concentrations of these drugs. However, combined exposure to vincristine or etoposide with an inhibitor of Mrp1 efficiently decreased cell viability by up to 80%. We conclude that chemosensitization of cells with inhibitors of Mrp1 activity might be an efficient tool for the treatment of human GBM.",

        "abstract": "Specific cell cycle checkpoints are activated by mutations in DNA structure and integrity induced by drug treatment during progression of cells through G1, S, G2, and M. DNA damage, if not repaired, results in genomic instability and cell death. There are two partially independent pathways involved in the initiation of different cell cycle checkpoints that are controlled by PIKK kinases. BRCA-deficient breast and ovarian cancers are normally more sensitive to drugs that produce single and double stranded lesions in DNA. Studies show that tumor cells with defects in checkpoint pathways have frequently increased sensitivity to antitumor agents, which cause DNA damage. Studies reveal that in some situations, nonfunctional G2 and mitotic checkpoints may allow cells with damaged genomes to progress through mitosis, divide, and survive.",

        "abstract": "Acquired drug resistance is a major problem in cancer treatment.  To explore the genes involved in chemosensitivity and resistance, 10 human tumor cell lines, including parental cells and resistant subtypes selected for resistance against doxorubicin, melphalan, teniposide and vincristine, were profiled for mRNA expression of 7400 genes using cDNA microarray technol.  The drug activity of 66 cancer agents was evaluated on the cell lines, and correlations between drug activity and gene expression were calcd. and ranked.  Hierarchical clustering of drugs based on their drug-gene correlations yielded clusters of drugs with similar mechanism of action.  Genes correlated with drug sensitivity and resistance were imported into the PathwayAssist software to identify putative mol. pathways involved.  A substantial no. of both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic genes such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 and focal adhesion kinase were found to be assocd. to drug resistance, whereas genes linked to cell cycle control and proliferation, such as cell division cycle 25A and signal transducer of activator of transcription 5A, were assocd. to general drug sensitivity.  The results indicate that combined information from drug activity and gene expression in a resistance-based cell line panel may provide new knowledge of the genes involved in anticancer drug resistance and become a useful tool in drug development.

        "title": "Helminth drug initiative.",
        "abstract": "Helminth infections are responsible for a huge health burden on developing country populations. These are manifest through soil transmitted helminths leading to intestinal infections and vector borne infections, such as schistosomiasis (frequently called Bilharzia) transmitted through water snail, lymphatic filariasis (frequently called elephantiasis) transmitted by mosquitoes and onchocerciasis (frequently called river blindness) transmitted by blackflies. The number of drugs available to treat these infections is incredibly limited, but where they are available they have, in some cases, led to incredible gains in public health. For example, TDR collaborated with Merck in the 1980s in the develop- ment of ivermectin for onchocerciasis. Merck subsequently made the drug available as a donation. Following this, through the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control, an innovative community directed distribution system now provides this drug to \u223c 60 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, with a goal of reaching 90 million by 2010. The disease is significantly reduced as a public health problem as a result, but continued effort and vigilance is needed. WHO is supporting a drive to scale up the treatment of helminth infections through integrated mass drug administration and several other drugs are now also being made available through pharmaceutical company donations. However, this scale up of use further highlights helminth infections for which chemotherapy is not available. It also brings with it the threat of resistance development and highlights the need for additional drugs to be discovered and developed to cover that eventuality. The paucity of products in development for helminth diseases, as well as the lack of a dedicated product development partnership (PDP) for these diseases has necessitated a focused initiative to boost the research and development pipeline for these diseases. Consultation meetings organised by TDR in collaboration with the Japanese Society of Parasitology have identified the need for a focused initiative to facilitate research and development against human parasitic worm infections. This special issue of Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery documents the rationale for the Helminth Drug Initiative, as well as reports of technical consultations and recommendations that led to the initial establishment of the Initiative within TDR. We hope that it will stimulate interest and activity in this highly significant and neglected area of research.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer treatment with trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2), has largely been successful in improving the prognosis of HER2-positive disease. However, a critical issue associated with trastuzumab treatment is its cardiotoxic adverse effects, including cardiac insufficiency.\\n\\nMETHODS: We measured levels of cardiac troponin I, a marker of myocardial damage, with a highly sensitive method (hs-cTnI) using a fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassay system (ADVIA Centaur(\u00ae) XP) in breast cancer patients and examined the relationship between administration of trastuzumab and epirubicin and concentrations of hs-cTnI.\\n\\nRESULTS: The coefficient of variation for within-run repeatability was 1.34-5.93 %, using plasma pools and controls of 3 concentrations, and that for between-run reproducibility was 3.99-8.79 %, indicating high precision of the assay. In a dilutional linearity test with highly concentrated specimens, hs-cTnI values could be measured up to 50 ng/mL with linearity. No influence from coexisting substances was observed. The concentration of hs-cTnI was at or above the reference range (0.04 ng/mL) in 9 of 214 total breast cancer cases (4.2 %). The hs-cTnI concentration was at or above the reference range in 4 of 49 cases (8.2 %) that were administered trastuzumab, and in 5 of 165 cases (3.0 %) that were not. Trastuzumab did not cause elevation of hs-cTnI when not administered in combination with epirubicin.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that epirubicin and trastuzumab cause cardiotoxicity through different mechanisms. Epirubicin can cause myocardial necrosis, while trastuzumab can cause cardiomyopathy without myocardial necrosis.",
