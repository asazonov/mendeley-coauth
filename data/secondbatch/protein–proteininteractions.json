For instance, protein-protein interactions are involved in the assembly and regulation of multimeric enzymes and transcription factors, various signal response pathways, intracellular sorting and movement of proteins and membrane vesicles, cell-to-cell protein transport, and many others. Here we provide a detailed protocol for the mating-based split-ubiquitin system (mbSUS), which is a sensitive and user-friendly alternative to the classical yeast two-hybrid system in particular. mbSUS relies on the ubiquitin-degradation pathway as a sensor for protein-protein interactions. Thus, mbSUS is predominantly suitable for the determination of full-length proteins localized in the cytoplasm and in or at membrane compartments, without the need for their truncation and nuclear mislocation. In addition, we present a set of Gateway compatible mbSUS vectors that allow the rapid generation of constructs for fast and efficient interaction studies. An additional vector is introduced that allows the extension of mbSUS for the analysis of oligomeric protein complex formation and competition assays in vivo. In summary, mbSUS provides an additional versatile tool for protein-protein interaction studies, which is complementary to in planta assays such as BiFC and FRET.",

        "abstract": "Since the completion of genome sequences of several organisms, attention has been focused on the analysis of the function and functional network of proteins. Most cell type-specific functions and phenotypes are mediated and regulated by the activities of multiprotein complexes as well as other types of protein\u2013protein interactions and posttranslational modifications. Accordingly, the formation and function of macromolecular protein complexes support the whole of cell processes. Consequently, analysis of the variations of protein complex composition in different cell and tissue types is essential to understand the relationship between gene products and cellular functions in diverse physiological contexts (Alberts, 1998; Cusick et al., 2005). With the development of research strategies, many large-scaleprotein-protein interaction studies have been performed in model organisms, especially the budding yeast Saccharomyces cervisiae. Genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screens (Fromont-Racine et al., 1997; Ito et al., 2001; Uetz et al., 2000) and protein chip-based methods (Zhu et al., 2001) allow broader insight into the interaction networks and afford the possibility of highthroughput analysis of function and functional network of proteins. While the former approach provides information relating to interactions between two proteins, typically of binary nature, and has the potential for false-positive and false-negative results, the latter approach is time consuming and labor intensive. These defects may limit their application in large scale protein complex purification. A novel protein complex purification strategy, named tandem affinity purification (TAP) (Puig et al., 2001; Rigaut et al., 1999), in cooperation with mass spectrometry allows identification of interaction partners and purification of protein complexes. This strategy was originally developed in yeast and has been tested in many cells and organisms.",

Although there have been recent advances in both experimental and computational methods for predicting protein-protein interactions, we are only beginning to see a confluence of these techniques. In this paper, we describe a very general, high-throughput method for predicting protein-protein interactions. Our method combines a sequence-based description of proteins with experimental information that can be gathered from any type of protein-protein interaction screen. The method uses a novel description of interacting proteins by extending the signature descriptor, which has demonstrated success in predicting peptide/protein binding interactions for individual proteins. This descriptor is extended to protein pairs by taking signature products. The signature product is implemented within a support vector machine classifier as a kernel function. RESULTS: We have applied our method to publicly available yeast, Helicobacter pylori, human and mouse datasets. We used the yeast and H.pylori datasets to verify the predictive ability of our method, achieving from 70 to 80% accuracy rates using 10-fold cross-validation. We used the human and mouse datasets to demonstrate that our method is capable of cross-species prediction. Finally, we reused the yeast dataset to explore the ability of our algorithm to predict domains. CONTACT: smartin@sandia.gov",

Statistically, conserved residues correlate with hot spots, and their occurrence can distinguish between binding sites and the remainder of the protein surface. The hot spot and conservation analyses have been carried out on one side of the interface. Here, we show that both experimental hot spots and conserved residues tend to couple across two-chain interfaces. Intriguingly, the local packing density around both hot spots and conserved residues is higher than expected. We further observe a correlation between local packing density and experimental deltadeltaG. Favorable conserved pairs include Gly coupled with aromatics, charged and polar residues, as well as aromatic residue coupling. Remarkably, charged residue couples are underrepresented. Overall, protein-protein interactions appear to consist of regions of high and low packing density, with the hot spots organized in the former. The high local packing density in binding interfaces is reminiscent of protein cores.",

CD in the far ultraviolet region (178-260 nm) arises from the amides of the protein backbone and is sensitive to the conformation of the protein. Thus CD can determine whether there are changes in the conformation of proteins when they interact. CD bands in the near ultraviolet (350-260 nm) and visible regions arise from aromatic and prosthetic groups. There are also changes in these regions when proteins bind to each other. Because CD is a quantitative technique, changes in CD spectra are directly proportional to the amount of the protein-protein complexes formed, and these changes can be used to estimate binding constants. Changes in the stability of the protein complexes as a function of temperature or added denaturants, compared to the isolated proteins, can also be used to determine binding constants.",

We also review the published results of comprehensive protein interaction analyses of Pneumococcus phages Dp-1 and Cp-1, as well as coliphages \u03bb and T7. For example, the \u2248 55 proteins encoded by the T7 genome are connected by \u2248 43 interactions with another \u2248 15 between the phage and its host.

We discuss whether different interaction patterns reflect different phage lifestyles or whether they may be artifacts of sampling. Phages that infect the same host can interact with different host target proteins, as exemplified by E. coli phage \u03bb and T7. Despite decades of intensive investigation, only a fraction of these phage interactomes are known. Technical limitations and a lack of depth in many studies explain the gaps in our knowledge.

Pharma as a whole has historically considered PPIs to be undruggable or at the very least high-risk targets, and the relative lack of success in modulating PPIs with small molecules has done little to change this prevailing view. However, many compounds are now in clinical trials, and the experiences of the last 20 years have at the very least led to improved understanding of how to approach these challenging targets. This chapter discusses some of the issues that PPIs present as targets for small molecule modulation, with emphasis on the structural characteristics of PPIs in general, and also of classes of PPIs that share specific attributes. Grouping PPIs by structural class produces a clearer picture of both the characteristics of optimized small molecules, and the relative merits and drawbacks of various PPIs as drug targets. Within this framework, much of the past work in the PPI area is summarized through capsule descriptions of efforts directed against individual targets. Some contributors to individual successes and failures, and some insights gained from the many avenues of research followed within the PPI field are put forward. Themes of the importance of understanding the structural basis of mechanism of action and of structural support for drug discovery emerge, and guidelines for future study are offered. \u00a9 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

This problem of combining protein class information to data on protein-protein interactions to systematically predict unknown protein-protein interactions is solved by a probabilistic model-based approach. In general, a probabilistic model for clustering is a latent-variable model in which a latent variable takes values, each of which corresponds to a cluster. This paper extends such typical latent-variable model to a model having two (lower- and upper-level) latent variables hierarchically. This hierarchical probabilistic structure is a key feature of this model. It should be noted that this hierarchical dependency is reasonable since it cannot be observed which pair of protein classes is useful for predicting protein-protein interactions, although what protein pairs are interacting with each other can be observed. This structure allows to systematically deal with a set of protein classes as a latent variable of observable protein-protein interactions. Results show that the approach presented in this paper for capturing guilt-by-association interactions successfully outperformed existing methods and support vector machines, being statistically significant in predicting new protein-protein interactions. Thus, predicting protein-protein interactions should be conducted by unsupervised learning approach, and then the performance of hierarchical aspect model (HAM) should be compared with those of other unsupervised methods.",

As an adaptation to the iron-restricted environment of the host, A. pleuropneumoniae possesses iron acquisition pathways mediated by surface receptors that specifically bind transferrin from the host. The receptor is composed of two receptor proteins, transferrin-binding protein A and B (TbpA and B), which are both capable of binding to transferrin. An impairment of iron uptake mechanisms is likely to reduce virulence. For this reason, these two proteins can be useful as a candidate target for A. pleuropneumoniae vaccination. To do this, genes encoding the TbpA and B from a serotype 5 isolate of A. pleuropneumoniae were amplified from genomic DNA template by PCR and cloned into a pRSET prokaryotic expression vector, generating the pRSET-A.pp-TbpA and B. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS competent cells were transformed with each construct followed by the induction of protein expression by the addition of IPTG. Bands corresponding to the predicted sizes (110 and 60 kDa) were seen on the SDS-PAGE. Polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant TbpA and B from mice were reacted with bacterial proteins. This result indicates that the recombinant proteins can induce immunological responses and might be useful as candidate targets for A. pleuropneumoniae vaccination.",

        "abstract": "BioID is a unique method to screen for physiologically relevant protein interactions that occur in living cells. This technique harnesses a promiscuous biotin ligase to biotinylate proteins based on proximity. The ligase is fused to a protein of interest and expressed in cells, where it biotinylates proximal endogenous proteins. Because it is a rare protein modification in nature, biotinylation of these endogenous proteins by BioID fusion proteins enables their selective isolation and identification with standard biotin-affinity capture. Proteins identified by BioID are candidate interactors for the protein of interest. BioID can be applied to insoluble proteins, can identify weak and/or transient interactions, and is amenable to temporal regulation. Initially applied to mammalian cells, BioID has potential application in a variety of cell types from diverse species.",

We have derived empirical knowledge-based potential functions for selecting rigid-body docking poses. These potentials include the energetic component that provides the residues with a particular secondary structure and surface accessibility. These scoring functions have been tested on a state-of-art benchmark dataset and on a decoy dataset of permanent interactions. Our results were compared with a residue-pair potential scoring function (RPScore) and an atomic-detailed scoring function (Zrank). We have combined knowledge-based potentials to score protein\u2013protein poses of decoys of complexes classified either as transient or as permanent protein\u2013protein interactions. Being defined from residue-pair statistical potentials and not requiring of an atomic level description, our method surpassed Zrank for scoring rigid-docking decoys where the unbound partners of an interaction have to endure conformational changes upon binding. However, when only moderate conformational changes are required (in rigid docking) or when the right conformational changes are ensured (in flexible docking), Zrank is the most successful scoring function. Finally, our study suggests that the physicochemical properties necessary for the binding are allocated on the proteins previous to its binding and with independence of the partner. This information is encoded at the residue level and could be easily incorporated in the initial grid scoring for Fast Fourier Transform rigid-body docking methods.",

        "abstract": "Thermal stability shift analysis is a powerful method for examining binding interactions in proteins. We demonstrate that under certain circumstances, protein-protein interactions can be quantitated by monitoring shifts in thermal stability using thermodynamic models and data analysis methods presented in this work. This method relies on the determination of protein stabilities from thermal unfolding experiments using fluorescent dyes such as SYPRO Orange that report on protein denaturation. Data collection is rapid and straightforward using readily available real-time polymerase chain reaction instrumentation. We present an approach for the analysis of the unfolding transitions corresponding to each partner to extract the affinity of the interaction between the proteins. This method does not require the construction of a titration series that brackets the dissociation constant. In thermal shift experiments, protein stability data are obtained at different temperatures according to the affinity- and concentration-dependent shifts in unfolding transition midpoints. Treatment of the temperature dependence of affinity is, therefore, intrinsic to this method and is developed in this study. We used the interaction between maltose-binding protein (MBP) and a thermostable synthetic ankyrin repeat protein (Off7) as an experimental test case because their unfolding transitions overlap minimally. We found that MBP is significantly stabilized by Off7. High experimental throughput is enabled by sample parallelization, and the ability to extract quantitative binding information at a single partner concentration. In a single experiment, we were able to quantify the affinities of a series of alanine mutants, covering a wide range of affinities (\u223c 100 nM to \u223c 100 \u03bcM).",

        "abstract": "We are proud to present the first edition of the Protein-protein Interactions Section of Current Opinion in Structural Biology. The Section is new, but the topic has been present in the journal from the very start. Volume 1, Issue 1, dated February1991, had a review by Janin entitled Protein-protein interactions and assembly, and others by Bode and Huber on Proteinase-inhibitor interaction, and by Chothia on Antigen recognition. The Editorial Overview, signed by T.E. Creighton and P.S. Kim, noted that 'several new X-ray structures of protein complexes had been determined', and stated that, for such complexes, the 'overall goal was to understand the specificities of the binding reactions [and the] differential affinities'. At the time, most of the known structures displaying protein-protein interactions were oligomeric protein complexes, which are permanent assemblies. Protease-inhibitor and antigen-antibody complexes were the only examples of transient, although highly affine, interactions for which the questions of specificity and affinity could be raised, and therefore, the three reviews of Issue 1 pretty much covered the field. Soon afterwards, new X-ray structures illustrated the role of protein-protein interactions in several major cellular processes. A landmark was the structure of the transducin G \u03b1 -G \u03b2\u03b3 complex by Paul Sigler and collaborators (Lambright et al. 1996, Nature 379:311). Transducin is the G-protein that is coupled with rhodopsin in the retina, a key step of the visual signal transduction. The G \u03b1 -G \u03b2\u03b3 complex has many features that had not been seen in earlier structures. It is short-lived, whereas protease-inhibitor and antigen-antibody complexes are stable for hours or days; it displays large conformation changes, all essential to function. The December 1997 issue of Current Opinion in Structural Biology reviewed that structure and those of other complexes",

        "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTM) of proteins can control complex and dynamic cellular processes via regulating interactions between key proteins. To understand these regulatory mechanisms, it is critical that we can profile the PTM-dependent protein-protein interactions. However, identifying these interactions can be very difficult using available approaches, as PTMs can be dynamic and often mediate relatively weak protein-protein interactions. We have recently developed CLASPI (cross-linking-assisted and stable isotope labeling in cell culture-based protein identification), a chemical proteomics approach to examine protein-protein interactions mediated by methylation in human cell lysates. Here, we report three extensions of the CLASPI approach. First, we show that CLASPI can be used to analyze methylation-dependent protein-protein interactions in lysates of fission yeast, a genetically tractable model organism. For these studies, we examined trimethylated histone H3 lysine-9 (H3K9Me\u2083)-dependent protein-protein interactions. Second, we demonstrate that CLASPI can be used to examine phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions. In particular, we profile proteins recognizing phosphorylated histone H3 threonine-3 (H3T3-Phos), a mitotic histone \"mark\" appearing exclusively during cell division. Our approach identified survivin, the only known H3T3-Phos-binding protein, as well as other proteins, such as MCAK and KIF2A, that are likely to be involved in weak but selective interactions with this histone phosphorylation \"mark\". Finally, we demonstrate that the CLASPI approach can be used to study the interplay between histone H3T3-Phos and trimethylation on the adjacent residue lysine 4 (H3K4Me\u2083). Together, our findings indicate the CLASPI approach can be broadly applied to profile protein-protein interactions mediated by PTMs.",

        "abstract": "3-Nitrotyrosine (NT) is approximately 10(3)-fold more acidic than Tyr, and its absorption properties are strongly pH-dependent. NT absorbs radiation in the wavelength range where Tyr and Trp emit fluorescence (300-450 nm), and it is essentially nonfluorescent. Therefore, NT may function as an energy acceptor in resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies for investigating ligand protein interactions. Here, the potentialities of NT were tested on the hirudin thrombin system, a well-characterized protease inhibitor pair of key pharmacological importance. We synthesized two analogs of the N-terminal domain (residues 1-47) of hirudin: Y3NT, in which Tyr3 was replaced by NT, and S2R/Y3NT, containing the substitutions Ser2 --> Arg and Tyr3 --> NT. The binding of these analogs to thrombin was investigated at pH 8 by FRET and UV/Vis-absorption spectroscopy. Upon hirudin binding, the fluorescence of thrombin was reduced by approximately 50%, due to the energy transfer occurring between the Trp residues of the enzyme (i.e., the donors) and the single NT of the inhibitor (i.e., the acceptor). The changes in the absorption spectra of the enzyme inhibitor complex indicate that the phenate moiety of NT in the free state becomes protonated to phenol in the thrombin-bound form. Our results indicate that the incorporation of NT can be effectively used to detect protein protein interactions with sensitivity in the low nanomolar range, to uncover subtle structural features at the ligand protein interface, and to obtain reliable Kd values for structure activity relationship studies. Furthermore, advances in chemical and genetic methods, useful for incorporating noncoded amino acids into proteins, highlight the broad applicability of NT in biotechnology and pharmacological screening.",

Affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS), yeast two-hybrid, imaging approaches and numerous diverse databases have been developed as strategies to analyze PPIs. The past decade has seen an increase in the number of identified proteins with the development of MS and large-scale proteome analyses. Consequently, the false-positive protein identification rate has also increased. Therefore, the general consensus is to confirm PPI data using one or more independent approaches for an accurate evaluation. Furthermore, identifying minor PPIs is fundamental for understanding the functions of transient interactions and low-abundance proteins. Besides establishing PPI methodologies, we are now seeing the development of new methods and/or improvements in existing methods, which involve identifying minor proteins by MS, multidimensional protein identification technology or OFFGEL electrophoresis analyses, one-shot analysis with a long column or filter-aided sample preparation methods. These advanced techniques should allow thousands of proteins to be identified, whereas in-depth proteomic methods should permit the identification of transient binding or PPIs with weak affinity.

The reduced effectiveness of current treatments is largely due to drug resistance, hence the urgent need to develop new drugs, preferably against novel targets. We have recently identified a mitochondrial membrane-anchored protein, designated MIX, which occurs exclusively in these parasites and is essential for virulence. We have determined the crystal structure of Leishmania major MIX to a resolution of 2.4 \u00c5. MIX forms an all \u03b1-helical fold comprising seven \u03b1-helices that fold into a single domain. The distribution of helices is similar to a number of scaffold proteins, namely HEAT repeats, 14-3-3, and tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, suggesting that MIX mediates protein-protein interactions. Accordingly, using copurification and mass spectroscopy we were able to identify several proteins that may interact with MIX in vivo. Being parasite specific, MIX is a promising new drug target and, thus, the structure and potential interacting partners provide a basis for structure-guided drug discovery.",

We benchmarked these assays against positive and random reference sets consisting of well documented pairs of interacting human proteins and randomly chosen protein pairs, respectively. A logistic regression model was trained using the data from these reference sets to combine the assay outputs and calculate the probability that any newly identified interaction pair is a true biophysical interaction once it has been tested in the tool kit.

It has become apparent that protein-protein interactions are critically important to many processes that take place in the cell, including signal transduction, regulation of gene expression, vesicular transport, nuclear import and export, and cell migration (Pawson and Nash, 2003). This has led to the recognition of protein-protein interactions as targets for drug development and to an increased interest in the identification of novel protein-protein interactions (Fry and Vassilev, 2005; Fry, 2006; Tord et al., 2007). Coimmunoprecipitation is a technique that is used to confirm novel protein-protein interactions in the context of a living cell or organism. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation is also used to study the dynamics of protein-protein interactions in response to intra- or extracellular stimuli, or can be used to study the effect of mutations on the ability of a protein to engage its binding partner. In a coimmunoprecipitation experiment, a protein of interest is isolated by immunoprecipitation. Subsequently, the presence of binding partners can be assessed by immunoblotting (see Western Blotting using Chemiluminescent Substrates).",

        "abstract": "The availability of an increased number of fully sequenced genomes demands functional interpretation of the genomic information. Despite high throughput experimental techniques and in silico methods of predicting protein-protein interaction (PPI); the interactome of most organisms is far from completion. Thus, predicting the interactome of an organism is one of the major challenges in the post-genomic era. This manuscript describes Support Vector Machine (SVM) based models that have been developed for discriminating interacting and non-interacting pairs of proteins from their amino acid sequence. We have developed SVM models using various types of sequence compositions e.g. amino acid, dipeptide, biochemical property, split amino acid and pseudo amino acid composition. We also developed SVM models using evolutionary information in the form of Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) composition. We achieved maximum Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 1.00, 0.52 and 0.74 for Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Helicobacter pylori, using dipeptide based SVM model at default threshold. It was observed that the performance of a prediction model depends on the dataset used for training and testing. In case of E. coli MCC decreased from 1.0 to 0.67 when evaluated on a new dataset. In order to understand PPI in different cellular environment, we developed species specific and general models. It was observed that species-specific models are more accurate than general models. We conclude that the primary amino acid sequence based descriptors could be used to differentiate interacting from non-interacting protein pairs. Some amino acids tend to be favored in interacting pairs than non-interacting ones.

Protein-protein interactions are correlated with a proposed potential of mean force equal to the free energy to desolvate the protein surface that is made inaccessible to the solvent due to the protein-protein interaction. This energy is calculated from the surface free energy of the protein that is determined from protein-salt preferential-interaction parameter measurements. In classical salting-out behavior, the protein-salt preferential interaction is unfavorable. Because addition of salt raises the surface free energy of the protein according to the surface-tension increment of the salt, protein-protein attraction increases, leading to a reduction in solubility. When the surface chemistry of proteins is altered by binding of a specific ion, salting-in is observed when the interactions between (kosmotrope) ion-protein complexes are more repulsive than those between the uncomplexed proteins. However, salting-out is observed when interactions between (chaotrope) ion-protein complexes are more attractive than those of the uncomplexed proteins.",

        "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are essential for life. They are responsible for most cellular functions and when they go awry often lead to disease. Proteins are inherently complex. They are flexible macromolecules whose constituent amino acid components act in combinatorial and networked ways when they engage one another in binding interactions. It is just this complexity that allows them to conduct such a broad array of biological functions. Despite decades of intense study of the molecular basis of protein-protein interactions, key gaps in our understanding remain, hindering our ability to accurately predict the specificities and affinities of their interactions. Until recently, most protein-protein investigations have been probed experimentally at the single-amino acid level, making them, by definition, incapable of capturing the combinatorial nature of, and networked communications between, the numerous residues within and outside of the protein-protein interface. This aspect of protein-protein interactions, however, is emerging as a major driving force for protein affinity and specificity. Understanding a combinatorial process necessarily requires a combinatorial experimental tool. Much like the organisms in which they reside, proteins naturally evolve over time, through a combinatorial process of mutagenesis and selection, to functionally associate. Elucidating the process by which proteins have evolved may be one of the keys to deciphering the molecular rules that govern their interactions with one another. Directed evolution is a technique performed in the laboratory that mimics natural evolution on a tractable time scale that has been utilized widely to engineer proteins with novel capabilities, including altered binding properties. In this review, we discuss directed evolution as an emerging tool for dissecting protein-protein interactions.",

Arrays and libraries can be composed from various types of molecules, ranging from small organic compounds to DNA, proteins and peptides. The applications of libraries for detecting and characterizing biological interactions are wide and diverse, including for example epitope mapping, carbohydrate arrays, enzyme binding and protein-protein interactions. Here, we will focus on the use of peptide arrays to study protein-protein interactions. Characterization of protein-protein interactions is crucial for understanding cell functionality. Using peptides, it is possible to map the precise binding sites in such complexes. Peptide array libraries usually contain partly overlapping peptides derived from the sequence of one protein from the complex of interest. The peptides are attached to a solid support using various techniques such as SPOT-synthesis and photolithography. Then, the array is incubated with the partner protein from the complex of interest. Finally, the detection of the protein-bound peptides is carried out by using immunodetection assays. Peptide array screening is semi-quantitative, and quantitative studies with selected peptides in solution are required to validate and complement the screening results. These studies can improve our fundamental understanding of cellular processes by characterizing amino acid patterns of protein-protein interactions, which may even develop into prediction algorithms. The binding peptides can then serve as a basis for the design of drugs that inhibit or activate the target protein-protein interactions. In the current review, we will introduce the recent work on this subject performed in our and in other laboratories. We will discuss the applications, advantages and disadvantages of using peptide arrays as a tool to study protein-protein interactions.",

Our analysis focuses on heterodimers and includes curated structural and thermodynamic data for 113 complexes. We observe a direct correlation between binding affinity and the amount of surface area buried at the interface. For a given amount of surface area buried, the binding affinity spans four orders of magnitude in terms of the dissociation constant (Kd ). Across the entire dataset, we observe no obvious relationship between binding affinity and the chemical composition of the interface. We also calculate the free energy per unit surface area buried, or \"surface energy density,\" of each heterodimer. For interfacial surface areas between 500 and 2000 \u00c5(2) , the surface energy density decreases as the buried surface area increases. As the buried surface area increases beyond about 2000 \u00c5(2) , the surface energy density levels off to a constant value. We believe that these analyses and data will be useful for researchers with an interest in understanding, designing or inhibiting protein-protein interfaces.",

It is constituted of a functional central globular core flanked by a poorly structured N-terminal and large natively unfolded C-terminal domains. Up to now, about 30 different proteins have been reported to physically interact with Knr4. Here, we used an in vivo two-hybrid system approach and an in vitro surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) technique to compare the interaction level of different Knr4 deletion variants with given protein partners. We demonstrate the indispensability of the N-terminal domain of Knr4 for the interactions. On the other hand, presence of the unstructured C-terminal domain has a negative effect on the interaction strength. In protein interactions networks, the most highly connected proteins or \"hubs\" are significantly enriched in unstructured regions, and among them the transient hub proteins contain the largest and most highly flexible regions. The results presented here of our analysis of Knr4 protein suggest that these large disordered regions are not always involved in promoting the protein-protein interactions of hub proteins, but in some cases, might rather inhibit them. We propose that this type of regions could prevent unspecific protein interactions, or ensure the correct timing of occurrence of transient interactions, which may be of crucial importance for different signaling and regulation processes.",

        "abstract": "Novel discoveries in molecular disease pathways within the cell, combined with increasing information regarding protein binding partners has lead to a new approach in drug discovery. There is interest in designing drugs to modulate protein-protein interactions as opposed to solely targeting the catalytic active site within a single enzyme or protein. There are many challenges in this new approach to drug discovery, particularly since the protein-protein interface has a larger surface area, can comprise a discontinuous epitope, and is more amorphous and less well defined than the typical drug design target, a small contained enzyme-binding pocket. Computational methods to predict modes of protein-protein interaction, as well as protein interface hot spots, have garnered significant interest, in order to facilitate the development of drugs to successfully disrupt and inhibit protein-protein interactions. This review summarizes some current methods available for computational protein-protein docking, as well as tabulating some examples of the successful design of antagonists and small molecule inhibitors for protein-protein interactions. Several of these drugs are now beginning to appear in the clinic.",

        "abstract": "High throughput methods for detecting protein interactions require assessment of their accuracy. We present two forms of computational assessment. The first method is the expression profile reliability (EPR) index. The EPR index estimates the biologically relevant fraction of protein interactions detected in a high throughput screen. It does so by comparing the RNA expression profiles for the proteins whose interactions are found in the screen with expression profiles for known interacting and non-interacting pairs of proteins. The second form of assessment is the paralogous verification method (PVM). This method judges an interaction likely if the putatively interacting pair has paralogs that also interact. In contrast to the EPR index, which evaluates datasets of interactions, PVM scores individual interactions. On a test set, PVM identifies correctly 40% of true interactions with a false positive rate of \u223c1%. EPR and PVM were applied to the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP), a large and diverse collection of protein-protein interactions that contains over 8000 Saccharomyces cerevisiae pairwise protein interactions. Using these two methods, we estimate that \u223c50% of them are reliable, and with the aid of PVM we identify confidently 3003 of them. Web servers for both the PVM and EPR methods are available on the DIP website (dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/Services.cgi).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identifying protein-protein interactions is fundamental for understanding the molecular machinery of the cell. Proteome-wide studies of protein-protein interactions are of significant value, but the high-throughput experimental technologies suffer from high rates of both false positive and false negative predictions. In addition to high-throughput experimental data, many diverse types of genomic data can help predict protein-protein interactions, such as mRNA expression, localization, essentiality, and functional annotation. Evaluations of the information contributions from different evidences help to establish more parsimonious models with comparable or better prediction accuracy, and to obtain biological insights of the relationships between protein-protein interactions and other genomic information. RESULTS: Our assessment is based on the genomic features used in a Bayesian network approach to predict protein-protein interactions genome-wide in yeast. In the special case, when one does not have any missing information about any of the features, our analysis shows that there is a larger information contribution from the functional-classification than from expression correlations or essentiality. We also show that in this case alternative models, such as logistic regression and random forest, may be more effective than Bayesian networks for predicting interactions. CONCLUSIONS: In the restricted problem posed by the complete-information subset, we identified that the MIPS and Gene Ontology (GO) functional similarity datasets as the dominating information contributors for predicting the protein-protein interactions under the framework proposed by Jansen et al. Random forests based on the MIPS and GO information alone can give highly accurate classifications. In this particular subset of complete information, adding other genomic data does little for improving predictions. We also found that the data discretizations used in the Bayesian methods decreased classification performance.",

To build on this progress, it is worth analyzing successful cases to understand at a molecular level the strategies by which these compounds effectively interfere with protein-protein pairing. A commonly observed situation is one wherein the small molecule acts as a direct mimic of one of the protein partners. This review focuses exclusively on cases where this strategy is employed, and examines the structural characteristics of the binding sites and the conformational attributes of the small molecule ligands.

Peroxiredoxins function as peroxidasic systems that combine at least a reactivating reductant agent like thioredoxins, and sometimes glutaredoxins and glutathion. In the past three years a number of peroxiredoxin structures were solved by crystallography in different experimental crystallisation conditions. The structures have revealed a significant propensity of peroxiredoxins for oligomerism that was confirmed by biophysical studies in solution using NMR and other methods as analytical ultra-centrifugation. These studies showed that quaternary structures of peroxiredoxins involve specific protein-protein interaction interfaces that rely upon the peroxiredoxin types and/or their redox conditions. The protein-protein interactions with the reactivating redoxins essentially lead to transient unstable complexes.

        "abstract": "Colistin is a polymyxin antibiotic that was discovered in the late 1940s for the treatment of gram-negative infections. After several years of clinical use, its popularity diminished because of reports of significant nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Recently, the antibiotic has resurfaced as a last-line treatment option for multidrug-resistant organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The need for antibiotics with coverage of these gram-negative pathogens is critical because of their high morbidity and mortality, making colistin a very important treatment option. Unfortunately, however, resistance to colistin has been documented among all three of these organisms in case reports. Although the exact mechanism causing colistin resistance has not been defined, it is hypothesized that the PmrA-PmrB and PhoP-PhoQ genetic regulatory systems may play a role. Colistin dosages must be optimized, as colistin is a last-line treatment option; in addition, suboptimal doses have been linked to the development of resistance. The lack of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and no universal harmonization of dose units, however, have made it difficult to derive optimal dosing regimens and specific dosing guidelines for colistin. In critically ill patients who may have multiorgan failure, renal insufficiency may alter colistin pharmacokinetics. Therefore, dosage alterations in this patient population are imperative to achieve maximal efficacy and minimal toxicity. With regard to colistin toxicity, most studies show that nephrotoxicity is reversible and less frequent than once thought, and neurotoxicity is rare. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact that the two regulatory systems have on resistance, as well as the dosages of colistin needed to inhibit and overcome these developing patterns.",

Our preliminary analysis revealed the existence of the funnel in many protein\u2013protein interactions. However, because of the uncertainties in the modeling of these interactions and the ambiguity of the analysis procedures, the detection of the funnels requires detailed quantitative approaches to the energy landscape analysis. A number of such approaches are presented in this study. We show that the funnel detection problem is equivalent to a problem of distinguishing between distributions of low-energy intermolecular matches in the funnel and in the low-frequency landscape fluctuations. If the fluctuations are random, the decision about whether the minimum is the funnel is equivalent to determining whether this minimum is significantly different from a would-be random one. A database of 475 nonredundant cocrystallized protein\u2013protein complexes was used to re-dock the proteins by use of smoothed potentials. To detect the funnel, we developed a set of sophisticated models of random matches. The funnel was considered detected if the binding area was more populated by the low-energy docking predictions than by the matches generated in the random models. The number of funnels detected by use of different random models varied significantly. However, the results confirmed that the funnel may be the general feature in protein\u2013protein association.",

Physically interacting proteins tend to be involved in the same cellular process, and mutations in their genes may lead to similar disease phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether protein-protein interactions can predict genes for genetically heterogeneous diseases. METHODS: 72,940 protein-protein interactions between 10,894 human proteins were used to search 432 loci for candidate disease genes representing 383 genetically heterogeneous hereditary diseases. For each disease, the protein interaction partners of its known causative genes were compared with the disease associated loci lacking identified causative genes. Interaction partners located within such loci were considered candidate disease gene predictions. Prediction accuracy was tested using a benchmark set of known disease genes. RESULTS: Almost 300 candidate disease gene predictions were made. Some of these have since been confirmed. On average, 10% or more are expected to be genuine disease genes, representing a 10-fold enrichment compared with positional information only. Examples of interesting candidates are AKAP6 for arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia 3 and SYN3 for familial partial epilepsy with variable foci. CONCLUSIONS: Exploiting protein-protein interactions can greatly increase the likelihood of finding positional candidate disease genes. When applied on a large scale they can lead to novel candidate gene predictions.",

The expectation is that this will provide a fuller appreciation of cellular processes and networks at the protein level, ultimately leading to a better understanding of disease mechanisms and suggesting new means for intervention. This paper addresses the question: can protein-protein interactions be predicted directly from primary structure and associated data? Using a diverse database of known protein interactions, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning system was trained to recognize and predict interactions based solely on primary structure and associated physicochemical properties. RESULTS: Inductive accuracy of the trained system, defined here as the percentage of correct protein interaction predictions for previously unseen test sets, averaged 80% for the ensemble of statistical experiments. Future proteomics studies may benefit from this research by proceeding directly from the automated identification of a cell's gene products to prediction of protein interaction pairs.",

Elucidating both individual protein associations and complex protein interaction networks, while challenging, is an essential goal of functional genomics. For example, discovering interacting partners for a 'protein of unknown function' can provide insight into actual function far beyond what is possible with sequence-based predictions, and provide a platform for future research. Synthetic genetic approaches such as two-hybrid screening often reveal a perplexing array of potential interacting partners for any given target protein. It is now known, however, that this type of anonymous screening approach can yield high levels of false-positive results, and therefore putative interactors must be confirmed by independent methods. In vitro biochemical strategies for identifying interacting proteins are varied and time-honored, some being as old as the field of protein chemistry itself. Herein we discuss five biochemical approaches for isolating and characterizing protein-protein interactions in vitro: co-immunoprecipitation, blue native gel electrophoresis, in vitro binding assays, protein cross-linking, and rate-zonal centrifugation.

Here, we provide a critical overview of existing structure-independent and structure-based computational methods. Although these techniques have significantly advanced in the past few years, we find that most of them are still in their infancy. We also provide an overview of experimental techniques for the detection of protein-protein interactions. Although the developments are promising, false positive and false negative results are common, and reliable detection is possible only by taking a consensus of different experimental approaches. The shortcomings of experimental techniques affect both the further development and the fair evaluation of computational prediction methods.

They carry out catalytic reactions, transport, form viral capsids, traverse\\r membranes and form regulated channels, transmit information from DNA to RNA, making possible the\\r synthesis of new proteins, and they are responsible for the degradation of unnecessary proteins and\\r nucleic acids. They are the vehicles of the immune response and are responsible for viral entry into\\r the cell. Given their importance, considerable effort has been centered on the prediction of protein\\r function. A prime way to do this is through identification of binding partners. If the function of\\r at least one of the components with which the protein interacts is known, that should let us assign\\r its function(s) and the pathway(s) in which it plays a role. This holds since the vast majority of\\r their chores in the living cell involve protein\u2013protein interactions. Hence, through the intricate\\r network of these interactions we can map cellular pathways, their interconnectivities and their\\r dynamic regulation. Their identification is at the heart of functional genomics; their prediction is\\r crucial for drug discovery. Knowledge of the pathway, its topology, length, and dynamics may provide\\r useful information for forecasting side effects.\\r \\r The goal of predicting protein\u2013protein interactions is daunting. Some associations are obligatory,\\r others are continuously forming and dissociating. In principle, from the physical standpoint, any\\r two proteins can interact, but under what conditions and at which strength? The principles of\\r protein\u2013protein interactions are general: the non-covalent interactions of two proteins are largely\\r the outcome of the hydrophobic effect, which drives the interactions. In addition, hydrogen bonds\\r and electrostatic interactions play important roles. Thus, many of the interactions observed in\\r vitro are the outcome of experimental overexpression.\\r \\r Protein disorder is important in protein\u2013protein association. It has been estimated that a large\\r fraction of cellular proteins are `natively disordered', i.e., unstable in solution. The disordered\\r state has a significant residual structure. In this state, a protein exists in an ensemble of\\r rapidly interconverting conformers. They play roles in cell-cycle control, signal transduction,\\r transcriptional and translational regulation, and in large macromolecular complexes. It has been\\r suggested that natively disordered proteins are more `adaptive', and thus advantageous in regulation\\r and in binding diverse ligands. Alternatively, since the native conformation is still likely to be\\r the most abundant within the ensemble, disordered proteins, which typically have larger interface to\\r size ratios, lead to smaller protein, genome and cell sizes, and thus are functionally advantageous.\\r \\r To be able to predict protein\u2013protein interactions, we need to discern various aspects of their\\r associations: from their shape complementarity to the organization and relative contributions of the\\r different physical components to their stability. They involve the static and the dynamic. Proteins\\r interact through their surfaces. Thus, to analyze their interactions, we typically study residues\\r (or atoms) which are in contact across the two-chain interface. In addition, we often inspect the\\r residues in their vicinity, exploring their supporting matrix. The hope is that through the\\r understanding of the principles and mechanisms of the interactions, we shall eventually be able to\\r solve the protein\u2013protein interaction puzzle.",

        "abstract": "Many proteins can be split into fragments that exhibit enhanced function upon fusion to interacting proteins. While this strategy has been widely used to create protein-fragment complementation assays (PCAs) for discovering protein-protein interactions within mesophilic organisms, similar assays have not yet been developed for studying natural and engineered protein complexes at the temperatures where thermophilic microbes grow. We describe the development of a selection for protein-protein interactions within Thermus thermophilus that is based upon growth complementation by fragments of Thermotoga neapolitana adenylate kinase (AK(Tn)). Complementation studies with an engineered thermophile (PQN1) that is not viable above 75 degrees C because its adk gene has been replaced by a Geobacillus stearothermophilus ortholog revealed that growth could be restored at 78 degrees C by a vector that coexpresses polypeptides corresponding to residues 1-79 and 80-220 of AK(Tn). In contrast, PQN1 growth was not complemented by AK(Tn) fragments harboring a C156A mutation within the zinc-binding tetracysteine motif unless these fragments were fused to Thermotoga maritima chemotaxis proteins that heterodimerize (CheA and CheY) or homodimerize (CheX). This enhanced complementation is interpreted as arising from chemotaxis protein-protein interactions, since AK(Tn)-C156A fragments having only one polypeptide fused to a chemotaxis protein did not complement PQN1 to the same extent. This selection increases the maximum temperature where a PCA can be used to engineer thermostable protein complexes and to map protein-protein interactions.",

For those papers determined to discuss this topic, the relevant information can be captured for the Database of Interacting PROTEINS: Furthermore, suitable gene annotations can also be captured.\\n\\nRESULTS: Our Bayesian approach scores Medline abstracts for probability of discussing the topic of interest according to the frequencies of discriminating words found in the abstract. More than 80 discriminating words (e.g. complex, interaction, two-hybrid) were determined from a training set of 260 Medline abstracts corresponding to previously validated entries in the Database of Interacting Proteins. Using these words and a log likelihood scoring function, approximately 2000 Medline abstracts were identified as describing interactions between yeast proteins. This approach now forms the basis for the rapid expansion of the Database of Interacting Proteins.",

Novel approaches are suggested to tackle some of the challenges in this area. Protein-protein interaction data can provide a wealth of information to better understand the biology of a cell. The analysis of these interactions is also important for the discovery of disease-associated proteins. The data can also be used for the identification of novel cellular sites that are crucial for the development of new and improved pharmaceutical drugs. Knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) is the process of extracting implicit information from large amounts of data using mathematical and statistical methods. It grows in synergy with computer technology, creating new analytical tools and using them for knowledge discovery in large volume of data. A multidisciplinary science and technology with links in statistics, machine learning, database systems, and computer programming and visualization, KDD has proved to be a promising solution to various problems in molecular biology, and gene analysis. An overview of various data mining techniques is presented in this paper with specific examples of their applications in protein-protein interaction data analysis. While some of the most widely used data mining techniques for exploring protein interaction data sets are clustering (including supervised and unsupervised), classification and association rule discovery, others are based on methods for mining interaction information from scientific sources such as PubMed and MedLine. There are areas such as prediction and profiling that have not been explored much for mining information in protein-protein interactions. We propose methods to employ these novel techniques to analyze protein-protein interaction data",

First, we demonstrated that an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip inked with an oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) disulfide compound bearing terminal biotin groups can be used to generate biotin patterns on gold achieving line widths below 100 nm, a generic platform for fabrication of functional nanostructures via the highly specific biotin-streptavidin recognition. Subsequently, we converted such biotin/streptavidin patterns into functional MCh patterns for reversible assembly of histidine-tagged (His-tagged) proteins via the attachment of a tris-nitriloacetic acid (trisNTA) biotin derivative. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed reversible immobilization of the receptor subunit ifnar2-His10 and its interaction with interferon-alpha2 labeled with fluorescent quantum dots in a 7 x 7 dot array consisting of trisNTA spots with a diameter of approximately 230 nm. Moreover, we carried out characterization of the specificity, stability, and reversibility as well as quantitative real-time analysis of protein-protein interactions at the fabricated nanopatterns by imaging surface plasmon resonance.

We examine the distribution of electrostatic and nonelectrostatic contributions to these interactions for two globular proteins, lysozyme and chymosin B, which differ in molecular weight by about a factor of 2. The interaction trends for these proteins are computed in terms of contributions to the osmotic second virial coefficient that are evaluated using atomistic models of the proteins. Our emphasis is on identifying the orientational configurations that contribute most strongly to the overall interactions due to high- complementarity interactions, and on calculating the effect of ionic strength on such interactions. The results emphasize the quantitative importance of several features of protein interactions, notably that despite differences in their frequency of occurrence, configurations differing appreciably in interaction energy can contribute meaningfully to overall interactions. However, relatively small effects due to charge anisotropy or specific hydration can affect the overall interaction significantly only if they contribute to strongly attractive configurations. The results emphasize the necessity of accounting for detailed anisotropy to capture actual experimental trends, and the sensitivity of even very detailed atomistic models to subtle solution contributions.",

        "abstract": "In a cell there is an intricate machinery involved in the biosynthesis of complex oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans. These oligosaccharides play important roles in several biological processes, including the folding and transport of glycoproteins across cellular compartments. Defective glycan synthesis has been shown to have serious pathological consequences and result in several human diseases. The oligosaccharide moieties bind to cellular proteins with high specificity and modulate the homo- and hetero-dimerization of glycoproteins. Owing to the conformational flexibility of oligosaccharides, the torsional angles of a disaccharide unit, particularly around the 1-6-linkage, adjust in such a way that the side groups of the oligosaccharides orient themselves in a manner that promotes favorable interactions with the binding residues of the protein. Branched oligosaccharides cross-link proteins and generate infinite networks of protein-carbohydrate complexes, resulting in the modulation of various cell responses. Glycosaminoglycans, the oligosaccharide moieties of proteoglycans, bind growth factors with a high degree of specificity and induce interactions with growth factor receptors, thereby regulating their biological activity. Using an experimental model system to study the sugar mediated protein-protein interactions, we are investigating the sugar ligand-dependent interactions between ??-Lactalbumin (??-LA) and ??-1,4-galactosyltransferase (??4Gal-T). Also, using a molecular modeling method, we are investigating the heparin dependent dimerization of fibroblast growth factor and growth factor receptor. Our results, together with studies from various other laboratories, support the hypothesis that in the oligosaccharide induced recognition process, sugars accelerate the assembly of the complex by positioning and orienting the molecules in an optimal fashion that brings about specific protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions.",

We present different strategies to adjust the maximum sensitivity window of the assay by influencing the binding strength of the DNA reference duplexes. The binding of the nanobody Enhancer to the different GFP constructs is compared at high sensitivity of the assay. Whereas the binding strength to wild type and enhanced GFP are equal within experimental error, stronger binding to superfolder GFP is observed. This difference in binding strength is attributed to alterations in the amino acids that form contacts according to the crystal structure of the initial wild type GFP-Enhancer complex.

This new type of network represents interactions between individual interfaces used in functional protein binding and thereby contains the detail necessary to describe the competition and cooperation between any pair of binding partners. Here we establish a general framework for the construction of IINs that merges computational structure-based interface assignment with careful curation of available literature. To complement limited structural data, the inclusion of biochemical data is critical for achieving the accuracy and completeness necessary to analyze the specificity and competition between the protein interactions. Firstly, this procedure provides a means to clarify the information content of existing data on purported protein interactions and to remove indirect and spurious interactions. Secondly, the IIN we have constructed here for proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) exhibits distinctive topological properties. In contrast to PPI networks with their global and relatively dense connectivity, the fragmentation of the IIN into distinctive network modules suggests that different functional pressures act on the evolution of its topology. Large modules in the IIN are formed by interfaces sharing specificity for certain domain types, such as SH3 domains distributed across different proteins. The shared and distinct specificity of an interface is necessary for effective negative and positive design of highly selective binding targets. Lastly, the organization of detailed structural data in a network format allows one to identify pathways of specific binding interactions and thereby predict effects of mutations at specific surfaces on a protein and of specific binding inhibitors, as we explore in several examples. Overall, the endocytosis IIN is remarkably complex and rich in features masked in the coarser PPI, and collects relevant detail of protein association in a readily interpretable format.",

A new rate-based coevolutionary method, MMM, preferentially finds obligate interacting proteins that form complexes, conforming to results from studies based on coimmunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry. Using gold-standard databases as a benchmark for accuracy, MMM surpasses methods based on abundance ratios, suggesting that correlated evolutionary rates may yet be better than coexpression at predicting interacting proteins.

Initiation represents the most complex aspect of translation, requiring more accessory proteins, called initiation factors, than either elongation or termination.

The protein interactions from these screens have been used to develop a better understanding of the functions of individual proteins, regulatory pathways, molecular machines, and entire biological systems. The value of this data, however, is limited by the inherent frequency of false positives that arise in most protein interaction screens. Appreciable numbers of false positives can crop up in both low-throughput and high-throughput screens, and even in screens that employ stringent criteria for defining a positive. A number of classification systems have been used to help distinguish false positives from biologically relevant true positives. This chapter describes a system for assigning a confidence score to each interaction based on the probability that it is a true positive. Such confidence scores can be used to prioritize interactions for validation. The scores are also useful for network analysis methods that take advantage of probabilistic edge weights. The scoring method does not rely on gold standard datasets of reliable true positives and true negatives, and thus circumvents the challenges associated with obtaining such datasets. Moreover, the scoring method uses data features that are largely assay-independent, making it useful for interactions obtained from a variety of different technologies and screening methods.",

Ascertaining the reliability of PPIs collected from these diverse studies and scoring them to infer high-confidence networks is a non-trivial task. Moreover, a large number of PPIs share the same number of reported occurrences, making it impossible to distinguish the reliability of these PPIs and rank-order them. For example, for the data analyzed here, we found that the majority (>83%) of currently available human PPIs have been reported only once.\\n\\nRESULTS: In this work, we proposed an unsupervised statistical approach to score a set of diverse, experimentally identified PPIs from nine primary databases to create subsets of high-confidence human PPI networks. We evaluated this ranking method by comparing it with other methods and assessing their ability to retrieve protein associations from a number of diverse and independent reference sets. These reference sets contain known biological data that are either directly or indirectly linked to interactions between proteins. We quantified the average effect of using ranked protein interaction data to retrieve this information and showed that, when compared to randomly ranked interaction data sets, the proposed method created a larger enrichment (~134%) than either ranking based on the hypergeometric test (~109%) or occurrence ranking (~46%).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: From our evaluations, it was clear that ranked interactions were always of value because higher-ranked PPIs had a higher likelihood of retrieving high-confidence experimental data. Reducing the noise inherent in aggregated experimental PPIs via our ranking scheme further increased the accuracy and enrichment of PPIs derived from a number of biologically relevant data sets. These results suggest that using our high-confidence protein interactions at different levels of confidence will help clarify the topological and biological properties associated with human protein networks.",

In a bacterial system where the complete genome sequence is available, it is an arduous task to assign function to a large number of proteins. It is possible that many of them are peripherally associated with a cellular event and it is very difficult to probe such interaction. However, mutations in the genes that encode such proteins (primary mutations) are useful in these studies. Isolation of a suppressor or a second-site mutation that restores the phenotype abolished by the primary mutation could be an elegant yet simple way to follow a set of interacting proteins. Such a reversion site need not necessarily be geometrically close to the primary mutation site.",

Interacting proteins from the extracts are then recovered, trypsinized, and identified using mass spectrometry. The data obtained are searched against a sequence database using the Mascot software.

This viewpoint is derived from the combination of genetic, clinical, imaging and rapidly advancing cell biology data around this gene. All of these areas have been reviewed extensively recently and this review will point you towards some of these excellent papers. My own personal view of the potential importance of DISC1 was echoed in a recent review which suggested that DISC1 may be a 'Rosetta Stone' for schizophrenia research [Ross, Margolis, Reading, Pletnikov and Coyle (2006) Neuron 52, 139-153]. Our own efforts to try to understand the function of DISC1 were through identification of its protein-binding partners. Through an extensive Y2H (yeast two-hybrid) and bioinformatics effort we generated the 'DISC1-Interactome', a comprehensive network of protein-protein interactions around DISC1. In two excellent industry-academia collaborations we focused on two main interacting partners: Ndel1 (nudE nuclear distribution gene E homologue-like 1), an enigmatic protein which may have diverse functions as both a cysteine protease and a key centrosomal structural protein; and PDE4B, a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase. I will review the work around these two protein complexes in detail.",

However, landmark advances in computational analysis, fragment screening and molecular design have enabled development of a host of promising strategies to address the fundamental molecular recognition challenge. An attractive approach for targeting PPIs involves mimicry of protein domains that are critical for complex formation. This approach recognizes that protein subdomains or protein secondary structures are often present at interfaces and serve as organized scaffolds for the presentation of side chain groups that engage the partner protein(s). Design of protein domain mimetics is in principle rather straightforward but is enabled by a host of computational strategies that provide predictions of important residues that should be mimicked.

For example, there are dozens of gene families encoding actin cytoskeletal proteins that elaborate intercellular structures influencing development. Once gene family members evolve compartmentalized expression, protein isovariants are free to coevolve new interacting partners that may be incompatible with other related protein networks. Ancient classes of actin isovariants and actin-binding proteins are clear examples of such coevolving networks. Ectopic expression and suppression studies were used to dissect these interactions. In higher plants, the ectopic expression of a reproductive actin isovariant in vegetative cell types causes aberrant reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton and bizarre development of most organs and tissues. In contrast, overexpression of vegetative actin in vegetative cell types has little effect. The extreme ectopic actin expression phenotypes are suppressed by the coectopic expression of reproductive profilin or actin depolymerizing factor (ADF/cofilin) isovariants, but not by the overexpression of vegetative profilin or ADF. These data provide evidence for the coevolution of organ-specific protein-protein interactions. Thus, understanding the contingent relationships between the evolution of organ-specific isovariant networks and organ origination may be key to explaining multicellular development.",

However, there has been no structural information available to explain such a drastic destabilization. In the present study, we determined the structure of the mutant complex at 1.58 A resolution by X-ray crystallography. The complex was similar to the wild-type complex in terms of overall and interface structures; however, the hydrogen bond network mediated by water molecules at the interface was significantly different. Several water molecules filled the cavity created by the mutation and consequently caused rearrangement of the hydrated water molecules at the interface. The water molecules were redistributed into a channel-like structure that penetrated into the complex. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations showed that the mutation increased the mobility of water molecules at the interface. Since such a drastic change in hydration was not observed in other mutant complexes of bn and bs, the significant destabilization of the interaction may be due to this channel-like structure of hydrated water molecules.",

Such interactions occur abundantly within the cellular milieu and encompass interactions involved in vital cellular processes. Understanding the various types, mechanisms, and consequences of PPIs with respect to cellular signaling and function is vital for targeted drug therapy. Various types of small-molecule drugs and targeted approaches to drug design have been developed to modulate PPIs. Peptidomimetics offer an exciting class of therapeutics as they can be designed to target specific PPIs by mimicking key recognition motifs found at critical points in the interface of PPIs (e.g., hotspots). In contrast to peptides, peptidomimetics do not possess a natural peptide backbone structure but present essential functional groups in a required three-dimensional pattern complimentary to the protein-binding pocket. This design feature overcomes many limitations of peptide therapeutics including limited stability toward peptidases, poor transport across biologic membranes, and poor target specificity. Equally important is deciphering the structural requirements and amino acid residues critical to PPIs. This review provides an up-to-date perspective of the complexity of cellular signaling and strategies for targeting PPIs in disease states, particularly in cancer, using peptidomimetics, and highlights that the rational design of agents that target PPIs is not only feasible but is of the utmost clinical importance.",

Staircase potential electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (SPEIS) was performed to characterize the impedance and charge transfer characteristics of the alphaFN-doped PPy as a function of applied voltage, frequency, and FN concentration. Impedance measurements indicated oxidation of alphaFN-doped PPy promoted selective binding of FN to alphaFN antibodies and reduction of the polymer films facilitated FN dissociation. Moreover, SPEIS measurements suggested that the apparent reversibility of antigen binding to antibody-doped PPy is not due to the suppression of hydrophobic binding forces between antibody and antigen. Instead, our data indicate that reversible antigen binding to antibody-doped PPy can be attributed to the minimization of charge in the polymer films during oxidation and reduction. Furthermore, alphaFN-doped PPy was utilized to collect real-time, dynamic measurements of varying FN concentrations in solution by repeatedly binding and releasing FN. Our data demonstrate that antibody-doped PPy represents an electrically controllable sensing platform which can be exploited to collect rapid, repeated measurements of protein concentrations with molecular specificity.",

        "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins often bind to more than one partner. In this study, we focused on 11 sets of complexes in which the same disordered segment becomes bound to two or more distinct partners. For this collection of protein complexes, two or more partners of each disordered segment were selected to have less than 25% amino acid identity at structurally aligned positions. As it turned out that most of the examples so selected had similar 3D structure, the studied set was reduced to just these similar-fold cases. Based on the analyses of the interacting partners, the average sequence identity of the partners' binding regions showed substantially higher conservation as compared to the nonbinding regions: The residue identities, averaged over the 11 sets of partner proteins, were as follows: binding residues, 42 \u00b1 6%; nonbinding residues 20 \u00b1 3%; nonbinding buried residues 26 \u00b1 5%; and nonbinding surface residues 16 \u00b1 3%. The higher sequence identity of the binding residues compared to the other sets of residues provides evidence that these observed interactions are likely to be meaningful biological interactions, not artifacts. Since many of the features of the various interactions indicate that the disordered binding segments were likely to have been disordered before binding, these results also add further weight to the existence and function of intrinsically disordered regions inside cells.",

        "abstract": "Finding new drug targets for pathogenic infections would be of great utility for humanity, as there is a large need to develop new drugs to fight infections due to the developing resistance and side effects of current treatments. Current drug targets for pathogen infections involve only a single protein. However, proteins rarely act in isolation, and the majority of biological processes occur via interactions with other proteins, so protein-protein interactions (PPIs) offer a realm of unexplored potential drug targets and are thought to be the next-generation of drug targets. Parasitic worms were chosen for this study because they have deleterious effects on human health, livestock, and plants, costing society billions of dollars annually and many sequenced genomes are available. In this study, we present a computational approach that utilizes whole genomes of 6 parasitic and 1 free-living worm species and 2 hosts. The species were placed in orthologous groups, then binned in species-specific orthologous groups. Proteins that are essential and conserved among species that span a phyla are of greatest value, as they provide foundations for developing broad-control strategies. Two PPI databases were used to find PPIs within the species specific bins. PPIs with unique helminth proteins and helminth proteins with unique features relative to the host, such as indels, were prioritized as drug targets. The PPIs were scored based on RNAi phenotype and homology to the PDB (Protein DataBank). EST data for the various life stages, GO annotation, and druggability were also taken into consideration. Several PPIs emerged from this study as potential drug targets. A few interactions were supported by co-localization of expression in M. incognita (plant parasite) and B. malayi (H. sapiens parasite), which have extremely different modes of parasitism. As more genomes of pathogens are sequenced and PPI databases expanded, this methodology will become increasingly applicable.",

Although the regulation of cellular processes is mediated to a large extent by posttranslational modification of proteins, the target specificity of enzymic, e.g. protein kinase and phosphatase, activities derives in large part from protein-protein interactions (PPIs) rather than enzyme substrate specificity. Similarly, signal transduction through interaction of biol. effectors such as hormones and cytokines with their receptors is mediated by PPIs. For this reason PPIs represent attractive targets for modern mechanism based drug design. PPIs have been more difficult to modulate pharmacol. with drug-like small mols. than catalytic sites, however. The reasons for this apparent lack of success with PPI inhibitors are discussed here and new insights into the requirements for effective PPI modulation from both the ligand and receptor viewpoints are summarised. In particular, the emerging concept of protein plasticity and its implications for drug discovery and design are introduced. Recent breakthroughs with drug-like small mols. targeting PPIs are presented as a series of case studies in order to illustrate modern concepts and peptidomimetic techniques that will hopefully result in the development of a new generation of disease mechanism based PPI modulator drugs. on SciFinder (R)",

Increasing the ion activation (collision energy) causes unfolding and subsequent ejection of a highly charged monomer from the membrane protein complexes. Further increase of the ion activation then causes collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the ejected monomers, with fragments observed which were predominantly found to stem from membrane embedded regions.

A computational approach to predict protein interactions on a proteome-wide basis would therefore consist of identifying modular domains and sequence motifs from protein primary sequence data, creating sequence specificity-based algorithms to connect a domain in one protein with a motif in another in \"interaction space,\" and then graphically constructing possible interaction networks. Computational methods for predicting modular domains in proteins have been quite successful, but identifying the short sequence motifs these domains recognize has been more difficult. We are developing improved methods to identify these motifs by combining experimental and computational techniques with databases of sequences and binding information. Scansite is a web-accessible program that predicts interactions between proteins using experimental binding data from peptide library and phage display experiments. This program focuses on domains important in cell signaling, but it can, in principle, be used for other interactions if the domains and binding motifs are known.

The unknown or uncharacterized PPIs involved in such interaction networks often represent compelling therapeutic targets for drug discovery. To date, however, the main strategies for discovery of small molecule modulators of PPIs are typically limited to structurally characterized targets. Recent developments in molecular scaffolds that mimic the side chain display of peptide secondary structures have yielded effective designs, but few screening libraries of such mimetics are available to interrogate PPI targets. We initiated a program to prepare a comprehensive small molecule library designed to mimic the three major recognition motifs that mediate PPIs (\u03b1-helix, \u03b2-turn, and \u03b2-strand). Three libraries would be built around templates designed to mimic each such secondary structure and substituted with all triplet combinations of groups representing the 20 natural amino acid side chains. When combined, the three libraries would contain a member capable of mimicking the key interaction and recognition residues of most targetable PPIs. In this Account, we summarize the results of the design, synthesis, and validation of an 8000 member \u03b1-helix mimetic library and a 4200 member \u03b2-turn mimetic library. We expect that the screening of these libraries will not only provide lead structures against \u03b1-helix- or \u03b2-turn-mediated protein-protein or peptide-receptor interactions, even if the nature of the interaction is unknown, but also yield key insights into the recognition motif (\u03b1-helix or \u03b2-turn) and identify the key residues mediating the interaction. Consistent with this expectation, the screening of the libraries against p53/MDM2 and HIV-1 gp41 (\u03b1-helix mimetic library) or the opioid receptors (\u03b2-turn mimetic library) led to the discovery of library members expected to mimic the known endogenous ligands. These efforts led to the discovery of high-affinity \u03b1-helix mimetics (K(i) = 0.7 \u03bcM) against HIV-1 gp41 as well as high-affinity and selective \u03b2-turn mimetics (K(i) = 80 nM) against the \u03ba-opioid receptor. The results suggest that the use of such comprehensive libraries of peptide secondary structure mimetics, built around effective molecular scaffolds, constitutes a powerful method of interrogating PPIs. These structures provide small molecule modulators of PPI networks for therapeutic target validation, lead compound discovery, and the identification of modulators of biological processes for further study.",

        "abstract": "Following the completion of genome projects in a number of organisms, it is becoming evident that a relatively large proportion of the genes identified encode for proteins that have no sequence homology with known proteins. One possible approach towards understanding protein function is to identify the proteins with which a particular protein associates. Although very powerful, the most commonly used genetic method, the two-hybrid system, is limited in its ability to detect all possible protein-protein interactions. The development of novel approaches, such as the protein recruitment systems, provides attractive alternatives towards identification of protein-protein interactions where other methods have failed to function.",

        "abstract": "Many proteins exert their biological roles as components of complexes, and the functions of proteins are often determined by their specific interactions with other proteins. Because of the central importance of protein-protein interactions for cellular processes, the ability to interfere with specific protein-protein interactions provides a powerful means of influencing the function of selected proteins within the cell. Cell-permeable small organic modulators of protein-protein interactions are thus highly desirable tools both for the study of physiological cellular processes and for the treatment of numerous diseased states. Herein a number of protein-protein interactions that are considered to be pharmaceutical targets are presented, which will familiarize the reader with the strategies that have been employed for the successful identification of small molecule modulators of these protein-protein interactions. These encouraging examples suggest that combined research efforts in the areas of functional proteomics, assay development, and organic synthesis will open up novel possibilities for the treatment of human diseases in the future.",

The electrostatic energy was estimated by solving the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation. A free energy decomposition scheme was developed to determine binding energy hot spots of each complex. The calculations identified amino acids of the antibody that make important contributions to the interaction with lysozyme. They further showed the influence of small structural variations on the energetics of binding and they showed that the antibody amino acids that make up the hot spots are organized in such a way as to mimic the lysozyme substrate. Through further analysis of the results, we define the concept of \"efficient amino acids,\" which can provide an assessment of the binding potential of a particular hot spot interaction. This information, in turn, can be useful in the rational design of small molecules that mimic the antibody. The implications of using free energy decomposition to identify regions of a protein-protein complex that could be targeted by small molecules inhibitors are discussed.",

Because they are reported to play essential roles in cellular control, there has been a special interest in the study of their structural and functional properties, yet the mechanisms by which they evolve to maintain functional interactions are poorly understood. By combining biophysical simulations of coarse-grained proteins and analysis of proteins-complex crystallographic structures, we seek to elucidate those mechanisms. We focus on two types of hub proteins: Multi hubs, which interact with their partners through different interfaces, and Singlish hubs, which do so through a single interface. We show that loss of structural stability is required for the evolution of protein-protein-interaction (PPI) networks, and it is more profound in Singlish hub systems. In addition, different ratios of hydrophobic to electrostatic interfacial amino acids are shown to support distinct network topologies (i.e., Singlish and Multi systems), and therefore underlie a fundamental design principle of PPI in a crowded environment. We argue that the physical nature of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, in particular, their favoring of either same-type interactions (hydrophobic-hydrophobic), or opposite-type interactions (negatively-positively charged) plays a key role in maintaining the network topology while allowing the protein amino acid sequence to evolve.",

A computational approach to predict protein interactions on a proteome-wide basis would therefore consist of identifying modular domains and sequence motifs from protein primary sequence data, creating sequence specificity-based algorithms to connect a domain in one protein with a motif in another in \"interaction space,\" and then graphically constructing possible interaction networks. Computational methods for predicting modular domains in proteins have been quite successful, but identifying the short sequence motifs these domains recognize has been more difficult. We are developing improved methods to identify these motifs by combining experimental and computational techniques with databases of sequences and binding information. Scansite is a web-accessible program that predicts interactions between proteins using experimental binding data from peptide library and phage display experiments. This program focuses on domains important in cell signaling, but it can, in principle, be used for other interactions if the domains and binding motifs are known. This chapter describes in detail how to use Scansite to predict the binding partners of an input protein, and how to find all proteins that contain a given sequence motif.",

        "abstract": "A new method is described for isolating and identifying proteins participating in protein-protein interactions in a complex mixture. The method uses a cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose matrix to isolate proteins that are non-covalently bound to other proteins. Because the proteins are accessible to chemical manipulation, mass spectrometric identification of the proteins can yield information on specific classes of interacting proteins, such as calcium-dependent or substrate-dependent protein interactions. This permits selection of a subpopulation of proteins from a complex mixture on the basis of specified interaction criteria. The new method has the advantage of screening the entire proteome simultaneously, unlike the two-hybrid system or phage display, which can only detect proteins binding to a single bait protein at a time. The method was tested by selecting rat brain extract for proteins exhibiting calcium-dependent protein interactions. Of 12 proteins identified by mass spectrometry, eight were either known calcium-binding proteins or proteins with known calcium-dependent protein interactions, indicating that the method is capable of enriching a subpopulation of proteins from a complex mixture on the basis of a specific class of protein interactions. Because only naturally occurring interactions of proteins in their native state are observed, this method will have wide applicability to studies of protein interactions in tissue samples and autopsy specimens, for screening for perturbations of protein-protein interactions by signaling molecules, pharmacological agents or toxins, and screening for differences between cancerous and untransformed cells.",

Thus, the discovery and validation of protein-protein interactions, and the consequent formation of protein complexes, is an integral and essential component of plant biology research. The ability to efficiently and accurately determine existing protein networks is necessary to further our understanding of plant biology.

Here we have outlined several straightforward methods aimed at first discovering protein-protein interactions and then characterizing them utilizing additional approaches. We first describe methods for rate-zonal centrifugation, in vitro binding assays, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in the context of discovering novel protein-protein interactions. Next, we discuss methods for characterizing and validating these interactions using alternative approaches: yeast two-hybrid, in vitro pull-down assays, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). Obviously each of these methods need not be performed in parallel; rather our goal was to describe several approaches, some of which may be more appropriate for increasingly specialized laboratory environments.",

The experimentally derived static structure factors S(Q) obtained without and with added cosolvents and salts are analysed with a statistical mechanical model based on the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) potential, which accounts for repulsive and attractive interactions between the protein molecules. Different cosolvents and salts influence the interactions between protein molecules differently as a result of changes in the hydration level or solvation, in charge screening, specific adsorption of the additives at the protein surface, or increased hydrophobic interactions. Intermolecular interaction effects are significant above protein concentrations of 1 wt %, and with increasing protein concentration, the repulsive nature of the intermolecular pair potential V(r) increases markedly. Kosmotropic cosolvents like glycerol and sucrose exhibit strong concentration-dependent effects on the interaction potential, leading to an increase of repulsive forces between the protein molecules at low to medium high osmolyte concentrations. Addition of trifluoroethanol exhibits a multiphasic effect on V(r) when changing its concentration. Salts like sodium chloride and potassium sulfate exhibit strong concentration-dependent changes of the interaction potential due to charge screening of the positively charged protein molecules. Guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) at low concentrations exhibits a similar charge-screening effect, resulting in increased attractive interactions between the protein molecules. At higher GdmCl concentrations, V(r) becomes more repulsive in nature due to the presence of high concentrations of Gdm(+) ions binding to the protein molecules. Our findings also imply that in calculations of thermodynamic properties of proteins in solution and cosolvent mixtures, activity coefficients may not generally be neglected in the concentration range above 1 wt % protein.",

Determination of the protein-protein structures and insight into their interactions are vital to understand the mechanisms of protein functions. Currently, compared with the isolated protein structures, only a small fraction of protein-protein structures are experimentally solved. Therefore, the computational docking methods play an increasing role in predicting the structures and interactions of protein-protein complexes. The scoring function of protein-protein interactions is the key responsible for the accuracy of the computational docking. Previous scoring functions were mostly developed by optimizing the binding affinity which determines the stability of the protein-protein complex, but they are often lack of the consideration of specificity which determines the discrimination of native protein-protein complex against competitive ones.\\n\\nRESULTS: We developed a scoring function (named as SPA-PP, specificity and affinity of the protein-protein interactions) by incorporating both the specificity and affinity into the optimization strategy. The testing results and comparisons with other scoring functions show that SPA-PP performs remarkably on both predictions of binding pose and binding affinity. Thus, SPA-PP is a promising quantification of protein-protein interactions, which can be implemented into the protein docking tools and applied for the predictions of protein-protein structure and affinity.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY: The algorithm is implemented in C language, and the code can be downloaded from http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1865642/Optimization.cpp.",

Using the x-ray coordinates of the free and bound proteins, the absolute binding free energy was computed assuming additivity of three well-defined, physical processes: desolvation of the x-ray structures, isomerization of the x-ray conformation to a nearby local minimum in the gas-phase, and subsequent noncovalent complex formation in the gas phase. This free energy scheme, together with the Generalized Born model for computing the electrostatic solvation free energy, yielded binding free energies in remarkable agreement with experimental data. Two assumptions commonly used in theoretical treatments; viz., the rigid-binding approximation (which assumes no conformational change upon complexation) and the neglect of vdW interactions, were found to yield large errors in the binding free energy. Protein-protein vdW and electrostatic interactions between complementary surfaces over a relatively large area (1400--1700 A(2)) were found to drive antibody-antigen and protease-inhibitor binding.",

We start this review by describing three techniques that can be used for this purpose: (i) affinity-tagged proteins (ii) the two-hybrid system and (iii) some quantitative proteomic techniques that can be used in combination with, e.g., affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation for screening of protein-protein interactions. We then describe some public protein-protein interaction databases that can be searched to identify previously reported interactions for a given bait protein.

Importantly, BRET also allows for monitoring of protein-protein interactions, in real time, in intact living cells that can be submitted to various stimuli. Moreover, quantitative BRET analysis also permits a pharmacological approach of protein-protein interactions, allowing one to determine whether a given stimulus induces a conformational change within preassociated partners or increases the association (recruitment) between two separated partners. Determination of the proportion of the dimeric vs monomeric form of a protein in the cell also is possible.

Ultimately, the combination of these sources of information will allow the prediction of interactions among proteins where only domain composition is known. Based on the currently available protein-protein interaction and domain data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster we introduce a novel method, Maximum Specificity Set Cover (MSSC), to predict potential protein-protein interactions. Utilizing interactions and domain architectures of domains as training sets, this algorithm employs a set cover approach to partition domain pairs, which allows the explanation of the underlying protein interaction to the largest degree of specificity. While MSSC in its basic version only considers domain pairs as the driving force between interactions, we also modified the algorithm to account for combinations of more than two domains that govern a protein-protein interaction. This approach allows us to predict the previously unknown protein-protein interactions in S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster, with a degree of sensitivity and specificity that clearly outscores other approaches. As a proof of concept we also observe high levels of co-expression and decreasing GO distances between interacting proteins. Although our results are very encouraging, we observe that the quality of predictions significantly depends on the quality of interactions, which were utilized as the training set of the algorithm. The algorithm is part of a Web portal available at http://ppi.cse.nd.edu .",

        "abstract": "Protein-protein interfaces are prominent in many therapeutically important targets. Using small organic molecules to disrupt protein-protein interactions is a current challenge in chemical biology. An important example of protein-protein interactions is provided by the Myc protein, which is frequently deregulated in human cancers. Myc belongs to the family of basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) transcription factors. It is biologically active only as heterodimer with the bHLH-ZIP protein Max. Herein, we report a new strategy for the disruption of protein-protein interactions that has been corroborated through the design and synthesis of a small parallel library composed of 'credit-card' compounds. These compounds are derived from a planar, aromatic scaffold and functionalized with four points of diversity. From a 285 membered library, several hits were obtained that disrupted the c-Myc-Max interaction and cellular functions of c-Myc. The IC50 values determined for this small focused library for the disruption of Myc-Max dimerization are quite potent, especially since small molecule antagonists of protein-protein interactions are notoriously difficult to find. Furthermore, several of the compounds were active at the cellular level as shown by their biological effects on Myc action in chicken embryo fibroblast assays. In light of our findings, this approach is considered a valuable addition to the armamentarium of new molecules being developed to interact with protein-protein interfaces. Finally, this strategy for disrupting protein-protein interactions should prove applicable to other families of proteins. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

By monitoring different kinds of protein shape-complementarity modes, we gave a clear mechanism to reveal the role of the shape complementarity in the protein-protein interactions, i.e., when the two proteins with shape complementarity approach each other, the conformation of lipid chains between two proteins would be restricted significantly. The lipid molecules tend to leave the gap formed by two proteins to maximize the configuration entropy, and therefore yield an effective entropy-induced protein-protein attraction, which enhances the protein aggregation. In short, this work provides an insight into understanding the importance of the shape complementarity in the protein-protein interactions especially for protein aggregation and antibody-antigen complexes. Definitely, the shape complementarity is the third key factor affecting protein aggregation and complex, besides the electrostatic-complementarity and hydrophobic complementarity.",

Recently, two alternative systems have been described that take advantage of the fact that localization of signal transduction effectors to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is absolutely necessary for yeast viability. These effectors can either be the Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange factor or Ras itself. The yeast strain used in both systems is a temperature-sensitive mutant in the yeast Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange factor, CDC25. Membrane localization of these effectors is achieved via protein +/- protein interaction. Each system can be used to test interaction between known protein pairs, as well as for isolation of novel protein interactions.

Their exterior is hydrophilic and their cavity is hydrophobic, which gives cyclodextrins the ability to accommodate hydrophobic molecules/moieties in the cavity. This special molecular arrangement accounts for the variety of beneficial effects cyclodextrins have on proteins, which is widely used in pharmacological applications. We have studied the interaction between beta-cyclodextrin and four non-carbohydrate-binding model proteins: ubiquitin, chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), S6 and insulin SerB9Asp by NMR spectroscopy at varying structural detail. We demonstrate that the interaction of beta-cyclodextrin and our model proteins takes place at specific sites on the protein surface, and that solvent accessibility of those sites is a necessary but not compelling condition for the occurrence of an interaction. If this behaviour can be generalized, it might explain the wide range of different effects of cyclodextrins on different proteins: aggregation suppression (if residues responsible for aggregation are highly solvent accessible), protection against degradation (if point of attack of a protease is sterically 'masked' by cyclodextrin), alteration of function (if residues involved in function are 'masked' by cyclodextrin).

The number of quaternary folds thus corresponds to the number of ways proteins physically interact with other proteins. This study focuses on answering two basic questions: Whether the number of protein-protein interactions is limited and, if yes, how many different quaternary folds exist in nature. By all-to-all sequence and structure comparisons, we grouped the protein complexes in the protein data bank (PDB) into 3,629 families and 1,761 folds. A statistical model was introduced to obtain the quantitative relation between the numbers of quaternary families and quaternary folds in nature. The total number of possible protein-protein interactions was estimated around 4,000, which indicates that the current protein repository contains only 42% of quaternary folds in nature and a full coverage needs approximately a quarter century of experimental effort. The results have important implications to the protein complex structural modeling and the structure genomics of protein-protein interactions.",

Calmodulin has long been known to be an allosteric modulator of the three major NO synthases (NOS). Recent studies indicate that other proteins directly associate with NOS isoforms and regulate their activity or spatial distribution in the cell. Several proteins residing in or recruited to plasmalemmal caveolae of endothelial cells serve as allosteric regulators of endothelial NOS (eNOS). Caveolins, the resident scaffolding proteins of caveolae, and calmodulin undergo reciprocal Ca2+-dependent association and dissociation with eNOS in the caveolar membrane that inhibits (caveolins) and activates (calmodulin) eNOS activity. Other caveolar proteins appear to contribute to the eNOS-membrane complex, including the bradykinin B2 receptor, the angiotensin AT1 receptor, the CAT1 arginine transporter, and Hsp90. Direct interactions of a variety of proteins bearing PDZ domains with the PDZ domain of neuronal NOS (nNOS) have been shown to influence the subcellular distribution and/or activity of the enzyme in brain and muscle. One of these proteins, PSD-93, co-localizes with a subpopulation of nNOS in the macula densa. Although considerable emphasis has been placed on transcription as the principal step of regulation for inducible NOS (iNOS), our laboratory has recently defined a regulatory interaction of iNOS with Rho family GTPases.

The simulations consist of three-bead lipids and platelike proteins, which adsorb onto the membrane by binding preferentially to one of the two lipid species. The composition profile around one protein and the pair correlation function between two proteins are measured and compared to the analytical predictions. The theoretical framework is applicable to any scalar field embedded in the membrane, and although in this work the authors treat flat membranes, the methodology extends readily to curved geometries. Neglecting fluctuations, both lipid composition profile and induced protein pair potential are predicted to follow a zeroth order modified Bessel function of the second kind with the same characteristic decay length. These predictions are consistent with our molecular dynamics simulations, except that the interaction range is found to be larger than the single profile correlation length.",

This need has prompted the development of a number of methods for predicting protein-protein interactions based on various sources of data and methodologies. The common method for choosing negative examples for training a predictor of protein-protein interactions is based on annotations of cellular localization, and the observation that pairs of proteins that have different localization patterns are unlikely to interact. While this method leads to high quality sets of non-interacting proteins, we find that this choice can lead to biased estimates of prediction accuracy, because the constraints placed on the distribution of the negative examples makes the task easier. The effects of this bias are demonstrated in the context of both sequence-based and non-sequence based features used for predicting protein-protein interactions.",

Each stage involves multiple stable or transient interactions between protein subunits with functions that are more or less conserved in all organisms. In Escherichia coli, initiation of bidirectional replication at the origin (oriC) occurs through the concerted actions of the DnaA replication initiator protein, the hexameric DnaB helicase, the DnaC?helicase loading partner and the DnaG primase, leading to establishment of two replication forks. Elongation of RNA primers at each fork proceeds simultaneously on both strands by actions of the multimeric replicase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The fork that arrives first in the terminus region is halted by its encounter with a correctly-oriented complex of the Tus replication terminator protein bound at one of several Ter sites, where it is trapped until the other fork arrives. We summarize current understanding of interactions among the various proteins that act in the different stages of replication of the chromosome of E. coli, and make some comparisons with the analogous proteins in Bacillus subtilis and the coliphages T4 and T7.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: A recent study demonstrated the presence of protein-protein interactions among lens crystallins in a mammalian cell two-hybrid system assay and speculated about the significance of these interactions for protein solubility and lens transparency. The current study extends those findings to the following crystallin genes involved in some congenital cataracts: CRYAA (R116C), CRYAB (R120G), and CRYGC (T5P). METHODS: A mammalian two-hybrid system was used to assay the protein-protein interactions. Congenital cataract crystallin genes were cloned and fused into the two-hybrid system vectors (target and prey proteins). Together, with the third vector containing a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), they were cotransfected into human HeLa cells. The presence of protein-protein interactions and the strength of these interactions were assayed by CAT ELISA. RESULTS: The pattern of changes in protein-protein interactions of those congenital cataract gene products with the three major crystallins, alphaA- or alphaB-, betaB2-, and gammaC-crystallins, differed. For the T5P gammaC-crystallin, most of the interactions were decreased; for the R116C alphaA-crystallin, the interactions with betaB2- and gammaC-crystallin decreased and those with alphaB-crystallin and heat-shock protein (Hsp)27 increased; and for the R120G alphaB-crystallin, the interactions with alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin decreased, but those with betaB2- and gammaC-crystallin increased slightly. An attempt was made to interpret the results on the basis of conformational change and disruption of dimeric interaction involving beta-strands. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly indicate that crystallin mutations involved in congenital cataracts altered protein-protein interactions, which may contribute to decreased protein solubility and formation of cataract.",

        "abstract": "The methods of continuum electrostatics are used to calculate the binding free energies of a set of protein-protein complexes including experimentally determined structures as well as other orientations generated by a fast docking algorithm. In the native structures, charged groups that are deeply buried were often found to favor complex formation (relative to isosteric nonpolar groups), whereas in nonnative complexes generated by a geometric docking algorithm, they were equally likely to be stabilizing as destabilizing. These observations were used to design a new filter for screening docked conformations that was applied, in conjunction with a number of geometric filters that assess shape complementarity, to 15 antibody-antigen complexes and 14 enzyme-inhibitor complexes. For the bound docking problem, which is the major focus of this paper, native and near-native solutions were ranked first or second in all but two enzyme-inhibitor complexes. Less success was encountered for antibody-antigen complexes, but in all cases studied, the more complete free energy evaluation was able to identify native and near-native structures. A filter based on the enrichment of tyrosines and tryptophans in antibody binding sites was applied to the antibody-antigen complexes and resulted in a native and near-native solution being ranked first and second in all cases. A clear improvement over previously reported results was obtained for the unbound antibody-antigen examples as well. The algorithm and various filters used in this work are quite efficient and are able to reduce the number of plausible docking orientations to a size small enough so that a final more complete free energy evaluation on the reduced set becomes computationally feasible.",

        "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are essential for almost all cellular processes, hence understanding these processes mainly depends on the identification and characterization of the relevant protein-protein interactions. In the present paper, we introduce the concept of TRS (trans-SUMOylation), a new method developed to identify and verify protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells in vivo. TRS utilizes Ubc9-fusion proteins that trans-SUMOylate co-expressed interacting proteins. Using TRS, we analysed interactions of 65 protein pairs co-expressed in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells. We identified seven new and confirmed 16 known protein interactions, which were determined via endogenous SUMOylation sites of the binding partners or by using SUMOylation-site tags respectively. Four of the new protein interactions were confirmed by GST (glutathione transferase) pull-down and the p38\u03b1-Edr2 interaction was verified by co-localization analysis. Functionally, this p38\u03b1-Edr2 interaction could possibly be involved in the recruitment of p38\u03b1 to the polycomb chromatin-remodelling complex to phosphorylate Bmi1. We also used TRS to characterize protein-interaction domains of the protein kinase pairs p38\u03b1-MK2 [MK is MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-activated protein kinase] and ERK3 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 3)-MK5 and of the p38\u03b1-p53 complex. The ability of TRS to monitor protein interactions in mammalian cells in vivo at levels similar to endogenous expression makes it an excellent new tool that can help in defining the protein interactome of mammalian cells.",

        "abstract": "We show that the mechanism for molecular recognition requires one of the interacting proteins, usually the smaller of the two, to anchor a specific side chain in a structurally constrained binding groove of the other protein, providing a steric constraint that helps to stabilize a native-like bound intermediate. We identify the anchor residues in 39 protein-protein complexes and verify that, even in the absence of their interacting partners, the anchor side chains are found in conformations similar to those observed in the bound complex. These ready-made recognition motifs correspond to surface side chains that bury the largest solvent-accessible surface area after forming the complex (> or =100 A2). The existence of such anchors implies that binding pathways can avoid kinetically costly structural rearrangements at the core of the binding interface, allowing for a relatively smooth recognition process. Once anchors are docked, an induced fit process further contributes to forming the final high-affinity complex. This later stage involves flexible (solvent-exposed) side chains that latch to the encounter complex in the periphery of the binding pocket. Our results suggest that the evolutionary conservation of anchor side chains applies to the actual structure that these residues assume before the encounter complex and not just to their loci. Implications for protein docking are also discussed.",

In this study, we present a method that combines in vitro protein production with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure PPIs. This method uses readily available commodity instrumentation and generic antibody-affinity tag interactions. It is straightforward and rapid to execute, enabling many interactions to be assessed in parallel. In traditional ELISAs, reporter complexes are assembled stepwise with one layer at a time. In the method presented here, all the members of the reporter complex are present and assembled together. The signal strength is dependent on all the intercomponent interaction affinities and concentrations. Although this assay is straightforward to execute, establishing proper conditions and analysis of the results require a thorough understanding of the processes that determine the signal strength. The formation of the fully assembled reporter sandwich can be modeled as a competition between Langmuir adsorption isotherms for the immobilized components and binding equilibria of the solution components. We have shown that modeling this process provides semiquantitative understanding of the effects of affinity and concentration and can guide strategies for the development of experimental protocols. We tested the method experimentally using the interaction between a synthetic ankyrin repeat protein (Off7) and maltose-binding protein. Measurements obtained for a collection of alanine mutations in the interface between these two proteins demonstrate that a range of affinities can be analyzed.",

An algorithm to design an optimal energy function, based on empirical data of protein complexes, is proposed and applied. Emphasis is made on negative design in which incorrect geometries are presented to the algorithm that learns to avoid them. For the docking problem the search for plausible geometries can be performed exhaustively. The possible geometries of the complex are generated on a grid with the help of a fast Fourier transform algorithm. A novel formulation of negative design makes it possible to investigate iteratively hundreds of millions of negative examples while monotonically improving the quality of the potential. Experimental structures for 640 protein complexes are used to generate positive and negative examples for learning parameters. The algorithm designed in this work finds the correct binding structure as the lowest energy minimum in 318 cases of the 640 examples. Further benchmarks on independent sets confirm the significant capacity of the scoring function to recognize correct modes of interactions.",

It currently involves electrophoresis and western blotting, which are not optimized for detecting weak and transient interactions. In this protocol we describe an advanced version of co-IP analysis that uses real-time, single-molecule fluorescence imaging as its detection scheme. Bait proteins are pulled down onto the imaging plane of a total internal reflection (TIR) microscope. With unpurified cells or tissue extracts kept in reaction chambers, we observe single protein-protein interactions between the surface-immobilized bait and the fluorescent protein-labeled prey proteins in real time. Such direct recording provides an improvement of five orders of magnitude in the time resolution of co-IP analysis. With the single-molecule sensitivity and millisecond time resolution, which distinguish our method from other methods for measuring weak protein-protein interactions, it is possible to quantify the interaction kinetics and active fraction of native, unlabeled bait proteins. Real-time single-molecule co-IP analysis, which takes \u223c4 h to complete from lysate preparation to kinetic analysis, provides a general avenue for revealing the rich kinetic picture of target protein-protein interactions, and it can be used, for example, to investigate the molecular lesions that drive individual cancers at the level of protein-protein interactions.",

Our model is motivated by the recently developed yeast two-hybrid method for measuring protein-protein interaction networks. We suggest that the same phenomenological BRF can also be applied to the mass spectroscopic measurement of protein-protein interactions. Based on the model, we investigate the contributions to the network topology of protein-protein interactions from (i) the distribution of protein binary association free energy, and from (ii) the cellular protein abundance.

Close inspection of even relatively simple biological regulatory circuitry reveals multiple levels of control of the contributing protein interactions. The fundamental probability that an interaction will occur under a given set of conditions is difficult to predict because the relationship between structure and energy is not known. Layered on this basic difficulty are allosteric control mechanisms involving post-translational modification or small ligand binding. In addition, many biological processes involve multiple protein-protein interactions, some of which may be cooperative or even competitive. Finally, although the emphasis in predicting protein interactions is based on equilibrium thermodynamic principles, kinetics can be a major controlling feature in these systems. This complexity reinforces the necessity of performing detailed quantitative studies of the component interactions of complex biological regulatory systems. Results of such studies will help us to bridge the gap between our knowledge of structure and our understanding of functional biology.",

Therefore, developing computational techniques for predicting protein-protein interactions would be of significant value in this regard. By fusing the approach based on the gene ontology and the approach of pseudo-amino acid composition, a predictor called \"GO-PseAA\" predictor was established to deal with this problem. As a showcase, prediction was performed on 6323 protein pairs from yeast. To avoid redundancy and homology bias, none of the protein pairs investigated has > or = 40% sequence identity with any other. The overall success rate obtained by jackknife cross-validation was 81.6%, indicating the GO-PseAA predictor is very promising for predicting protein-protein interactions from protein sequences, and might become a useful vehicle for studying the network biology in the postgenomic era.",

Progress was mainly driven by the human genome project and associated with the development of several new technologies, leading to the birth of additional \"omic'' topics such as proteomics, glycomics, or antibodyomics. In this review we focus strictly on peptide arrays applied to investigate protein-protein interactions, starting from single events up to complete interaction networks (interactomes). The specificities and interaction networks of protein interaction domains (PIDs) are our central theme. Picking practical examples from the literature, we review some general concepts about peptide arrays on planar supports for mapping protein-protein interactions.",

From a fundamental point of view, the development of an understanding of the signaling events triggered by the interaction of two or more proteins provides key information to elucidate the functioning of many cell processes. From a practical point of view, understanding protein-protein interactions at a quantitative level provides the foundation for the development of antagonists or agonists of those interactions. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) is the only technique with the capability of measuring not only binding affinity but the enthalpic and entropic components that define affinity. Over the years, isothermal titration calorimeters have evolved in sensitivity and accuracy. Today, TA Instruments and MicroCal market instruments with the performance required to evaluate protein-protein interactions. In this methods paper, we describe general procedures to analyze heterodimeric (porcine pancreatic trypsin binding to soybean trypsin inhibitor) and homodimeric (bovine pancreatic \u03b1-chymotrypsin) protein associations by ITC.",

Understanding how and why proteins interact will inevitably lead to novel structure-based drug design methods, as well as design of de novo binders with preferred interaction properties. At a structural and molecular level, interface and rim regions are not enough to fully account for the energetics of protein-protein binding, even for simple lock-and-key rigid binders. As we have recently shown, properties of the global surface might also play a role in protein-protein interactions. Here, we report on molecular dynamics simulations performed to understand solvent effects on protein-protein surfaces. We compare properties of the interface, rim, and non-interacting surface regions for five different complexes and their free components. Interface and rim residues become, as expected, less mobile upon complexation. However, non-interacting surface appears more flexible in the complex. Fluctuations of polar residues are always lower compared with charged ones, independent of the protein state. Further, stable water molecules are often observed around polar residues, in contrast to charged ones. Our analysis reveals that (a) upon complexation, the non-interacting surface can have a direct entropic compensation for the lower interface and rim entropy and (b) the mobility of the first hydration layer, which is linked to the stability of the protein-protein complex, is influenced by the local chemical properties of the surface. These findings corroborate previous hypotheses on the role of the hydration layer in shielding protein-protein complexes from unintended protein-protein interactions.",

High-throughput technologies provide some data about these interactions, but so far that data is fairly noisy. Therefore, computational techniques for predicting protein-protein interactions could be of significant value. One approach to predicting interactions in silico is to produce from first principles a detailed model of a candidate interaction. We take an alternative approach, employing a relatively simple model that learns dynamically from a large collection of data. In this work, we describe an attraction-repulsion model, in which the interaction between a pair of proteins is represented as the sum of attractive and repulsive forces associated with small, domain- or motif-sized features along the length of each protein. The model is discriminative, learning simultaneously from known interactions and from pairs of proteins that are known (or suspected) not to interact. The model is efficient to compute and scales well to very large collections of data. In a cross-validated comparison using known yeast interactions, the attraction-repulsion method performs better than several competing techniques.",

Even though we specifically describe the capture of HA-tagged scFv antibody fragments to an anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody-immobilised surface prior to kinetic analysis, the same methodologies are universally applicable and can be used for practically any affinity pair and most Biacore systems.",

At the same levels of accuracy, our method recovered more experimentally observed physical interactions than a conventional correlation-based approach. Pairs predicted by our method to very likely interact were close in the overall network of interaction, suggesting our method as an aid for functional annotation. We applied the method to predict interactions in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).

The remarkable impact of two-hybrid assay platforms derives from their speed, simplicity, and broad applicability. Yet for many organisms, the need to express test proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Escherichia coli presents a substantial barrier because variations in codon specificity or bias may result in aberrant protein expression. In particular, nonstandard genetic codes are characteristic of several eukaryotic pathogens, for which there are currently no genetically based systems for detection of protein-protein interactions. We have developed a protein-protein interaction assay that is carried out in native host cells by using GFP as the only foreign protein moiety, thus circumventing these problems. We show that interaction can be detected between two protein pairs in both the model yeast S. cerevisiae and the fungal pathogen Candida albicans.

Revealing multi-domain cooperation can provide deep insights into the essential mechanism of protein-protein interactions at the domain level and be further exploited to improve the accuracy of protein interaction prediction. Results: In this paper, we aim to identify cooperative domains for protein interactions by extending two-domain interactions to multi-domain interactions. Based on the high-throughput experimental data from multiple organisms with different reliabilities, the interactions of domains were inferred by a Linear Programming algorithm with Multi-domain pairs (LPM) and an Association Probabilistic Method with Multi-domain pairs (APMM). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only can find cooperative domains effectively but also has a higher accuracy for predicting protein interaction than the existing methods. Cooperative domains, including strongly cooperative domains and superdomains, were detected from major interaction databases MIPS and DIP, and many of them were verified by physical interactions from the crystal structures of protein complexes in PDB which provide intuitive evidences for such cooperation. Comparison experiments in terms of protein/domain interaction prediction justified the benefit of considering multi-domain cooperation. Conclusion: From the computational viewpoint, this paper gives a general framework to predict protein interactions in a more accurate manner by considering the information of both multi-domains and multiple organisms, which can also be applied to identify cooperative domains, to reconstruct large complexes and further to annotate functions of domains.

The proteins utilized were beta-2-microglobulin, cystatin C (cysC), retinol binding protein (RBP), transthyretin (TTR), alpha-1-microglobulin, C-reactive protein, transferrin and papain. The immobilization of functionally active proteins was confirmed via interactions with antibodies to the corresponding proteins. Various dilutions of human urine and plasma were injected over the protein-derivatized surfaces. It was observed that the urine injections generally yielded smaller SPR responses than those observed after the plasma injections. The BIA/MS experiments did not reveal novel protein-protein interactions, although several established interactions (such as those between RBP and TTR, and cysC and papain) were validated. Few protein ligand deficiencies (such as truncations) leading to false negative and false positive BIA/MS results were also discovered.",

        "abstract": "Protein complexes are fundamental for understanding principles of cellular organizations. As the sizes of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are increasing, accurate and fast protein complex prediction from these PPI networks can serve as a guide for biological experiments to discover novel protein complexes. However, it is not easy to predict protein complexes from PPI networks, especially in situations where the PPI network is noisy and still incomplete. Here, we study the use of indirect interactions between level-2 neighbors (level-2 interactions) for protein complex prediction. We know from previous work that proteins which do not interact but share interaction partners (level-2 neighbors) often share biological functions. We have proposed a method in which all direct and indirect interactions are first weighted using topological weight (FS-Weight), which estimates the strength of functional association. Interactions with low weight are removed from the network, while level-2 interactions with high weight are introduced into the interaction network. Existing clustering algorithms can then be applied to this modified network. We have also proposed a novel algorithm that searches for cliques in the modified network, and merge cliques to form clusters using a \"partial clique merging\" method. Experiments show that (1) the use of indirect interactions and topological weight to augment protein-protein interactions can be used to improve the precision of clusters predicted by various existing clustering algorithms; and (2) our complex-finding algorithm performs very well on interaction networks modified in this way. Since no other information except the original PPI network is used, our approach would be very useful for protein complex prediction, especially for prediction of novel protein complexes.",

Today, the identification of proteins that interact with a protein of interest is a focus of intensive research and is an essential element of the rapidly growing field of proteomics. Yeast two-hybrid assays represent a versatile tool to study protein interactions in vivo. GAL4-based assay, for example, uses yeast transcription factor GAL4 for detection of protein interactions by transcriptional activation. Some transcription factors (such as GAL4) possess a characteristic phenomenon that the transactivation function can be restored when the factor's DNA-binding domain (DBD) and its transcription-activation domain (AD) are brought together by two interacting, heterologous proteins. GAL4-yeast two-hybrid assay uses two expression vectors, one uses GAL4-DBD and the other uses GAL4-AD. DNA sequences encoding the two proteins of interest (or a protein and a complementary DNA library) can be cloned in the GAL4-DBD and GAL4-AD vectors to form the bait and the target of the interaction trap, respectively. A selection of host cells with different reporter genes and different growth selection markers provides a means to detect and confirm protein-protein interactions and highlight the flexibility of these assays to fit different applications. This chapter presents an outline for the GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid system with a detailed description of the vectors, host cells, and methods for detection and verifying protein interactions.",

A substantial number of macromolecular structures, however, have not been examined with atomic detail due to sample size and heterogeneity, or resolution limitations of the technique; therefore, the general applicability of each method is greatly reduced. Synchrotron footprinting attempts to bridge the gap in these methods by monitoring changes in accessible surface areas of discrete macromolecular moieties. As evidenced by our previous studies on RNA folding and DNA-protein interactions, the three-dimensional structure is probed by examining the reactions of these moieties with hydroxyl radicals generated by synchrotron X-rays. Here we report the application of synchrotron footprinting to the investigation of protein- protein interactions, as the novel technique has been utilized to successfully map the contact sites of gelsolin segment-1 in the gelsolin segment 1/actin complex. Footprinting results demonstrate that phenylalanine 104, located on the actin binding helix of gelsolin segment 1, is protected from hydroxyl radical modification in the presence of actin. This change in reactivity results from the specific protection of gelsolin segment-1, consistent with the substantial decrease in solvent accessibility of F104 upon actin binding, as calculated from the crystal structural of the gelsolin segment 1/actin complex. The results presented here establish synchrotron footprinting as a broadly applicable method to probe structural features of macromolecular complexes that are not amenable to conventional approaches.",

The development of high-throughput experimental technologies such as the yeast two-hybrid screening has produced an explosion in data relating to interactions. Since manual curation is intensive in terms of time and cost, there is an urgent need for text-mining tools to facilitate the extraction of such information. The BioCreative (Critical Assessment of Information Extraction systems in Biology) challenge evaluation provided common standards and shared evaluation criteria to enable comparisons among different approaches. RESULTS: During the benchmark evaluation of BioCreative 2006, all of our results ranked in the top three places. In the task of filtering articles irrelevant to physical protein interactions, our method contributes a precision of 75.07%, a recall of 81.07%, and an AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.847. In the task of identifying protein mentions and normalizing mentions to molecule identifiers, our method is competitive among runs submitted, with a precision of 34.83%, a recall of 24.10%, and an F1 score of 28.5%. In extracting protein interaction pairs, our profile-based method was competitive on the SwissProt-only subset (precision = 36.95%, recall = 32.68%, and F1 score = 30.40%) and on the entire dataset (30.96%, 29.35%, and 26.20%, respectively). From the biologist's point of view, however, these findings are far from satisfactory. The error analysis presented in this report provides insight into how performance could be improved: three-quarters of false negatives were due to protein normalization problems (532/698), and about one-quarter were due to problems with correctly extracting interactions for this system. CONCLUSION: We present a text-mining framework to extract physical protein-protein interactions from the literature. Three key issues are addressed, namely filtering irrelevant articles, identifying protein names and normalizing them to molecule identifiers, and extracting protein-protein interactions. Our system is among the top three performers in the benchmark evaluation of BioCreative 2006. The tool will be helpful for manual interaction curation and can greatly facilitate the process of extracting protein-protein interactions.",

        "abstract": "For most biophysical techniques, characterization of protein-protein interactions is challenging; this is especially true with methods that rely on a physical phenomenon that is common to both of the interacting proteins. Thus, for example, in IR spectroscopy, the carbonyl vibration (1600-1700 cm(-1)) associated with the amide bonds from both of the interacting proteins will overlap extensively, making the interpretation of spectral changes very complicated. Isotope-edited infrared spectroscopy, where one of the interacting proteins is uniformly labelled with (13)C or (13)C,(15)N has been introduced as a solution to this problem, enabling the study of protein-protein interactions using IR spectroscopy. The large shift of the amide I band (approx. 45 cm(-1) towards lower frequency) upon (13)C labelling of one of the proteins reveals the amide I band of the unlabelled protein, enabling it to be used as a probe for monitoring conformational changes. With site-specific isotopic labelling, structural resolution at the level of individual amino acid residues can be achieved. Furthermore, the ability to record IR spectra of proteins in diverse environments means that isotope-edited IR spectroscopy can be used to structurally characterize difficult systems such as protein-protein complexes bound to membranes or large insoluble peptide/protein aggregates. In the present article, examples of application of isotope-edited IR spectroscopy for studying protein-protein interactions are provided.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-throughput methods identify an overwhelming number of protein-protein interactions. However, the limited accuracy of these methods results in the false identification of many spurious interactions. Accordingly, the resulting interactions are regarded as hypothetical and computational methods are needed to increase their confidence. Several methods have recently been suggested for this purpose including co-expression as a confidence measure for interacting proteins, but their performance is still quite poor. RESULTS: We introduce a novel computational method for verification of protein-protein interactions based on the co-expression of orthologs of interacting partners. The performance of our method is analysed using known S. cerevisiae interactions, and is shown to overcome limitations of previous methods. We present specific examples of known and putative interactions that are detected by our method and not by previous methods, and suggest that they represent transient interactions that might have been conserved and stabilized in other species. CONCLUSION: Co-expression of orthologous protein-pairs can be used to increase the confidence of hypothetical protein-protein interactions in S. cerevisiae as well as in other species. This approach may be especially useful for species with no available expression profiles and for transient interactions.",

In contrast to western blotting, which uses specific antibodies to detect target proteins, far-western blotting detects proteins on the basis of the presence or the absence of binding sites for the protein probe. When specific modular protein binding domains are used as probes, this approach allows characterization of protein-protein interactions involved in biological processes such as signal transduction, including interactions regulated by posttranslational modification.

        "abstract": "Extracellular matrix proteins control the formation of the inorganic component of hard tissues including bone, dentin, and enamel. The structural proteins expressed primarily in the enamel matrix are amelogenin, ameloblastin, enamelin, and amelotin. Other proteins, like biglycan, are also present in the enamel matrix as well as in other mineralizing and nonmineralizing tissues of mammals. In addition, the presence of sulfated enamel proteins, and \"tuft\" proteins has been examined and discussed in relation to enamel formation. The structural proteins of the enamel matrix must have specific protein-protein interactions to produce a matrix capable of directing the highly ordered structure of the enamel crystallites. Protein-protein interactions are also likely to occur between the secreted enamel proteins and the plasma membrane of the enamel producing cells, the ameloblasts. Such protein-protein interactions are hypothesized to influence the secretion of enamel proteins, establish short-term order of the forming matrix, and to mediate feedback signals to the transcriptional machinery of these cells. Membrane-bound proteins identified in ameloblasts, and which interact with the structural enamel proteins, include Cd63 (cluster of differentiation 63 antigen), annexin A2 (Anxa2), and lysosomal-associated glycoprotein 1 (Lamp1). These and related data help explain the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the removal of the organic enamel matrix during the events of enamel mineralization, and how the enamel matrix influences its own fate through signaling initiated at the cell surface. The knowledge gained from enamel developmental studies may lead to better dental and nondental materials, or materials inspired by Nature. These data will be critical to scientists, engineers, and dentists in their pursuits to regenerate an entire tooth. For tooth regeneration to become a reality, the protein-protein interactions involving the key dental proteins must be identified and understood. The scope of this review is to discuss the current understanding of protein-protein interactions of the developing enamel matrix, and relate this knowledge to enamel biomineralization",

As these interactions are of a critical nature in many important cellular functions and their dysregulation is causal of disease, the modulation of these binding events has emerged as a leading, yet difficult therapeutic arena. In particular, the targeting of protein-protein interactions relevant to cancer is of fundamental importance as the tumor-promoting function of several aberrantly expressed proteins in the cancerous state is directly resultant of its ability to interact with a protein-binding partner. Of significance, these protein complexes play a crucial role in each of the steps of the central dogma of molecular biology, the fundamental processes of genetic transmission. With the many important discoveries being made regarding the mechanisms of these genetic process, the identification of new chemical probes are needed to better understand and validate the druggability of protein-protein interactions related to the central dogma. In this review, we provide an overview of current small molecule-based protein-protein interaction inhibitors for each stage of the central dogma: transcription, mRNA splicing and translation. Importantly, through our analysis we have uncovered a lack of necessary probes targeting mRNA splicing and translation, thus, opening up the possibility for expansion of these fields.",

High output NO generation by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) participates in host defense against pathogens and contributes to tissue injury during inflammatory states. Because of its potent reactivity and diffusibility, NO generation by iNOS is subject to multiple levels of regulation, including transcriptional, translational, and post-translational controls, including protein-protein interactions. This review examines the experimental basis for these protein-protein interactions and their known and potential importance for kidney and vascular physiology.\\n\\nMETHODS: Analysis of the biomedical literature in the area.\\n\\nRESULTS: iNOS interacts with the inhibitory molecules Kalirin and NOS-associated protein 1.10 kd (NAP110), which inhibit iNOS homodimerization, as well as activator proteins, the Rac-GTPases.

In the case of protein-protein interactions, an interaction can be inferred between two proteins on the basis that sequence-similar proteins have been observed to interact. The use of transferred interactions is common, but the legitimacy of such inferred interactions is not clear. Here we investigate transferred interactions and whether data incompleteness explains the lack of evidence found for them. Using definitions of homology associated with functional annotation transfer, we estimate that conservation rates of interactions are low even after taking interactome incompleteness into account. For example, at a blastp E-value threshold of 10(-70), we estimate the conservation rate to be about 11 % between S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens. Our method also produces estimates of interactome sizes (which are similar to those previously proposed). Using our estimates of interaction conservation we estimate the rate at which protein-protein interactions are lost across species. To our knowledge, this is the first such study based on large-scale data. Previous work has suggested that interactions transferred within species are more reliable than interactions transferred across species. By controlling for factors that are specific to within-species interaction prediction, we propose that the transfer of interactions within species might be less reliable than transfers between species. Protein-protein interactions appear to be very rarely conserved unless very high sequence similarity is observed. Consequently, inferred interactions should be used with care.",

Experimental methods have been developed to survey the proteome for interacting partners and some computational approaches have been developed to extend the impact of these experimental methods. Computational methods are routinely applied to newly discovered genes to infer protein function and plausible protein-protein interactions. Here, we develop and extend a quantitative method that identifies interacting proteins based upon the correlated behavior of the evolutionary histories of protein ligands and their receptors. We have studied six families of ligand-receptor pairs including: the syntaxin/Unc-18 family, the GPCR/G-?????s, the TGF-??/TGF-?? receptor system, the immunity/colicin domain collection from bacteria, the chemokine/chemokine receptors, and the VEGF/VEGF receptor family. For correlation scores above a defined threshold, we were able to find an average of 79% of all known binding partners. We then applied this method to find plausible binding partners for proteins with uncharacterized binding specificities in the syntaxin/Unc-18 protein and TGF-??/TGF-?? receptor families. Analysis of the results shows that co-evolutionary analysis of interacting protein families can reduce the search space for identifying binding partners by not only finding binding partners for uncharacterized proteins but also recognizing potentially new binding partners for previously characterized proteins. We believe that correlated evolutionary histories provide a route to exploit the wealth of whole genome sequences and recent systematic proteomic results to extend the impact of these studies and focus experimental efforts to categorize physiologically or pathologically relevant protein-protein interactions. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here, we present a regulatory mechanism in protein-protein interactions mediated by finely tuned structural instability and coupled with molecular mimicry. We show that a set of type III secretion (TTS) autoinhibited homodimeric chaperones adopt a molten globule-like state that transiently exposes the substrate binding site as a means to become rapidly poised for binding to their cognate protein substrates. Packing defects at the homodimeric interface stimulate binding, whereas correction of these defects results in less labile chaperones that give rise to nonfunctional biological systems. The protein substrates use structural mimicry to offset the weak spots in the chaperones and to counteract their autoinhibitory conformation. This regulatory mechanism of protein activity is evolutionarily conserved among several TSS systems and presents a lucid example of functional advantage conferred upon a biological system by finely tuned structural instability. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

Applications of the dynamic property to protein function researches have been discussed and encouraging progresses have been achieved, for example, in enzyme activity and protein-protein docking studies. However, how the global dynamic property contributes to protein-protein interaction was still unclear. We have studied the dynamic property in protein-protein interactions based on Gaussian Network Model and applied it to classify biological and nonbiological protein-protein complexes in crystal structures. The global motion correlation between residues from the two protomers was found to be remarkably different for biological and nonbiological complexes. This correlation has been used to discriminate biological and nonbiological complexes in crystal and gave a classification rate of 86.9% in the cross-validation test. The innovation of this feature is that it is a global dynamic property which does not rely directly on the interfacial properties of the complex. In addition, the correlation of the global motions was found to be weakly correlated with the dissociation rate constant of protein complexes. We suggest that the dynamic property is a key determinant for protein-protein interaction, which can be used to discriminate native and crystal complexes and potentially be applied in protein-protein dynamic rate constants estimations.",

As shown by numerical simulations, the ionic current through the conical-shaped nanopipette is very sensitive to the surface charge variation near the pore mouth. With the appropriate modification of negatively charged human neuroglobin (hNgb) onto the inner surface of a nanopipette, we were able to detect concentration-dependent current change when the hNgb-modified nanopipette tip was exposed to positively charged cytochrome c (Cyt c) with a series of concentrations in the bath solution. Such current change is due to the adsorption of Cyt c to the inner surface of the nanopipette through specific interactions with hNgb. In contrast, a smaller current change with weak concentration dependence was observed when Cyt c was replaced with lysozyme, which does not specifically bind to hNgb. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the Cyt c-hNgb complex formation was derived and the value matched very well with the result from surface plasmon resonance measurement. This is the first quantitative study of protein-protein interactions by a conical-shaped nanopore based on charge sensing. Our results demonstrate that nanopipettes can potentially be used as a label-free analytical tool to quantitatively characterize protein-protein interactions.",

The proteins involved in this signalling pathway have been extensively studied on a molecular level in various model organisms, including enterobacteria and Bacillus subtilis, and specific protein-protein interactions have been identified. The chemotaxis operon of spirochaetes encodes a novel chemotaxis protein, CheX, in addition to homologues to the central components of established chemotaxis systems. Interestingly, the closest functionally characterized homologue of CheX is CheC of the complex B. subtilis chemotaxis pathway. In this study, the yeast two-hybrid system was applied to investigate protein-protein interactions within the chemotaxis signalling pathway of Treponema denticola, with special focus on CheX. CheX was found to interact with CheA and with itself. The other chemotaxis proteins exhibited interactions comparable to their homologues in known chemotaxis systems. Based on these findings, a model integrating CheX in the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of T. denticola is proposed.",

Most interfaces would be classed as 'undruggable' by conventional analyses, as they tend to be large, flat and featureless. Over the past decade, encouragement has come from the discovery of hotspots that contribute much of the free energy of interaction, and this has led to the development of tethering methods that target small molecules to these sites, often inducing adaptive changes. Equally important has been the recognition that many protein-protein interactions involve a continuous epitope of one partner and a well-defined groove or series of specific small pockets. These observations have stimulated the development of stapled \u03b1-helical peptides and other proteomimetic approaches. They have also led to the realisation that fragments might gain low-affinity 'footholds' on some protein-protein interfaces, and that these fragments might be elaborated to useful modulators of the interactions.",

The vast majority of host-pathogen interactions involve protein-protein recognition, yet our current understanding of these interactions is limited. Here, we present and apply a computational whole-genome protocol that generates testable predictions of host-pathogen protein interactions. The protocol first scans the host and pathogen genomes for proteins with similarity to known protein complexes, then assesses these putative interactions, using structure if available, and, finally, filters the remaining interactions using biological context, such as the stage-specific expression of pathogen proteins and tissue expression of host proteins. The technique was applied to 10 pathogens, including species of Mycobacterium, apicomplexa, and kinetoplastida, responsible for \"neglected\" human diseases. The method was assessed by (1) comparison to a set of known host-pathogen interactions, (2) comparison to gene expression and essentiality data describing host and pathogen genes involved in infection, and (3) analysis of the functional properties of the human proteins predicted to interact with pathogen proteins, demonstrating an enrichment for functionally relevant host-pathogen interactions. We present several specific predictions that warrant experimental follow-up, including interactions from previously characterized mechanisms, such as cytoadhesion and protease inhibition, as well as suspected interactions in hypothesized networks, such as apoptotic pathways. Our computational method provides a means to mine whole-genome data and is complementary to experimental efforts in elucidating networks of host-pathogen protein interactions.",

These peptide recognition modules are critical for the assembly of multiprotein complexes. We have arrayed glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, with a focus on protein interaction domains, on to nitrocellulose-coated glass slides to generate a protein-domain chip. Arrayed protein-interacting modules included WW (a domain with two conserved tryptophans), SH3 (Src homology 3), SH2, 14.3.3, FHA (forkhead-associated), PDZ (a domain originally identified in PSD-95, DLG and ZO-1 proteins), PH (pleckstrin homology) and FF (a domain with two conserved phenylalanines) domains. Here we demonstrate, using peptides, that the arrayed domains retain their binding integrity. Furthermore, we show that the protein-domain chip can 'fish' proteins out of a total cell lysate; these domain-bound proteins can then be detected on the chip with a specific antibody, thus producing an interaction map for a cellular protein of interest. Using this approach we have confirmed the domain-binding profile of the signalling molecule Sam68 (Src-associated during mitosis 68), and have identified a new binding profile for the core small nuclear ribonucleoprotein SmB'. This protein-domain chip not only identifies potential binding partners for proteins, but also promises to recognize qualitative differences in protein ligands (caused by post-translational modification), thus getting at the heart of signal transduction pathways.",

To this end we take advantage of a recent genome sequence dataset of 39 Saccahromyces cerevisiae strains and the experimentally determined protein interaction network of the laboratory strain. We analyze the polymorphism in domain residues involved in interactions at various levels of resolution, depending on their likelihood to be interaction mediators. We find that domains involved in interactions are less polymorphic than other domains. Furthermore, as the likelihood of a residue to be involved in interaction increases, its polymorphism decreases.

In this study, oligomeric protein structures are viewed from a network perspective to obtain new insights into protein association. Structure graphs of proteins have been constructed from a non-redundant set of protein oligomer crystal structures by considering amino acid residues as nodes and the edges are based on the strength of the non-covalent interactions between the residues. The analysis of such networks has been carried out in terms of amino acid clusters and hubs (highly connected residues) with special emphasis to protein interfaces.\\n\\nRESULTS: A variety of interactions such as hydrogen bond, salt bridges, aromatic and hydrophobic interactions, which occur at the interfaces are identified in a consolidated manner as amino acid clusters at the interface, from this study. Moreover, the characterization of the highly connected hub-forming residues at the interfaces and their comparison with the hubs from the non-interface regions and the non-hubs in the interface regions show that there is a predominance of charged interactions at the interfaces. Further, strong and weak interfaces are identified on the basis of the interaction strength between amino acid residues and the sizes of the interface clusters, which also show that many protein interfaces are stronger than their monomeric protein cores. The interface strengths evaluated based on the interface clusters and hubs also correlate well with experimentally determined dissociation constants for known complexes. Finally, the interface hubs identified using the present method correlate very well with experimentally determined hotspots in the interfaces of protein complexes obtained from the Alanine Scanning Energetics database (ASEdb). A few predictions of interface hot spots have also been made based on the results obtained from this analysis, which await experimental verification.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The construction and analysis of oligomeric protein structure networks and their comparison with monomeric protein structure networks provide insights into protein association. Further, the interface hubs identified using the present method can be effective targets for interface de-stabilizing mutations. We believe this analysis will significantly enhance our knowledge of the principles behind protein association and also aid in protein design.",

Our method successfully identified specific disruption of the Hom3:Fpr1 interaction by the immunosuppressant FK506, illustrating the assay's capacity to identify chemical inhibitors of protein-protein interactions. Among the additional findings was specific cellular depletion of the Dst1:Rbp9 complex by the anthracycline drug doxorubicin, but not by the related drug idarubicin. The assay also revealed chemical-induced accumulation of several binary multidrug transporter complexes that largely paralleled increases in transcript levels. Further assessment of two such interactions (Tpo1:Pdr5 and Snq2:Pdr5) in the presence of 1,246 unique chemical compounds revealed a positive correlation between drug lipophilicity and the drug response in yeast.",

        "abstract": "Cell physiology is governed by an intricate mesh of physical and functional links among proteins, nucleic acids and other metabolites. The recent information flood coming from large-scale genomic and proteomic approaches allows us to foresee the possibility of compiling an exhaustive list of the molecules present within a cell, enriched with quantitative information on concentration and cellular localization. Moreover, several high-throughput experimental and computational techniques have been devised to map all the protein interactions occurring in a living cell. So far, such maps have been drawn as graphs where nodes represent proteins and edges represent interactions. However, this representation does not take into account the intrinsically modular nature of proteins and thus fails in providing an effective description of the determinants of binding. Since proteins are composed of domains that often confer on proteins their binding capabilities, a more informative description of the interaction network would detail, for each pair of interacting proteins in the network, which domains mediate the binding. Understanding how protein domains combine to mediate protein interactions would allow one to add important features to the protein interaction network, making it possible to discriminate between simultaneously occurring and mutually exclusive interactions. This objective can be achieved by experimentally characterizing domain recognition specificity or by analyzing the frequency of co-occurring domains in proteins that do interact. Such approaches allow gaining insights on the topology of complexes with unknown three-dimensional structure, thus opening the prospect of adopting a more rational strategy in developing drugs designed to selectively target specific protein interactions.",

        "abstract": "The inhibition of protein-protein interactions and their ensuing signaling processes play an increasingly important role in modern medicine. Small molecular-weight inhibitors that can be administered orally are the preferred approach but efficient strategies for developing them are not yet generally available. Due to the large size difference between the protein-protein interface and the small molecule, inhibitor interactions are expected to extend to only a small region of the interface. If this is the case, classical competitive inhibition may be hard to achieve. In addition, competitive inhibition wastes binding energy that can be effectively used to inhibit signaling. The best and most energy-efficient approach would be the development of small molecules that bind at the protein-protein interface and inhibit the signaling process without displacing the protein ligand. This approach seems feasible knowing that the binding energy is not evenly distributed within the binding interface but concentrated in discrete hotspots, and that the initiation of signaling may not overlap with those hotspots. We outline a general protein-protein inhibition model that extends from competitive to noncompetitive scenarios and apply it to the development of HIV-1 gp120-CD4 inhibitors. This rigorous model can be easily applied to the analysis of protein-protein inhibition data and used as a tool in the optimization of inhibitor molecules.",

The method was then used to measure the predicted weak interaction between two domains of the Escherichia coli l-arabinose operon regulatory protein AraC. The interaction between domains has the expected magnitude (Kd = 0.37??mM) in the absence of arabinose. Upon addition of arabinose, we detected a weaker and unexpected interaction, which may necessitate modification of the proposed mechanism of AraC.

To gain insight into the lipid-mediated interactions between two intrinsic membrane proteins, we developed a mesoscopic model of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins, which we studied with dissipative particle dynamics. Our calculations of the potential of mean force between transmembrane proteins show that hydrophobic forces drive long-range protein-protein interactions and that the nature of these interactions depends on the length of the protein hydrophobic segment, on the three-dimensional structure of the protein and on the properties of the lipid bilayer. To understand the nature of the computed potentials of mean force, the concept of hydrophilic shielding is introduced. The observed protein interactions are interpreted as resulting from the dynamic reorganization of the system to maintain an optimal hydrophilic shielding of the protein and lipid hydrophobic parts, within the constraint of the flexibility of the components. Our results could lead to a better understanding of several membrane processes in which protein interactions are involved.",

Domain-domain interactions have been recently used to predict protein-protein interactions (PPI). In general, the interaction probability of a pair of domains is scored using a trained scoring function. Satisfying a threshold, the protein pairs carrying those domains are regarded as \"interacting\". In this study, the signature contents of proteins were utilized to predict PPI pairs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Homo sapiens. Similarity between protein signature patterns was scored and PPI predictions were drawn based on the binary similarity scoring function. Results show that the true positive rate of prediction by the proposed approach is approximately 32% higher than that using the maximum likelihood estimation method when compared with a test set, resulting in 22% increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. When proteins containing one or two signatures were removed, the sensitivity of the predicted PPI pairs increased significantly. The predicted PPI pairs are on average 11 times more likely to interact than the random selection at a confidence level of 0.95, and on average 4 times better than those predicted by either phylogenetic profiling or gene expression profiling.",

        "abstract": "Experimental high-throughput studies of protein-protein interactions are beginning to provide enough data for comprehensive computational studies. Today, about ten large data sets, each with thousands of interacting pairs, coarsely sample the interactions in fly, human, worm, and yeast. Another about 55,000 pairs of interacting proteins have been identified by more careful, detailed biochemical experiments. Most interactions are experimentally observed in prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes; very few interactions are observed in higher eukaryotes such as mammals. It is commonly assumed that pathways in mammals can be inferred through homology to model organisms, e.g. the experimental observation that two yeast proteins interact is transferred to infer that the two corresponding proteins in human also interact. Two pairs for which the interaction is conserved are often described as interologs. The goal of this investigation was a large-scale comprehensive analysis of such inferences, i.e. of the evolutionary conservation of interologs. Here, we introduced a novel score for measuring the overlap between protein-protein interaction data sets. This measure appeared to reflect the overall quality of the data and was the basis for our two surprising results from our large-scale analysis. Firstly, homology-based inferences of physical protein-protein interactions appeared far less successful than expected. In fact, such inferences were accurate only for extremely high levels of sequence similarity. Secondly, and most surprisingly, the identification of interacting partners through sequence similarity was significantly more reliable for protein pairs within the same organism than for pairs between species. Our analysis underlined that the discrepancies between different datasets are large, even when using the same type of experiment on the same organism. This reality considerably constrains the power of homology-based transfer of interactions. In particular, the experimental probing of interactions in distant model organisms has to be undertaken with some caution. More comprehensive images of protein-protein networks will require the combination of many high-throughput methods, including in silico inferences and predictions. http://www.rostlab.org/results/2006/ppi_homology/",

The diverse transient signals transduced by Ca(2+) are mediated by intracellular -Ca(2+)-binding proteins. Calcium ions shuttle into and out of the cytosol, transported across membranes by channels, exchangers, and pumps that regulate flux across the ER, mitochondrial and plasma membranes. Calcium regulates both rapid events, such as cytoskeleton remodelling or release of vesicle contents, and slower ones, such as transcriptional changes. Moreover, sustained cytosolic calcium elevations can lead to unwanted cellular activation or apoptosis. Calmodulin represents the most significant of the Ca(2+)-binding proteins and is an essential regulator of intracellular processes in response to extracellular stimuli mediated by a rise in Ca(2+) ion concentration. To profile novel protein-protein interactions that calmodulin participates in, we probed a high-content recombinant human protein array with fluorophore-labelled calmodulin in the presence of Ca(2+). This protein array contains 37,200 redundant proteins, incorporating over 10,000 unique human proteins expressed from a human brain cDNA library. We describe the identification of a high affinity interaction between calmodulin and the single-pass transmembrane proteins STIM1 and STIM2 that localise to the ER.

However, forces involved in protein-protein interactions as well the forces keeping the three-dimensional structures of proteins intact are complicated, and proteins are easily unfolded by various factors with unpredictable results. Because of this and because of the generally high association strength between proteins, the correct adjustment of binding forces between an immobilized protein and the protein to be purified as well as the release of bound proteins in biologically active form from affinity complexes are the main problem.

Most of the existing domain-based methods, however, consider only single-domain pairs (one domain from one protein) and assume independence between domain-domain interactions. RESULTS: In this paper, we introduce a domain-based random forest of decision trees to infer protein interactions. Our proposed method is capable of exploring all possible domain interactions and making predictions based on all the protein domains. Experimental results on Saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset demonstrate that our approach can predict protein-protein interactions with higher sensitivity (79.78%) and specificity (64.38%) compared with that of the maximum likelihood approach. Furthermore, our model can be used to infer interactions not only for single-domain pairs but also for multiple domain pairs.",

Based on the assumption that the likelihood of two proteins to interact with each other is associated with their structural domain composition and functional role, we transformed the problem of predicting protein interactions to a classification problem. We developed a heuristic to generate training pairs and test pairs, and then designed a new feature space to represent the training data. In particular, we propose a new method to construct a negative data set such that the functional and structural properties of putative non-interacting proteins strongly resemble the properties of proteins known to interact. The support vector machine algorithm was used to perform the classification of interacting and non-interacting protein pairs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to search for optimal training parameters. The accuracy of the system to predict whether two yeast proteins interact in a 10-fold cross-validation experiment was 79%.",

        "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions have become attractive drug targets and recent studies suggest that these interfaces may be amenable to inhibition by small molecules. However, blocking specific interactions may not be the only way of manipulating the extensive network of interacting proteins. Recently, several approaches have emerged for promoting these interactions rather than inhibiting them. Typically, these strategies employ a bifunctional ligand to simultaneously bind two targets, forcing their juxtaposition. Chemically \"riveting\" specific protein contacts can reveal important aspects of regulation, such as the consequences of stable dimerization or the effects of prolonged dwell time. Moreover, in some cases, entirely new functions arise when two proteins, which normally do not interact, are brought into close proximity with one another. Together with inhibitors, bifunctional molecules are part of a growing toolbox of chemical probes that can be used to reversibly and selectively control the interact-ome. Using these reagents, new insights into the dynamics of protein-protein interactions and their importance in biology are beginning to emerge. Future hurdles in this area lie in the development of robust synthetic platforms for rapidly generating compounds to meet the challenges of diverse protein-protein interfaces.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although the prediction of protein-protein interactions has been extensively investigated for yeast, few such datasets exist for the far larger proteome in human. Furthermore, it has recently been estimated that the overall average false positive rate of available computational and high-throughput experimental interaction datasets is as high as 90%. RESULTS: The prediction of human protein-protein interactions was investigated by combining orthogonal protein features within a probabilistic framework. The features include co-expression, orthology to known interacting proteins and the full-Bayesian combination of subcellular localization, co-occurrence of domains and post-translational modifications. A novel scoring function for local network topology was also investigated. This topology feature greatly enhanced the predictions and together with the full-Bayes combined features, made the largest contribution to the predictions. Using a conservative threshold, our most accurate predictor identifies 37606 human interactions, 32892 (80%) of which are not present in other publicly available large human interaction datasets, thus substantially increasing the coverage of the human interaction map. A subset of the 32892 novel predicted interactions have been independently validated. Comparison of the prediction dataset to other available human interaction datasets estimates the false positive rate of the new method to be below 80% which is competitive with other methods. Since the new method scores and ranks all human protein pairs, smaller subsets of higher quality can be generated thus leading to even lower false positive prediction rates. CONCLUSION: The set of interactions predicted in this work increases the coverage of the human interaction map and will help determine the highest confidence human interactions.",

Because most proteins operate as parts of complexes to regulate biological processes, we systematically analyzed protein-protein interactions in Pyrococcus using the mammalian two-hybrid system to determine the function of the hypothetical proteins. RESULTS: We examined 960 soluble proteins from Pyrococcus and selected 107 interactions based on luciferase reporter activity, which was then evaluated using a computational approach to assess the reliability of the interactions. We also analyzed the expression of the assay samples by western blot, and a few interactions by in vitro pull-down assays. We identified 11 hetero-interactions that we considered to be located at the same operon, as observed in Helicobacter pylori. We annotated and classified proteins in the selected interactions according to their orthologous proteins. Many enzyme proteins showed self-interactions, similar to those seen in other organisms. CONCLUSION: We found 13 unannotated proteins that interacted with annotated proteins; this information is useful for predicting the functions of the hypothetical Pyrococcus proteins from the annotations of their interacting partners. Among the heterogeneous interactions, proteins were more likely to interact with proteins within the same ortholog class than with proteins of different classes. The analysis described here can provide global insights into the biological features of the protein-protein interactions in P. horikoshii.",

This method involves two protein fusions, a soluble reporter fusion and a fusion for immobilizing the target protein. The soluble reporter is an N-terminal Renilla luciferase fusion protein that exhibits high Renilla luciferase activity. Crude cleared lysates from transfected Cos1 cells that express the Renilla luciferase fusion protein can be used in binding assays with immobilized target proteins. Following incubation and washing, target-bound Renilla luciferase fusion proteins produce light from the coelenterazine substrate, indicating an interaction between the two proteins of interest. As proof of the principle, we reproduced known, transient protein-protein interactions between the Cdc42 GTPase and its effector proteins. GTPase Renilla fusion proteins produced in Cos1 cells were tested with immobilized recombinant GST-N-WASP and CEP5 effector proteins. Using this assay, we could detect specific interactions of Cdc42 with these effector proteins in approximately 50 min. The specificity of these interactions was demonstrated by showing that they were GTPase-specific and GTP-dependent and not seen with other unrelated target proteins. These results suggest that the LAPD method, which is both rapid and sensitive, may have research and practical applications.",

They are the result of specific interactions between protein interfaces and are maintained by the action of evolutionary pressure on the regions of the interacting proteins that contribute to binding. For the most part, selection restricts amino acid replacements, accounting for the conservation of binding interfaces. However, in some cases, change in one protein will be mitigated by compensatory change in its binding partner, maintaining function in the face of evolutionary change. There have been several attempts to use correlations in sequence evolution to predict interactions of proteins. Most commonly, these approaches use the entire sequence to identify correlations and so infer probable binding. However, other factors such as shared evolutionary history and similarities in the rates of evolution confound these whole-sequence-based approaches. Here, we discuss recent work on this topic and argue that both site-specific coevolutionary change and whole-sequence evolution contribute to evolutionary signals in sets of interacting proteins. We discuss the relative effects of both types of selection and how they might be identified. This permits an integrated view of protein-protein interactions, their evolution, and coevolution.",

The tweezers inhibit binding between the 14-3-3 protein and two partner proteins--a phosphorylated (C-Raf) protein and an unphosphorylated one (ExoS)--in a concentration-dependent manner. Protein crystallography shows that this effect arises from the binding of the tweezers to a single surface-exposed lysine (Lys214) of the 14-3-3 protein in the proximity of its central channel, which normally binds the partner proteins. A combination of structural analysis and computer simulations provides rules for the tweezers' binding preferences, thus allowing us to predict their influence on this type of protein-protein interactions.",

Interactions between parasite and host proteins are important in understanding the pathogenesis of this deadly form of malaria. It is, therefore, necessary to study available protein-protein interactions to identify lesser known interactions that could throw light on key events of cerebral malaria. METHODS: Sequestration, haemostasis dysfunction, systemic inflammation and neuronal damage are key processes of cerebral malaria. Key events were identified from literature as being crucial to these processes. An integrated interactome was created using available experimental and predicted datasets as well as from literature. Interactions from this interactome were filtered based on Gene Ontology and tissue-specific annotations, and further analysed for relevance to the key events. RESULTS: PfEMP1 presentation, platelet activation and astrocyte dysfunction were identified as the key events influencing the disease. 48896 host-parasite along with other host-parasite, host-host and parasite-parasite protein-protein interactions obtained from a disease-specific corpus were combined to form an integrated interactome. Filtering of the interactome resulted in five host-parasite PPI, six parasite-parasite and two host-host PPI. The analysis of these interactions revealed the potential significance of apolipoproteins and temperature/Hsp expression on efficient PfEMP1 presentation; role of MSP-1 in platelet activation; effect of parasite proteins in TGF-beta regulation and the role of albumin in astrocyte dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: This work links key host-parasite, parasite-parasite and host-host protein-protein interactions to key processes of cerebral malaria and generates hypotheses for disease pathogenesis based on a filtered interaction dataset. These hypotheses provide novel and significant insights to cerebral malaria",

The risk for development of gastric cancer or peptic ulcer disease is higher among humans infected with cag PAI-positive H. pylori strains than among those infected with cag PAI-negative strains. The cag PAI encodes a type IV secretion system that translocates CagA into gastric epithelial cells. To identify Cag proteins that are expressed by H. pylori during growth in vitro, we compared the proteomes of a wild-type H. pylori strain and an isogenic cag PAI deletion mutant using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) in multiple pH ranges. Seven Cag proteins were identified by this approach. We then used a yeast two-hybrid system to detect potential protein-protein interactions among 14 Cag proteins. One heterotypic interaction (CagY/7 with CagX/8) and two homotypic interactions (involving H. pylori VirB11/ATPase and Cag5) were similar to interactions previously reported to occur among homologous components of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens type IV secretion system. Other interactions involved Cag proteins that do not have known homologues in other bacterial species. Biochemical analysis confirmed selected interactions involving five of the proteins that were identified by 2D-DIGE. Protein-protein interactions among Cag proteins are likely to have an important role in the assembly of the H. pylori type IV secretion apparatus.",

        "abstract": "Protein-protein complexes that dissociate and associate readily, often depending on the physiological condition or environment, play an important role in many biological processes. In order to characterise these \"transient\" protein-protein interactions, two sets of complexes were collected and analysed. The first set consists of 16 experimentally validated \"weak\" transient homodimers, which are known to exist as monomers and dimers at physiological concentration, with dissociation constants in the micromolar range. A set of 23 functionally validated transient (i.e. intracellular signalling) heterodimers comprise the second set. This set includes complexes that are more stable, with nanomolar binding affinities, and require a molecular trigger to form and break the interaction. In comparison to more stable homodimeric complexes, the weak homodimers demonstrate smaller contact areas between protomers and the interfaces are more planar and polar on average. The physicochemical and geometrical properties of these weak homodimers more closely resemble those of non-obligate hetero-oligomeric complexes, whose components can exist either as monomers or as complexes in vivo. In contrast to the weak transient dimers, \"strong\" transient dimers often undergo large conformational changes upon association/dissociation and are characterised with larger, less planar and sometimes more hydrophobic interfaces. From sequence alignments we find that the interface residues of the weak transient homodimers are generally more conserved than surface residues, consistent with being constrained to maintain the protein-protein interaction during evolution. Protein families that include members with different oligomeric states or structures are identified, and found to exhibit a lower sequence conservation at the interface. The results are discussed in terms of the physiological function and evolution of protein-protein interactions. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Results: On the basis of short co-occurring polypeptide regions, we developed a tool called MP-PIPE capable of predicting a global human PPI network within 3 months. With a recall of 23% at a precision of 82.1%, we predicted 172,132 putative PPIs. We demonstrate the usefulness of these predictions through a range of experiments. Conclusions: The speed and accuracy associated with MP-PIPE can make this a potential tool to study individual human PPI networks (from genomic sequences alone) for personalized medicine.

Recently we developed an approach called IBIS (Inferred Biomolecular Interaction Server) to predict and annotate protein-protein binding sites and interaction partners, which is based on the assumption that the structural location and sequence patterns of protein-protein binding sites are conserved between close homologs. In this study first we confirmed high accuracy of our method and found that its accuracy depends critically on the usage of all available data on structures of homologous complexes, compared to the approaches where only a non-redundant set of complexes is employed. Second we showed that there exists a trade-off between specificity and sensitivity if we employ in the prediction only evolutionarily conserved binding site clusters or clusters supported by only one observation (singletons). Finally we addressed the question of identifying the biologically relevant interactions using the homology inference approach and demonstrated that a large majority of crystal packing interactions can be correctly identified and filtered by our algorithm. At the same time, about half of biological interfaces that are not present in the protein crystallographic asymmetric unit can be reconstructed by IBIS from homologous complexes without the prior knowledge of crystal parameters of the query protein.",

In the present paper, we report detailed investigation of the role of this protein family, and specifically the role of the COMM domain, in NF-\u03baB signalling through characterization of protein\u2013protein interactions involving COMMD proteins. The small ubiquitously expressed COMMD6 consists primarily of the COMM domain. Therefore COMMD1 and COMMD6 were analysed further as prototype members of the COMMD protein family. Using specific antisera, interaction between endogenous COMMD1 and COMMD6 is described. This interaction was verified by independent techniques, appeared to be direct and could be detected throughout the whole cell, in-cluding the nucleus. Both proteins inhibit TNF (tumour necrosis factor)-induced NF-\u03baB activation in a non-synergistic manner. Mutation of the amino acid residues Trp 24 and Pro 41 in the COMM domain of COMMD6 completely abolished the inhibitory effect of COMMD6 on TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation, but this was not accompanied by loss of interaction with COMMD1, COMMD6 or the NF-\u03baB subunit RelA. In contrast with COMMD1, COMMD6 does not bind to I\u03baB\u03b1 (inhibitory \u03baB\u03b1), indicating that both proteins inhibit NF-\u03baB in an overlapping, but not completely similar, manner. Taken together, these data support the significance of COMMD protein\u2013protein interactions and provide new mechanistic insight into the function of this protein family in NF-\u03baB signalling.",

        "abstract": "The detection of protein-protein interactions in vivo is of critical importance to our understanding of biological processes. The classic library approach has been to use the yeast two-hybrid screen, where an interaction between known bait and unknown prey proteins leads to restoration of transcription factor activity1. However, its use is limited by host organism and nuclear localization requirements, and a tendency to detect indirect interactions (false positives). Bacterial two-hybrid screens have eliminated localization requirements and simplified many technical aspects of the procedure2. An innovative approach has been the reassembly of protein fragments, which then directly report interactions. A suitable reporter protein is dissected at the genetic level, and the fragments are fused to bait and prey, which are then coexpressed in vivo. Bait and prey interaction brings the reporter fragments together, facilitating reassembly of the active reporter protein, giving a direct readout of the association. This method has been demonstrated for dihydrofolate reductase3, 4, ubiquitin5 and the green fluorescent protein6 (GFP) from Aequorea victoria. We recently described improvements to the original screen based on the reassembly of the GFP enhanced-stability mutant sg100 in Escherichia coli7. Our system, presented in the protocol that follows, consists of two plasmid vectors for the independent expression of fusions with N- and C-terminal fragments of GFP, and allows for simple visual detection of protein-protein interactions with a KD as weak as 1 mM.",

These techniques have been widely used to depict the interactome as we know it today but current models of interactomes do not contain stoichiometric or temporal information. In this chapter we describe size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with protein correlation profiling-stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (PCP-SILAC) to generate dynamic chromatographs for thousands of proteins (Kristensen et al. Nat Methods 9: 907-909, 2012). Using the precise co-elution of two proteins as evidence that they interact, it is possible to identify similar numbers of protein interactions without overexpression or creating fusion proteins as other high-throughput techniques require. In addition, triplex SILAC allows us to quantify protein stoichiometry and temporal changes to the interactome following perturbation. Finally, SEC-PCP-SILAC is very time efficient since it generates two orders of magnitude fewer samples for LC-MS analysis and avoids the tedious tagging and purification steps, making it possible for everyone with a single mass spectrometer to study the interactome.",

Functional reconstitution of TEV protease fragments can be monitored with 'proteolysis-only' reporters, which can be previously silent fluorescent and luminescent reporter proteins. Additionally, proteolytically cleavable inactive transcription factors can be combined with any downstream reporter gene of choice to yield 'transcription-coupled' reporter systems.

In the majority of cases, however, one of the interacting proteins was known to be involved in DNA replication, transcription, virion structure, or host evasion, thereby providing a clue to the role of the other uncharacterized protein in a specific process.",

        "abstract": "Heparin, a sulfated polysaccharide belonging to the family of glycosaminoglycans, has numerous important biological activities, associated with its interaction with diverse proteins. Heparin is widely used as an anticoagulant drug based on its ability to accelerate the rate at which antithrombin inhibits serine proteases in the blood coagulation cascade. Heparin and the structurally related heparan sulfate are complex linear polymers comprised of a mixture of chains of different length, having variable sequences. Heparan sulfate is ubiquitously distributed on the surfaces of animal cells and in the extracellular matrix. It also mediates various physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. Difficulties in evaluating the role of heparin and heparan sulfate in vivo may be partly ascribed to ignorance of the detailed structure and sequence of these polysaccharides. In addition, the understanding of carbohydrate-protein interactions has lagged behind that of the more thoroughly studied protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. The recent extensive studies on the structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic aspects of the protein binding of heparin and heparan sulfate have led to an improved understanding of heparin-protein interactions. A high degree of specificity could be identified in many of these interactions. An understanding of these interactions at the molecular level is of fundamental importance in the design of new highly specific therapeutic agents. This review focuses on aspects of heparin structure and conformation, which are important for its interactions with proteins. It also describes the interaction of heparin and heparan sulfate with selected families of heparin-binding proteins.",

In q-AP-MS the protein of interest is biochemically enriched together with its interaction partners. In parallel, a control experiment is performed to control for non-specific binding. Quantitative mass spectrometry is then employed to compare protein levels in both samples and to exclude non-specific contaminants. Here, we provide two detailed q-AP-MS protocols for pull-downs with immobilized bait proteins or transient transfection of tagged expression constructs. We discuss benefits and limitations of q-AP-MS and highlight critical parameters that need to be considered.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Is it possible to identify what the best solution of a docking program is? The usual answer to this question is the highest score solution, but interactions between proteins are dynamic processes, and many times the interaction regions are wide enough to permit protein-protein interactions with different orientations and/or interaction energies. In some cases, as in a multimeric protein complex, several interaction regions are possible among the monomers. These dynamic processes involve interactions with surface displacements between the proteins to finally achieve the functional configuration of the protein complex. Consequently, there is not a static and single solution for the interaction between proteins, but there are several important configurations that also have to be analyzed. RESULTS: To extract those representative solutions from the docking output datafile, we have developed an unsupervised and automatic clustering application, named DockAnalyse. This application is based on the already existing DBscan clustering method, which searches for continuities among the clusters generated by the docking output data representation. The DBscan clustering method is very robust and, moreover, solves some of the inconsistency problems of the classical clustering methods like, for example, the treatment of outliers and the dependence of the previously defined number of clusters. CONCLUSIONS: DockAnalyse makes the interpretation of the docking solutions through graphical and visual representations easier by guiding the user to find the representative solutions. We have applied our new approach to analyze several protein interactions and model the dynamic protein interaction behavior of a protein complex. DockAnalyse might also be used to describe interaction regions between proteins and, therefore, guide future flexible dockings. The application (implemented in the R package) is accessible.",

        "abstract": "Hemoglobin cross-linked as a bis(isophthalamide) of the epsilon-amino groups of lysine 82 of each beta-subunit binds and releases oxygen with a Hill coefficient indicative of cooperative oxygen binding (typically approximately 2.0). However, connecting two such cross-linked tetramers with a relatively short covalent linkage produces cross-linked bis-tetramers that bind oxygen with Hill coefficients near unity. To separate the effect of the linkages from the effects of protein-protein interactions in the conjoined proteins, reagents (1 and 2) were used to produce bis-tetramers (A and B). These have a considerably greater distance between cross-linked tetramers than earlier examples. Yet, the bis-tetramers (A and B) bind oxygen with minimal cooperativity (n(50) = 1.4, 1.2). To assess the effect of the linkage itself, cross-linked tetramers (Cand D) were prepared from reactions with the same reagents. These bind oxygen with cooperativity similar to that of cross-linked tetramers without the extended chain (C, n(50) = 2.0; D, n(50) = 1.8). Other tetramers (E and F) with flexible, saturated hydrocarbon appendages were also prepared. These also showed cooperativity in oxygen binding (E, n(50) = 1.7; F, n(50) = 1.8) despite their high degree of hydrophobicity. Thus, the intertetrameric linkages themselves do not induce the loss of cooperativity, leading to the conclusion that solution effects of the tetramers upon one another are the source of the decline in cooperativity: protein-protein interactions are most significant in disrupting the cooperativity of the bis-tetramers, regardless of the span or composition of the linker. This suggests that effects of oligomerization of hemoglobin within red cell substitutes should be considered in terms of such interactions.",

The functions of a large number of viral ORFs are poorly understood or unknown. In order to gain more insight into functions and modes of action and interaction of the different proteins, we cloned the viral ORFeome and performed a genome-wide analysis for intraviral protein interactions and for intracellular localization. 900 pairwise interactions were tested by yeast-two-hybrid matrix analysis, and more than 65 positive non-redundant interactions, including six self interactions, were identified. About 38% of interactions were subsequently confirmed by CoIP in mammalian cells. Nsp2, nsp8 and ORF9b showed a wide range of interactions with other viral proteins. Nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14, indicating a crucial role as a major player within the replication complex machinery. It was shown by others that nsp8 is essential for viral replication in vitro, whereas nsp2 is not. We show that also accessory protein ORF9b does not play a pivotal role for viral replication, as it can be deleted from the virus displaying normal plaque sizes and growth characteristics in Vero cells. However, it can be expected to be important for the virus-host interplay and for pathogenicity, due to its large number of interactions, by enhancing the global stability of the SARS proteome network, or play some unrealized role in regulating protein-protein interactions.

PICK1 is a 416 amino acid protein that contains a PDZ domain, a coiled-coil motif/arfaptin homology domain and an acidic c-terminal. Nearly all proteins thus far reported to interact with PICK1 do so via its single PDZ domain. PICK1 self-associates via its coiled-coil motif and together with its PDZ domain has potential to act as a scaffolding protein. This molecule was first identified as a protein interacting with Calpha-kinase (PICK1) and interacts with several members of the glutamate receptor family and receptor tyrosine kinases. The PDZ domain of PICK1 has since been shown to interact with a plethora of proteins including dopamine transporter, prolactin-releasing peptide receptor, ion channels BNaC1/ASIC and many more. The single PDZ domain of PICK1 interacts with a network of proteins that is pivotal in processes such as synaptic plasticity, development and neural guidance as well as many diseased states. The proteins that interact with PICK1 and the functional roles of its PDZ domain are discussed and illustrated are ways to regulate PDZ protein-protein interactions.",

We combined evolutionary analysis, structural modeling, and experimental testing to study determinants of GABA(C) receptor assembly and channel gating. We estimated the posterior probability of selection pressure at amino acid residue sites measured as omega-values and built a comparative structural model, which identified several polar residues under strong selection pressure at the subunit interfaces that may form intersubunit hydrogen bonds or salt bridges. At three selected sites (R111, T151, and E55), mutations disrupting intersubunit interactions had strong effects on receptor folding, assembly, and function. We next examined the role of a predicted intersubunit salt bridge for residue pair R158-D204. The mutant R158D, where the positively charged residue is replaced by a negatively charged aspartate, yielded a partially degraded receptor and lacked membrane surface expression. The membrane surface expression was rescued by the double mutant R158D-D204R, where positive and negative charges are switched, although the mutant receptor was inactive. The single mutants R158A, D204R, and D204A exhibited diminished activities and altered kinetic profiles with fast recovery kinetics, suggesting that R158-D204 salt bridge perhaps stabilizes the open state of the GABA(C) receptor. Our results emphasize the functional importance of highly conserved polar residues at the protein-protein interfaces in GABA(C) rho1 receptors and demonstrate how the integration of computational and experimental approaches can aid discovery of functionally important interactions.",

This is surprising, given that many protein interactions have high specificity that depends on detailed atomic recognition between physiochemically complementary surfaces. Are the reported high accuracies realistic? RESULTS We find that the reported accuracies of the predictions are significantly over-estimated, and strongly dependent on the structure of the training and testing datasets used. The choice of which protein pairs are deemed as non-interactions in the training data has a variable impact on the accuracy estimates, and the accuracies can be artificially inflated by a bias towards dominant samples in the positive data which result from the presence of hub proteins in the protein interaction network. To address this bias, we propose a positive set-specific method to create a 'balanced' negative set maintaining the degree distribution for each protein, leading to the conclusion that simple sequence-based features contain insufficient information to be useful for predicting PPIs, but that protein domain-based features have some predictive value.

While experimental methods for identifying these interactions remain costly and often noisy, the increasing quantity of solved 3D protein structures suggests that in silico methods to predict interactions between two protein structures will play an increasingly important role in screening candidate interacting pairs. Approaches using the knowledge of the structure are presumably more accurate than those based on sequence only. Approaches based on docking protein structures solve a variant of this problem, but these methods remain very computationally intensive and will not scale in the near future to the detection of interactions at the level of an interactome, involving millions of candidate pairs of proteins. RESULTS: Here, we describe a computational method to predict efficiently in silico whether two protein structures interact. This yes/no question is presumably easier to answer than the standard protein docking question, \"How do these two protein structures interact?\" Our approach is to discriminate between interacting and non-interacting protein pairs using a statistical pattern recognition method known as a support vector machine (SVM). We demonstrate that our structure-based method performs well on this task and scales well to the size of an interactome. CONCLUSIONS: The use of structure information for the prediction of protein interaction yields significantly better performance than other sequence-based methods. Among structure-based classifiers, the SVM algorithm, combined with the metric learning pairwise kernel and the MAMMOTH kernel, performs best in our experiments.",

Recent findings, however, demonstrate a significant amount of structural disorder or polymorphism in protein complexes, a phenomenon that has been largely overlooked thus far. It is our view that such disorder can be classified into four mechanistic categories, covering a continuous spectrum of structural states from static to dynamic disorder and from segmental to full disorder. To emphasize its generality and importance, we suggest a generic term, 'fuzziness', for this phenomenon. Given the crucial role of protein disorder in protein-protein interactions and in regulatory processes, we envision that fuzziness will become integral to understanding the interactome. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A recently proposed framework for binary interactome mapping recommends the repeated screening approach to improve the quality of PPI data. Such repeated screening reveals Y2H interactions ranging from highly sampled to singleton interactions. The quality and the biological significance of interactions from distinguished sampling classes remain unknown. In order to systematically characterize such interactions, we have chosen a dataset of 1,262 interactions that were screened repeatedly four-times. The interactions were classified as highly sampled, weakly sampled, and singleton interactions. We assessed the quality of interactions in different sampling classes using features such as protein structural properties, conservation in yeast and presence of known domain-domain interactions that are previously associated with false positive rates. Our analysis reveals that the quality of singleton interactions is comparable to that of highly sampled interactions. Interestingly, singletons encompass a higher fraction of known domain-domain interactions than highly sampled ones. Furthermore, we observed that the singleton interactions are transient in nature, while the highly sampled interactions are predominantly part of stable complexes. Hence, the repeated Y2H screening method is ideal for detecting transient PPIs that are crucial in cellular signaling pathways. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2009.",

We are testing a stepwise, generic, structure-driven approach for finding low molecular weight inhibitors of protein-protein interactions. The approach requires development of a high-affinity, single chain antibody directed specifically against the interaction surface of one of the proteins to obtain structural information on the interface. To this end, we developed a single chain antibody (sc1E3) against hIL-1beta that exhibited the equivalent affinity of the soluble IL-1 receptor type I (sIL-1R) for hIL-1beta and competitively blocked the sIL-1R from binding to the cytokine. The antibody proved to be more specific for hIL-1beta than the sIL-1R in that it failed to bind to either murine IL-1beta or human/murine IL-1alpha proteins. Additionally, failure of sc1E3 to bind to several hIL-1beta mutant proteins, altered at receptor site B, indicated that the antibody interacted preferentially with this site. This, coupled with other surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements, shows that sc1E3 can achieve comparable affinity of binding hIL-1beta as the receptor through interactions at a smaller interface. This stable single chain antibody based heterodimer has simplified the complexity of the IL-1/IL-1R PPI system and will facilitate the design of the low molecular weight inhibitors of this interaction.",

Potential cosolute-induced alterations in target association are particularly important for a signaling molecule like calmodulin (CaM), where competition among >300 targets governs which pathways are selectively activated. To explore how high concentrations of cosolutes influence CaM-target affinity and kinetics, we methodically investigated each step of the CaM-target binding mechanism under crowded or osmolyte-rich environments mimicked by ficoll-70, dextran-10, and sucrose. All cosolutes stabilized compact conformers of CaM and modulated association kinetics by affecting diffusion and rates of conformational change; however, the results showed that differently sized molecules had variable effects to enhance or impede unique steps of the association pathway. On- and off-rates were modulated by all cosolutes in a compensatory fashion, producing little change in steady-state affinity. From this work insights were gained on how high concentrations of inert crowding agents and osmolytes fit into a kinetic framework to describe protein-protein interactions relevant for cellular signaling.",

Identifying the PPI network of a given organism (interactome) is useful to shed light on the key molecular mechanisms within a biological system. In this work, we show the role of structural features (loops and domains) to comprehend the molecular mechanisms of PPIs. A paradox in protein-protein binding is to explain how the unbound proteins of a binary complex recognize each other among a large population within a cell and how they find their best docking interface in a short timescale. We use interacting and non-interacting protein pairs to classify the structural features that sustain the binding (or non-binding) behavior. Our study indicates that not only the interacting region but also the rest of the protein surface are important for the interaction fate. The interpretation of this classification suggests that the balance between favoring and disfavoring structural features determines if a pair of proteins interacts or not. Our results are in agreement with previous works and support the funnel-like intermolecular energy landscape theory that explains PPIs. We have used these features to score the likelihood of the interaction between two proteins and to develop a method for the prediction of PPIs. We have tested our method on several sets with unbalanced ratios of interactions and non-interactions to simulate real conditions, obtaining accuracies higher than 25% in the most unfavorable circumstances.",

They provide a comprehensive view of the global interaction structure of an organism's proteome, as well as detailed information on specific interactions. Here we suggest a physical model of protein interactions that can be used to extract additional information at an intermediate level: It enables us to identify proteins which share biological interaction motifs, and also to identify potentially missing or spurious interactions. RESULTS: Our new graph model explains observed interactions between proteins by an underlying interaction of complementary binding domains (lock-and-key model). This leads to a novel graph-theoretical algorithm to identify bipartite subgraphs within protein-protein interaction networks where the underlying data are taken from yeast two-hybrid experimental results. By testing on synthetic data, we demonstrate that under certain modelling assumptions, the algorithm will return correct domain information about each protein in the network. Tests on data from various model organisms show that the local and global patterns predicted by the model are indeed found in experimental data. Using functional and protein structure annotations, we show that bipartite subnetworks can be identified that correspond to biologically relevant interaction motifs. Some of these are novel and we discuss an example involving SH3 domains from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae interactome.

Invertebrates offer additional experimental advantages when attempting to characterise protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Their relatively small genome size compared to mammals helps to reduce missed interactions due to redundancy, and their function can be addressed using forward (mutants) and reverse (RNA interference) genetics. However, the researcher looking for evidence of PPIs for a protein of interest is faced with the challenge of extracting interaction data from sources that are highly varied, such as the results of microarray experiments in the unstructured text of research papers.

The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay is one such novel method for which tools and protocols for its application in plant cell research are still being developed. BiFC is a powerful tool which enables not only detection, but also visualization and subcellular localization of protein-protein interactions in living cells. Here we describe the application of BiFC in plant cells while focusing on the use of our versatile set of vectors which were specifically designed to facilitate the transformation, expression and imaging of protein-protein interactions in various plant species. We discuss the considerations of using our system in various plant model systems, the use of single versus multiple expression cassettes, the application of our vectors using various transformation methods and the use of internal fluorescent markers which can assist in signal localization and easy data acquisition in living cells. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We have developed a technology called light-activated dimerization (LAD) to artificially induce protein hetero- and homodimerization in live cells using light. Using the FKF1 and GIGANTEA (GI) proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana, we have generated protein tags whose interaction is controlled by blue light. We demonstrated the utility of this system with LAD constructs that can recruit the small G-protein Rac1 to the plasma membrane and induce the local formation of lamellipodia in response to focal illumination. We also generated a light-activated transcription factor by fusing domains of GI and FKF1 to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 and the transactivation domain of VP16, respectively, showing that this technology is easily adapted to other systems. These studies set the stage for the development of light-regulated signaling molecules for controlling receptor activation, synapse formation and other signaling events in organisms",

        "abstract": "Transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria is the rate-determining, hormone-sensitive step in steroid biosynthesis. Here we report that the mechanism underlying mitochondrial cholesterol transport involves the formation of a macromolecular signaling complex composed of the outer mitochondrial membrane translocator protein (TSPO), previously known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor; the TSPO-associated protein PAP7, which binds and brings to mitochondria the regulatory subunit RIalpha of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKARIalpha); and the hormone-induced PKA substrate, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). Hormone treatment of MA-10 Leydig cells induced the co-localization of TSPO, PAP7, PKARIalpha, and StAR in mitochondria, visualized by confocal microscopy, and the formation in living cells of a high molecular weight multimeric complex identified using photoactivable amino acids. The hormone-induced recruitment of exogenous TSPO in this complex was found to parallel the increased presence of 7-azi-5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol in the samples. Co-expression of Tspo, Pap7, PkarIalpha, and Star genes resulted in the stimulation of steroid formation in both steroidogenic MA-10 and non-steroidogenic COS-F2-130 cells that were engineered to metabolize cholesterol. Disruption of these protein-protein interactions and specifically the PKARIalpha-PAP7 and PAP7-TSPO interactions, using PAP7 mutants where the N0 area homologous to dual A-kinase-anchoring protein-1 or the acyl-CoA signature motif were deleted or using the peptide Ht31 known to disrupt the anchoring of PKA, inhibited both basal and hormone-induced steroidogenesis. These results suggest that the initiation of cAMP-induced protein-protein interactions results in the formation of a multivalent scaffold in the outer mitochondrial membrane that mediates the effect of hormones on mitochondrial cholesterol transport and steroidogenesis.",

        "abstract": "The identification of subpicomolar amounts of protein by mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with two-dimensional methods to separate complex protein mixtures is fueling the field of proteomics, and making feasible the notion of cataloging and comparing all of the expressed proteins in a biological sample. Functional proteomics is a complementary effort aimed at the characterization of functional features of proteins, such as their interactions with other proteins. Proteins comprise modular domains, many of which are noncatalytic modules that direct protein-protein interactions. Capturing proteins of interest and their interacting proteins by using high-affinity antibodies presents a simple method to prepare relatively simple protein mixtures easily resolved in one-dimensional formats. Individual or mixtures of proteins identified as stained bands in polyacrylamide gels are subjected to in situ digestion with the protease trypsin, and the extracted peptide fragments are analyzed by MS. The quality, quantity, and complexity of the tryptic digest, the species origin of the proteins, and the quality of the corresponding databases of genomic and protein information greatly influence the subsequent MS analysis in terms of degree of difficulty and methodological approach required to make an unambiguous protein identification. In this article we report the isolation of associated proteins from a complex cell-derived lysate by using an epitope-directed antibody. The protein pICLn engineered to carry an epitope tag was purified from cultured human embryonic kidney cells, and found to associate with a variety of proteins including the spliceosomal proteins smE and smG. By application of this general approach, the systematic identification of protein complexes and assignment of protein function are possible.",

Specific potentials were derived for the interaction of the calcium cation with the Asp, Glu, Asn, and Gln side chains and the peptide group. The analytical expressions for the interaction energies for each of these amino acids were obtained by averaging the electrostatic interaction energy, expressed by a multipole series over the dihedral angles not considered in the united-residue model, that is, the side-chain dihedral angles chi and the dihedral angles lambda for the rotation of peptide groups about the C(alpha)...C(alpha) virtual-bond axes. For the side-chains that do not interact favorably with calcium, simple excluded-volume potentials were introduced. The parameters of the potentials were obtained from ab initio quantum mechanical calculations of model systems at the Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) level with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The energy surfaces of pairs consisting of Ca(2+)-acetate, Ca(2+)-propionate, Ca(2+)-acetamide, Ca(2+)-propionamide, and Ca(2+)-N-methylacetamide systems (modeling the Ca(2+)-Asp(-), Ca(2+)-Glu(-), Ca(2+)-Asn, Ca(2+)-Gln, and Ca(2+)-peptide group interactions) at different distances and orientations were calculated. For each pair, the restricted free energy (RFE) surfaces were calculated by numerical integration over the degrees of freedom lost when switching from the all-atom model to the united-residue model. Finally, the analytical expressions for each pair were fitted to the RFE surfaces. This force-field was able to distinguish the EF-hand motif from all potential binding sites in the crystal structures of bovine alpha-lactalbumin, whiting parvalbumin, calbindin D9K, and apo-calbindin D9K.",

To address this, many current methods use multiple evidence from different sources of information to compute reliability scores for such PPIs. However, they often combine the evidence without taking into account the uncertainty of the evidence values, potential dependencies between the information sources used and missing values from some information sources. We propose to formulate the task of scoring PPIs using multiple information sources as a multi-criteria decision making problem that can be solved using data fusion to model potential interactions between the multiple information sources. Using data fusion, the amount of contribution from each information source can be proportioned accordingly to systematically score the reliability of PPIs.

This tutorial review will introduce the relevance of PPIs to chemical biology and highlight the key challenges in designing inhibitors. Some of the successes using conventional approaches to the identification of small-molecule PPI inhibitors will be highlighted, and also the reasons why these approaches have not always proven successful. Several general approaches tailored to particular protein topologies are emerging for the design of scaffolds that inhibit PPIs-these will form the major content of this review.

In order to perform their function, they interact with each other as well as with other biomolecules such as DNA or RNA. Therefore, to fathom the function of a protein, we require knowing its partners and the atomic details of its interactions (i.e., the structure of the complex). However, the amount of protein interactions with an experimentally determined three-dimensional structure is scarce. Therefore, computational techniques such as homology modeling are foremost to fill this gap. Protein interactions can be modeled using as templates the interactions of homologous proteins, if the structure of the complex is known, or using docking methods. In both approaches, the estimation of the quality of models is essential. There are several ways to address this problem. In this review, we focus on the use of knowledge-based potentials for the analysis of protein interactions. We describe the procedure to derive statistical potentials and split them into different energetic terms that can be used for different purposes. We extensively discuss the fields where knowledge-based potentials have been successfully applied to (1) model protein-protein, protein-DNA, and protein-RNA interactions and (2) predict binding sites (in the protein and in the DNA). Moreover, we provide ready-to-use resources for docking and benchmarking protein interactions. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONIn recent years, phage display has evolved into a powerful tool providing opportunities to define natural protein-protein interactions and to mold novel ligand receptors. The essential advantages of phage-display approaches originate in the incorporation of the protein and genetic components into a single phage particle. By providing a direct physical link between the expressed protein and the encoding genetic information, clones with desirable functional capacities can be efficiently subjected to iterative rounds of selection, followed by amplification of the selected sublibrary. Hence, during library selection (or panning), specific phage clones are progressively enriched on the basis of their specificity and affinity for ligand.

To execute these functions, the signals of those stimuli are transmitted to the cytosolic and nuclear targets in a rapid and specific manner. In the last few years it has become clear that the specificity and the rapid function of the ERK cascade is largely determined by protein-protein interactions with various signaling components and substrates. This review describes interactions of ERK with its immediate regulators, scaffold proteins, substrates, and localizing proteins, and shows their involvement in the functioning of the ERK cascade. Understanding the full scope of ERK-interactions is important for the development of new drugs for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.",

In recent years, fragment-based approaches have emerged as a new methodology in drug discovery; however, few examples of small molecules that are active against chemotherapeutic targets have been published. Herein, we describe the fragment-based approach of targeting the interaction between the tumour suppressor BRCA2 and the recombination enzyme RAD51; it makes use of a screening pipeline of biophysical techniques that we expect to be more generally applicable to similar targets. Disruption of this interaction in vivo is hypothesised to give rise to cellular hypersensitivity to radiation and genotoxic drugs. We have used protein engineering to create a monomeric form of RAD51 by humanising a thermostable archaeal orthologue, RadA, and used this protein for fragment screening. The initial fragment hits were thoroughly validated biophysically by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR techniques and observed by X-ray crystallography to bind in a shallow surface pocket that is occupied in the native complex by the side chain of a phenylalanine from the conserved FxxA interaction motif found in BRCA2. This represents the first report of fragments or any small molecule binding at this protein-protein interaction site.",

The power of this approach is demonstrated by the identification of nine-residue peptides from a combinatorial library that inhibit the intracellular dimerization of HIV-1 protease. Fewer than 1 in 106 peptides do so. In vitro biochemical analyses of one such peptide demonstrate that it acts by dissociating HIV-1 protease into monomers, which are inactive catalysts.

This situates the receptor well in the regulation of limbic function and in the pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The intracellular domains of the receptor, mainly the large third intracellular loop and the intracellular C-terminal tail, interact with multiple submembranous proteins. These interactions are critical for the control of surface expression of the receptor and the efficacy of receptor signaling. Recently, a synapse-enriched protein kinase, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), has been found to interact with D3R in the above mentioned interaction model. CaMKII directly binds to the N-terminal of the third loop of D3R. This binding is Ca(2+)-dependent and is sustained by the autophosphorylation of the kinase. In rat accumbal neurons, the increase in Ca(2+) level induces the recruitment of CaMKII to D3R, and CaMKII phosphorylates the receptor at a specific serine site. The CaMKII-induced phosphorylation could inhibit the receptor function and further regulate the behavioral response to the psychostimulant cocaine. These findings reveal a prototypic protein association model between a G protein-coupled receptor and CaMKII. Through the dynamic protein-protein interactions, the abundance, turnover cycle, and function of D3R can be regulated by multiple signals and enzymatic proteins.",

They took a binding domain in a signalling pathway in yeast and replaced it with domains of the same class but from different organisms. They found that the probability of a protein binding to a protein from the proteome of a different organism is rather high, around one half. We calculate the probability of a model protein from one proteome binding to the protein of a different proteome. These proteomes are obtained by sampling the space of functional proteomes uniformly. In agreement with Zarrinpar et al we find that the probability of a protein binding a protein from another proteome is rather high, of order one tenth. Our results, together with those of Zarrinpar et al, suggest that designing, say, a peptide to block or reconstitute a single signalling pathway, without affecting any other pathways, requires knowledge of all the partners of the class of binding domains the peptide is designed to mimic. This knowledge is required to use negative design to explicitly design out interactions of the peptide with proteins other than its target. We also found that patches that are required to bind with high specificity evolve more slowly than those that are required only to not bind to any other patch. This is consistent with some analysis of sequence data for proteins engaged in highly specific interactions.",

Most experimental findings pertaining to such interactions are discussed in research papers, which, in turn, get curated by protein interaction databases. Authors, editors, and publishers benefit from efforts to alleviate the tasks of searching for relevant papers, evidence for physical interactions, and proper identifiers for each protein involved. The BioCreative II.5 community challenge addressed these tasks in a competition-style assessment to evaluate and compare different methodologies, to make aware of the increasing accuracy of automated methods, and to guide future implementations. In this paper, we present our approaches for protein-named entity recognition, including normalization, and for extraction of protein-protein interactions from full text. Our overall goal is to identify efficient individual components, and we compare various compositions to handle a single full-text article in between 10 seconds and 2 minutes. We propose strategies to transfer document-level annotations to the sentence-level, which allows for the creation of a more fine-grained training corpus; we use this corpus to automatically derive around 5,000 patterns. We rank sentences by relevance to the task of finding novel interactions with physical evidence, using a sentence classifier built from this training corpus. Heuristics for paraphrasing sentences help to further remove unnecessary information that might interfere with patterns, such as additional adjectives, clauses, or bracketed expressions. In BioCreative II.5, we achieved an f-score of 22 percent for finding protein interactions, and 43 percent for mapping proteins to UniProt IDs; disregarding species, f-scores are 30 percent and 55 percent, respectively. On average, our best-performing setup required around 2 minutes per full text. All data and pattern sets as well as Java classes that extend- - third-party software are available as supplementary information (see Appendix).",

In addition, channel class specific accessory proteins termed beta, gamma and delta subunits have been found that modulate or even determine key properties like channel gating (e.g. activation, inactivation properties), surface expression, targeting and stability. Moreover, some of these subunits constitute binding sites for toxins as well as for therapeutic drugs. With the development of more powerful proteomic and molecular biology-based methods, a vastly increasing number of proteins interacting with ion channels has recently been described. These results are providing novel insight into ion channel function and at the same time challenging classical concepts of beta subunits and ion channel drug targets. They are also raising questions about functional validation and reliability of these methods. This review focuses on the potentials and limitations of modern \"-omic\" protein-protein interaction analyses and their application to ion channels. After recapitulating fundamental thermodynamic and biochemical principles underlying protein-protein interactions, current methods for their systematic identification are critically reviewed.

We classify the yeast protein complexes as either permanent or transient, with permanent ones being maintained through most cellular conditions. We find that, generally, permanent complexes, such as the ribosome and proteasome, have a particularly strong relationship with expression, while transient ones do not. However, we note that several transient complexes, such as the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and the replication complex, can be subdivided into smaller permanent ones, which do have a strong relationship to gene expression.

These interactions are usually transient, easily formed, and disrupted, yet specific. Many of these transient interactions involve the binding of a protein domain to a short stretch (3-10) of amino acid residues, which can be characterized by a sequence pattern, i.e., a short linear motif (SLiM). We call these interacting domains and motifs domain-SLiM interactions. Existing methods have focused on discovering SLiMs in the interacting proteins' sequence data. With the recent increase in protein structures, we have a new opportunity to detect SLiMs directly from the proteins' 3D structures instead of their linear sequences. In this chapter, we describe a computational method called SLiMDIet to directly detect SLiMs on domain interfaces extracted from 3D structures of PPIs. SLiMDIet comprises two steps: (1) interaction interfaces belonging to the same domain are extracted and grouped together using structural clustering and (2) the extracted interaction interfaces in each cluster are structurally aligned to extract the corresponding SLiM. Using SLiMDIet, de novo SLiMs interacting with protein domains can be computationally detected from structurally clustered domain-SLiM interactions for PFAM domains which have available 3D structures in the PDB database.",

This array was screened by a simple and automated procedure for 192 yeast proteins, with positive responses identified by their positions in the array. In a second approach, we pooled cells expressing one of about 6,000 activation domain fusions to generate a library. We used a high-throughput screening procedure to screen nearly all of the 6,000 predicted yeast proteins, expressed as Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, against the library, and characterized positives by sequence analysis. These approaches resulted in the detection of 957 putative interactions involving 1,004 S. cerevisiae proteins.

Although efforts have been devoted to the development of methodology for predicting PPIs and protein interaction networks, the application of most existing methods is limited because they need information about protein homology or the interaction marks of the protein partners. In the present work, we propose a method for PPI prediction using only the information of protein sequences. This method was developed based on a learning algorithm-support vector machine combined with a kernel function and a conjoint triad feature for describing amino acids. More than 16,000 diverse PPI pairs were used to construct the universal model. The prediction ability of our approach is better than that of other sequence-based PPI prediction methods because it is able to predict PPI networks. Different types of PPI networks have been effectively mapped with our method, suggesting that, even with only sequence information, this method could be applied to the exploration of networks for any newly discovered protein with unknown biological relativity.

In this chapter, we review the current knowledge about the regulatory mechanisms for AMPAR trafficking and channel gating by protein-protein interactions and posttranslational modifications. Especially, we focus on the recently established mode of action of the AMPAR auxiliary subunit, stargazin/TARPs, and PSD-95 scaffold. Furthermore, we introduce novel players in AMPAR regulation, PSD-95 palmitoylating enzymes and epilepsy-related ligand, LGI1. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Ribosome assembly in eukaryotic organisms requires more than 200 assembly factors to facilitate and coordinate rRNA transcription, processing, and folding with the binding of the ribosomal proteins. Many of these assembly factors bind and dissociate at defined times giving rise to discrete assembly intermediates, some of which have been partially characterized with regards to their protein and RNA composition. Here, we have analyzed the protein-protein interactions between the seven assembly factors bound to late cytoplasmic pre-40S ribosomes using recombinant proteins in binding assays. Our data show that these factors form two modules: one comprising Enp1 and the export adaptor Ltv1 near the beak structure, and the second comprising the kinase Rio2, the nuclease Nob1, and a regulatory RNA binding protein Dim2/Pno1 on the front of the head. The GTPase-like Tsr1 and the universally conserved methylase Dim1 are also peripherally connected to this second module. Additionally, in an effort to further define the locations for these essential proteins, we have analyzed the interactions between these assembly factors and six ribosomal proteins: Rps0, Rps3, Rps5, Rps14, Rps15 and Rps29. Together, these results and previous RNA-protein crosslinking data allow us to propose a model for the binding sites of these seven assembly factors. Furthermore, our data show that the essential kinase Rio2 is located at the center of the pre-ribosomal particle and interacts, directly or indirectly, with every other assembly factor, as well as three ribosomal proteins required for cytoplasmic 40S maturation. These data suggest that Rio2 could play a central role in regulating cytoplasmic maturation steps.",

        "abstract": "Motivation: Infectious diseases such as malaria result in millions of deaths each year. An important aspect of any host-pathogen system is the mechanism by which a pathogen can infect its host. One method of infection is via protein-protein interactions (PPIs) where pathogen proteins target host proteins. Developing computational methods that identify which PPIs enable a pathogen to infect a host has great implications in identifying potential targets for therapeutics.  Results: We present a method that integrates known intra-species PPIs with protein-domain profiles to predict PPIs between host and pathogen proteins. Given a set of intra-species PPIs, we identify the functional domains in each of the interacting proteins. For every pair of functional domains, we use Bayesian statistics to assess the probability that two proteins with that pair of domains will interact. We apply our method to the Homo sapiens - Plasmodium falciparum host-pathogen system. Our system predicts 516 PPIs between proteins from these two organisms. We show that pairs of human proteins we predict to interact with the same Plasmodium protein are close to each other in the human PPI network and that Plasmodium pairs predicted to interact with same human protein are co-expressed in DNA microarray datasets measured during various stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. Finally, we identify functionally enriched sub-networks spanned by the predicted interactions and discuss the plausibility of our predictions.

To predict PPIs, while the integrative methods use multiple data sources instead of a single source, the domain-based methods often use only protein domain features. Integration of both protein domain features and genomic/proteomic features from multiple databases can more effectively predict PPIs. Moreover, it allows discovering the reciprocal relationships between PPIs and biological features of their interacting partners. We developed a novel integrative domain-based method for predicting PPIs using inductive logic programming (ILP). Two principal domain features used were domain fusions and domain-domain interactions (DDIs). Various relevant features of proteins were exploited from five popular genomic and proteomic databases. By integrating these features, we constructed biologically significant ILP background knowledge of more than 278,000 ground facts. The experimental results through multiple 10-fold cross-validations demonstrated that our method predicts PPIs better than other computational methods in terms of typical performance measures. The proposed ILP framework can be applied to predict DDIs with high sensitivity and specificity. The induced ILP rules gave us many interesting, biologically reciprocal relationships among PPIs, protein domains, and PPI-related genomic/proteomic features. Supplementary material is available at",

Protein complexes are pruned and decomposed into small parts based on the adaptive k-cores method to predict protein-protein interactions associated with the complexes. The proposed method is adaptive to protein complexes with different structure, number, and size of nodes in a protein-protein interaction network. Based on different complex sets detected by various algorithms, we can obtain different prediction sets of protein-protein interactions. The reliability of the predicted interaction sets is proved by using estimations with statistical tests and direct confirmation of the biological data. In comparison with the approaches which predict the interactions based on the cliques, the overlap of the predictions is small. Similarly, the overlaps among the predicted sets of interactions derived from various complex sets are also small. Thus, every predicted set of interactions may complement and improve the quality of the original network data. Meanwhile, the predictions from the proposed method replenish protein-protein interactions associated with protein complexes using only the network topology.",

We hypothesized that an artificially appended molecular tension to it full-length luciferase may diversify the enzymatic activity through it modification of the active site. For the basic probe design, a full-length luciferase was sandwiched between two component proteins of interest. The length of flexible linkers between the components wits minimized to exert an efficient molecular tension to the sandwiched luciferase. When N- and C-terminal ends of Renilla luciferase 8 were flanked by the ligand-binding domain of human estrogen receptor alpha (ER LBD) and SH2 domain of Src, named ERS, this simple probe was surprisingly sensitive to estrogens. The luminescence spectra by ERS were largely enhanced by an addition of 4-hydroxytarnoxifen (OHT), 17 beta-estradiol, and genistein. The detection limit of ERS reached 1 nM OHT. Quantum yield (QY) and Michaelis-Menten constant of ERS were found to be 6.3% and 94.3 mu M, respectively. The enzymatic activities of ERS are also governed by different types of coelenterazine (CTZ) variants. The two hydroxy groups in CTZ, are critical for the enzymatic activities of ERS. This study is the first example that ail artificially appended molecular tension to a full-length luciferase can be taken as an optical signature upon molecular imaging. This study also provides new insight into the construction of a new lineage of bioluminescent probes for estimating protein-protein interactions.",

        "abstract": "The capacity of proteins to interact specifically with one another underlies our conceptual understanding of how living systems function. Systems-level study of specificity in protein-protein interactions is complicated by the fact that the cellular environment is crowded and heterogeneous; interaction pairs may exist at low relative concentrations and thus be presented with many more opportunities for promiscuous interactions compared with specific interaction possibilities. Here we address these questions by using a simple computational model that includes specifically designed interacting model proteins immersed in a mixture containing hundreds of different unrelated ones; all of them undergo simulated diffusion and interaction. We find that specific complexes are quite robust to interference from promiscuous interaction partners only in the range of temperatures T(design) > T > T(rand). At T > T(design), specific complexes become unstable, whereas at T < T(rand), formation of specific complexes is suppressed by promiscuous interactions. Specific interactions can form only if T(design) > T(rand). This condition requires an energy gap between binding energy in a specific complex and set of binding energies between randomly associating proteins, providing a general physical constraint on evolutionary selection or design of specific interacting protein interfaces. This work has implications for our understanding of how the protein repertoire functions and evolves within the context of cellular systems.",

In this chapter, we present a method for the integration of various data sets to predict TRIs for 54 organisms in the Bioverse ( 3 ). We describe how to compile and handle various formats and identifiers of data sets from different sources and how to predict TRIs using a homology-based approach, utilizing the compiled data sets. Integrated data sets include experimentally verified TRIs, binding sites of transcription factors, promoter sequences, protein subcellular localization, and protein families. Predicted TRIs expand the networks of gene regulation for a large number of organisms.

Several approaches have been used to address the problem of predicting PPI. Some of them are based on biological features extracted from a protein sequence (such as, amino acid composition, GO terms, etc.); others use relational and structural features extracted from the PPI network, which can be represented as a graph. Our approach falls in the second category. We adapt a general approach to graph feature extraction that has previously been applied to collaborative recommendation of friends in social networks. Several structural features are identified based on the PPI graph and used to learn classifiers for predicting new interactions. Two datasets containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI are used to test the proposed approach. Both these datasets were assembled from the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP). We assembled the first data set directly from DIP in April 2006, while the second data set has been used in previous studies, thus making it easy to compare our approach with previous approaches. Several classifiers are trained using the structural features extracted from the interactions graph. The results show good performance (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity), proving that the structural features are highly predictive with respect to PPI.",

However, more recent studies have begun to identify a host of other proteins that interact selectively with individual receptors at both the intracellular and extracellular face of the membrane.

We used a split synthetic renilla luciferase (hRLUC) complementation-based bioluminescence assay to study homodimerization of herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (TK) in mammalian cells and in living mice. We quantified and imaged homodimerization of TK chimeras containing N-terminal (N-hRLUC) or C-terminal (C-hRLUC) fragments of hRLUC in the upstream and downstream positions, respectively (tail-to-head homodimer). This was monitored using luminometry (68-fold increase, and was significantly [P<0.01] above background light emission) and by CCD camera imaging of living mice implanted with ex vivo transfected 293T cells (2.7-fold increase, and is significantly [P<0.01] above background light emission). We also made a mutant-TK to generate N-hRLUC mutant TK and mutant TK-C-hRLUC by changing a single amino acid at position 318 from arginine to cysteine, a key site that has previously been reported to be essential for TK homo-dimerization, to support the specificity of the hRLUC complementation signal from TK homodimerization. Ex vivo substrate (8-3H Penciclovir) accumulation assays in 293T cells expressing the TK protein chimeras showed active TK enzyme. We also devised an experimental strategy by constructing variant TK chimeras (possessing extra N-hRLUC or C-hRLUC 'spacers') to monitor incremental lack of association of the tail-to-head TK homodimer. Application of this potentially generalizable assay to screen for molecules that promote or disrupt ubiquitous homodimeric protein-protein interactions could serve not only as an invaluable tool to understand biological networks but could also be applied to drug discovery and validation in living subjects.",

Besides an abundant cytoplasmic localization of TPPII-p53 interaction signal, the nuclear interactions were also demonstrated. The cytoplasmic interactions were likewise detected between TPPII and SIRT7 in control HEK293 and lowactTPPII HEK293 cells. The interactions of SIRT7 with p53 were confirmed in three HEK293 cell transformants as well. The cytoplasmic occurrence of SIRT7 protein was demonstrated by immunofluorescence, when both nucleolar and cytoplasmic signals were identified within HEK293 cells and primary human fibroblasts. The unique cytoplasmic localization of SIRT7 protein was discussed based on an epitope specificity of N-terminus specific SIRT7 antibodies utilized in the present study compared with C-terminus specific antibodies previously used for nuclear detection of SIRT7 by other authors. The epitope sequence of N-terminal antibodies is occurring in all three splicing variants of SIRT7 compared to the epitope of C-terminal antibody, which is specific exclusively to the splicing variant 1. The cytoplasmic localization of p53 detected by immunofluorescence supported the results from its interactions with TPPII and SIRT7 observed by in situ PLA within model cells.

This is also true of other ligand-binding and active site residues. This raises the question whether protein interactions place additional constraints on sequence divergence beyond this general background of functional restrictions on all different types of proteins. In order to investigate this, the sequence identities of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) proteins to their Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SP) orthologues were used as a measure of sequence divergence. The SC proteins were divided into those in stable complexes, those that participate in transient interactions and the remaining proteins. All types of proteins can undergo extensive divergence: all three sequence identity distributions range from less than 20 to over 90%. However, overall, protein interactions do place additional constraints on sequence divergence and the distributions differ significantly: proteins not known to be involved in interactions have an average sequence identity of 38% while this value is 46% for proteins in stable complexes. Proteins that have transient interactions are intermediate between the two, with an average sequence identity of 41%. This trend is independent of whether the proteins are involved in informational functions (transcription, translation and replication) or not and of protein dispensability. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The interactions between labeled-con A versus succinylated ovalbumin, labeled-trypsin versus four proteinaceous trypsin inhibitors and labeled-insulin versus seven anti-insulin monoclonal antibodies were analyzed using a dual buffer system, in which a 60 mM borate-Na buffer (pH 9.35) was used as electrophoresis buffer and 60 mM MOPS-Na (pH 7.35) containing 0.1% Tween 20 was used as a sample buffer. The dual buffer system allowed fast and reproducible analyses of interactions at a physiological pH using uncoated fused-silica capillaries.

This method outperforms previously developed PPI prediction algorithms that rely on the conjunction of two protein names in MEDLINE abstracts. We show significant increases in coverage (76% versus 32%) and sensitivity (66% versus 41% at a specificity of 95%) for the prediction of PPIs currently archived in 6 PPI databases. A retrospective analysis shows that PPIs can efficiently be predicted before they enter PPI databases and before their interaction is explicitly described in the literature. The practical value of the method for discovery of novel PPIs is illustrated by the experimental confirmation of the inferred physical interaction between CAPN3 and PARVB, which was based on frequent co-occurrence of both proteins with concepts like Z-disc, dysferlin, and alpha-actinin. The relationships between proteins predicted by our method are broader than PPIs, and include proteins in the same complex or pathway. Dependent on the type of relationships deemed useful, the precision of our method can be as high as 90%. The full set of predicted interactions is available in a downloadable matrix and through the webtool Nermal, which lists the most likely interaction partners for a given protein. Our framework can be used for prioritizing potential interaction partners, hitherto undiscovered, for follow-up studies and to aid the generation of accurate protein interaction maps.",

The protein ligands convene for regulation of biological function: adding, enhancing or inhibiting activity, for assistance in structural integrity or to enable subsequent PPI. All these general roles of PPI are represented in the proteasome, the giant proteolytic factory universally present in human cells. The proteasome is a renowned target for anti-cancer drugs and a considered target for drugs curbing inflammation. The essential function of the proteasome, the degradation of a majority of intracellular proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, relies on proper interactions between multiple subunits of the enzyme and between multiple modules forming distinct super-assemblies covered by the \"proteasome\" name. The interface regions between constitutive, alternative or transient protein components of the proteasome provide a rich platform for design of drugs with potentially very diverse actions. Still, the resource remains largely untapped since all proteasometargeting drugs used so far in humans are classical competitive inhibitors blocking catalytic centers. In this review, we will discuss the opportunities and challenges of targeting PPI in the hub enzyme for intracellular protein catabolism, the proteasome.",

However, not much is known about the general characteristic features of the human proteins interacting with viral proteins (referred to as hVIPs) as well as the motifs and domains utilized by human-virus protein-protein interactions (referred to as Hu-Vir PPIs). RESULTS Our study has revealed that hVIPs are mostly disordered proteins, whereas viral proteins are mostly ordered proteins. Protein disorder in viral proteins and hVIPs varies from one subcellular location to another. In any given viral-human PPI pair, at least one of the two proteins is structurally disordered suggesting that disorder associated conformational flexibility as one of the characteristic features of virus-host interaction. Further analyses reveal that hVIPs are (i) slowly evolving proteins, (ii) associated with high centrality scores in human-PPI network, (iii) involved in multiple pathways, (iv) enriched in eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs) associated with protein modification, degradation and regulatory processes, (v) associated with high number of splice variants and (vi) expressed abundantly across multiple tissues. These aforementioned findings suggest that conformational flexibility, spatial diversity, abundance and slow evolution are the characteristic features of the human proteins targeted by viral proteins. Hu-Vir PPIs are mostly mediated via domain-motif interactions (DMIs) where viral proteins employ motifs that mimic host ELMs to bind to domains in human proteins. DMIs are shared among viruses belonging to different families indicating a possible convergent evolution of these motifs to help viruses to adopt common strategies to subvert host cellular pathways.

        "abstract": "Far western blotting (WB) was derived from the standard WB method to detect protein-protein interactions in vitro. In Far WB, proteins in a cell lysate containing prey proteins are firstly separated by SDS or native PAGE, and transferred to a membrane, as in a standard WB. The proteins in the membrane are then denatured and renatured. The membrane is then blocked and probed, usually with purified bait protein(s). The bait proteins are detected on spots in the membrane where a prey protein is located if the bait proteins and the prey protein together form a complex. Compared with other biochemical binding assays, Far WB allows prey proteins to be endogenously expressed without purification. Unlike most methods using cell lysates (e.g., co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)) or living cells (e.g., fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)), Far WB determines whether two proteins bind to each other directly. Furthermore, in cases where they bind to each other indirectly, Far WB allows the examination of candidate protein(s) that form a complex between them. Typically, 2-3 d are required to carry out the experiment.",

Here, we describe an assay for the analysis of protein-protein interactions based on the co-localization of a fused site-specific protease with a cleavable reporter in close proximity to the interaction partner under examination. We exemplified this scheme in the temperature-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc25-2 mutant strain using the nuclear inclusion protease of tobacco etch virus fused to the adaptor protein growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2). The growth-defective phenotype of cdc25-2 was complemented by expression of a membrane-targeted constitutively active Ras protein, which contained a TEV protease substrate sequence allowing for release from the membrane upon proteolysis. Interaction of Grb2 with the membrane-targeted intracellular domain of the oncogene vErbB resulted in co-localization of the TEV protease with its substrate, release of Ras from the membrane and restoration of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of cdc25-2. The flexibility of the general scheme of this approach may allow for its application in many different assay scenarios and may represent a suitable alternative in cases where other approaches fail. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

It is readily applied to samples prepared with standard immunofluorescence techniques using antibodies labeled with fluorescent dyes that act as a donor and acceptor pair for FRET.

Nevertheless, the majority of available protein-protein interaction networks are context-less, i.e. without any reference to the spatial, temporal or physiological conditions in which the interactions may occur. In this work, we are proposing a protocol to infer the most likely protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in human macrophages.\\n\\nRESULTS: We integrated the PPI dataset from the Agile Protein Interaction DataAnalyzer (APID) with different meta-data to infer a contextualized macrophage-specific interactome using a combination of statistical methods. The obtained interactome is enriched in experimentally verified interactions and in proteins involved in macrophage-related biological processes (i.e. immune response activation, regulation of apoptosis). As a case study, we used the contextualized interactome to highlight the cellular processes induced upon Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our work confirms that contextualizing interactomes improves the biological significance of bioinformatic analyses. More specifically, studying such inferred network rather than focusing at the gene expression level only, is informative on the processes involved in the host response. Indeed, important immune features such as apoptosis are solely highlighted when the spotlight is on the protein interaction level.",

This diversity results in PPI binding affinities that span more than nine orders of magnitude. Several early studies attempted to correlate PPI binding affinities to various structure-derived features with limited success. The growing number of high-resolution structures, the appearance of more precise methods for measuring binding affinities and the development of new computational algorithms enable more thorough investigations in this direction. Here, we use a large dataset of PPI structures with the documented binding affinities to calculate a number of structure-based features that could potentially define binding energetics. We explore how well each calculated biophysical feature alone correlates with binding affinity and determine the features that could be used to distinguish between high-, medium- and low- affinity PPIs. Furthermore, we test how various combinations of features could be applied to predict binding affinity and observe a slow improvement in correlation as more features are incorporated into the equation. In addition, we observe a considerable improvement in predictions if we exclude from our analysis low-resolution and NMR structures, revealing the importance of capturing exact intermolecular interactions in our calculations. Our analysis should facilitate prediction of new interactions on the genome scale, better characterization of signaling networks and design of novel binding partners for various target proteins.",

We successfully applied this method to design membrane-spanning peptides targeting the transmembrane domains of the alpha IIb subunit of integrin alpha IIbbeta 3. Previously, we demonstrated that these CHAMP peptides bind specifically with reasonable affinity to isolated transmembrane helices of the targeted transmembrane region. These peptides also induced integrin alpha IIbbeta 3 activation due to disruption of the helix-helix interactions between the transmembrane domains of the alpha IIb and beta 3 subunits. In this paper, we show the direct interaction of the designed anti-alpha IIb CHAMP peptide with isolated full-length integrin alpha IIbbeta 3 in detergent micelles. Further, the behavior of the designed peptides in phospholipid bilayers is essentially identical to their behavior in detergent micelles. In particular, the peptides assume a membrane-spanning alpha-helical conformation that does not disrupt bilayer integrity. The activity and selectivity of the CHAMP peptides were further explored in platelets, comfirming that anti-alpha IIb activates wild-type alpha IIbbeta 3 in whole cells as a result of its disruption of the protein-protein interactions between the alpha and beta subunits in the transmembrane regions. These results demonstrate that CHAMP is a successful chemical biology approach that can provide specific tools for probing the transmembrane domains of proteins.",

This interaction is mediated by a small pentapeptide motif (LXXLL), termed the NR box. Based on this motif, a variety of cyclic and linear peptides were synthesized in order to gain a better understanding of the association of CoA proteins with the ER isoforms. Utilizing a time-resolved florescence-based coactivator interaction assay, we determined the abilities of these peptides to inhibit this interaction. Using molecular modeling and CD spectroscopy, we have examined the structural basis of their bioactivities with both hormone receptor isoforms. Either homocysteine or penicillamine was utilized as a substitute for cysteine in the disulfide-bridged peptides, while tertiary leucine and neopentyl glycine were used as the surrogates for the NR box leucines. The most potent disufide-bridged peptide (K(i)= 70 pM, with ERalpha) incorporates neopentyl glycine in the NR box, while the most active peptide in this series with ERbeta (K(i)=350 pM) incorporates tertiary leucine. Surprisingly, several linear peptides containing a single cysteine residue showed activities with low nanomolar K(i) values.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Live cell imaging is an essential approach for studying the structure, dynamics, and functions of cells in a living plant under normal or stressed growth conditions. The tiny flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, provides an ideal system to apply various live microscopy techniques. Its small size allows fluorescent light to penetrate the tissues, and its plantlets contain different cell types with different ploidy levels and differentiation stages. Its 2C nucleus contains only five pairs of chromosomes in which heterochromatin domains are organized as chromocenters, and these domains are easily resolved under the microscope. In addition, the availability of powerful genetic tools facilitates the investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying various cellular phenomena. In designing live imaging experiments, one must keep in mind that plants sense light, temperature, osmolarity, humidity, gravity, and nutrition. In addition, plants also have strong circadian rhythms of physiological behavior and gene expression. Moreover, plant tissues are normally thick (having multiple cell layers), and can have strong autofluorescence, especially in green leaves. Therefore, optimized culturing and imaging conditions are essential for successful live cell studies in plants. This protocol describes a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) imaging assay for protein-protein interactions via their transient coexpression in tobacco. The example used here examines interactions among the plant primary microRNA processing proteins Dicer-like 1, Hyponastic Leaves 1, and SERRATE, but the procedure can be modified easily to accommodate other proteins or structures of interest.",

The first is to find pairs of proteins which are mentioned together in the same context, for example, the same sentence, with the assumption that textual proximity implies biological association. The second approach is to use precise linguistic patterns based on NLP to find specific relationships between proteins. This can reveal the direction of the relationship and its nature such as \"phosphorylation\" or \"upregulation\".

Previously, we demonstrated that the consideration of protein-protein interactions significantly increases the accuracy of fold assignment compared with PSI-BLAST sequence comparisons. A drawback of our method was the low number of proteins to which a fold could be assigned. Here, we present an improved version of the method that addresses this limitation. We also compare our method to other state-of-the-art fold assignment methodologies. Results: Our approach (ModLink+) has been tested on 3716 proteins with domain folds classified in the Structural Classification Of Proteins (SCOP) as well as known interacting partners in the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP). For this test set, the ratio of success [positive predictive value (PPV)] on fold assignment increases from 75% for PSI-BLAST, 83% for HHSearch and 81% for PRC to >90% for ModLink+ at the e-value cutoff of 10(-3). Under this e-value, ModLink+ can assign a fold to 30-45% of the proteins in the test set, while our previous method could cover <25%. When applied to 6384 proteins with unknown fold in the yeast proteome, ModLink+ combined with PSI-BLAST assigns a fold for domains in 3738 proteins, while PSI-BLAST alone covers only 2122 proteins, HHSearch 2969 and PRC 2826 proteins, using a threshold e-value that would represent a PPV >82% for each method in the test set.",

Protein docking procedures allow systematic sampling of intermolecular energy landscapes, revealing the distribution of energy basins and their characteristics. A systematic search docking procedure GRAMM-X was applied to a comprehensive nonredundant database of nonobligate protein-protein complexes to determine the size of the intermolecular energy funnel. The unbound structures were simulated using rotamer library. The procedure generated grid-based matches, based on a smoothed Lennard-Jones potential, and minimized them off the grid with the same potential. The minimization generated a distribution of distances, based on a variety of metrics, between the grid-based and the minimized matches. The metric selected for the analysis, ligand interface RMSD, provided three independent estimates of the funnel size: based on the distribution amplitude for the near-native matches, deviation from random, and correlation with the energy values. The three methods converge to similar estimates of approximately 6-8 A ligand interface RMSD. The results indicated dependence of the funnel size on the type of the complex (smaller for antigen-antibody, medium for enzyme-inhibitor, and larger for the rest of the complexes) and the funnel size correlation with the size of the interface. Guidelines for the optimal sampling of docking coordinates, based on the funnel size estimates, were explored.",

Our general approach has been to make use of structural motifs found in native proteins that are predisposed to interact with a particular binding geometry, and then further bolster these anchor points with favourable hydrophobic contacts. We describe the use of three different anchor points, i.e. \u03b2-strand pairing, metal binding and the docking of \u03b1-helix into a groove, to successfully design new interfaces. In several cases, high-resolution crystal structures show that the design models closely match the experimental structure. In addition, we have tested the use of buried hydrogen-bond networks as a source of affinity and specificity at interfaces. In these cases, the designed complexes did not form, highlighting the challenges associated with designing buried polar interactions.",

Transcription factors are master regulators of gene expression at the transcriptional level, and controlling the activity of these factors alters the transcriptome of the plant, leading to metabolic and phenotypic changes in response to stress. The functional analysis of interactions between transcription factors and other proteins is very important for elucidating the role of these transcriptional regulators in different signaling cascades. In this review, we present an overview of protein-protein interactions for the six major families of transcription factors involved in plant defense: basic leucine zipper containing domain proteins (bZIP), amino-acid sequence WRKYGQK (WRKY), myelocytomatosis related proteins (MYC), myeloblastosis related proteins (MYB), APETALA2/ ETHYLENE-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING FACTORS (AP2/EREBP) and no apical meristem (NAM), Arabidopsis transcription activation factor (ATAF), and  cup-shaped cotyledon (CUC) (NAC). We describe the interaction partners of these transcription factors as molecular responses during pathogen attack and the key components of signal transduction pathways that take place during plant defense responses. These interactions determine the activation or repression of response pathways and are crucial to understanding the regulatory networks that modulate plant defense responses.",

Despite of years of study and genome availability, effective vaccine has not been developed yet, and the chemotherapy is highly toxic. Therefore, it is clear just interdisciplinary integrated studies will have success in trying to search new targets for developing of vaccines and drugs. An essential part of this rationale is related to protein-protein interaction network (PPI) study which can provide a better understanding of complex protein interactions in biological system. Thus, we modeled PPIs for Trypanosomatids through computational methods using sequence comparison against public database of protein or domain interaction for interaction prediction (Interolog Mapping) and developed a dedicated combined system score to address the predictions robustness. The confidence evaluation of network prediction approach was addressed using gold standard positive and negative datasets and the AUC value obtained was 0.94. As result, 39,420, 43,531 and 45,235 interactions were predicted for L. braziliensis, L. major and L. infantum respectively. For each predicted network the top 20 proteins were ranked by MCC topological index. In addition, information related with immunological potential, degree of protein sequence conservation among orthologs and degree of identity compared to proteins of potential parasite hosts was integrated. This information integration provides a better understanding and usefulness of the predicted networks that can be valuable to select new potential biological targets for drug and vaccine development. Network modularity which is a key when one is interested in destabilizing the PPIs for drug or vaccine purposes along with multiple alignments of the predicted PPIs were performed revealing patterns associated with protein turnover. In addition, around 50% of hypothetical protein present in the networks received some degree of functional annotation which represents an important contribution since approximately 60% of Leishmania predicted proteomes has no predicted function.",

Methods: In this paper, we report our exploration of developing an automated system to identify MEDLINE abstracts referring to HP-PPIs. An annotated corpus consisting of 1360 MEDLINE abstracts was generated. With this corpus, we developed and evaluated document classification systems using support vector machines (SVMs). We also investigated the effects of three feature selection methods:information gain (IG), ??2 test, and specific mutual information (SI). The performance was measured using normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) and positive predictive value (PPV) and all measures were obtained through 10-fold cross validation. Results: NDCG measures for classification systems using all features or a subset of features selected using IG and ??2 test range from 0.83 to 0.89 while classification systems built based on features selected using SI had relatively lower NDCG measures. The classification system achieved a PPV of 50.7% for the top 10% ranked documents comparing to a baseline PPV of 10.0%. Conclusions: Our results indicate that document classification systems can be constructed to efficiently retrieve HP-PPI related documents.

The CSIDOP method is capable of making protein function prediction with accuracy of 95.42% using 2,972 gene ontology (GO) functional categories. In addition, we are able to assign novel functional annotations for 181 previously uncharacterized proteins in H. sapiens. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for proteins that are characterized by GO, the CSIDOP may predict extra functions. This is attractive as a protein normally executes a variety of functions in different processes and its current GO annotation may be incomplete.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: It can be shown through experimental results that the CSIDOP method is reliable and practical in use.

Unfortunately, the existing biological experimental techniques are expensive, time-consuming and labor-intensive. The network structures of many such networks are sparse, incomplete and noisy. Thus, state-of-the-art methods for link prediction in these networks often cannot give satisfactory prediction results, especially when some networks are extremely sparse. Noticing that we typically have more than one PPI network available, we naturally wonder whether it is possible to 'transfer' the linkage knowledge from some existing, relatively dense networks to a sparse network, to improve the prediction performance. Noticing that a network structure can be modeled using a matrix model, we introduce the well-known collective matrix factorization technique to 'transfer' usable linkage knowledge from relatively dense interaction network to a sparse target network. Our approach is to establish a correspondence between a source network and a target network via network-wide similarities. We test this method on two real PPI networks, Helicobacter pylori (as a target network) and human (as a source network).

In this study, we propose a novel system to detect PPIs using the distinct domains of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In this system named \"split FAK\", the linker and kinase domains in native FAK are tethered separately to two target proteins of interest. The interaction between the target proteins brings the linker and kinase domains into proximity, which leads to phosphorylation at Y397 of the linker domain, recruitment of another tyrosine kinase Src, and phosphorylation at Y576 of the kinase domain. PPIs are readily detected by probing phosphorylation at Y397 and Y576 of these domains. To demonstrate this system, we designed a series of split FAK chimeras with different domain structures. Consequently, dimerizer-induced interaction between FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP) and the T2098L mutant of FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain (FRB) was clearly detected by probing phosphorylation at the specific tyrosine residues of most of the split FAK chimeras.

We previously showed that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly a single residue located at the TM1/periplasmic loop interface, F47 of Staphylococcus aureus and I49 of Escherichia coli MscL, plays a major role in both the open dwell time and mechanosensitivity of the channel. Here, we introduced cysteine mutations at these sites and found they formed disulfide bridges that decreased the channel open dwell time. By scanning a likely interacting domain, we also found that these sites could be disulfide trapped by addition of cysteine mutations in other locations within the periplasmic loop of MscL, and this also led to rapid channel kinetics. Together, the data suggest structural rearrangements and protein-protein interactions that occur within this region upon normal gating, and further suggest that locking portions of the channel into a transition state decreases the stability of the open state. ?? 2014 Biophysical Society.",

Described here are the detailed methodological approaches used for a transient I-DIRT analysis of a multi-subunit complex, NuA3, that acetylates histone H3 and functions to activate gene transcription.

However, approaches relying on domains as features cannot be applied to proteins without any domain information. In this paper, we explore the contribution of pure amino acid composition (AAC) for protein interaction prediction. This simple feature, which is based on normalized counts of single or pairs of amino acids, is applicable to proteins from any sequenced organism and can be used to compensate for the lack of domain information.\\n\\nRESULTS: AAC performed at par with protein interaction prediction based on domains on three yeast protein interaction datasets. Similar behavior was obtained using different classifiers, indicating that our results are a function of features and not of classifiers. In addition to yeast datasets, AAC performed comparably on worm and fly datasets. Prediction of interactions for the entire yeast proteome identified a large number of novel interactions, the majority of which co-localized or participated in the same processes. Our high confidence interaction network included both well-studied and uncharacterized proteins. Proteins with known function were involved in actin assembly and cell budding. Uncharacterized proteins interacted with proteins involved in reproduction and cell budding, thus providing putative biological roles for the uncharacterized proteins.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: AAC is a simple, yet powerful feature for predicting protein interactions, and can be used alone or in conjunction with protein domains to predict new and validate existing interactions. More importantly, AAC alone performs at par with existing, but more complex, features indicating the presence of sequence-level information that is predictive of interaction, but which is not necessarily restricted to domains.",

This article reports a continuum analysis of the free-energy changes underlying the binding of 31 interfacial alanine substitutions of two complexes of the antihen egg white lysozyme (HEL) antibody D1.3 bound with HEL or the antibody E5.2. Two implicit schemes for modeling the effects of protein and solvent relaxation were examined, in which the protein environment was treated as either homogeneous with a \"protein dielectric constant\" of epsilon(p) = 4 or inhomogeneous, with epsilon(p) = 4 for neutral residues and epsilon(p) = 25 for ionized residues. The results showed that the nonuniform dielectric model reproduced the experimental differences better, with an average absolute error of +/-1.1 kcal/mol, compared with +/-1.4 kcal/mol for the uniform model. More importantly, the error for charged residues in the nonuniform model is +/-0.8 kcal/mol and is nearly half of that corresponding to the uniform model.

Several experimental approaches and in silico algorithms have been developed to cluster proteins into networks of biological significance that may provide new biological insights, especially into understanding the functions of many uncharacterized proteins. Among these methods, the phylogenetic profiles method has been widely used to predict protein-protein interactions. It involves the selection of reference organisms and identification of homologous proteins. Up to now, no published report has systematically studied the effects of the reference genome selection and the identification of homologous proteins upon the accuracy of this method. RESULTS: In this study, we optimized the phylogenetic profiles method by integrating phylogenetic relationships among reference organisms and sequence homology information to improve prediction accuracy. Our results revealed that the selection of the reference organisms set and the criteria for homology identification significantly are two critical factors for the prediction accuracy of this method. Our refined phylogenetic profiles method shows greater performance and potentially provides more reliable functional linkages compared with previous methods.",

One of the most common applications is to mine protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from PubMed abstracts. Currently, most tools in mining PPIs from literature are using co-occurrence-based approaches or rule-based approaches. Hybrid methods (frame-based approaches) by combining these two methods may have better performance in predicting PPIs. However, the predicted PPIs from these methods are rarely evaluated by known PPI databases and co-occurred terms in Gene Ontology (GO) database.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We here developed a web-based tool, PPI Finder, to mine human PPIs from PubMed abstracts based on their co-occurrences and interaction words, followed by evidences in human PPI databases and shared terms in GO database. Only 28% of the co-occurred pairs in PubMed abstracts appeared in any of the commonly used human PPI databases (HPRD, BioGRID and BIND). On the other hand, of the known PPIs in HPRD, 69% showed co-occurrences in the literature, and 65% shared GO terms.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: PPI Finder provides a useful tool for biologists to uncover potential novel PPIs.

To streamline protein structure-based inhibitor design, we have previously described the examination of protein complexes in the Protein Data Bank where \u03b1-helices or \u03b2-strands form critical contacts.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial in cellular processes. Since the current biological experimental techniques are time-consuming and expensive, and the results suffer from the problems of incompleteness and noise, developing computational methods and software tools to predict PPIs is necessary. Although several approaches have been proposed, the species supported are often limited and additional data like homologous interactions in other species, protein sequence and protein expression are often required. And predictive abilities of different features for different kinds of PPI data have not been studied. RESULTS In this paper, we propose ppiPre, an open-source framework for PPI analysis and prediction using a combination of heterogeneous features including three GO-based semantic similarities, one KEGG-based co-pathway similarity and three topology-based similarities. It supports up to twenty species. Only the original PPI data and gold-standard PPI data are required from users. The experiments on binary and co-complex gold-standard yeast PPI data sets show that there exist big differences among the predictive abilities of different features on different kinds of PPI data sets. And the prediction performance on the two data sets shows that ppiPre is capable of handling PPI data in different kinds and sizes. ppiPre is implemented in the R language and is freely available on the CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ppiPre/). CONCLUSIONS We applied our framework to both binary and co-complex gold-standard PPI data sets. The detailed analysis on three GO aspects suggests that different GO aspects should be used on different kinds of data sets, and that combining all the three aspects of GO often gets the best result. The analysis also shows that using only features based solely on the topology of the PPI network can get a very good result when predicting the co-complex PPI data. ppiPre provides useful functions for analysing PPI data and can be used to predict PPIs for multiple species.",

        "abstract": "Protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) are involved in many biological processes, with an estimated 400,000 PPIs within the human proteome. There is significant interest in exploiting the relatively unexplored potential of these interactions in drug discovery, driven by the need to find new therapeutic targets. Compared with classical drug discovery against targets with well-defined binding sites, developing small-molecule inhibitors against PPIs where the contact surfaces are frequently more extensive and comparatively flat, with most of the binding energy localized in \u201chot spots\u201d, has proven far more challenging. However, despite the difficulties associated with targeting PPIs, important progress has been made in recent years with fragment-based drug discovery playing a pivotal role in improving their tractability. Computational and empirical approaches can be used to identify hot-spot regions and assess the druggability and ligandability of new targets, whilst fragment screening campaigns can detect low-affinity fragments that either directly or indirectly perturb the PPI. Once fragment hits have been identified and confirmed using biochemical and biophysical approaches, three-dimensional structural data derived from nuclear magnetic resonance or X-ray crystallography can be used to drive medicinal chemistry efforts towards the development of more potent inhibitors. A small-scale comparison presented in this review of \u201cstandard\u201d fragments with those targeting PPIs has revealed that the latter tend to be larger, be more lipophilic, and contain more polar (acid/base) functionality, whereas three-dimensional descriptor data indicate that there is little difference in their three-dimensional character. These physiochemical properties can potentially be exploited in the rational design of PPI-specific fragment libraries and correlate well with optimized PPI inhibitors, which tend to have properties outside currently accepted guidelines for drug-likeness. Several examples of small-molecule PPI inhibitors derived from fragment-based drug discovery now exist and are described in this review, including navitoclax, a novel Bcl-2 family inhibitor which has entered Phase II clinical trials in patients with small-cell lung cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",

This method entails sequentially expressing two (or more) proteins within a single bacterial cell in a time-controlled manner and monitoring their interactions using in-cell NMR spectroscopy. The resulting NMR data provide a complete titration of the interaction and define structural details of the interacting surfaces at atomic resolution. Unlike the case where interacting proteins are simultaneously overexpressed in the labeled medium, in STINT-NMR the spectral complexity is minimized because only the target protein is labeled with NMR-active nuclei, which leaves the interactor protein(s) cryptic. This method can be combined with genetic and molecular screens to provide a structural foundation for proteomic studies.

        "abstract": "Although the nature of solvent-protein interactions is generally weak and non-specific, addition of cosolvents such as denaturants and osmolytes strengthens protein-protein interactions for some proteins, whereas it weakens protein-protein interactions for others. This is exemplified by the puzzling observation that addition of glycerol oppositely affects the association constants of two antibodies, D1.3 and D44.1, with lysozyme. To resolve this conundrum, we develop a methodology based on the thermodynamic principles of preferential interaction theory and the quantitative characterization of local protein solvation from molecular dynamics simulations. We find that changes of preferential solvent interactions at the protein-protein interface quantitatively account for the opposite effects of glycerol on the antibody-antigen association constants. Detailed characterization of local protein solvation in the free and associated protein states reveals how opposite solvent effects on protein-protein interactions depend on the extent of dewetting of the protein-protein contact region and on structural changes that alter cooperative solvent-protein interactions at the periphery of the protein-protein interface. These results demonstrate the direct relationship between macroscopic solvent effects on protein-protein interactions and atom-scale solvent-protein interactions, and establish a general methodology for predicting and understanding solvent effects on protein-protein interactions in diverse biological environments.",

However, the generality of this observation has recently been challenged. Here we examine the problem using protein-protein interaction data from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and genome sequences from two other yeast species.\\n\\nRESULTS: In contrast to a previous study that used an incomplete set of protein-protein interactions, we observed a highly significant correlation between number of interactions and evolutionary distance to either Candida albicans or Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This study differs from the previous one in that it includes all known protein interactions from S. cerevisiae, and a larger set of protein evolutionary rates. In both evolutionary comparisons, a simple monotonic relationship was found across the entire range of the number of protein-protein interactions. In agreement with our earlier findings, this relationship cannot be explained by the fact that proteins with many interactions tend to be important to yeast. The generality of these correlations in other kingdoms of life unfortunately cannot be addressed at this time, due to the incompleteness of protein-protein interaction data from organisms other than S. cerevisiae.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Protein-protein interactions tend to slow the rate at which proteins evolve.

However, there is currently no satisfactory method to construct an integrated cellular network that combines the gene regulatory network and the signaling regulatory pathway. RESULTS: In this study, we integrated different kinds of omics data and developed a systematic method to construct the integrated cellular network based on coupling dynamic models and statistical assessments. The proposed method was applied to S. cerevisiae stress responses, elucidating the stress response mechanism of the yeast. From the resulting integrated cellular network under hyperosmotic stress, the highly connected hubs which are functionally relevant to the stress response were identified. Beyond hyperosmotic stress, the integrated network under heat shock and oxidative stress were also constructed and the crosstalks of these networks were analyzed, specifying the significance of some transcription factors to serve as the decision-making devices at the center of the bow-tie structure and the crucial role for rapid adaptation scheme to respond to stress. In addition, the predictive power of the proposed method was also demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully construct the integrated cellular network which is validated by literature evidences. The integration of transcription regulations and protein-protein interactions gives more insight into the actual biological network and is more predictive than those without integration. The method is shown to be powerful and flexible and can be used under different conditions and for different species. The coupling dynamic models of the whole integrated cellular network are very useful for theoretical analyses and for further experiments in the fields of network biology and synthetic biology.",

In this study we describe a computational framework to improve the reconstruction of the PSD network. The approach is based on learning the characteristics of PSD protein interactions from a set of trusted interactions, expanding this set with data collected from large scale repositories, and then predicting novel interaction with proteins that are suspected to reside in the PSD. Using this method we obtained thirty predicted interactions, with more than half of which having supporting evidence in the literature.

However, unraveling large-scale protein-protein interaction maps is laborious and expensive. Moreover, assessing the reliability of the interactions can be cumbersome. RESULTS: In this study, we have developed a computational method that exploits the existing knowledge on protein-protein interactions in diverse species through orthologous relations on the one hand, and functional association data on the other hand to predict and filter protein-protein interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana. A highly reliable set of protein-protein interactions is predicted through this integrative approach making use of existing protein-protein interaction data from yeast, human, C. elegans and D. melanogaster. Localization, biological process, and co-expression data are used as powerful indicators for protein-protein interactions. The functional repertoire of the identified interactome reveals interactions between proteins functioning in well-conserved as well as plant-specific biological processes. We observe that although common mechanisms (e.g. actin polymerization) and components (e.g. ARPs, actin-related proteins) exist between different lineages, they are active in specific processes such as growth, cancer metastasis and trichome development in yeast, human and Arabidopsis, respectively. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the integration of orthology with functional association data is adequate to predict protein-protein interactions. Through this approach, a high number of novel protein-protein interactions with diverse biological roles is discovered. Overall, we have predicted a reliable set of protein-protein interactions suitable for further computational as well as experimental analyses.",

One of the dangers of oxygen is that it is easily converted into other reactive compounds. Inside our cells, electrons are continually shuttled from site to site by carrier molecules, such as carriers derived from riboflavin and niacin. If oxygen runs into one of these carrier molecules, the electron may be accidentally transferred to it. This converts oxygen into dangerous compounds such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, which can attack the delicate sulfur atoms and metal ions in proteins. To make things even worse, free iron ions in the cell occasionally convert hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals. These deadly molecules attack and mutate DNA. One theory, still controversial, is that this type of oxidative damage accumulates over the years of our life, causing us to age.",

These expression plasmids were constructed in such a way so as to serve a dual purpose of synthesizing the protein of interest as well as capturing the synthesized protein. The microarray system is based on the high affinity binding of Escherichia coli \"Tus\" protein to \"Ter,\" a 20 bp DNA sequence involved in the regulation of DNA replication. The protein expression is carried out in a cell-free protein synthesis system, with rabbit reticulocyte lysates, and the target proteins are detected either by labeled incorporated tag specific or by gene-specific antibodies. This microarray system has been successfully used for the detection of protein-protein interaction because both the target protein and the query protein can be transcribed and translated simultaneously in the microarray slides. The utility of this system for detecting protein-protein interaction is demonstrated by a few well-known examples: Jun/Fos, FRB/FKBP12, p53/MDM2, and CDK4/p16. In all these cases, the presence of protein complexes resulted in the localization of fluorophores at the specific sites of the immobilized target plasmids. Interestingly, during our interactions studies we also detected a previously unknown interaction between CDK2 and p16. Thus, this Tus-Ter based system of protein microarray can be used for the validation of known protein interactions as well as for identifying new protein-protein interactions. In addition, it can be used to examine and identify targets of nucleic acid-protein, ligand-receptor, enzyme-substrate, and drug-protein interactions.",

We start with a comparison of interfaces with protein cores and non-interface surfaces. The results show that interfaces differ from protein cores and non-interface surfaces in residue composition, sequence entropy, and secondary structure. Since interfaces, protein cores, and non-interface surfaces have different solvent accessibilities, it is important to investigate whether the observed differences are due to the differences in solvent accessibility or differences in functionality. We separate out the effect of solvent accessibility by comparing interfaces with a set of residues having the same solvent accessibility as the interfaces. This strategy reveals residue distribution propensities that are not observable by comparing interfaces with protein cores and non-interface surfaces. Our conclusions are that there are larger numbers of hydrophobic residues, particularly aromatic residues, in interfaces, and the interactions apparently favored in interfaces include the opposite charge pairs and hydrophobic pairs. Surprisingly, Pro-Trp pairs are over represented in interfaces, presumably because of favorable geometries. The analysis is repeated using three datasets having different constraints on sequence similarity and structure quality. Consistent results are obtained across these datasets.

Since many of Hsp90 clients are oncogenic proteins, Hsp90 has become an attractive therapeutic target for treatment of cancer. To discover small molecule inhibitors targeting Hsp90 chaperone machinery, several strategies have been employed, which results in three classes of inhibitors such as N-terminal inhibitors, C-terminal inhibitors, and inhibitors disrupting protein-protein interactions of Hsp90 chaperone machinery. Developing small molecule inhibitors that modulate protein-protein interactions of Hsp90 is a challenging task, although it offers many alternative opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The lack of well-defined binding pocket and starting points for drug design challenges medicinal chemists to discover small molecule inhibitors disrupting protein-protein interactions of Hsp90. The present review will focus on the current studies on small molecule inhibitors disrupting protein-protein interactions of Hsp90 chaperone machinery, provide biological background on the structure, function and mechanism of Hsp90's protein-protein interactions, and discuss the challenges and promise of its small molecule modulations.",

However, some proteins can be challenging to fragment without disrupting function, such as near-infrared fluorescent protein (IFP). We describe a directed evolution strategy that can overcome this challenge by randomly fragmenting proteins and concomitantly fusing the protein fragments to pairs of proteins or peptides that associate. We used this method to create libraries that express fragmented IFP as fusions to a pair of associating peptides (IAAL-E3 and IAAL-K3) and proteins (CheA and CheY) and screened for fragmented IFP with detectable near-infrared fluorescence. Thirteen novel fragmented IFPs were identified, all of which arose from backbone fission proximal to the interdomain linker. Either the IAAL-E3 and IAAL-K3 peptides or CheA and CheY proteins could assist with IFP fragment complementation, although the IAAL-E3 and IAAL-K3 peptides consistently yielded ...",

In interactome networks that are modeled as nodes (macromolecules) connected by edges (interactions), these alterations can be thought of as node removal and edge-specific or \"edgetic\" perturbations, respectively. Here we present two complementary strategies, forward and reverse edgetics, to investigate the phenotypic outcomes of edgetic perturbations of binary protein-protein interaction networks. Both approaches are based on the yeast two-hybrid system (Y2H). The first allows the determination of the interaction profile of proteins encoded by alleles with known phenotypes to identify edgetic alleles.

To examine the influence of domain intimacy, the 7\u2009NoV domains were grouped by depth. The number of domain-domain interactions increased exponentially as the depth increased.

Conventional drug design has mainly focused on the inhibition of a single protein, usually an enzyme or receptor, since these proteins often contain a clearly defined ligand-binding site with which a small-molecule drug can be designed to interact. Designing a small molecule to bind to a protein-protein interface and subsequently inhibit the interaction poses several challenges, including the initial identification of suitable protein-protein interactions, the surface area of the interface (it is often large), and the location of 'hot spots' (small regions suitable for drug binding).

Here we report the detailed characterization of a putative interaction between two transcription factor proteins, GATA-1 and Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 3 (KLF3/BKLF) that show robust interactions in GST-pulldown experiments. Attempts to map the interaction interface of GATA-1 on KLF3 using a mutagenic screening approach did not yield a contiguous binding face on KLF3, suggesting that the interaction might be non-specific. NMR experiments showed that the proteins do not interact at protein concentrations of 50-100 \u03bcM. Rather, the GST tag can cause part of KLF3 to misfold. In addition to misfolding, the fact that both proteins are DNA-binding domains appears to introduce binding artifacts (possibly nucleic acid bridging) that cannot be resolved by the addition of nucleases or ethidium bromide (EtBr). This study emphasizes the need for caution in relying on GST-pulldown results and related methods, without convincing confirmation from different approaches.",

        "abstract": "Ions can significantly modulate the solution interactions of proteins. We aim to demonstrate that the salt-dependent reversible heptamerization of a fusion protein called peptibody A or PbA is governed by anion-specific interactions with key arginyl and lysyl residues on its peptide arms. Peptibody A, an E. coli expressed, basic (pI = 8.8), homodimer (65.2 kDa), consisted of an IgG1-Fc with two, C-terminal peptide arms linked via penta-glycine linkers. Each peptide arm was composed of two, tandem, active sequences (SEYQGLPPQGWK) separated by a spacer (GSGSATGGSGGGASSGSGSATG). PbA was monomeric in 10 mM acetate, pH 5.0 but exhibited reversible self-association upon salt addition. The sedimentation coefficient (s(w)) and hydrodynamic diameter (D(H)) versus PbA concentration isotherms in the presence of 140 mM NaCl (A5N) displayed sharp increases in s(w) and D(H), reaching plateau values of 9 s and 16 nm by 10 mg/mL PbA. The D(H) and sedimentation equilibrium data in the plateau region (>12 mg/mL) indicated the oligomeric ensemble to be monodisperse (PdI = 0.05) with a z-average molecular weight (M(z)) of 433 kDa (stoichiometry = 7). There was no evidence of reversible self-association for an IgG1-Fc molecule in A5N by itself or in a mixture containing fluorescently labeled IgG1-Fc and PbA, indicative of PbA self-assembly being mediated through its peptide arms. Self-association increased with pH, NaCl concentration, and anion size (I(-) > Br(-) > Cl(-) > F(-)) but could be inhibited using soluble Trp-, Phe-, and Leu-amide salts (Trp > Phe > Leu). We propose that in the presence of salt (i) anion binding renders PbA self-association competent by neutralizing the peptidyl arginyl and lysyl amines, (ii) self-association occurs via aromatic and hydrophobic interactions between the ..xxCTRWPWMC..xxxCTRWPWMCxx.. motifs, and (iii) at >10 mg/mL, PbA predominantly exists as heptameric clusters.",

        "abstract": "As in any society, the many different proteins found within cells must often work together to carry out their intricate business. The protein complexes that form can be stable, as seen with multisubunit enzymes or structures such as the proteasome, or transient, such as those seen during the assembly of transcription factors or the intermediates in a signaling cascade. Wherever they are found, the identification of the interacting protein partners can be a difficult and sometimes daunting task. Interestingly, when two proteins are in close proximity, light energy absorbed by one can be passed to the other by a process called resonance energy transfer (RET). During fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), the input light energy is obtained by illuminating the sample, whereas in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), the input light energy is derived from an in situ bioluminescence reaction (1). Light derived from bioluminescence is generally weak and does not photobleach the sample or cause autofluorescence, a problem particularly acute in plant cells because of chlorophyll. BRET is therefore an excellent choice for measuring protein interactions in plant cells but in the past has seen limited application precisely because the bioluminescence emission is so weak. The work of Xu et al. (2) in this issue of PNAS marries an exquisitely sensitive CCD camera with a beam splitter to solve the light intensity problem, and the ensemble allows BRET to be visualized not only in plant seedlings but also in single cells.",

        "abstract": "Very weak protein-protein interactions may play a critical role in cell physiology but they are not easily detectable in \"in vitro\" experiments. To detect these weak interactions, we have developed a strategy that included: (a) design of a rapid and very effective crosslinking of protein-protein complexes with poly-functional reagents; (b) selective adsorption of very large proteins on lowly activated ionic exchangers, based on the need of a multipoint physical adsorption to incorporate the proteins into the matrix; (c) purification by selective adsorption of protein-protein complexes formed by strong protein-protein interactions, via selective adsorption of the complexes on lowly activated ionic exchangers via multi-protein physical adsorption and leaving the non-associated proteins in the solution; (d) reinforcement of very weak protein-protein interactions by selective adsorption of the complex on lowly activated ionic exchange supports via a synergetic cooperation of the weak protein-protein interaction plus the interactions of both proteins with the support enabling the almost full shifting of the equilibrium towards the association position; (e) control of the aggregation state of proteins like BSA, formed by weak protein-protein interactions. In this last case, it seems that the interaction of the protein molecules placed on the borders of the aggregate with the groups on the support partially stabilizes the whole aggregate, although, some molecules of the aggregate cannot interact with the support. The size of the aggregates may be defined by controlling the concentration of ionised groups on the support: the less activated the supports are, the bigger the complexes. In this way, solid-phase proteomics could be a very interesting tool to detect weak protein-protein interactions. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The dense, heterogeneous cellular environment is known to affect protein stability through interactions with other biomacromo-lecules. The effect of excluded volume due to these biomolecules, also known as crowding agents, on a protein of interest, or test protein, has long been known to increase the stability of a test protein. Recently, it has been recognized that attractive protein\u2212crowder interactions play an important role. These interactions affect protein stability and can destabilize the test protein. However, most computational work investigating the role of attractive interactions has used spherical crowding agents and has neglected the specific roles of crowding agent hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding. Here we use multicanonical molecular dynamics and a coarse-grained protein model to study the folding thermodynamics of a small helical test protein in the presence of crowding agents that are themselves proteins. Our results show that the stability of the test protein depends on the hydrophobicity of the crowding agents. For low values of crowding agent hydrophobicity, the excluded volume effect is dominant, and the test protein is stabilized relative to the dilute solution. For intermediate values of the crowding agent hydrophobicity, the test protein is destabilized by favorable side chain\u2212side chain interactions stabilizing the unfolded states. For high values of the crowding agent hydrophobicity, the native state is stabilized by the strong intermolecular attractions, causing the formation of a packed structure that increases the stability of the test protein through favorable side chain\u2212side chain interactions. In addition, increasing crowding agent hydrophobicity increases the \" foldability \" of the test protein and alters the potential energy landscape by simultaneously deepening the basins corresponding to the folded and unfolded states and increasing the energy barrier between them. \u25a0 INTRODUCTION The cellular environment in which proteins fold and function is crowded with biomacromolecules and is known to affect protein stability relative to dilute solution. 1 Much of the work investigating the effect of a crowded environment on the stability of proteins has focused on macromolecular crowding by using large, inert macromolecules to reproduce the crowded cellular milieu. 2 Experimental investigations of macromolecular crowding frequently use large, neutral, and inert molecules such as Ficoll or dextran as crowding agents. 3 In theoretical and computational studies, these are usually represented as inert spheres that have no interactions with the protein other than excluded volume interactions. 4 It is now widely accepted that it is essential to include the attractive interactions between the protein of interest, the \" test protein, \" and other cellular macromolecules, referred to as \" crowding agents \" . 5\u221211 Of the computational work that includes attractive interactions between the test protein and crowding agents, most continue to use large unphysical spheres as crowding agents, with either single 7,12 or multiple 13 interaction sites per crowder with a fixed attractive interaction. The only work to vary the strength of the attraction between the test protein and the (spherical) crowders 7,12 focuses on protein association and not stability. Recently, efforts have been made to include both attractive interactions and excluded volume effects by studying protein stability in a more realistic cellular-like environment in silico, 9,11,14\u221219 in vitro, 6,10 and in vivo. 5,20\u221225 In addition, it has been shown that the hydrophobic nature of a chaperonin cavity can affect the stability of the enclosed protein.",

In the first approach, we used a novel method to model sampling overlap by a Bernoulli process, compared the results of two independent yeast two-hybrid interaction screens and tested the robustness of the estimate. The most stable estimate of five interactors per protein was obtained when the three most highly connected nodes in the protein interaction network were removed from the analysis (eight interactors per protein if those nodes were kept). In the second approach, we analysed a published high-confidence subset of putative interaction data obtained from multiple sources, including large-scale two-hybrid screens, complex purifications, synthetic lethals, correlated gene expression, computational predictions and previous annotations. Strikingly, the estimate was again five interactors per protein. These estimates suggest a range of approximately 16,000-26,000 different interaction pairs in the yeast, excluding homotypic interactions. We also discuss the approaches to estimating the rate of homotypic interactions.",

        "abstract": "With the booming of interactome studies, a lot of interactions can be measured in a high throughput way and large scale datasets are available. It is becoming apparent that many different types of interactions can be potential drug targets. Compared with inhibition of a single protein, inhibition of protein-protein interaction (PPI) is promising to improve the specificity with fewer adverse side-effects. Also it greatly broadens the drug target search space, which makes the drug target discovery difficult. Computational methods are highly desired to efficiently provide candidates for further experiments and hold the promise to greatly accelerate the discovery of novel drug targets. Here, we propose a machine learning method to predict PPI targets in a genomic-wide scale. Specifically, we develop a computational method, named as PrePPItar, to Predict PPIs as drug targets by uncovering the potential associations between drugs and PPIs. First, we survey the databases and manually construct a gold-standard positive dataset for drug and PPI interactions. This effort leads to a dataset with 227 associations among 63 PPIs and 113 FDA-approved drugs and allows us to build models to learn the association rules from the data. Second, we characterize drugs by profiling in chemical structure, drug ATC-code annotation, and side-effect space and represent PPI similarity by a symmetrical S-kernel based on protein amino acid sequence. Then the drugs and PPIs are correlated by Kronecker product kernel. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM), is trained to predict novel associations between drugs and PPIs. We validate our PrePPItar method on the well-established gold-standard dataset by cross-validation. We find that all chemical structure, drug ATC-code, and side-effect information are predictive for PPI target. Moreover, we can increase the PPI target prediction coverage by integrating multiple data sources. Follow-up database search and pathway analysis indicate that our new predictions are worthy of future experimental validation. In conclusion, PrePPItar can serve as a useful tool for PPI target discovery and provides a general heterogeneous data integrative framework. PrePPItar is available at http://doc.aporc.org/wiki/PrePPItar. ycwang@nwipb.cas.cn or ywang@amss.ac.cn Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Since many of these pathways are deeply involved in diseases, extensive research efforts have been undertaken towards the modulation of protein-protein interactions. At the early stage of this challenge most of the attention was drawn to the drawbacks of such a therapeutic approach. Encouragingly, however, several recent studies provided a proof of concept that protein-protein interactions are actually valuable targets and that they do have a promising therapeutic potential. This review is divided into three sections. In the first section we summarize the general features of protein-protein interfaces, focusing on the characteristics that make them different from classical protein-ligand binding sites, as well as on problematic aspects that hamper the application of classical drug discovery approaches. In the second section, we present how some of the characteristics of protein-protein interactions can be exploited fruitfully in drug design, hence focusing on the druggability of protein-protein interfaces. Methods successfully applied to protein-protein interactions will be introduced, giving special attention to the computational ones. In the third section, three case studies are presented. First, we describe protein-protein interaction modulators targeting HDM2 and the computational methods applied to identify them. Next, we present the retrospective application of the discussed approaches on the well-examined target IL-2. We conclude with a prospective application to the NHR2 protein, a target just recently validated experimentally with the aid of computational methods.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Knowing which proteins exist in a certain organism or cell type and how these proteins interact with each other are necessary for the understanding of biological processes at the whole cell level. The determination of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks has been the subject of extensive research. Despite the development of reasonably successful methods, serious technical difficulties still exist. In this paper we present DomainGA, a quantitative computational approach that uses the information about the domain-domain interactions to predict the interactions between proteins.  RESULTS: DomainGA is a multi-parameter optimization method in which the available PPI information is used to derive a quantitative scoring scheme for the domain-domain pairs. Obtained domain interaction scores are then used to predict whether a pair of proteins interacts. Using the yeast PPI data and a series of tests, we show the robustness and insensitivity of the DomainGA method to the selection of the parameter sets, score ranges, and detection rules. Our DomainGA method achieves very high explanation ratios for the positive and negative PPIs in yeast. Based on our cross-verification tests on human PPIs, comparison of the optimized scores with the structurally observed domain interactions obtained from the iPFAM database, and sensitivity and specificity analysis; we conclude that our DomainGA method shows great promise to be applicable across multiple organisms.  CONCLUSION: We envision the DomainGA as a first step of a multiple tier approach to constructing organism specific PPIs. As it is based on fundamental structural information, the DomainGA approach can be used to create potential PPIs and the accuracy of the constructed interaction template can be further improved using complementary methods. Explanation ratios obtained in the reported test case studies clearly show that the false prediction rates of the template networks constructed using the DomainGA scores are reasonably low, and the erroneous predictions can be filtered further using supplementary approaches such as those based on literature search or other prediction methods.",

        "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are crucial to biological functions. Consequently, designing drugs to control protein-protein interactions is receiving increasing attention. Protein structures can associate in different ways. Analysis of the structures of protein-protein complexes using amino acid sequence order-independent multiple structural comparison algorithms, led us to conclude that the amino acids Trp, Met, and Phe are important for protein-protein interactions. Hence, in principle, drug design targeting the Trp/Met/Phe should modulate protein functions effectively. Several clusters of the Trp/Met/Phe residues are involved in the p53 protein-protein interactions. The best example in this regard is the Phe19/Trp23 of p53, which binds to transcriptional factors and to the MDM2 protein. In the HIV related proteins, the Trp/Met/Phe residues have roles in the dimerization of the transcriptase (p51/p66) and in cell-fusion processes, including the gp120-CD4 interaction and the gp41 six-helix bundle formation. Trp/Met/Phe residues are preferred in 'normal' functional protein-protein interactions and they also appear to be exploited in amyloid formation, especially the phenylalanine. Comparison of binding propensity and amyloid formation preference reveals that apart from Lysine, Isoleucine is the least structurally conserved in protein binding sites and has a high propensity in sequences forming amyloids. Thus, this may suggest that nature tends to avoid Ile conservation in protein-protein interaction to avoid amyloid formation. In this regards, Trp/Met/Phe as well as Ile may be targeted to modulate protein-protein interaction.",

The importance of a particular protein for cell viability is directly dependent upon the number of interactions where it participates and the function it performs: the larger the number of interactions of a protein the greater its functional importance is for the cell. With the advent of genome sequencing and \"omics\" technologies it became feasible conducting large-scale searches for protein interacting partners. Unfortunately, the accuracy of such analyses has been underwhelming owing to methodological limitations and to the inherent complexity of protein interactions. In addition to these experimental approaches, many computational methods have been developed to identify protein-protein interactions by assuming that interacting proteins coevolve resulting from the coadaptation dynamics between the amino acids of their interacting faces. We review the main technological advances made in the field of interactomics and discuss the feasibility of computational methods to identify protein-protein interactions based on the estimation of coevolution. As proof-of-concept, we present a classical case study: the interactions of cell surface proteins (receptors) and their ligands. Finally, we take this discussion one step forward to include interactions between organisms and species to understand the generation of biological complexity. Development of technologies for accurate detection of protein-protein interactions may shed light on processes that go from the fine-tuning of pathways and metabolic networks to the emergence of biological complexity.",

Previous studies have attempted to find cooperative TFs based on gene expression data with gene expression profiles as a measure of similarity of gene regulations. In this paper, we use protein-protein interaction data to infer synergistic binding of cooperative TFs. Our fundamental idea is based on the assumption that genes contributing to a similar biological process are regulated under the same control mechanism. First, the protein-protein interaction networks are used to calculate the similarity of biological processes among genes. Second, we integrate this similarity and the chromatin immuno-precipitation data to identify cooperative TFs. Our computational experiments in yeast show that predictions made by our method have successfully identified eight pairs of cooperative TFs that have literature evidences but could not be identified by the previous method. Further, 12 new possible pairs have been inferred and we have examined the biological relevances for them. However, since a typical problem using protein-protein interaction data is that many false-positive data are contained, we propose a method combining various biological data to increase the prediction accuracy.",

This relationship has been put forward many times, based on a biological premise that a highly interacting protein will be more restricted in its sequence changes. However, to date several studies have voiced conflicting views on the presence or absence of such a relationship. RESULTS: Here we perform a large scale study over multiple data sets in order to demonstrate that the major reason for conflict between previous studies is the use of different but overlapping datasets. We show that lack of correlation, between evolutionary rate and number of interactions in a data set is related to the error rate. We also demonstrate that the correlation is not an artifact of the underlying distributions of evolutionary distance and interactions and is therefore likely to be biologically relevant. Further to this, we consider the claim that the dependence is due to gene expression levels and find some supporting evidence. A strong and positive correlation between the number of interactions and the age of a protein is also observed and we show this relationship is independent of expression levels. CONCLUSION: A correlation between number of interactions and evolutionary rate is observed but is dependent on the accuracy of the dataset being used. However it appears that the number of interactions a protein participates in depends more on the age of the protein than the rate at which it changes.",

For this analysis, we propose a new probabilistic model for protein-protein interactions by considering the latent knowledge of proteins. We further present an efficient learning algorithm for this model, based on an EM algorithm. Experimental results have shown that in a supervised test setting, the proposed method outperformed five other competing methods by a statistically significant factor in all cases. Using the probability parameters of a trained model, we have further shown the latent knowledge that is esProtein-protein interactions play a number of central roles in many cellular functions, including DNA replication, transcription and translation, signal transduction, and metabolic pathways. A recent increase in the number of protein-protein interactions has made predicting unknown protein-protein interactions important for the understanding of living cells. However, the protein-protein interactions experimentally obtained so far are often incomplete and contradictory and, consequently, existing computational prediction methods have integrated evidence (latent knowledge of proteins) from different and more reliable sources. Analyzing the relationships between proteins and the latent knowledge isential to predicting protein-protein interactions. Overall, our experimental results confirm that our proposed model is especially effective for analyzing protein-protein interactions from a viewpoint of the latent knowledge of proteins.",

While significant progress has been made to detect PTMs, profiling protein-protein interactions mediated by these PTMs remains a challenge. Here, we report a method that combines a photo-cross-linking strategy with stable isotope labeling in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative mass spectrometry to identify PTM-dependent protein-protein interactions. To develop and apply this approach, we focused on trimethylated lysine-4 at the histone H3 N-terminus (H3K4Me(3)), a PTM linked to actively transcribed gene promoters. Our approach identified proteins previously known to recognize this modification and MORC3 as a new protein that binds H3M4Me(3). This study indicates that our cross-linking-assisted and SILAC-based protein identification (CLASPI) approach can be used to profile protein-protein interactions mediated by PTMs, such as lysine methylation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Comprehensive exploration of protein-protein interactions is a challenging route to understand biological processes. For efficiently enlarging protein interactions annotated with residue-based binding models, we proposed a new concept \"3D-domain interolog mapping\" with a scoring system to explore all possible protein pairs between the two homolog families, derived from a known 3D-structure dimmer (template), across multiple species. Each family consists of homologous proteins which have interacting domains of the template for studying domain interface evolution of two interacting homolog families.\\n\\nRESULTS: The 3D-interologs database records the evolution of protein-protein interactions database across multiple species. Based on \"3D-domain interolog mapping\" and a new scoring function, we infer 173,294 protein-protein interactions by using 1,895 three-dimensional (3D) structure heterodimers to search the UniProt database (4,826,134 protein sequences). The 3D- interologs database comprises 15,124 species and 283,980 protein-protein interactions, including 173,294 interactions (61%) and 110,686 interactions (39%) summarized from the IntAct database. For a protein-protein interaction, the 3D-interologs database shows functional annotations (e.g. Gene Ontology), interacting domains and binding models (e.g. hydrogen-bond interactions and conserved residues). Additionally, this database provides couple-conserved residues and the interacting evolution by exploring the interologs across multiple species. Experimental results reveal that the proposed scoring function obtains good agreement for the binding affinity of 275 mutated residues from the ASEdb. The precision and recall of our method are 0.52 and 0.34, respectively, by using 563 non-redundant heterodimers to search on the Integr8 database (549 complete genomes).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can infer reliable physical protein-protein interactions and be useful for studying the protein-protein interaction evolution across multiple species. In addition, the top-ranked strategy and template interface score are able to significantly improve the accuracies of identifying protein-protein interactions in a complete genome.

The calculations are based on a molecular description capturing the detailed structure of the protein molecule using x-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance structural data. Both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions are included and the salt particles are explicitly treated allowing investigations of systems containing mono-, di-, and trivalent ions. For three different proteins-lysozyme, alpha-chymotrypsinogen, and calbindin D(9k)-we have investigated under which conditions (salt concentration, ion valency, pH, and/or solvent) the proteins are expected to aggregate via evaluation of the second virial coefficient. Good agreement is found with experimental data where available. Calbindin is investigated in more detail, and it is demonstrated how changes in solvent and/or counterion valency lead to attractive ion-ion correlation effects. For high valency counterions we have found abnormal trends in the second virial coefficient. With trivalent counterions, attraction of two negatively charged protein molecules can be favored because the repulsive term is decreased for entropic reasons due to the low number of particles present.",

We consider the primary structures of each of the five PDZ domains as a numerical sequence derived from graph-theoretic models of each of the individual amino acids in the protein sequence. Using available PDZ domain databases to obtain known targets, the graph-theoretic based numerical sequences are then used to train a neural network to recognize their targets.

Sequence analysis of the virus indicates that there is only 20% amino acid (aa) identity with known coronaviruses. Previous studies indicate that protein-protein interactions amongst various coronavirus proteins are critical for viral assembly. Yet, little sequence homology between the newly identified SARS-CoV and those previously studied coronaviruses suggests that determination of protein-protein interaction and identification of amino acid sequences, responsible for such interaction in SARS-CoV, are necessary for the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV replication and rationalization of anti-SARS therapeutic intervention. In this study, we employed mammalian two-hybrid system to investigate possible interactions between SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) and the membrane (M) proteins. We found that interaction of the N and M proteins takes place in vivo and identified that a stretch of amino acids (168-208) in the N protein may be critical for such protein-protein interactions. Importantly, the same region has been found to be required for multimerization of the N protein (He et al., 2004) suggesting this region may be crucial in maintaining correct conformation of the N protein for self-interaction and interaction with the M protein. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Packaging of large dsDNA genome is known to give rise to a highly pressurized viral capsid, but molecular interactions conducive to the formation of CMV capsid resistant to pressurization have not been described. Here, we report a cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) capsid at a 9.1 resolution and describe the molecular interactions among the similar to 3000 protein molecules in the MCMV capsid at the secondary structure level. Secondary structural elements are resolved to provide landmarks for correlating with results from sequence-based prediction and for structure-based homology modeling. The major capsid protein (MCP) upper domain (MCPud) contains alpha-helices and beta-sheets conserved with those in MCPud of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), with the largest differences identified as a \"saddle loop\" region, located at the tip of MCPud and involved in interaction with the smallest capsid protein (SCP). Interactions among the bacteriophage HK97-like floor domain of MCP, the middle domain of MCP, the hook and clamp domains of the triplex proteins (hoop and clamp domains of TRI-1 and clamp domain of TRI-2) contribute to the formation of a mature capsid. These results offer a framework for understanding how cytomegalovirus uses various secondary structural elements of its capsid proteins to build a robust capsid for packaging its large dsDNA genome inside and for attaching unique functional tegument proteins outside.",

However, the physical-chemical and structural basis of the multispecificity is not understood. In Escherichia coli, the protein BirA can self-associate to a homodimer or form a heterodimer with the biotin carboxyl carrier protein of the biotin-dependent carboxylase, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase. The first interaction results in binding of BirA to the biotin operator sequence to repress transcription initiation at the biotin biosynthetic operon and the second is a prerequisite to posttranslational biotin addition to the carrier protein for use in metabolism. A single surface on BirA is used for both interactions and previous studies indicate that, despite the structural differences between the alternative partners, the two dimerization reactions are isoenergetic. In this work, the underlying thermodynamic driving forces and the sequence determinants of the two interactions were investigated in order to elucidate the energetic and structural underpinnings of the dual specificity. Combined measurements of the temperature and salt dependencies of heterodimerization indicate a modest unfavorable enthalpy and no dependence on salt concentration. By contrast, homodimerization is characterized by a very large unfavorable enthalpy and a modest dependence on salt concentration. Measurements of the function of BirA variants with single amino acid replacements in the alternative dimerization reactions indicate that although considerable overlap in structural determinants for both interactions exists, hotspots specific for one but not the other were detected. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have shown cross-species comparison to be an effective approach in uncovering functional modules in protein networks. This has in turn driven the research for new network alignment methods with a more solid grounding in network evolution models and better scalability, to allow multiple network comparison.  Results: We develop a new framework for protein network alignment, based on reconstruction of an ancestral PPI network. The reconstruction algorithm is built upon a proposed model of protein network evolution, which takes into account phylogenetic history of the proteins and the evolution of their interactions. The application of our methodology to the PPI networks of yeast, worm and fly reveals that the most probable conserved ancestral interactions are often related to known protein complexes. By projecting the conserved ancestral interactions back onto the input networks we are able to identify the corresponding conserved protein modules in the considered species. In contrast to most of the previous methods, our algorithm is able to compare many networks simultaneously. The performed experiments demonstrate the ability of our method to uncover many functional modules with high specificity.

In addition to reviewing the computational and experimental approaches for addressing this problem, we highlight two relevant examples. The first example from our laboratory involves the structure of acyl-CoA thioesterase 7, where each domain of this two-domain protein was crystallized separately, but both yielded a non-functional assembly. The structure of the full-length protein was uncovered using a combination of complementary approaches including chemical cross-linking, analytical ultracentrifugation and mutagenesis. The second example involves the platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha-thrombin complex. Two groups reported the crystal structures of this complex, but all the interacting interfaces differed between the two structures. Our computational analysis did not fully resolve the reasons for the discrepancies, but provided interesting insights into the system.

We show that conformational changes are often important in complexes with intermediate buried surface areas of 1500 to 2000 A2, such as Cdk6INK4 interactions. Some interactions involve recognition of continuous epitopes, where there is no necessity for a tertiary structure and very often the binding conformation is induced during the process of interaction, for example phosducin binding to the betagamma subunits (Gtbetagamma) of the heterotrimeric G protein transducin.",

Existing databases, which contain experimentally verified PHI data, suffer from scarcity of reported interactions due to the technically challenging and time consuming process of experiments. This has motivated many researchers to address the problem by proposing computational approaches for analysis and prediction of PHIs. The computational methods primarily utilize sequence information, protein structure and known interactions. Classic machine learning techniques are used when there are sufficient known interactions to be used as training data. On the opposite case, transfer and multi task learning methods are preferred.

We analyze the coverage of protein domain families (defined according to CDD and Pfam databases) by structures, structural protein-protein complexes and unique protein binding sites. Structural PPI coverage of currently available protein families is about 30% without any signs of saturation in coverage growth dynamics. Given the current growth rates of domain databases and structural PPI deposition, complete domain coverage with PPIs is not expected in the near future.

In our approach, we map the relationship between interactions of proteins and their corresponding domain architectures to a generalized weighted set cover problem. The application of a greedy algorithm provides sets of domain interactions which explain the presence of protein interactions to the largest degree of specificity. Utilizing domain and protein interaction data of S. cerevisiae, MSSC enables prediction of previously unknown protein interactions, links that are well supported by a high tendency of coexpression and functional homogeneity of the corresponding proteins. Focusing on concrete examples, we show that MSSC reliably predicts protein interactions in well-studied molecular systems, such as the 26S proteasome and RNA polymerase II of S. cerevisiae. We also show that the quality of the predictions is comparable to the Maximum Likelihood Estimation while MSSC is faster.

Most of its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain shares sequence similarity with the winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) motif of OmpR-like transcriptional regulators. In the heterologous host Escherichia coli ToxR activates transcription at the V.cholerae ctx promoter in a dimerization-dependent manner, which has led to its employment as a genetic indicator for protein-protein interactions. However, although offering a broader potential application range than other prokaryotic two-hybrid systems described to date, ToxR has so far only been used to study interactions between heterologous transmembrane segments or to monitor homodimerization of C-terminal fusion partners in the periplasm and the cytoplasm of E.coli. Here we show that the ToxR-system also allows the detection of heterodimerization in both cellular compartments of E.coli. In addition, to better understand ToxR's mode of action at ctx in E.coli, we have investigated the minimal requirements for its function as a transcriptional activator.

        "abstract": "We have previously described a strategy for detecting protein protein interactions based on protein interaction assisted folding of rationally designed fragments of enzymes. We call this strategy the protein fragment complementation assay (PCA). Here we describe PCAs based on the enzyme TEM-1 beta-lactamase (EC: 3.5.2.6), which include simple colorimetric in vitro assays using the cephalosporin nitrocefin and assays in intact cells using the fluorescent substrate CCF2/AM (ref. 6). Constitutive protein protein interactions of the GCN4 leucine zippers and of apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bad, and the homodimerization of Smad3, were tested in an in vitro assay using cell lysates. With the same in vitro assay, we also demonstrate interactions of protein kinase PKB with substrate Bad. The in vitro assay is facile and amenable to high-throughput modes of screening with signal-to-background ratios in the range of 10:1 to 250:1, which is superior to other PCAs developed to date. Furthermore, we show that the in vitro assay can be used for quantitative analysis of a small molecule induced protein interaction, the rapamycin-induced interaction of FKBP and yeast FRB (the FKBP-rapamycin binding domain of TOR (target of rapamycin)). The assay reproduces the known dissociation constant and number of sites for this interaction. The combination of in vitro colorimetric and in vivo fluorescence assays of beta-lactamase in mammalian cells suggests a wide variety of sensitive and high-throughput large-scale applications, including in vitro protein array analysis of protein protein or enzyme protein interactions and in vivo applications such as clonal selection for cells expressing interacting protein partners.",

        "abstract": "The myelin basic protein (MBP) family comprises a variety of developmentally-regulated members arising from different transcription start sites, differential splicing, and post-translational modifications. The \"classic\" isoforms of MBP include the 18.5 kDa form, which predominates in adult human myelin and facilitates compaction of the mature myelin sheath in the central nervous system, thereby maintaining its structural integrity. In addition to membrane-association, the 18.5 kDa and all other classic isoforms are able to interact with a multitude of proteins, including Ca(2+)-calmodulin, actin, tubulin, and SH3-domain containing proteins, and thus may be signalling linkers during myelin development and remodelling. All proteins in this family are intrinsically disordered, creating a large effective surface to facilitate multiple protein associations, and are post-translationally modified to various degrees by methylation, phosphorylation, and deimination. We have used spectroscopic (fluorescence, CD, EPR, and NMR) approaches to study MBP's conformational adaptability. A highly-conserved central domain presents an amphipathic alpha-helix in association with a phospholipid membrane, and contains a threonyl residue that is phosphorylated by MAP-kinases. In multiple sclerosis, this segment represents a primary immunodominant epitope. This helical structure is adjacent to a proline-rich region that presents a classic SH3-ligand, comprises a second MAP-kinase phosphorylation site, and forms a polyproline type II helix. This domain of the protein is thus essential to proper positioning of a protein-interaction motif, with the local conformation and accessibility being modulated by MAP-kinases. In addition, the C-terminus of 18.5 kDa MBP has been identified by NMR spectroscopy as a Ca(2+)-calmodulin-binding site, and is of note for having a high density of post-translational modifications (protein kinase C phosphorylation, and deimination). For the most part, any classic protein isoform functions as an entropic spring that interacts in its entirety with membranes and cytoskeletal proteins, but the central and C-terminal motifs may represent molecular switches.",

Modulators of these interactions are supposed to be candidates for the development of novel drugs. Here, we describe the role of the small, polycationic and highly abundant natural polyamines that could efficiently bind to charged spots at protein interfaces as modulators of such protein-protein interactions. Using the mitochondrial cytochrome P45011A1 (CYP11A1) electron transfer system as a model, we have analyzed the capability of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine at physiologically relevant concentrations to affect the protein-protein interactions between adrenodoxin reductase (AdR), adrenodoxin (Adx), and CYP11A1. The actions of polyamines on the individual components, on their association/dissociation, on electron transfer, and on substrate conversion were examined. These studies revealed modulating effects of polyamines on distinct interactions and on the entire system in a complex way. Modulation via changed protein-protein interactions appeared plausible from docking experiments that suggested favourable high-affinity binding sites of polyamines (spermine > spermidine > putrescine) at the AdR-Adx interface. Our findings imply for the first time that small endogenous compounds are capable of interfering with distinct components of transient protein complexes and might control protein functions by modulating electrostatic protein-protein interactions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "We present an unconventional approach to antiviral drug discovery, which is used to identify potent small molecules against rabies virus. First, we conceptualized viral capsid assembly as occurring via a host-catalyzed biochemical pathway, in contrast to the classical view of capsid formation by self-assembly. This suggested opportunities for antiviral intervention by targeting previously unappreciated catalytic host proteins, which were pursued. Second, we hypothesized these host proteins to be components of heterogeneous, labile, and dynamic multi-subunit assembly machines, not easily isolated by specific target protein-focused methods. This suggested the need to identify active compounds before knowing the precise protein target. A cell-free translation-based small molecule screen was established to recreate the hypothesized interactions involving newly synthesized capsid proteins as host assembly machine substrates. Hits from the screen were validated by efficacy against infectious rabies virus in mammalian cell culture. Used as affinity ligands, advanced analogs were shown to bind a set of proteins that effectively reconstituted drug sensitivity in the cell-free screen and included a small but discrete subfraction of cellular ATP-binding cassette family E1 (ABCE1), a host protein previously found essential for HIV capsid formation. Taken together, these studies advance an alternate view of capsid formation (as a host-catalyzed biochemical pathway), a different paradigm for drug discovery (whole pathway screening without knowledge of the target), and suggest the existence of labile assembly machines that can be rendered accessible as next-generation drug targets by the means described.",

Second, DNA arrays have also evolved to explore the identification of protein-DNA interactions (PDIs), offering novel tools to control key biological processes. Such a tool is termed protein-binding DNA arrays (also protein-DNA arrays or protein-binding microarrays). These two array-based technologies share unrivaled screening capabilities and constitute valid approaches to address biological questions at the molecular level and, eventually, may be used in biomedical applications. Outstanding achievements of these technologies and their eventual application in biomedicine are discussed here, including the identification and characterization of biomarkers, screening of PPIs, detection of protein posttranslational modifications and biofluid profiling. Advantages and limitations of protein arrays, protein-binding arrays, and other proteomic technologies are also discussed here. Finally, we built a list of dedicated databases and on-line resources comprising updated information on human PPIs and PDIs that can serve as a toolbox for researchers in the field. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

Their characterisation is necessary in order to analyse these processes and for the functional identification of unknown proteins. Existing detection methods such as the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and tandem affinity purification (TAP) method provide a means to answer rapidly questions regarding protein-protein interactions, but have limitations which restrict their use to certain interaction net- works; furthermore they provide little information regarding interaction localisation at the subcellular level. The develop- ment of protein-fragment complementation assays (PCA) employing a fluorescent reporter such as a member of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) family has led to a new method of interaction detection termed Bimolecular Fluorescent Com- plementation (BiFC). These assays have become important tools for understanding protein interactions and the develop- ment of whole genome interaction maps. BiFC assays have the advantages of very low background signal coupled with rapid detection of protein-protein interactions in vivo while also providing information regarding interaction compartmen- talisation. Modified forms of the assay such as the use of combinations of spectral variants of GFP have allowed simulta- neous visualisation of multiple competing interactions in vivo. Advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed in the context of other fluorescence-based interaction monitoring techniques.",

        "abstract": "Chemically induced dimerization provides a general way to gain control over intracellular processes. Typically, FK506-binding protein (FKBP) domains are fused to a signaling domain of interest, allowing crosslinking to be initiated by addition of a bivalent FKBP ligand. In the course of protein engineering studies on human FKBP, we discovered that a single point mutation in the ligand-binding site (Phe-36 --> Met) converts the normally monomeric protein into a ligand-reversible dimer. Two-hybrid, gel filtration, analytical ultracentrifugation, and x-ray crystallographic studies show that the mutant (F(M)) forms discrete homodimers with micromolar affinity that can be completely dissociated within minutes by addition of monomeric synthetic ligands. These unexpected properties form the basis for a \"reverse dimerization\" regulatory system involving F(M) fusion proteins, in which association is the ground state and addition of ligand abolishes interactions. We have used this strategy to rapidly and reversibly aggregate fusion proteins in different cellular compartments, and to provide an off switch for transcription. Reiterated F(M) domains should be generally useful as conditional aggregation domains (CADs) to control intracellular events where rapid, reversible dissolution of interactions is required. Our results also suggest that dimerization is a latent property of the FKBP fold: the crystal structure reveals a remarkably complementary interaction between the monomer binding sites, with only subtle changes in side-chain disposition accounting for the dramatic change in quaternary structure.",

Hence, semi-automatic tools can be a valid support to increase annotation throughput. Although a handful of curation assistant tools are already available, to date, little has been done to formally evaluate their benefit to biocuration. Moreover, most curation tools are designed for specific problems. Thus, it is not easy to apply an annotation tool for multiple tasks. BioQRator is a publicly available web-based tool for annotating biomedical literature. It was designed to support general tasks, i.e. any task annotating entities and relationships. In the BioCreative IV edition, BioQRator was tailored for protein\u2013 protein interaction (PPI) annotation by migrating information from PIE the search. The results obtained from six curators showed that the precision on the top 10 documents doubled with PIE the search compared with PubMed search results. It was also observed that the annotation time for a full PPI annotation task decreased for a beginner-intermediate level annotator. This finding is encouraging because text-mining techniques were not directly involved in the full annotation task and BioQRator can be easily integrated with any text-mining resources.\\nDatabase URL: http://www.bioqrator.org/",

The strong variations of the protein-protein interaction are correlated to an attractive potential whose depth evolves with the salinity but in an opposite way in Mg salts and (NH(4))(2)SO(4). A repulsive Donnan term, corresponding to counterion dissociation, and an attractive term related to previously measured preferential salt binding parameters are discussed from well-established thermodynamics considerations and qualitatively account for the behavior of the protein-protein interactions in the various solutions. Because a solvation shell with a composition different from bulk induces protein-protein attraction, molecular adaptation to high salt would be directed to allow protein-salt interactions in order to avoid water or salt enrichment at the surface of the protein and thus preserve its solubility.",

        "abstract": "The detailed, atomistic-level understanding of molecular signaling along the tumor-suppressive Hippo signaling pathway that controls tissue homeostasis by balancing cell proliferation and death through apoptosis is a promising avenue for the discovery of novel anticancer drug targets. The activation of kinases such as Mammalian STE20-Like Protein Kinases 1 and 2 (MST1 and MST2)-modulated through both homo- and heterodimerization (e.g. interactions with Ras association domain family, RASSF, enzymes)-is a key upstream event in this pathway and remains poorly understood. On the other hand, RASSFs (such as RASSF1A or RASSF5) act as important apoptosis activators and tumor suppressors, although their exact regulatory roles are also unclear. We present recent molecular studies of signaling along the Ras-RASSF-MST pathway, which controls growth and apoptosis in eukaryotic cells, including a variety of modern molecular modeling and simulation techniques. Using recently available structural information, we discuss the complex regulatory scenario according to which RASSFs perform dual signaling functions, either preventing or promoting MST2 activation, and thus control cell apoptosis. Here, we focus on recent studies highlighting the special role being played by the specific interactions between the helical Salvador/RASSF/Hippo (SARAH) domains of MST2 and RASSF1a or RASSF5 enzymes. These studies are crucial for integrating atomistic-level mechanistic information about the structures and conformational dynamics of interacting proteins, with information available on their system-level functions in cellular signaling.",

An effective methodology to assess protein-protein interactions in living cells of interest is protein-fragment complement assay (PCA). Particularly the assays using fluorescent proteins are powerful techniques, but they do not directly track interactions because of its irreversibility or the time for chromophore formation. By contrast, PCAs using bioluminescent proteins can overcome these drawbacks. We herein describe an imaging method for real-time analysis of protein-protein interactions using multicolor luciferases with different spectral characteristics. The sensitivity and signal-to-background ratio were improved considerably by developing a carboxy-terminal fragment engineered from a click beetle luciferase. We demonstrate its utility in spatiotemporal characterization of Smad1-Smad4 and Smad2-Smad4 interactions in early developing stages of a single living Xenopus laevis embryo. We also describe the value of this method by application of specific protein-protein interactions in cell cultures and living mice. This technique supports quantitative analyses and imaging of versatile protein-protein interactions with a selective luminescence wavelength in opaque or strongly auto-fluorescent living subjects.",

Sequences within the large N-terminal domain of the receptor have been shown to be important for transactivation and protein-protein interactions; however, little is known about the structure and folding of this region. Folding of the AR transactivation domain was observed in the presence of the helix-stabilizing solvent trifluorethanol and the natural osmolyte TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide). TMAO resulted in the movement of two tryptophan residues to a less solvent-exposed environment and the formation of a protease-resistant conformation. Critically, binding to a target protein, the RAP74 subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIF, resulted in a similar resistance to protease digestion, consistent with induced folding of the receptor transactivation domain. Our current hypothesis is that the folding of the transactivation domain in response to specific protein-protein interactions creates a platform for subsequent interactions, resulting in the formation of a competent transcriptional activation complex.",

The objectives of this study were to develop a method to study these combined effects under widely varying protein-protein interaction conditions using hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) adsorbed on silica glass, poly(methyl methacrylate), and polyethylene as our model systems. In order to vary protein-protein interaction effects over a wide range, HEWL was first adsorbed to each surface type under widely varying protein solution concentrations for 2. h to saturate the surface, followed by immersion in pure buffer solution for 15. h to equilibrate the adsorbed protein layers in the absence of additionally adsorbing protein. Periodic measurements were made at selected time points of the areal density of the adsorbed protein layer as an indicator of the level of protein-protein interaction effects within the layer, and these values were then correlated with measurements of the adsorbed protein's secondary structure and bioactivity. The results from these studies indicate that protein-protein interaction effects help stabilize the structure of HEWL adsorbed on silica glass, have little influence on the structural behavior of HEWL on HDPE, and actually serve to destabilize HEWL's structure on PMMA. The bioactivity of HEWL on silica glass and HDPE was found to decrease in direct proportion to the degree of adsorption-induce protein unfolding. A direct correlation between bioactivity and the conformational state of adsorbed HEWL was less apparent on PMMA, thus suggesting that other factors influenced HEWL's bioactivity on this surface, such as the accessibility of HEWL's bioactive site being blocked by neighboring proteins or the surface itself. The developed methods provide an effective means to characterize the influence of protein-protein interaction effects and provide new molecular-level insights into how protein-protein interaction effects combine with protein-surface interaction and internal protein stability effects to influence the structure and bioactivity of adsorbed protein. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

We show that these interactions involve three distinct structural elements: (i) a previously unidentified dimerization motif in the N-terminal 100 amino acids, (ii) an alpha-helical motif spanning aa 106-162 and (iii) the C-terminal half of the molecule (aa 213-406), which is predicted to fold into an antiparallel alpha-helix bundle. The N-terminal half of dynamitin by itself is sufficient to disrupt dynactin, although very high concentrations are required. The ability of mutations in dynamitin's interaction domains to disrupt dynactin in vitro was found to correlate with their inhibitory effects when expressed in cells. We determined that the dynactin subunit, p24, governs dynamitin oligomerization by binding dynamitin along its length. This suppresses aberrant multimerization and drives formation of a protein complex that is identical to the native dynactin shoulder.",

        "abstract": "Since protein-protein interactions play a pivotal role in the communication on the molecular level in virtually every biological system and process, the search and design for modulators of such interactions is of utmost importance. In recent years many inhibitors for specific protein-protein interactions have been developed, however, in only a few cases, small and druglike molecules are able to interfere in the complex formation of proteins. On the other hand, there are several small molecules known to modulate protein-protein interactions by means of stabilizing an already assembled complex. To achieve this goal, a ligand is binding to a pocket, which is located rim-exposed at the interface of the interacting proteins, for example as the phytotoxin Fusicoccin, which stabilizes the interaction of plant H+-ATPase and 14-3-3 protein by nearly a factor of 100. To suggest alternative leads, we performed a virtual screening campaign to discover new molecules putatively stabilizing this complex. Furthermore, we screen a dataset of 198 transient recognition protein-protein complexes for cavities, which are located rim-exposed at their interfaces. We provide evidence for high similarity between such rim-exposed cavities and usual ligands accommodating active sites of enzymes. This analysis suggests that rim-exposed cavities at protein-protein interfaces are druggable binding sites. Therefore, the principle of stabilizing protein-protein interactions seems to be a promising alternative to the approach of the competitive inhibition of such interactions by small molecules.",

This method was particularly suited for assessing the high-affinity interactions that have become typical of therapeutic antibody-antigen systems. Five different commercially available antibodies that bind digoxin and a digoxin-bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugate with high affinity were rigorously evaluated by this method and by the more conventional kinetic exclusion assay (KinExA) method. Binding parameter values obtained using Gyrolab were similar to those recovered from KinExA. However, the total experimental time for 20 binding affinity titrations, with each titration covering 12 data points in duplicate, took approximately 4 h by the Gyrolab method, which reduced the experimental duration by more than 10-fold when compared with the KinExA method.

Because protein domains represent binding modules and are responsible for the interactions between proteins, computational approaches have been proposed to predict protein interactions at the domain level.

The estimated domain-domain interaction probabilities are then used to predict protein-protein interactions in S.cerevisiae. Based on a thorough comparison of sensitivity and specificity, Gene Ontology term enrichment and gene expression profiles, we have demonstrated that it may be far more informative to predict protein-protein interactions from diverse organisms than from a single organism.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY: The program for computing the protein-protein interaction probabilities and supplementary material are available at http://bioinformatics.med.yale.edu/interaction.",

Selective inhibition of these protein-protein interactions has the potential to inhibit the DNA-damage response and to sensitize cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents without affecting other functions of RPA. To discover a potent, selective inhibitor of the RPA70N protein-protein interactions to test this hypothesis, we used NMR spectroscopy to identify fragment hits that bind to two adjacent sites in the basic cleft of RPA70N. High-resolution X-ray crystal structures of RPA70N-ligand complexes revealed how these fragments bind to RPA and guided the design of linked compounds that simultaneously occupy both sites.

The present article focuses on the relationship(s) among protein-protein interactions, aggregate growth mechanisms, aggregate morphologies, and specific-ion effects for an anti-streptavidin (AS) immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1). Aggregation mechanisms of AS-IgG1 were determined as a function of pH and NaCl concentration with sodium acetate buffer and compared to previous work with sodium citrate. Aggregate size and shape were determined using a combination of laser light scattering and small-angle neutron or X-ray scattering. Protein-protein interactions were quantified in terms of the protein-protein Kirkwood-Buff integral (G22) determined from static light scattering and in terms of the protein effective charge (Zeff) measured using electrophoretic light scattering. Changing from citrate to acetate resulted in significantly different protein-protein interactions as a function of pH for low NaCl concentrations when the protein displayed positive Zeff. Overall, the results suggest that electrostatic repulsions between proteins were lessened because of preferential accumulation of citrate anions, compared to acetate anions, at the protein surface. The predominant aggregation mechanisms correlated well with G22, indicating that ion-specific effects beyond traditional mean-field descriptions of electrostatic protein-protein interactions are important for predicting qualitative shifts in protein aggregation state diagrams. Interestingly, while solution conditions dictated which mechanisms predominated, aggregate average molecular weight and size displayed a common scaling behavior across both citrate- and acetate-based systems.",

An optimum curve for the relationship between interaction energy and the number of contact sites emerged. With increasing particle densities the effect decreased. In a mixture of interacting and noninteracting particles the distance between the noninteracting particles was increased and there seemed to be much more free space around them. In thylakoids, this could lead to a more homogeneous distribution of the noninteracting but rate-limiting cytochrome bf complexes.

Among the techniques related to fluorescence microscopy, FRET is unique in providing signals sensitive to intra- and intermolecular distances in the 1-10 nm range. Because of its potency, FRET is increasingly used to visualize and quantify the dynamics of protein-protein interaction in living cells, with high spatio-temporal resolution. Here we describe the physical bases of FRET, detailing the principal methods applied: (1) measurement of signal intensity and (2) analysis of fluorescence lifetime (FLIM). Although several technical complications must be carefully considered, both methods can be applied fruitfully to specific fields. For example, FRET based on intensity detection is more suitable to follow biological phenomena at a finely tuned spatial and temporal scale. Furthermore, a specific fluorescence signal occurring close to the plasma membrane (< or = 100 nm) can be obtained using a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy system. When performing FRET experiments, care must be also taken to the method chosen for labeling interacting proteins. Two principal tools can be applied: (1) fluorophore tagged antibodies; (2) recombinant fluorescent fusion proteins. The latter method essentially takes advantage of the discovery and use of spontaneously fluorescent proteins, like the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Until now, FRET has been widely used to analyze the structural characteristics of several proteins, including integrins and ion channels. More recently, this method has been applied to clarify the interaction dynamics of these classes of membrane proteins with cytosolic signaling proteins. We report two examples in which the interaction dynamics between integrins and ion channels have been studied with FRET methods. Using fluorescent antibodies and applying FRET-FLIM, the direct interaction of beta1 integrin with the receptor for Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF-R) has been proved in living endothelial cells. A different approach, based on TIRFM measurement of the FRET intensity of fluorescently labeled recombinant proteins, suggests that a direct interaction also occurs between integrins and the ether-a-go-go-related-gene 1 (hERG1) K+ channel.",

In this article, the most commonly used approaches for studying protein-protein interactions are discussed as well as the direction in which the field of systematic characterization of protein interaction networks is progressing. We also discuss some success stories in the modulation of disease-related protein-protein interactions using small molecules.",

While two prophylactic HPV vaccines and screening programs are available, there is currently no antiviral drug for the treatment of HPV infections and associated diseases. The recent progress toward the identification and characterization of specific molecular targets for small molecule-based approaches provides prospect for the development of effective HPV antiviral compounds. Traditionally, antiviral therapies target viral enzymes. HPV encode for few proteins, however, and rely extensively on the infected cell for completion of their life cycle. This article will review the functions of the viral E1 helicase, which encodes the only enzymatic function of the virus, of the E2 regulatory protein, and of the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes in viral replication and pathogenesis. Particular emphasis will be placed on the recent progress made towards the development of novel small molecule inhibitors that specifically target and inhibit the functions of these viral proteins, as well as their interactions with other viral and/or cellular proteins.",

To date, thousands of protein-protein interactions have been identified by using the conventional two-hybrid system, but this method is limited in that the interaction must occur in the yeast nucleus. This means interactions that strictly depend upon cell-type specific processing and/or compartmentalization will not be detected. Therefore, a number of new methods have been developed recently that rely on reconstitution of biochemical function in vivo, such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), protein mass spectrometry, or evanescent wave1. Among those methods, the resonance energy transfer techniques have potential advantages for assaying protein-protein interactions in living cells and in real time.

        "abstract": "Methods for determining protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells typically rely on single reporter functions and are susceptible to variations between samples particularly in regard to levels of transcription, processing and translation. A method has been developed for determining protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells, which bypasses these variables confounding single reporter assays. The approach utilizes two units of gene expression linked to reporter functions that are interposed by a deactivation-activation unit in such a way that the downstream expression unit is switched off. Hence upstream expression occurs regardless of protein-protein interaction, leading to the production of the upstream reporter. In the event of protein-protein interactions, the downstream expression unit is switched on leading to dual reporter read outs. Thus, the ratio of the two reporter activities provides a measure to determine the efficiency of protein-protein interactions. To access the system we screened a mutant of BMPR2 where the interaction between BMPR-II and LIMK is abrogated. BMPR-II is a type II receptor of the TGFbeta superfamily and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of familial pulmonary arterial hypertension. This system has potential for high-throughput screening of libraries (peptide, chemical, cDNA, etc.) to isolate agents that are capable of interfering with highly selective protein-protein interaction.",

These water molecules reduce the surface complementarity of highly favorable short-range interactions, and therefore can play an important role in mediating protein-protein interactions. Here we examine this quasi-chemical view of hydration by predicting the interaction part of B(2) and comparing our results with those derived from light-scattering measurements of B(2) for staphylococcal nuclease, lysozyme, and chymotrypsinogen at 25 degrees C as a function of solution pH and ionic strength. We find that short-range protein interactions are influenced by water molecules strongly associated with a relatively small fraction of the protein surface. However, the effect of these strongly associated water molecules on the surface complementarity of short-range protein interactions is significant, and must be taken into account for an accurate description of B(2). We also observe remarkably similar hydration behavior for these proteins despite substantial differences in their three-dimensional structures and spatial charge distributions, suggesting a general characterization of protein hydration.",

        "abstract": "Protein interactions are the basic building blocks for assembly of pathways and networks. Almost any biologically meaningful functionality (for instance, linear signaling pathways, chains of metabolic reactions, transcription factor dimmers, protein complexes of transcriptosome, gene-disease associations) can be represented as a combination of binary relationships between \"network objects\" (genes, proteins, RNA species, bioactive compounds). Naturally, the assembled pathways and networks are only as good as their \"weakest\" link (i.e., a wrongly assigned interaction), and the errors multiply in multi-step pathways. Therefore, the utility of \"systems biology\" is fundamentally dependent on quality and relevance of protein interactions. The second important parameter is the sheer number of interactions assembled in the database. One needs a \"critical mass\" of species-specific interactions in order to build cohesive networks for a gene list, not a constellation of non-connected proteins and protein pairs. The third issue is semantic consistency between interactions of different types. Transient physical signal transduction interactions, reactions of endogenous metabolism, transcription factor-promoter binding, and kinetic drug-target interactions are all very different in nature. Yet, they have to fit well into one database format and be consistent in order to be useful in reconstruction of cellular processes.High-quality protein interactions are available in peer-reviewed \"small experiment\" literature and, to a much smaller extent, patents. However, it is very challenging to find the interactions, annotate with searchable (and computable) parameters, catalogue in the database format in computer readable form, and assemble into a database. There are hundreds of thousands of mammalian interactions scattered in tens of thousands of papers in a few thousands of scientific journals. There are no widely used standards for reporting the interactions in scientific texts and, therefore, text-mining tools have only limited applicability. In order to generate a meaningful database of protein interactions, one needs a well-developed technology of manual curation, equipped with computational solutions, managerial procedures, quality control, and users' feedback. Here we describe our ever-evolving annotation approach, the important annotation issues and our solutions, and the mammalian protein interactions database MetaBase which we have been working on for over 8 years.",

GFP was fused as a fluorescent indicator to the C-terminus of a cyclophilin (rDmCyp20) from Drosophila melanogaster. Cyclophilins (Cyps) belong to the ubiquitously distributed enzyme family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPlases) and are well known as cellular targets of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). The PPlase activity of the GFP fused rDmCyp20 as well as the high affinity to CsA remain intact. Using native gel electrophoresis and ACE mobility-shift assays, it was demonstrated that the known moderate affinity of Cyp20 to the capsid protein p24 of HIV-1 was detectable in the case of rDmCyp20 fused to the fluorescent tag. For the p24 / rDmCyp20-GFP binding an ACE method was established which allowed to determine a dissociation constant of Kd = 20+/-1.5 x 10(-6) M. This result was verified by size-exclusion chromatography and is in good agreement with published data for the nonfused protein. Moreover the fusion protein was utilized to screen rDmCyp20-protein interactions by capillary electrophoresis in biological matrices. A putative ligand of rDmCyp20 in crude extracts of embryonic D. melanogaster was discovered by mobility-shift assays using native gel electrophoresis with fluorescence imaging and ACE with laser-induced fluorescence detection. The approach seems applicable to a wide range of proteins and offers new opportunities to screen for moderate protein-protein interactions in biological samples.",

        "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are governed by the change in free energy upon binding, \u0394G = \u0394H \u2212 T\u0394S. These interactions are often marginally stable, so one must examine the balance between the change in enthalpy, \u0394H, and the change in entropy, \u0394S, when investigating known complexes, characterizing the effects of mutations, or designing optimized variants. To perform a large-scale study into the contribution of conformational entropy to binding free energy, we developed a technique called GOBLIN (Graphical mOdel for BiomoLecular INteractions) that performs physics-based free energy calculations for protein-protein complexes under both side-chain and backbone flexibility. GOBLIN uses a probabilistic graphical model that exploits conditional independencies in the Boltzmann distribution and employs variational inference techniques that approximate the free energy of binding in only a few minutes. We examined the role of conformational entropy on a benchmark set of more than 700 mutants in eight large, well-studied complexes. Our findings suggest that conformational entropy is important in protein-protein interactions\u2014the root mean square error (RMSE) between calculated and experimentally measured \u0394\u0394Gs decreases by 12% when explicit entropic contributions were incorporated. GOBLIN models all atoms of the protein complex and detects changes to the binding entropy along the interface as well as positions distal to the binding interface. Our results also suggest that a variational approach to entropy calculations may be quantitatively more accurate than the knowledge-based approaches used by the well-known programs FOLDX and ROSETTA\u2014GOBLIN's RMSEs are 10 and 36% lower than these programs, respectively.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For understanding cellular systems and biological networks, it is important to analyze functions and interactions of proteins and domains. Many methods for predicting protein-protein interactions have been developed. It is known that mutual information between residues at interacting sites can be higher than that at non-interacting sites. It is based on the thought that amino acid residues at interacting sites have coevolved with those at the corresponding residues in the partner proteins. Several studies have shown that such mutual information is useful for identifying contact residues in interacting proteins. RESULTS: We propose novel methods using conditional random fields for predicting protein-protein interactions. We focus on the mutual information between residues, and combine it with conditional random fields. In the methods, protein-protein interactions are modeled using domain-domain interactions. We perform computational experiments using protein-protein interaction datasets for several organisms, and calculate AUC (Area Under ROC Curve) score. The results suggest that our proposed methods with and without mutual information outperform EM (Expectation Maximization) method proposed by Deng et al., which is one of the best predictors based on domain-domain interactions. CONCLUSIONS: We propose novel methods using conditional random fields with and without mutual information between domains. Our methods based on domain-domain interactions are useful for predicting protein-protein interactions.",

        "abstract": "The identification and quantitative analysis of protein-protein interactions are essential to the functional characterization of proteins in the post-proteomics era. The methods currently available are generally time-consuming, technically complicated, insensitive and/or semi-quantitative. The lack of simple, sensitive approaches to precisely quantify protein-protein interactions still prevents our understanding of the functions of many proteins. Here, we develop a novel dual luciferase reporter pull-down assay by combining a biotinylated Firefly luciferase pull-down assay with a dual luciferase reporter assay. The biotinylated Firefly luciferase-tagged protein enables rapid and efficient isolation of a putative Renilla luciferase-tagged binding protein from a relatively small amount of sample. Both of these proteins can be quantitatively detected using the dual luciferase reporter assay system. Protein-protein interactions, including Fos-Jun located in the nucleus; MAVS-TRAF3 in cytoplasm; inducible IRF3 dimerization; viral protein-regulated interactions, such as MAVS-MAVS and MAVS-TRAF3; IRF3 dimerization; and protein interaction domain mapping, are studied using this novel assay system. Herein, we demonstrate that this dual luciferase reporter pull-down assay enables the quantification of the relative amounts of interacting proteins that bind to streptavidin-coupled beads for protein purification. This study provides a simple, rapid, sensitive, and efficient approach to identify and quantify relative protein-protein interactions. Importantly, the dual luciferase reporter pull-down method will facilitate the functional determination of proteins.",

Pink when in a homogeneous suspension, the solution turns blue-gray when particles are drawn close together, for example, when immobilized proteins specifically interact with each other. However, the nanoparticle stability, size, and method of protein attachment contribute to the unreliable outcome of current assays. To overcome these hurdles, we developed novel and reliable methods first to synthesize homogenous particles of optimal diameter and second to apply a heterologous NTA-Ni-SAM coating for controlled orientation and optimal presentation of histidine-tagged proteins. Both methods were proven to greatly enhance assay sensitivity and specificity by increasing the signal and minimizing the nonspecific binding. Our assay reproducibly detected known protein-protein interactions and unambiguously identified small molecules that inhibited them.

However, few of these methods allow the detection of dynamic and real-time protein-protein interactions in bacteria. Here we describe a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) system based on the bacterial luciferase LuxAB. We found that enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) accepts the emission from LuxAB and emits yellow fluorescence. Importantly, BRET occurred when LuxAB and eYFP were fused, respectively, to the interacting protein pair FlgM and FliA. Furthermore, we observed sirolimus (i.e., rapamycin)-inducible interactions between FRB and FKBP12 and a dose-dependent abolishment of such interactions by FK506, the ligand of FKBP12. Using this system, we showed that osmotic stress or low pH efficiently induced multimerization of the regulatory protein OmpR and that the multimerization induced by low pH can be reversed by a neutralizing agent, further indicating the usefulness of this system in the measurement of dynamic interactions. This method can be adapted to analyze dynamic protein-protein interactions and the importance of such interactions in bacterial processes such as development and pathogenicity.\\n\\nIMPORTANCE: Real-time measurement of protein-protein interactions in prokaryotes is highly desirable for determining the roles of protein complex in the development or virulence of bacteria, but methods that allow such measurement are not available. Here we describe the development of a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technology that meets this need. The use of endogenous excitation light in this strategy circumvents the requirement for the sophisticated instrument demanded by standard fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Furthermore, because the LuxAB substrate decanal is membrane permeable, the assay can be performed without lysing the bacterial cells, thus allowing the detection of protein-protein interactions in live bacterial cells. This BRET system added another useful tool to address important questions in microbiological studies.",

An enzymatically inactive HtrA1 point mutant, HtrA1-S328A, was generated and used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system. Fifty-two plasmids were isolated from primary positive yeast clones. Subsequent sequencing and BLAST analysis revealed cDNAs encoding for 13 different proteins. These putative binding partners of HtrA1 appeared to be a) components of extracellular matrix; b) factors related to signal pathways, and c) unknown proteins. Among the 13 positive clones identified and reported here, it is worth of note that the interaction of HtrA1 with tubulin and collagen (extracellular matrix proteins) and with tuberin (cytoplasmic protein) is confirmed by other studies, and this further supports previous findings in which HtrA1 can be found active as an intracytoplasmic protein or as secreted protein as well.",

To facilitate protein-protein interaction studies in plants, we adopted the luciferase complementation imaging assay. The amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal halves of the firefly luciferase reconstitute active luciferase enzyme only when fused to two interacting proteins, and that can be visualized with a low-light imaging system. A series of plasmid constructs were made to enable the transient expression of fusion proteins or generation of stable transgenic plants. We tested nine pairs of proteins known to interact in plants, including Pseudomonas syringae bacterial effector proteins and their protein targets in the plant, proteins of the SKP1-Cullin-F-box protein E3 ligase complex, the HSP90 chaperone complex, components of disease resistance protein complex, and transcription factors. In each case, strong luciferase complementation was observed for positive interactions.

Recently, a variety of co-evolution-based methods have been investigated toward this goal. In this study, we introduced a partial correlation coefficient as a new measure for the degree of co-evolution between proteins, and proposed its use to predict protein-protein interactions. RESULTS: The accuracy of the prediction by the proposed method was compared with those of the original mirror tree method and the projection method previously developed by our group. We found that the partial correlation coefficient effectively reduces the number of false positives, as compared with other methods, although the number of false negatives increased in the prediction by the partial correlation coefficient.

All three proteins are functionally related to the spliceosome and involved in pre-mRNA splicing activities. The spliceosome is a dynamic ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing of intronic regions, and is composed of five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and \u03bc140 proteins. TFIP11 appears to play a role in spliceosome disassembly allowing for the release of the bound lariat-intron. The roles of CCNL1 and EWSR1 in the spliceosome are poorly understood. Using fluorescently-tagged proteins and confocal microscopy we show that TFIP11, CCNL1 and EWSR1 frequently co-localize to speckled nuclear domains. These data would suggest that all three proteins participate in a common cellular activity related to RNA splicing events.",

However, the mechanisms by which viral proteins interact with such large numbers of factors remain unknown. Cellular proteins that interact with multiple, distinct partners often do so through short sequences known as molecular recognition features (MoRFs) embedded within intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). In this study, we report the first evidence that MoRFs in viral proteins play a similar role in targeting the host cell. Using a combination of evolutionary modeling, protein-protein interaction analyses and forward genetic screening, we systematically investigated two computationally predicted MoRFs within the N-terminal IDR of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) Core protein. Sequence analysis of the MoRFs showed their conservation across all HCV genotypes and the canine and equine Hepaciviruses. Phylogenetic modeling indicated that the Core MoRFs are under stronger purifying selection than the surrounding sequence, suggesting that these modules have a biological function. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified three cellular binding partners for each HCV Core MoRF, including two previously characterized cellular targets of HCV Core (DDX3X and NPM1). Random and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the predicted MoRF regions were required for binding to the cellular proteins, but that different residues within each MoRF were critical for binding to different partners. This study demonstrated that viruses may use intrinsic disorder to target multiple cellular proteins with the same amino acid sequence and provides a framework for characterizing the binding partners of other disordered regions in viral and cellular proteomes.",

Because structural elucidation and computational analysis have revealed the importance of hot spot residues in stabilizing these interactions, there have been on-going efforts to develop drugs which bind the hot spots and out-compete the native protein partners. The question arises as to what are the key 'druggable' properties of hot spots in protein-protein interactions and whether these mimic the general hot spot definition. Identification of orthosteric (at the protein-protein interaction site) and allosteric (elsewhere) druggable hot spots is expected to help in discovering compounds that can more effectively modulate protein-protein interactions. For example, are there any other significant features beyond their location in pockets in the interface? The interactions of protein-protein hot spots are coupled with conformational dynamics of protein complexes. Currently increasing efforts focus on the allosteric drug discovery. Allosteric drugs bind away from the native binding site and can modulate the native interactions. We propose that identification of allosteric hot spots could similarly help in more effective allosteric drug discovery. While detection of allosteric hot spots is challenging, targeting drugs to these residues has the potential of greatly increasing the hot spot and protein druggability.",

Guided by results obtained on exactly solvable model problems, we transform the problem of diffusion in a potential into free diffusion in the presence of an absorbing zone spanning the entrance to the binding funnel. The free diffusion problem is solved using a recently derived analytic expression for the rate of association of asymmetrically oriented molecules. Despite the required high steric specificity and the absence of long-range attractive interactions, the computed rates are typically on the order of 10(4)-10(6) M(-1) sec(-1), several orders of magnitude higher than rates obtained using a purely probabilistic model in which the association rate for free diffusion of uniformly reactive molecules is multiplied by the probability of a correct alignment of the two partners in a random collision. As the association rates of many protein-protein complexes are also in the 10(5)-10(6) M(-1) sec(-1) range, our results suggest that free energy barriers arising from desolvation and/or side-chain freezing during complex formation or increased ruggedness within the binding funnel, which are completely neglected in our simple diffusional model, do not contribute significantly to the dynamics of protein-protein association. The transparent physical interpretation of our approach that computes association rates directly from the size and geometry of protein-protein binding funnels makes it a useful complement to Brownian dynamics simulations.",

According to the histone code theory, PTMs recruit regulatory proteins or block their access to chromatin. Here, we report a general strategy for simultaneous analysis of both of these effects based on a SILAC MS scheme. We applied this approach for studying the biochemical role of phosphorylated S10 of histone H3. Differential pull-down experiments with H3-tails synthesized from l- and d-amino acids uncovered that histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) and retinoblastoma-binding protein 7 (RBBP7) are part of the protein network, which interacts with the unmodified H3-tail. An additional H3-derived bait containing the nonhydrolyzable phospho-serine mimic phosphonomethylen-alanine (Pma) at S10 recruited several isoforms of the 14-3-3 family and blocked the recruitment of HAT1 and RBBP7 to the unmodified H3-tail. Our observations provide new insights into the many functions of H3S10 phosphorylation. In addition, the outlined methodology is generally applicable for studying specific binding partners of unmodified histone tails.",

        "abstract": "The human lens crystallin gene CRYGC T5P is associated with Coppock-like cataract and has a phenotype of a dust-like opacity of the fetal lens nucleus and deep cortical region. Previous in vitro mutation studies indicate that the protein has changed conformation, solubility, and stability, which may make it susceptible to aggregation, as seen in cataractous lens and cell culture expression. To investigate the mechanisms leading to these events, we studied protein-protein interactions using confocal fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. The method detects protein-protein interactions in the natural environment of living cells. Crystallin genes (CRYGC T5P, CRYGC, and CRYAA) were fused to either the green fluorescence protein (GFP) or red fluorescence protein (DsRED or RFP) vector. Each of the following GFP-RFP (donor-acceptor) plasmid pairs was cotransfected into HeLa cells: gammaC-gammaC, gammaC-gammaCT5P, gammaCT5P-gammaCT5P, alphaA-gammaC, and alphaA-gammaCT5P. After culture, confocal fluorescence cell images were taken. Protein-protein interactions in the form of net FRET were evaluated. The confocal fluorescence images show that cells expressing T5P gammaC-crystallin contain many protein aggregates, but cells co-expressing with either gammaC- or alphaA-crystallin reduce the aggregation considerably. FRET determination indicates that gammaCT5P-gammaCT5P shows less protein-protein interaction than either gammaC-gammaC or gammaC-gammaCT5P. Cotransfection with alphaA-crystallin (alphaA-gammaC or alphaA-T5PgammaC) increases nFRET compared with gammaC-gammaC or gammaC-T5PgammaC. Our results demonstrate that T5P gammaC-crystallin shows more protein aggregates and less protein-protein interaction than WT gammaC-crystallin. Chaperone alphaA-crystallin can rescue T5P gammaC-crystallin from aggregation through increased protein interaction. The formation of congenital cataract may be due to reduced protein-protein interactions and increased aggregation from an insufficient amount of alpha-crystallin for protection.",

Interaction between the ligand with the receptor subunits was probed by a combination of surface-sensitive spectroscopic detection techniques. Label-free detection by reflectance interferometry is used for following assembly of the membrane and tethering of the receptor subunits in quantitative terms. Total internal reflection spectroscopy is used for monitoring ligand binding to the membrane-anchored receptor, for monitoring ligand-receptor interactions by FRET and for monitoring ligand-exchange kinetics. These assays can be used for determining the affinities and stabilities of ligand-receptor complexes in plane of the membrane.

A limitation of this approach is that the protein interaction is studied in isolation, without regard to the many competing protein interactions that can occur within cells. This unit presents a light microscopy approach for detecting protein-protein interactions in vivo based on the measurement of FRET using the multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) technique.

The concept is demonstrated with binary and ternary complexes between the chi, psi and gamma subunits of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III: nascent, selectively 15N-labeled psi produced in the presence of chi resulted in a soluble, correctly folded chi-psi complex, whereas psi alone precipitated irrespective of whether gamma was present or not. The 15N-HSQC spectra showed that the N-terminal segment of psi is mobile in the chi-psi complex, yet important for its binding to gamma. The sample preparation was greatly enhanced by an autoinduction strategy, where the T7 RNA polymerase needed for transcription of a gene in a T7-promoter vector was produced in situ.",

Two important signaling components in the network are the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade and elevation of calcium concentrations, which transmit signals of hormones, growth factors and other ligands. Each of these components is known to independently regulate a large number of targets in various cellular organelles. The cooperation between them, however, seems to modulate the fate of their individual signals, and accordingly, their regulated processes. We have recently shown that calcium modulates the protein interaction properties of ERKs, which further affect the subcellular localization of the latter and as a consequence also the distribution of their targets. These effects of calcium are important in determining the specificity of the ERK cascade, and thereby, play important roles in the regulation of ERK-dependent cellular processes. Our findings, as well as their possible implications, are further discussed in this addendum.",

        "abstract": "Nck is a ubiquitously expressed, primarily cytosolic adapter protein consisting of one SH2 domain and three SH3 domains. It links receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases to actin cytoskeleton reorganizing proteins. In T lymphocytes, Nck is a crucial component of signaling pathways for T cell activation and effector function. It recruits actin remodeling proteins to T cell receptor (TCR)-associated activation clusters and thereby initiates changes in cell polarity and morphology. Moreover, Nck is crucial for the TCR-induced mobilization of secretory vesicles to the cytotoxic immunological synapse. To identify the interactome of Nck in human T cells, we performed a systematic screen for interaction partners in untreated or pervanadate-treated cells. We used GST fusion proteins containing full length Nck, the combined SH3 domains or the individual SH3 and SH2 domains to precipitate putative Nck interactors from cellular lysates. Protein bands were excised from gels, processed by tryptic in-gel digestion and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Using this approach, we confirmed previously established interactions (e.g., with Slp76, CD3 epsilon, WASP, and WIPF1) and identified several novel putative Nck-binding proteins. We subsequently verified the SH2 domain binding to the actin-binding protein HIP55 and to FYB/ADAP, and the SH3-mediated binding to the nuclear proteins SFPQ/NONO. Using laser scanning microscopy, we provide new evidence for a nuclear localization of Nck in human T cells. Our data highlight the fundamental role of Nck in the TCR-to-cytoskeleton crosstalk and point to yet unknown nuclear functions of Nck also in T lymphocytes.",

Here, we have characterized the pH and ionic strength dependence of protein-protein interactions in terms of an interaction parameter kD obtained from dynamic light scattering and the osmotic second virial coefficient B22 measured by static light scattering. A simplified protein-protein interaction model based on a Baxter adhesive potential and an electric double layer force is used to separate out the contributions of longer-ranged electrostatic interactions from short-ranged attractive forces. The ionic strength dependence of protein-protein interactions for solutions at pH 6.5 and below can be accurately captured using a Deryaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) potential to describe the double layer forces. In solutions at pH 9, attractive electrostatics occur over the ionic strength range of 5-275 mM. At intermediate pH values (7.25 to 8.5), there is a crossover effect characterized by a nonmonotonic ionic strength dependence of protein-protein interactions, which can be rationalized by the competing effects of long-ranged repulsive double layer forces at low ionic strength and a shorter ranged electrostatic attraction, which dominates above a critical ionic strength. The change of interactions from repulsive to attractive indicates a concomitant change in the angular dependence of protein-protein interaction from isotropic to anisotropic. In the second part of the paper, we show how the Baxter adhesive potential can be used to predict values of kD from fitting to B22 measurements, thus providing a molecular basis for the linear correlation between the two protein-protein interaction parameters.",

Recent studies have investigated such processes by explicitly modelling the diffusion and interactions of individual molecules. In these approaches, two entities are considered to have interacted if they come within a set cutoff distance of each other. RESULTS: In this study, a new model of bimolecular interactions is presented that uses a simple, probability-based description of the reaction process. This description is well-suited to simulations on timescales relevant to biological systems (from seconds to hours), and provides an alternative to the previous description given by Smoluchowski. In the present approach (TFB) the diffusion process is explicitly taken into account in generating the probability that two freely diffusing chemical entities will interact within a given time interval. It is compared to the Smoluchowski method, as modified by Andrews and Bray (AB). CONCLUSION: When implemented, the AB & TFB methods give equivalent results in a variety of situations relevant to biology. Overall, the Smoluchowski method as modified by Andrews and Bray emerges as the most simple, robust and efficient method for simulating biological diffusion-reaction processes currently available.",

        "abstract": "Proteins often bind other proteins in more than one way. Thus alternative binding modes is an essential feature of protein interactions. Such binding modes may be detected by X-ray crystallography and thus reflected in Protein Data Bank. The alternative binding is often observed not for the protein itself but for its structural homolog. The results of this study based on the analysis of a comprehensive set of co-crystallized protein-protein complexes show that the alternative binding modes generally do not overlap, but are spatially separated. This effect is based on molecular recognition characteristics of the protein structures. The results are also in excellent agreement with the intermolecular energy funnel size estimates obtained previously by an independent methodology. The results provide an important insight into the principles of protein association, as well as potential guidelines for modeling of protein complexes and the design of protein interfaces.",

        "abstract": "HIV-1 integrase (IN) is one of the key enzymes in the viral replication cycle. It mediates the integration of viral cDNA into the host cell genome. IN activity requires interactions with several viral and cellular proteins, as well as IN oligomerization. Inhibition of IN is an important target for the development of anti-HIV therapies, but there is currently only one anti-HIV drug used in the clinic that targets IN. Several other small-molecule anti-IN drug leads are either undergoing clinical trials or in earlier stages of development. These molecules specifically inhibit one of the IN-mediated reactions necessary for successful integration. However, small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions are difficult to develop. In this review, we focus on peptides that inhibit IN. Peptides have advantages over small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions: they can mimic the structures of the binding domains within proteins, and are large enough to competitively inhibit protein-protein interactions. The development of peptides that bind IN and inhibit its protein-protein interactions will increase our understanding of the IN mode of action, and lead to the development of new drug leads, such as small molecules derived from these peptides, for better anti-HIV therapy.",

In certain NRs, including the androgen receptor (AR), ligand binding to the carboxy-terminal domain (LBD) regulates transcriptional activation functions in the LBD and amino-terminal domain (NTD). The basis for NTD-LBD communication is unknown but may involve NTD-LBD interactions either within a single receptor or between different members of an AR dimer. Here, measurement of FRET between fluorophores attached to the NTD and LBD of the AR established that agonist binding initiated an intramolecular NTD-LBD interaction in the nucleus and cytoplasm. This intramolecular folding was followed by AR self-association, which occurred preferentially in the nucleus. Rapid, ligand-induced intramolecular folding and delayed association also were observed for estrogen receptor-alpha but not for peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma2. An antagonist ligand, hydroxyflutamide, blocked the NTD-LBD association within AR. NTD-LBD association also closely correlated with the transcriptional activation by heterologous ligands of AR mutants isolated from hormone-refractory prostate tumors. Intramolecular folding, but not AR-AR affinity, was disrupted by mutation of an alpha-helical ((23)FQNLF(27)) motif in the AR NTD previously described to interact with the AR LBD in vitro. This work establishes an intramolecular NTD-LBD conformational change as an initial component of ligand-regulated NR function.",

Biliverdin reductase (BVR) then catalyzes conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin.Wedescribe mutagenesis combined with kinetic, spectroscopic (fluorescence and NMR), surface plasmon resonance, cross-linking, gel filtration, and analytical ultracentrifugation studies aimed at evaluating interactions of HO-2 with CPR and BVR. Based on these results, we propose a model in which HO-2 and CPR form a dynamic ensemble of complex(es) that precede formation of the productive electron transfer complex. The 1H-15N TROSYNMR spectrum of HO-2 reveals specific residues, including Leu-201, near the heme face of HO-2 that are affected by the addition of CPR, implicating these residues at the HO/CPR interface. Alanine substitutions at HO-2 residues Leu-201 and Lys-169 cause a respective 3- and 22-fold increase in Km values for CPR, consistent with a role for these residues in CPR binding. Sedimentation velocity experiments confirm the transient nature of the HO-2?CPR complex (Kd ? 15.1 ? M). Our results also indicate that HO-2 and BVR form a very weak complex that is only captured by cross-linking. For example, under conditions where CPR affects the 1H-15N TROSY NMR spectrum of HO-2, BVR has no effect. Fluorescence quenching experiments also suggest that BVR binds HO-2 weakly, if at all, and that the previously reported high affinity of BVR for HO is artifactual, resulting from the effects of free heme (dissociated from HO) on BVR fluorescence.",

That elements of these two populous signalling pathways must cross-talk to achieve proper signalling in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and metabolism has been anticipated, but the evolution of our thinking and the analysis of such cross-talk have lagged behind the ever-expanding troupe of players and the recognition of multivalency as the rule, rather than the exception, in signalling biology. New insights have been provided by Kreuzer et al. in this issue of the Biochemical Journal, in which insulin is shown to provoke recruitment of Galpha(i)-proteins to insulin-receptor-based complexes that can regulate the gain of insulin-receptor-catalysed autophosphorylation, a proximal point in the insulin-sensitive cascade of signalling. Understanding the convergence and cross-talk of signals from the receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptor pathways in physical, spatial and temporal contexts will remain a major challenge of cell biology.",

We have employed an optimized GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid system to dissect the photoreceptor cilium-associated protein complex around the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) in mammalian photoreceptors.

The number of protein modules that are known to recognise these membrane lipids is rapidly increasing. Pleckstrin homology domains, FYVE domains, PX domains, ENTH domains, CALM domains, PDZ domains, PTB domains and FERM domains are all inositide-recognition modules. The latest additions to this list are members of the clathrin adaptor protein and arrestin families. Initially, inositol lipids were believed to recruit signaling molecules to specific membrane compartments, but many of the domains clearly do not possess high enough affinity to act alone as localisation signals. Another important notion is that some (and probably most) of these protein modules also have protein binding partners, and their protein- and lipid-binding activities might influence one another through allosteric mechanisms. Comparison of the structural features of these domains not only reveals a high degree of conservation of their lipid interaction sites but also highlights their evolutionary link to protein modules known for protein-protein interactions. Protein-protein interactions involving lipid-binding domains could serve as the basis for phosphoinositide-induced conformational regulation of target proteins at biological membranes. Therefore, these modules function as crucially important signal integrators, which explains their involvement in a broad range of regulatory functions in eukaryotic cells.",

By taking advantage of the modular nature of many regulatory proteins, we attempted to simplify protein-protein interactions to the corresponding domain-ligand recognition and employed peptide arrays to identify such binding events. A group of 12 Src homology (SH) 3 domains from eight human proteins (Swiss-Prot ID: SRC, PLCG1, P85A, NCK1, GRB2, FYN, CRK) were used to screen a peptide target array composed of 1536 potential ligands, which led to the identification of 921 binary interactions between these proteins and 284 targets. To assess the efficiency of the peptide array target screening (PATS) method in identifying authentic protein-protein interactions, we examined a set of interactions mediated by the PLCgamma1 SH3 domain by coimmunoprecipitation and/or affinity pull-downs using full-length proteins and achieved a 75% success rate. Furthermore, we characterized a novel interaction between PLCgamma1 and hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) identified by PATS and demonstrated that the PLCgamma1 SH3 domain negatively regulated HPK1 kinase activity. Compared to protein interactions listed in the online predicted human interaction protein database (OPHID), the majority of interactions identified by PATS are novel, suggesting that, when extended to the large number of peptide interaction domains encoded by the human genome, PATS should aid in the mapping of the human interactome.",

In multiple in vitro systems, P450-P450 interactions also have been observed, resulting in alterations in enzymatic activity. The current work investigated the effects and mechanisms of interaction between CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in a reconstituted system. CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of S-naproxen and S-flurbiprofen was inhibited up to 80% by coincubation with CYP3A4, although K(m) values were unchanged. Increasing CYP3A4 concentrations increased the degree of inhibition, whereas increasing CPR concentrations resulted in less inhibition. Addition of b5 only marginally affected the magnitude of inhibition. In contrast, CYP2C9 did not alter the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of testosterone. The potential role of the hydrophobic N terminus on these interactions was assessed by incubating truncated CYP2C9 with full-length CYP3A4, and vice versa. In both cases, the inhibition was fully abolished, indicating an important role for hydrophobic forces in CYP2C9-CYP3A4 interactions. Finally, a CYP2C9/CYP3A4 heteromer complex was isolated by coimmunoprecipitation techniques, confirming the physical interaction of the proteins. These results show that the N-terminal membrane binding domains of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 are involved in heteromer complex formation and that at least one consequence is a reduction in CYP2C9 activity.",

Coimmunoprecipitation studies show that Kvbeta1.1 interacts with Shaker channel members Kvalpha1.2 and 1.3, both of which colocalize with beta to the cochlear ganglion cells. Additionally, coimmunoprecipitation studies show that Kvalpha1.2 and 1.3 interact with each other, suggesting that these ion channels are formed by heteromultimers. In comparison, Kvbeta did not coprecipitate with a member of the Shal subfamily.

However, the preparation of antibodies in this method involves the injection of antigen into mammals, and requires the use of the expensive protein A-Sepharose 4B. Molecular imprinting polymer can compensate for these deficiencies. In this paper, a new strategy for studying protein interactions is reported; this method is based on the use of protein-imprinted polymers (PIPs). PIP is a proper substitute for antibody. We designed and synthesized assistant recognition polymer chains (ARPCs), which were limited length polymer chains with randomly distributed recognition and immobilizing sites. The template protein was selectively assembled with ARPCs. The assemblies were adsorbed by macroporous microspheres, and were immobilized by cross-linking polymerization. After removing the templates, the two kinds of synthesized PIPs were used to adsorb natural BiP or FKBP23 from ER extract; both showed high selectivity. Furthermore, we investigated the binding specificity of BiP to FKBP23, using synthesized PIPs.

Consequently, targeting of such pathways is considered an attractive therapeutic approach. Inhibition of the Wnt signaling cascade proves to be complicated, in part, due to the lack of druggable pathway components. The central hub in Wnt signaling is the protein ??-catenin, which is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions. In general, the inhibition of protein-protein interactions is challenging in particular with binding interfaces lacking pronounced hydrophobic pockets.

To date, identifying small-molecules that selectively disrupt these interactions has proven particularly challenging for virtual screening tools, since these have typically been optimized to perform well on more \"traditional\" drug discovery targets. Here, we test the performance of the Rosetta energy function for identifying compounds that inhibit protein interactions, when these active compounds have been hidden amongst pools of \"decoys.\" Through this virtual screening benchmark, we gauge the effect of two recent enhancements to the functional form of the Rosetta energy function: the new \"Talaris\" update and the \"pwSHO\" solvation model. Finally, we conclude by developing and validating a new weight set that maximizes Rosetta's ability to pick out the active compounds in this test set. Looking collectively over the course of these enhancements, we find a marked improvement in Rosetta's ability to identify small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions.",

In plants, searching for novel protein-protein interactions is limited to protein purification assays, heterologous in vivo systems such as the yeast-two-hybrid or mutant screens.

We demonstrate that it is possible to screen for novel protein-protein interactions from a random library in protoplasted Arabidopsis plant cells and recover some of the interacting partners. Our screen is based on capturing the bi-molecular complementation of mYFP between an YN-bait fusion partner and a completely random prey YC-cDNA library with FACS. The candidate interactions were confirmed using in planta BiFC assays and in planta FRET-FLIM assays. From this work, we show that the well characterized protein Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase 3 (CPK3) interacts with APX3, HMGB5, ORP2A and a ricin B-related lectin domain containing protein At2g39050.

Rediscovering them automatically is a challenging bioinformatics task. Solutions to this problem also reach far beyond bioinformatics. RESULTS: We study a new approach that involves automatically discovering English expression patterns, optimizing them and using them to extract protein-protein interactions. In a sister paper, we described how to generate English expression patterns related to protein-protein interactions, and this approach alone has already achieved precision and recall rates significantly higher than those of other automatic systems. This paper continues to present our theory, focusing on how to improve the patterns. A minimum description length (MDL)-based pattern-optimization algorithm is designed to reduce and merge patterns. This has significantly increased generalization power, and hence the recall and precision rates, as confirmed by our experiments. AVAILABILITY: http://spies.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn.",

Net protein-protein interactions were probed via the Kirkwood-Buff integral G22 and the static structure factor S(q) from SLS and SANS data. G22 was obtained by regressing the Rayleigh ratio versus protein concentration with a local Taylor series approach, which does not require one to assume the underlying form or nature of intermolecular interactions. In addition, G22 and S(q) were further analyzed by traditional methods involving fits to effective interaction potentials. Although the fitted model parameters were not always physically realistic, the numerical values for G22 and S(q \u2192 0) were in good agreement from SLS and SANS as a function of protein concentration. In the dilute regime, fitted G22 values agreed with those obtained via the osmotic second virial coefficient B22 and showed that electrostatic interactions are the dominant contribution for colloidal interactions in \u03b1-chymotrypsinogen solutions. However, as protein concentration increases, the strength of protein-protein interactions decreases, with a more pronounced decrease at low salt concentrations. The results are consistent with an effective \"crowding\" or excluded volume contribution to G22 due to the long-ranged electrostatic repulsions that are prominent even at the moderate range of protein concentrations used here (<40 g/L). These apparent crowding effects were confirmed and quantified by assessing the hydrodynamic factor H(q \u2192 0), which is obtained by combining measurements of the collective diffusion coefficient from DLS data with measurements of S(q \u2192 0). H(q \u2192 0) was significantly less than that for a corresponding hard-sphere system and showed that hydrodynamic nonidealities can lead to qualitatively incorrect conclusions regarding B22, G22, and static protein-protein interactions if one uses only DLS to assess protein interactions.",

Protein-protein interactions involved in signaling pathways in living systems are a prime example where hydrophobic effects have profound implications. In the context of protein-protein interactions, a priori knowledge of relevant binding interfaces (i.e., clusters of residues involved directly with binding interactions) is difficult. In the case of hydrophobically mediated interactions, use of hydropathy-based methods relying on single residue hydrophobicity properties are routinely and widely used to predict propensities for such residues to be present in hydrophobic interfaces. However, recent studies suggest that consideration of hydrophobicity for single residues on a protein surface require accounting of the local environment dictated by neighboring residues and local water. In this study, we use a method derived from percolation theory to evaluate spanning water networks in the first hydration shells of a series of small proteins. We use residue based water density and single-linkage clustering methods to predict hydrophobic regions of proteins; these regions are putatively involved in binding interactions. We find that this simple method is able to predict with sufficient accuracy and coverage the binding interface residues of a series of proteins. The approach is competitive with automated servers. The results of this study highlight the importance of accounting of local environment in determining the hydrophobic nature of individual residues on protein surfaces. \u00a9 Proteins 2014;. \u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Elucidating such interactions is crucial for understanding general principles of cellular systems. Previous studies have shown the potential of predicting PPIs based on only sequence information. Compared to approaches that require other auxiliary information, these sequence-based approaches can be applied to a broader range of applications.RESULTS:This study presents a novel sequence-based method based on the assumption that protein-protein interactions are more related to amino acids at the surface than those at the core. The present method considers surface information and maintains the advantage of relying on only sequence data by including an accessible surface area (ASA) predictor recently proposed by the authors. This study also reports the experiments conducted to evaluate a) the performance of PPI prediction achieved by including the predicted surface and b) the quality of the predicted surface in comparison with the surface obtained from structures. The experimental results show that surface information helps to predict interacting protein pairs. Furthermore, the prediction performance achieved by using the surface estimated with the ASA predictor is close to that using the surface obtained from protein structures.CONCLUSION:This work presents a sequence-based method that takes into account surface information for predicting PPIs. The proposed procedure of surface identification improves the prediction performance with an F-measure of 5.1%. The extracted surfaces are also valuable in other biomedical applications that require similar information.",

        "abstract": "Better predictive ability of salt and buffer effects on protein-protein interactions requires separating out contributions due to ionic screening, protein charge neutralization by ion bind- ing, and salting-in(out) behaviour. We have carried out a systematic study by measuring protein-protein interactions for a monoclonal antibody over an ionic strength range of 25 to 525 mM at 4 pH values (5, 6.5, 8, 9) in solutions containing either sodium chloride, calcium chlo- ride, sodium sulfate, or sodium thiocyante. The salt ions are chosen so as to represent a range of affinities for protein charged and non-charged groups. The results are compared to effects of various buffers including acetate, citrate, phosphate, histidine, succinate, or tris. In low ionic strength solutions, anion binding affinity is reflected by the ability to reduce protein-protein repulsion, which follows the order thiocyanate > sulfate > chloride. The sulfate specific effect is screened at the same ionic strength required to screen the pH dependence of protein-protein interactions indicating sulfate binding only neutralizaes protein charged groups. Thiocyanate specific effects occur over a larger ionic strength range reflecting adsorption to charged and non-charged regions of the protein. The latter leads to salting-in behaviour and, at low pH, a non-monotonic interaction profile with respect to sodium thiocyanate concentration. The ef- fects of thiocyanate can not only be rationalized in terms of neutralizing double layer forces indicating the presence of an additional short-ranged protein-protein attraction at moderate ionic strength. Conversely, buffer specific effects can be explained through a charge neutral- ization mechanism, where buffers with greater valency are more effective at reducing double layer forces at low pH. Citrate binding at pH 6.5 leads to protein charge inversion and the for- mation of attractive electrostatic interactions. Throughout the report, we highlight similarities in the measured protein-protein interaction profiles with previous studies providing evidence that the behaviour is universal to all proteins.",

Here, we provide an overview of the structure and protein-protein interactions of ASPP2. The C-terminus of ASPP2 contains Ank (ankyrin) repeats and an SH3 domain (Src homology 3 domain). The Ank-SH3 domains mediate interactions between ASPP2 and numerous proteins involved in apoptosis such as p53 and Bcl-2. The proline-rich domain of ASPP2 is unfolded in its native state, but was not shown to mediate intermolecular interactions. Instead, it makes an intramolecular domain-domain interaction with the Ank-SH3 C-terminal domains of ASPP2. This intramolecular interaction between the unstructured proline-rich domain and the structured Ank-SH3 domains in ASPP2, which is possible due to the unfolded nature of the proline-rich domain, is proposed to have an important role in regulating the intermolecular interactions of ASPP2 with its partner proteins.",

Recent methodological developments have helped characterize weak protein interactions, and have in particular been applied to the study of proteins that are mostly unfolded alone but form well-defined complexes upon interaction. In addition, NMR methods have been applied to the identification and characterization of small chemicals that inhibit protein function, a primary objective of rational drug design.",

        "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are considered as one of the next generation of therapeutic targets. Specific tools thus need to be developed to tackle this challenging chemical space. In an effort to derive some common principles from recent successes, we have built 2P2Idb (freely accessible at http://2p2idb.cnrs-mrs.fr), a hand-curated structural database dedicated to protein-protein interactions with known orthosteric modulators. It includes all interactions for which both the protein-protein and protein-ligand complexes have been structurally characterized. A web server provides links to related sites of interest, binding affinity data, pre-calculated structural information about protein-protein interfaces and 3D interactive views through java applets. Comparison of interfaces in 2P2Idb to those of representative datasets of heterodimeric complexes has led to the identification of geometrical parameters and residue properties to assess the druggability of protein-protein complexes. A tool is proposed to calculate a series of biophysical and geometrical parameters that characterize protein-protein interfaces. A large range of descriptors are computed including, buried accessible surface area, gap volume, non-bonded contacts, hydrogen-bonds, atom and residue composition, number of segments and secondary structure contribution. All together the 2P2I database represents a structural source of information for scientists from academic institutions or pharmaceutical industries.",

        "abstract": "Background: Protein-protein interactions play vital roles in nearly all cellular processes and are involved in the construction of biological pathways such as metabolic and signal transduction pathways. Although large-scale experiments have enabled the discovery of thousands of previously unknown linkages among proteins in many organisms, the high-throughput interaction data is often associated with high error rates. Since protein interaction networks have been utilized in numerous biological inferences, the inclusive experimental errors inevitably affect the quality of such prediction. Thus, it is essential to assess the quality of the protein interaction data. Results: In this paper, a novel Bayesian network-based integrative framework is proposed to assess the reliability of protein-protein interactions. We develop a cross-species in silico model that assigns likelihood scores to individual protein pairs based on the information entirely extracted from model organisms. Our proposed approach integrates multiple microarray datasets and novel features derived from gene ontology. Furthermore, the confidence scores for cross-species protein mappings are explicitly incorporated into our model. Applying our model to predict protein interactions in the human genome, we are able to achieve 80% in sensitivity and 70% in specificity. Finally, we assess the overall quality of the experimentally determined yeast protein-protein interaction dataset. We observe that the more high-throughput experiments confirming an interaction, the higher the likelihood score, which confirms the effectiveness of our approach. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that model organisms certainly provide important information for protein-protein interaction inference and assessment. The proposed method is able to assess not only the overall quality of an interaction dataset, but also the quality of individual protein-protein interactions. We expect the method to continually improve as more high quality interaction data from more model organisms becomes available and is readily scalable to a genome-wide application. \u00a9 2009 Lin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

One specific topic of interest is related to the identification of articles that might be used for extracting protein-protein interactions. Using the BioCreative III Article Classification Task dataset, composed of PubMed abstracts classified as relevant or non-relevant for describing protein-protein interactions, we compare different classification methods with different sets of features. The best results--area under the interpolated precision-recall curve of 0.654--indicate that the proposed classification strategy could be incorporated in the database curation workflows in order to prioritize articles for extraction of protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, we also analysed the use of this method for ranking documents resulting from general PubMed queries, and propose that this approach could be useful for general researchers looking for publications describing protein-protein interactions within a particular topic of interest.",

One candidate interacting protein is fused to a luminescent energy donor, such as Renilla luciferase, and the other to a fluorescent energy acceptor, such the green fluorescent protein (GFP), and the two are then coexpressed in the same cells. If the two proteins interact, their close proximity allows nonradiative energy transfer (BRET) between the luciferase and the GFP. BRET does not occur if the two proteins are separated by more than 100 A, making the technique ideal for monitoring protein-protein interactions in biological systems. This unit describes the use of BRET to study constitutive and agonist-promoted interactions among signaling molecules, as illustrated by the homodimerization of the CXCR4 receptor and the recruitment of beta-arrestin2 to agonist-activated G-protein-coupled receptors. This noninvasive and homogeneous assay provides a robust and sensitive proteomic platform with applications for basic science research and drug discovery.",

Antagonists of these interactions could play key roles as both biological reagents and therapeutic compounds. However, much of the early work in this area with peptides revealed that these species, in general, bind with modest affinity to their protein targets. In addition, when these studies first commenced nearly 20 years ago, the technology for the intracellular delivery of peptides and modified analogs thereof was rudimentary. In the intervening years, not only has this technology dramatically improved, but the global role that protein-protein interactions play in transducing intracellular signals has become simply too obvious to ignore. With the introduction of combinatorial library methods, it is now a simple matter to identify consensus sequences recognized by protein interaction domains. An array of strategies has now been developed to transform these otherwise modest binding consensus sequences into high-affinity ligands. These strategies include the design of high-affinity replacements for key amino acid residues in consensus peptides, the construction of multidomain-binding peptides, and the structural modification of consensus sequence peptides. In several of these instances, unprecedented affinity (<nM) and selectivity (>1,000-fold versus closely related protein targets) have been achieved.",

For comparison, we generated six proteomes with randomized concentrations. We found that the net charges and molecular weights of the proteins in the minimal genome are not random. The net charge of a protein decreases linearly with molecular weight, with small proteins being mostly positively charged and large proteins negatively charged. The protein copy numbers in the minimal genome have the tendency to maximize the number of protein-protein interactions in the network. Negatively charged proteins that tend to have larger sizes can provide a large collision cross-section allowing them to interact with other proteins; on the other hand, the smaller positively charged proteins could have higher diffusion speed and are more likely to collide with other proteins. Proteomes with random charge/mass populations form less stable clusters than those with experimental protein copy numbers. Our study suggests that \"proper\" populations of negatively and positively charged proteins are important for maintaining a protein-protein interaction network in a proteome. It is interesting to note that the minimal genome model based on the charge and mass of Escherichia coli may have a larger protein-protein interaction network than that based on the lower organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae.",

The QS scan approach was applied to the high affinity site of human growth hormone (hGH) for binding to its receptor (hGHR). Although the published structure-function data base describing this system is probably the most extensive for any large protein-protein interface, it is nonetheless too sparse to accurately describe the nature of the energetics governing the interaction. Our comprehensive data base affords a complete view of the binding site and provides important new insights into the general principles underlying protein-protein interactions. The hGH binding interface is highly adaptable to mutations, but the nature of the tolerated mutations challenges generally accepted views about the evolutionary and biophysical pressures governing protein-protein interactions. Many substitutions that would be considered chemically conservative are not tolerated, while conversely, many non-conservative substitutions can be accommodated. Furthermore, conservation across species is a poor predictor of the chemical character of tolerated substitutions across the interface. Numerous deviations from generally accepted expectations indicate that mutational tolerance is highly context dependent and, furthermore, cannot be predicted by our current knowledge base. The type of data produced by the comprehensive QS scan can fill the gaps in the structure-function matrix. The compilation of analogous data bases from studies of other protein-protein interactions should greatly aid the development of computational methods for explaining and designing molecular recognition.",

RNA interference (RNAi) has evolved not only as a powerful tool for studying gene expression and validating new drug targets, but also as a potential therapeutic intervention. However, the major challenge facing the translation of RNAi into clinical practice is the lack of efficient systemic deliv-ery to specific cell types.

RNA interference is a cellular mechanism that can be induced either by synthetic small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or by vec-tors that express small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) (1). This mecha-nism mediates sequence-specific gene silencing by cleavage of the targeted messenger RNA or by suppression of the translation machinery (2, 3). To realize the potential of siRNAs for in vivo drug discovery and therapy, there is a need to overcome the con-siderable hurdles of systemic and intracellular delivery of pay-loads into the cell (4). siRNAs are subjected to a rapid renal clearance and can be degraded by serum RNases, shortening their half-life in vivo and thus, suitable nanocarriers that protect",

When we fused a protein that interacts with a transcription factor with SRDX and co-expressed the product with the transcription factor in plant cells, the expression of genes that are targets of the transcription factor was suppressed by transrepression. We demonstrated the transrepressive activity of SRDX using FOS and JUN as a model system and used two MADS box plant proteins, PISTILLATA and APETALA3, which are known to form heterodimers. Furthermore, the transgenic plants that expressed TTG1, which is a WD40 protein and interacts with bHLH transcription factors, fused to SRDX exhibited a phenotype similar to ttg1 mutants by transrepression and the regions of TTG1 required for interaction to the bHLH protein were detected using our system. We also used this system to analyse a protein factor that might be incorporated into a transcriptional complex and identified an Arabidopsis WD40 protein PWP2 (AtPWP2) interacting with AtTBP1 through comparison of phenotypes induced by 35S:AtPWP2-SRDX with that induced by the chimeric repressor.

It is well established that the G-protein gamma subunit (Ggamma) is anchored to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane via lipid modification in the C-terminus, and that this localization of Ggamma is required for signal transduction. In our system, mutated Ggamma (Ggamma(cyto)) lacking membrane localization ability was genetically prepared by deletion of the lipid modification site. Complete disappearance of G-protein signal was observed when Ggamma(cyto) was expressed in the cytoplasm of yeast cells from which the endogenous Ggamma gene had been deleted. In order to demonstrate the potential use of our system, we utilized the Staphylococcus aureus ZZ domain and the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a model interaction pair. To design our detection system for protein-protein interaction, the ZZ domain was altered so that it associates with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, and the Fc part was then fused to Ggamma(cyto). The Fc-Ggamma(cyto) fusion protein migrated towards the membrane via the ZZ-Fc interaction, and signal transduction was therefore restored. This signal was successfully detected by assessing growth inhibition and transcription in response to G-protein signaling. Finally, several Z variants displaying affinity constants ranging from 8.0 x 10(3) to 6.8 x 10(8) m(-1) were prepared, and it was demonstrated that our system was able to discriminate subtle differences in affinity. In conclusion, our system appears to be a reliable and versatile technique for detection of protein-protein interactions, and may prove useful in future protein interaction studies.",

Modeling procedure starts from a reduced space representation of proteins and peptides. Polypeptide chains are represented by strings of alpha-carbon beads restricted to a fine-mesh cubic lattice. Side chains are represented by up to two centers of interactions, corresponding to beta-carbons and the centers of mass of the remaining portions of the side groups, respectively. Additional pseudoatoms are located in the centers of the virtual bonds connecting consecutive alpha carbons. These pseudoatoms support a model of main-chain hydrogen bonds. Docking starts from a collection of random configurations of modeled molecules. Interacting molecules are flexible; however, higher accuracy models are obtained when the conformational freedom of one (the larger one) of the assembling molecules is limited by a set of weak distance restraints extracted from the experimental (or theoretically predicted) structures. Sampling is done by means of Replica Exchange Monte Carlo method. Afterwards, the set of obtained structures is subject to a hierarchical clustering. Then, the centroids of the resulting clusters are used as scaffolds for the reconstruction of the atomic details. Finally, the all-atom models are energy minimized and scored using classical tools of molecular mechanics. The method is tested on a set of macromolecular assemblies consisting of proteins and peptides. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach to the flexible docking could be successfully applied to prediction of protein-peptide and protein-protein interactions. The obtained models are almost always qualitatively correct, although usually of relatively low (or moderate) resolution. In spite of this limitation, the proposed method opens new possibilities of computational studies of macromolecular recognition and mechanisms of assembly of macromolecular complexes.",

        "abstract": "Multisite protein phosphorylation is a common regulatory mechanism in cell signaling, and dramatically increases the possibilities for protein\u2013protein interactions, conformational regulation, and phosphorylation pathways. However, there is at present no comprehensive picture of how these factors shape the response of a protein's phosphorylation state to changes in kinase and phosphatase activities. Here we provide a mathematical theory for the regulation of multisite protein phosphorylation based on the mechanistic description of elementary binding and catalytic steps. Explicit solutions for the steady-state response curves and characteristic (de)phosphorylation times have been obtained in special cases. The order of phosphate processing and the characteristics of protein\u2013protein interactions turn out to be of overriding importance for both sensitivity and speed of response. Random phosphate processing gives rise to shallow response curves, favoring intermediate phosphorylation states of the target, and rapid kinetics. Sequential processing is characterized by steeper response curves and slower kinetics. We show systematically how qualitative differences in target phosphorylation\u00a0\u2212\u00a0including graded, switch-like and bistable responses\u00a0\u2212\u00a0are determined by the relative concentrations of enzyme and target as well as the enzyme\u2013target affinities. In addition to collective effects of several phosphorylation sites, our analysis predicts that distinct phosphorylation patterns can be finely tuned by a single kinase. Taken together, this study suggests a versatile regulation of protein activation by the combined effect of structural, kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of multisite phosphorylation.",

The mol. properties of protein surfaces, including their shallow features and lack of deep binding pockets, pose significant challenges, and as a result have proved difficult to target. Peptides are ideal candidates for this mission due to their ability to closely mimic many structural features of protein interfaces. However, their inherently low intracellular stability and permeability and high in vivo clearance have thus far limited their biol. applications. One way to improve these properties is to constrain the secondary structure of linear peptides by cyclisation.

The strength and validity of this association has been called into question. Here we investigate how biases in high-throughput protein-protein interaction studies could lead to a spurious correlation.\\n\\nRESULTS: We examined the correlation between evolutionary rate and the number of protein-protein interactions for sets of interactions determined by seven different high-throughput methods in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Some methods have been shown to be biased towards counting more interactions for abundant proteins, a fact that could be important since abundant proteins are known to evolve more slowly. We show that the apparent tendency for interactive proteins to evolve more slowly varies directly with the bias towards counting more interactions for abundant proteins. Interactions studies with no bias show no correlation between evolutionary rate and the number of interactions, and the one study biased towards counting fewer interactions for abundant proteins actually suggests that interactive proteins evolve more rapidly. In all cases, controlling for protein abundance significantly decreases the observed correlation between interactions and evolutionary rate. Finally, we disprove the hypothesis that small data set size accounts for the failure of some interactions studies to show a correlation between evolutionary rate and the number of interactions.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The only correlation supported by a careful analysis of the data is between evolutionary rate and protein abundance. The reported correlation between evolutionary rate and protein-protein interactions cannot be separated from the biases of some protein-protein interactions studies to count more interactions for abundant proteins.",

While bacterial proteins required for host cell invasion and infection can be identified through bacterial mutant library screens, information about host target proteins and interspecies complex structures has been more difficult to acquire. Using an unbiased chemical crosslinking/mass spectrometry approach, we identified interspecies protein-protein interactions in human lung epithelial cells infected with Acinetobacter baumannii. These efforts resulted in identification of 3,076 crosslinked peptide pairs and 46 interspecies protein-protein interactions. Most notably, the key A. baumannii virulence factor, OmpA, was identified as crosslinked to host proteins involved in desmosomes, specialized structures that mediate host cell-to-cell adhesion. Co-immunoprecipitation and transposon mutant experiments were used to verify these interactions and demonstrate relevance for host cell invasion and acute murine lung infection. These results shed new light on A. baumannii-host protein interactions and their structural features, and the presented approach is generally applicable to other systems.",

Thus, establishing the fundamentals of their formation, through detecting and quantifying important protein\u2013protein interactions, could be crucial to understanding essential cellular machinery, and for further development of protein-based technologies. Herein we describe a method to monitor the assembly of protein cages by detecting specific, oligomerization state dependent, protein\u2013protein interactions. Our strategy relies on engineering protein monomers to include cysteine pairs that are presented proximally if the cage state assembles. These assembled pairs of cysteines act as binding sites for the fluorescent reagent FlAsH, which, once bound, provides a readout for successful oligomerization. As a proof of principle, we applied this technique to the iron storage protein, DNA-binding protein from starved cells from E. coli. Several linker lengths and conformations for the presentation of the cysteine pairs were screened to optimize the engineered binding sites. We confirmed that our designs were successful in both lysates and with purified proteins, and that FlAsH binding was dependent upon cage assembly. Following successful characterization of the assay, its throughput was expanded. A two-dimension matrix of pH and denaturing buffer conditions was screened to optimize nanocage stability. We intend to use this method for the high throughput screening of protein cage libraries and of conditions for the generation of inorganic nanoparticles within the cavity of these and other cage proteins.",

To provide a new method to detect these interactions, we designed and synthesized fluorinated bromopyronins as molecular probes. These electrophilic compounds rapidly react with amines via a S(N)Ar mechanism to form modestly electrophilic aminopyronin fluorophores. To investigate whether proteins modified with aminopyronins might selectively transfer these fluorophores between proximal lysine residues at protein-protein interfaces, immunoglobulin-G (IgG) was conjugated to fluorinated pyronins and added to unlabeled Protein A (SpA) from S. aureus. Analysis by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry revealed transfer of this fluorophore from IgG to specific lysines of its binding partner SpA but not to bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a nonbinding control. Examination of an X-ray structure of IgG bound to SpA revealed that the fluorophore was selectively transferred between amino groups of lysines that reside within ~10 \u00c5 at the protein-protein interface. To evaluate whether this approach could be used to identify interactions with endogenous cellular proteins, pyronin-modified Rnase A was added to crude extracts of human HeLa cells. Analysis of interacting proteins by gel electrophoresis revealed the endogenous ribonuclease inhibitor as the primary cellular target. Given that proximal lysine residues frequently reside at protein-protein interfaces, this method may facilitate identification of diverse protein-protein interactions present in complex biological matrices.",

One of the challenges in development is the identification of potential druggable binding sites in protein interacting interfaces. Identification of interface surfaces can greatly aid rational drug design of small molecules inhibiting protein-protein interactions. In this work, starting from the structure of a free monomer, we have developed a ligand docking based method, called \"FindBindSite\" (FBS), to locate protein-protein interacting interface regions and potential druggable sites in this interface. FindBindSite utilizes the results from docking a small and diverse library of small molecules to the entire protein structure. By clustering regions with the highest docked ligand density from FBS, we have shown that these high ligand density regions strongly correlate with the known protein-protein interacting surfaces. We have further predicted potential druggable binding sites on the protein surface using FBS, with druggability being defined as the site with high density of ligands docked. FBS shows a hit rate of 71% with high confidence and 93% with lower confidence for the 41 proteins used for predicting druggable binding sites on the protein-protein interface. Mining the regions of lower ligand density that are contiguous with the high scoring high ligand density regions from FBS, we were able to map 70% of the protein-protein interacting surface in 24 out of 41 structures tested. We also observed that FBS has limited sensitivity to the size and nature of the small molecule library used for docking. The experimentally determined hotspot residues for each protein-protein complex cluster near the best scoring druggable binding sites identified by FBS.

The efficacy of the system was systematically investigated by mapping the p53/mdm2 protein interaction interface. Specificity and general applicability of the biosensors were confirmed by studying additional classes of protein interaction domains (IDs), e.g., the leucine zipper IDs of Jun/Fos and the coiled-coil ID of Bcr-Abl in different cell lines. Importantly, we found that, in comparison to protein complementation assays, our system proved highly efficient and reversible and thus suited for the identification of molecular decoys to prevent specific protein-protein interactions in living cells. Reversibility was demonstrated in competition experiments by overexpressing the specific IDs or by the application of a p53/mdm2 protein interaction inhibitor.

This fraction ranges from 0 to 1 and represents a normalized protein-protein interaction (PPI) index and is a measure of the extent of protein-protein interactions. The PPI indices were used to compare the extent of association of subunits among different capsids. We further examined the variation of the PPI indices as a function of the molecular weight of the coat protein subunit and the capsid diameter. Our results suggest that the PPI indices in T=1 and pseudo-T=3 capsids vary linearly with the molecular weight of the subunit and capsid size. This is in contrast to quasi-equivalent capsids with T>or=3, where the extent of protein-protein interactions is relatively independent of the subunit and capsid sizes. The striking outcome of this analysis is the distinctive clustering of the \"T=2\" capsids, which are distinguished by higher subunit molecular weights and a much lower degree of protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, the calculated residual (R(sym)) of the fraction buried surface areas of the structurally unique subunits in capsids with T>1 was used to calculate the quasi-equivalence of different subunit environments.",

For instance, protein-protein interactions are involved in the assembly and regulation of multimeric enzymes and transcription factors, various signal response pathways, intracellular sorting and movement of proteins and membrane vesicles, cell-to-cell protein transport, and many others. Here we provide a detailed protocol for the mating-based split-ubiquitin system (mbSUS), which is a sensitive and user-friendly alternative to the classical yeast two-hybrid system in particular. mbSUS relies on the ubiquitin-degradation pathway as a sensor for protein-protein interactions. Thus, mbSUS is predominantly suitable for the determination of full-length proteins localized in the cytoplasm and in or at membrane compartments, without the need for their truncation and nuclear mislocation. In addition, we present a set of Gateway compatible mbSUS vectors that allow the rapid generation of constructs for fast and efficient interaction studies. An additional vector is introduced that allows the extension of mbSUS for the analysis of oligomeric protein complex formation and competition assays in vivo. In summary, mbSUS provides an additional versatile tool for protein-protein interaction studies, which is complementary to in planta assays such as BiFC and FRET.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that require multiple protein-protein interactions to regulate target gene expression. We have cloned a 27-kDa protein, termed NIX1 (neuronal interacting factor X 1), that directly binds nuclear receptors in vitro and in vivo. Protein-protein interaction between NIX1 and ligand-activated or constitutive active nuclear receptors, including retinoid-related orphan receptor beta (RORbeta) (NR1F2), strictly depends on the conserved receptor C-terminal activation function 2 (AF2-D). NIX1 selectively binds retinoic acid receptor (RAR) (NR1A) and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) (NR1B) in a ligand-dependent manner, but does not interact with retinoid X receptor (RXR) (NR2B) or steroid hormone receptors. Interestingly, NIX1 down-regulates transcriptional activation by binding to ligand-bound nuclear receptors. A 39-aa domain within NIX1 was found to be necessary and sufficient for protein-protein interactions with nuclear receptors. Northern blot analysis demonstrates low-abundance RNA messages only in brain and neuronal cells. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that NIX1 expression is restricted to the central nervous system and could be confined to neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the amygdala, thalamic, and hypothalamic regions. In summary, protein-protein interactions between the neuronal protein NIX1 and ligand-activated nuclear receptors are both specific and selective. By suppressing receptor-mediated transcription, NIX1 implements coregulation of nuclear receptor functions in brain.",

In this work, we revisit the regulatory output functions recorded for the synthetic enhancers that contain binding sites for TetR. We use our thermodynamic model as an analysis tool to infer that two different types of interactions may take place between the TetR molecules. First, a strong mutually exclusive anti-cooperative interaction precludes the synthetic enhancer from being occupied by more than one AT (the aTc bound TetR isoform) protein, and a second weak cooperative interaction exists between the aTc-free TetR isoform (T). Consequently, this work highlights the power of the synthetic enhancer approach as a tool for studying protein-protein interactions via an experimentally verifiable prediction for the general mode of binding of the TetR repressor.",

However, over the years many investigators have reported specific interactions between linker histones and proteins involved in important cellular processes. The purpose of this review is to highlight evidence indicating an important alternative mode of action for H1, namely protein-protein interactions. We first review key aspects of the traditional view of linker histone action, including the importance of the H1 C-terminal domain. We then discuss the current state of knowledge of linker histone interactions with other proteins, and, where possible, highlight the mechanism of linker histone-mediated protein-protein interactions. Taken together, the data suggest a combinatorial role for the linker histones, functioning both as primary chromatin architectural proteins and simultaneously as recruitment hubs for proteins involved in accessing and modifying the chromatin fiber.",

        "abstract": "Viral capsids are composed of multiple copies of one or a few chemically distinct capsid proteins and are mostly stabilized by inter subunit protein-protein interactions. There have been efforts to identify and analyze these protein-protein interactions, in terms of their extent and similarity, between the subunit interfaces related by quasi- and icosahedral symmetry. Here, we describe a new method to map quaternary interactions in spherical virus capsids onto polar angle space with respect to the icosahedral symmetry axes using azimuthal orthographic diagrams. This approach enables one to map the nonredundant interactions in a spherical virus capsid, irrespective of its size or triangulation number (T), onto the reference icosahedral asymmetric unit space. The resultant diagrams represent characteristic fingerprints of quaternary interactions of the respective capsids. Hence, they can be used as road maps of the protein-protein interactions to visualize the distribution and the density of the interactions. In addition, unlike the previous studies, the fingerprints of different capsids, when represented in a matrix form, can be compared with one another to quantitatively evaluate the similarity (S-score) in the subunit environments and the associated protein-protein interactions. The S-score selectively distinguishes the similarity, or lack of it, in the locations of the quaternary interactions as opposed to other well-known structural similarity metrics (e.g., RMSD, TM-score). Application of this method on a subset of T = 1 and T = 3 capsids suggests that S-score values range between 1 and 0.6 for capsids that belong to the same virus family/genus; 0.6-0.3 for capsids from different families with the same T-number and similar subunit fold; and <0.3 for comparisons of the dissimilar capsids that display different quaternary architectures (T-numbers). Finally, the sequence conserved interface residues within a virus family, whose spatial locations were also conserved have been hypothesized as the essential residues for self-assembly of the member virus capsids.",

Other methods, such as yeast two-hybrid systems or pull-down approaches followed by MS, are widely used to screen protein-protein interactions. However, as the yeast two-hybrid system requires protein interactions in the nucleus of yeast, proteins that are abundant in other compartments may not be detected. Pull-down approaches based on immunoprecipitation can be used to study endogenous proteins but they require specific antibodies.

It is particularly suitable for real-time monitoring of such interactions, however, the timescale over which assays can be carried out is currently relatively short (minutes) due to substrate instability. We present a new derivation of the BRET technology, termed 'extended BRET' (eBRET), which now enables protein-protein interactions to be monitored in real-time for many hours. This capability has significant benefits for investigating cellular function over extended timescales, as we have illustrated using the agonist-induced G-protein coupled receptor/??-arrestin interaction. The potential for studying the modulation of such interactions by agonists, antagonists, inhibitors, dominant negative mutants and co-expressed accessory proteins is substantial. Furthermore, the advantages of eBRET have important implications for the development of high-throughput BRET screening systems, an ever-expanding area of interest for the pharmaceutical industry. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "The rapid development by malaria parasites of resistance to almost all the chemotherapeutic agents so far used for their control means that constant efforts to develop new drugs are necessary. In this review, we propose that the exploration of protein-protein interactions as a new strategy to identify antimalarial drug targets is an attractive and a promising area of research. Nevertheless, one of the most important criteria is that the targeted gene should encode an essential protein within a complex that is able to affect parasite survival. Recently, our research on the biology of Plasmodium falciparum allowed us to identify the interaction of Protein Phosphatase type 1 and actin with two essential partners, PfLRR1 and PfLRR7 respectively, both of which belong to the Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR) protein family. LRR-containing proteins are composed of several consensus LRR motifs LXLXXNXL (where X is any amino acid) that provide sites for the assembly of protein interactions. The LRR combines structural versatility, adaptability and more importantly a high degree of interaction specificity. In addition, it has been shown that a single mutation in a particular LRR motif abolishes the protein-protein interaction and contributes to the expression of severe pathology in humans. This clearly infers that blocking the interaction related to 'hot spots' of LRR motifs can be considered as good targets to block parasite growth and development. Thus, the inhibition of protein-protein interactions by peptides, peptidomimetics or small-molecule inhibitors that interfere with binding domains can contribute to defining new potential drug targets.",

Because the interaction network of humans is poorly understood and difficult to investigate, here we propose the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system for understanding the impact of disease-causing mutations on protein-protein interactions. Alignments of human disease-associated proteins and 379 yeast orthologs showed that 124 of these proteins have > 40% sequence identity, with some orthologs having up to 89% identity. A total of 1826 amino acid mutations associated with human disease were found to map to invariant amino acids in yeast. These mutations were proportionately more likely to be non-conservative than non-disease associated polymorphisms for the same proteins (p = 0.016). Importantly, 73 of the mutations mapped to protein-protein interaction domains, implying a direct link between mutation and changes in protein interactivity. In the manuscript, all alignment information and tables that map mutations and diseases to yeast orthologs are given. This will help researchers experimentally test the impact of mutations on protein-protein interactions in S. cerevisiae and, by homology, explore the role of such mutations in the genesis of human disease.

We demonstrate that protein-protein interactions between the fatty acid acyl carrier protein (ACP) and thioesterase (TE) govern fatty acid hydrolysis within the algal chloroplast. Using green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr) as a model, a structural simulation of docking CrACP to CrTE identifies a protein-protein recognition surface between the two domains. A virtual screen reveals plant TEs with similar in silico binding to CrACP. Employing an activity-based crosslinking probe designed to selectively trap transient protein-protein interactions between the TE and ACP, we demonstrate in vitro that CrTE must functionally interact with CrACP to release fatty acids, while TEs of vascular plants show no mechanistic crosslinking to CrACP. This is recapitulated in vivo, where overproduction of the endogenous CrTE increased levels of short-chain fatty acids and engineering plant TEs into the C. reinhardtii chloroplast did not alter the fatty acid profile. These findings highlight the critical role of protein-protein interactions in manipulating fatty acid biosynthesis for algae biofuel engineering as illuminated by activity-based probes.",

The zinc-binding transcriptional regulatory proteins utilize Zn2+ to fold structural domains that participate in intermolecular interactions. A study by Matt et al. in this issue of the Biochemical Journal has examined the transcription factor binding properties of the zinc-binding module C/H1 (cysteine/histidine-rich region 1) found in the transcriptional co-activator proteins CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300. Their studies revealed that EDTA treatment of native C/H1 leads to irreversible denaturation and aggregation. Of particular concern is their finding that unfolded C/H1 participates in non-specific protein-protein interactions. The implications of these results are significant. EDTA is a very potent zinc-chelating agent that is used ubiquitously in protein interaction studies and in molecular biology in general. The potentially detrimental effects of EDTA on the structure and interactions of zinc-binding proteins should be taken into account in the interpretation of a sizeable number of published studies and must be considered in future experiments.",

BRET is the non-radiative transfer of energy from a 'donor' luciferase enzyme to an 'acceptor' fluorescent protein. In the most common configuration of this assay, the donor is Renilla reniformis luciferase and the acceptor is Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP). Because the efficiency of energy transfer is strongly distance-dependent, observation of the BRET phenomenon requires that the donor and acceptor be in close proximity. To test for an interaction between two proteins of interest in cultured mammalian cells, one protein is expressed as a fusion with luciferase and the second as a fusion with YFP. An interaction between the two proteins of interest may bring the donor and acceptor sufficiently close for energy transfer to occur. Compared to other techniques for investigating protein-protein interactions, the BRET assay is sensitive, requires little hands-on time and few reagents, and is able to detect interactions which are weak, transient, or dependent on the biochemical environment found within a live cell. It is therefore an ideal approach for confirming putative interactions suggested by yeast two-hybrid or mass spectrometry proteomics studies, and in addition it is well-suited for mapping interacting regions, assessing the effect of post-translational modifications on protein-protein interactions, and evaluating the impact of mutations identified in patient DNA.",

The principle is based on a protein splicing system, which involves a self-catalyzed excision of protein splicing elements, or inteins, from flanking polypeptide sequences, or exteins, leading to formation of a new protein in which the exteins are linked directly by a peptide bond. As the exteins, split N- and C-terminal halves of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were used. When a single peptide consisting of an intein derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae intervening the split EGFP was expressed in Escherichia coli, the two external regions of EGFP were ligated, thereby forming the EGFP corresponding fluorophore. Genetic alteration of the intein, which involved large deletion of the central region encoding 104 amino acids, was performed. In the expression of the residual N- and C-terminal intein fragments each fused to the split EGFP exteins, the splicing in trans did not proceed. However, upon coexpression of calmodulin and its target peptide M13, each connected to the N- and C-terminal inteins, fluorescence of EGFP was observed. These results demonstrate that interaction of calmodulin and M13 triggers the refolding of intein, which induces the protein splicing, thereby folding the ligated extein correctly for yielding the EGFP fluorophore. This method opens a new way not only to screen protein-protein interactions but also to visualize the interaction in vivo in transgenic animals.",

Given two proteins, the model compares the patterns of divergence of their families and assigns a score based on the correlation between the two. The working hypothesis of the model postulates that the stronger the correlation the more likely is that the two proteins interact. Several novel variants of this model are considered, including algorithms that attempt to identify the subset of the database proteins (the homologs of the query proteins) that are more likely to interact.

Many proteomic approaches have succeeded in the identification of strong and obligatory interactions but the study of weak and transient protein-protein interactions is still a challenge. The aim of the present study was to test the ability of bimolecular fluorescence complementation to detect and discriminate in vivo weak intracellular protein interactions. As a test case, the interaction of the SH3 domain from the c-Abl tyrosine kinase with both natural and designed targets has been chosen. The reassociation of functional yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) from its fragments requires previous binding between the SH3 domain and its partners; but once this occurs, the complex is trapped, turning transient SH3 interactions into stable, easily detectable ones. The method is very sensitive and can be implemented for proteomic analysis of weak protein interactions using flow cytometry. The fluorescence emission is dependent on the strength of the interaction, in such a way that it can be used, at least qualitatively, to screen for best binding candidates among similar proline-rich peptides. In addition, it is illustrated how this method can be used to gain structural insights into particular c-Abl SH3 interactions.",

Emerging evidence indicates that DAT function is influenced through interactions with other proteins. The current report describes a method to identify such interactions following DAT immunoprecipitation from a rat striatal synaptosomal preparation. This subcellular fraction was selected since DAT function is often determined ex vivo by measuring DA uptake in this preparation and few reports investigating DAT-protein interactions have utilized this preparation. Following SDS-PAGE and colloidal Coomassie staining, selected protein bands from a DAT-immunoprecipitate were excised, digested with trypsin, extracted, and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). From the analysis of the tryptic peptides, several proteins were identified including DAT, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) beta, CaMKII delta, protein kinase C (PKC) beta, and PKC gamma. Co-immunoprecipitation of PKC, CaMKII, and protein interacting with C kinase-1 with DAT was confirmed by Western blotting. Thus, the present study highlights a method to immunoprecipitate DAT and to identify co-immunoprecipitating proteins using LC/MS/MS and Western blotting. This method can be utilized to evaluate DAT protein-protein interactions but also to assess interactions involving other synaptic proteins. Ex vivo identification of protein-protein interactions will provide new insight into the function and regulation of a variety of synaptic, membrane-associated proteins, including DAT.",

We have described a number of assays with different reporter readouts, but of particular value to studies of protein interaction dynamics are assays based on enzyme reporters that catalyze the creation of products, thus taking advantage of the amplification of signal afforded. Here we describe protocols for one such PCA based on the enzyme TEM beta-lactamase as a reporter in mammalian cells. The beta-lactamase PCA consists of fusing complementary fragments of beta-lactamase to two proteins of interest. If the proteins interact, the fragments are brought together and fold into active beta-lactamase. Here we describe a protocol for this PCA that can be completed in a few hours, using two different substrates that are converted to fluorescent or colored products by beta-lactamase.",

The importance of protein-protein interactions in the mechanism of flavin transfer was analyzed in these studies. The results from affinity chromatography and cross-linking experiments support the formation of a stable complex between the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) reductase (SsuE) and monooxygenase (SsuD). Interactions between the two proteins do not lead to overall conformational changes in protein structure, as indicated by the results from circular dichroism spectroscopy in the far-UV region. However, subtle changes in the flavin environment of FMN-bound SsuE that occur in the presence of SsuD were identified by circular dichroism spectroscopy in the visible region. These data are supported by the results from fluorescent spectroscopy experiments, where a dissociation constant of 0.0022 +/- 0.0010 muM was obtained for the binding of SsuE to SsuD. Based on these studies, the stoichiometry for protein-protein interactions is proposed to involve a 1:1 monomeric association of SsuE with SsuD.",

The development of rational strategies to imitate key secondary structure elements of protein interfaces is complementary to other approaches based on the screening of synthetic or virtual libraries. In this sense, the present review provides representative examples of compounds that are able to disturb PPIs of therapeutic relevance, through the stabilization or the imitation of peptide hot-spots detected in contact areas of the interacting proteins. The review is divided into three sections, covering mimetics of the three main secondary structural elements found in proteins, in general, and in protein-protein interfaces, in particular (alpha-helices, beta-sheets, and reverse turns). Once the secondary element has been identified, the first approach typically involves the translation of the primary peptide structure into different cyclic analogues. This is normally followed by gradual decrease of the peptide nature through combination of peptide and non-peptide fragments in the same molecule. The final step usually consists in the development of pertinent organic scaffolds for appending key functional groups in the right spatial disposition, as a means towards totally non-peptide small molecule PPI modulators.",

The functions of the complement proteins of innate immunity are governed by the weak interactions between the activated proteins and their regulators. Complement is effective in attacking pathogens, but not the human host, and imbalances in this process can lead to disease conditions. The inherent complexity in analysing complement interactions is augmented by the multivalency of its main regulator, CFH (complement factor H), for its physiological or pathophysiological ligands. The unravelling of such weak protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions requires a multidisciplinary approach. Synchrotron X-ray solution scattering and constrained modelling resulted in the determination of the solution structure of CFH and its self-associative properties, whereas AUC (analytical ultracentrifugation) identified the formation of much larger CFH multimers through the addition of metals such as zinc. The ligands of CFH, such as CRP (C-reactive protein), also undergo self-association. The combination of X-rays and AUC with SPR (surface plasmon resonance) proved to be essential to identify CRP self-association and revealed how CFH interacts with CRP. We show that CRP unexpectedly binds to CFH at two non-contiguous sites and explain its relevance to age-related macular degeneration.",

To understand such an elusive phenomenon, it is necessary to thoroughly survey the large configurational space from the stable complex structure to the dissociated states using the all-atom model in explicit solvent and to delineate the energy landscape of protein-protein interactions. In this study, we carried out a multiscale enhanced sampling (MSES) simulation of the formation of a barnase-barstar complex, which is a protein complex characterized by an extraordinary tight and fast binding, to determine the energy landscape of atomistic protein-protein interactions. The MSES adopts a multicopy and multiscale scheme to enable for the enhanced sampling of the all-atom model of large proteins including explicit solvent. During the 100-ns MSES simulation of the barnase-barstar system, we observed the association-dissociation processes of the atomistic protein complex in solution several times, which contained not only the native complex structure but also fully non-native configurations. The sampled distributions suggest that a large variety of non-native states went downhill to the stable complex structure, like a fast folding on a funnel-like potential. This funnel landscape is attributed to dominant configurations in the early stage of the association process characterized by near-native orientations, which will accelerate the native inter-molecular interactions. These configurations are guided mostly by the shape complementarity between barnase and barstar, and lead to the fast formation of the final complex structure along the downhill energy landscape.",

The tight junction protein, claudin-2, synthesised in vitro using a cell-free expression system in the presence of polymer vesicles as membrane scaffolds, was used as a model membrane protein. Individual claudin-2 molecules interact weakly, although the cumulative effect of these interactions is significant. This effect results in a transient decrease of average vesicle dispersivity and reduction in transport speed of claudin-2-functionalised vesicles. Polymer vesicles functionalised with claudin-2 were perfused through a microfluidic channel and the time taken to traverse a defined distance within the channel was measured. Functionalised vesicles took 1.19 to 1.69 times longer to traverse this distance than unfunctionalised ones. Coating the channel walls with protein A and incubating the vesicles with anti-claudin-2 antibodies prior to perfusion resulted in the functionalised vesicles taking 1.75 to 2.5 times longer to traverse this distance compared to the controls. The data show that our system is able to detect weak as well as strong protein-protein interactions.

The 1D PAGE results showed that the amounts of insoluble material in MPC powders increased with storage time at elevated temperatures. This material consisted predominantly of ??- and ??-caseins. This material was formed largely by weak non-covalent (hydrophobic) protein-protein interactions that were dissociable under SDS-PAGE conditions. The 2D PAGE results demonstrated that the disulphide-linked protein aggregates present in MPC powders consisted of ??-casein, ??-lactoglobulin and some ??\n                        s2-casein, and not all of this material was sedimented. These aggregates were not considered to play a major role in the formation of the insoluble material. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Background: The investigation of protein-protein interactions is important for characterizing protein function. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) has recently gained interest as a relatively easy and inexpensive method to visualize protein-protein interactions in living cells. BiFC uses \"split YFP\" tags on proteins to detect interactions: If the tagged proteins interact, they may bring the two split fluorophore components together such that they can fold and reconstitute fluorescence. The sites of interaction can be monitored using epifluorescence or confocal microscopy. However, \"conventional\" BiFC can investigate interactions only between two proteins at a time. There are instances when one may wish to offer a particular \"bait\" protein to several \"prey\" proteins simultaneously. Preferential interaction of the bait protein with one of the prey proteins, or different sites of interaction between the bait protein and multiple prey proteins, may thus be observed. Results: We have constructed a series of gene expression vectors, based upon the pSAT series of vectors, to facilitate the practice of multi-color BiFC. The bait protein is tagged with the C-terminal portion of CFP (cCFP), and prey proteins are tagged with the N-terminal portions of either Venus (nVenus) or Cerulean (nCerulean). Interaction of cCFP-tagged proteins with nVenus-tagged proteins generates yellow fluorescence, whereas interaction of cCFP-tagged proteins with nCerulean-tagged proteins generates blue fluorescence. Additional expression of mCherry indicates transfected cells and sub-cellular structures. Using this system, we have determined in both tobacco BY-2 protoplasts and in onion epidermal cells that Agrobacterium VirE2 protein interacts with the Arabidopsis nuclear transport adapter protein importin \u03b1-1 in the cytoplasm, whereas interaction of VirE2 with a different importin \u03b1 isoform, importin \u03b1-4, occurs predominantly in the nucleus. Conclusion: Multi-color BiFC is a useful technique to determine interactions simultaneously between a given\" bait\" protein and multiple \"prey\" proteins in living plant cells. The vectors we have constructed and tested will facilitate the study of protein-protein interactions in many different plant systems.",

Identification and characterization of these interactions is one challenging task of the post-genomic era and crucial for understanding of molecular processes within a cell. Several methods have been successfully employed during the past decades to identify protein-protein interactions in bacteria, but most of them include tedious and time-consuming manipulations of DNA. In contrast, the MultiSite Gateway system is a fast tool for transfer of multiple DNA fragments between plasmids enabling simultaneous and site directed cloning of up to four fragments into one construct. Here we developed a new set of Gateway vectors including custom made entry vectors and modular Destination vectors for studying protein-protein interactions via Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), Bacterial two Hybrid (B2H) and split Gaussia luciferase (Gluc), as well as for fusions with SNAP-tag and HaloTag for dual-color super-resolution microscopy. As proof of principle, we characterized the interaction between the Salmonella effector SipA and its chaperone InvB via split Gluc and B2H approach. The suitability for FRET analysis as well as functionality of fusions with SNAP- and HaloTag could be demonstrated by studying the transient interaction between chemotaxis response regulator CheY and its phosphatase CheZ.",

Small molecules synthesized within cells or recruited from the external environment mediate many protein interactions. The study of small molecule-mediated interactions of proteins is important to understand abnormal signal transduction pathways in cancer and in drug development and validation. In this study, we used split synthetic renilla luciferase (hRLUC) protein fragment-assisted complementation to evaluate heterodimerization of the human proteins FRB and FKBP12 mediated by the small molecule rapamycin. The concentration of rapamycin required for efficient dimerization and that of its competitive binder ascomycin required for dimerization inhibition were studied in cell lines. The system was dually modulated in cell culture at the transcription level, by controlling nuclear factor kappaB promoter/enhancer elements using tumor necrosis factor alpha, and at the interaction level, by controlling the concentration of the dimerizer rapamycin. The rapamycin-mediated dimerization of FRB and FKBP12 also was studied in living mice by locating, quantifying, and timing the hRLUC complementation-based bioluminescence imaging signal using a cooled charged coupled device camera. This split reporter system can be used to efficiently screen small molecule drugs that modulate protein-protein interactions and also to assess drugs in living animals. Both are essential steps in the preclinical evaluation of candidate pharmaceutical agents targeting protein-protein interactions, including signaling pathways in cancer cells.",

Eph receptors (EphRs) are RTKs that are found in different cell types, from both tissues that are developing and from mature tissues, and play important roles in the development of the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. EphRs also play roles in synapse formation, neural crest formation, angiogenesis and in remodeling the vascular system. Interaction of EphRs with their ephrin ligands lead to activation of signal transduction pathways and formation of many transient protein-protein interactions that ultimately leads to cytoskeletal remodeling. However, the sequence of events at the molecular level is not well understood. We used blue native PAGE and MS to analyze the transient protein-protein interactions that resulted from the stimulation of EphB2 receptors by their ephrinB1-Fc ligands. We analyzed the phosphotyrosine-containing protein complexes immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates of both unstimulated (-) and ephrinB1-Fc-stimulated (+) NG108 cells. Our experiments allowed us to identify many signaling proteins, either known to be part of EphB2 signaling or new for this pathway, which are involved in transient protein-protein interactions upon ephrinB1-Fc stimulation. These data led us to investigate the roles of proteins such as FAK, WAVEs and Nischarin in EphB2 signaling.",

Many of the predicted interactions could potentially occur between the pathogen and its human host during pathogenesis as we focused mainly on the H. pylori proteins that have a transmembrane region or are encoded in the pathogenic island and those which are known to be secreted into the human host. By applying the homology search approach to protein-protein interaction databases DIP and iPfam, we could predict in vitro interactions for a total of 623 H. pylori proteins with 6559 human proteins. The predicted interactions include 549 hypothetical proteins of as yet unknown function encoded in the H. pylori genome and 13 experimentally verified secreted proteins.

Protein fragment complementation assays are based on the reconstitution of protein function when non-active protein fragments are brought together by interacting proteins that were genetically fused to these protein fragments. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) relies on the reconstitution of fluorescent proteins and enables both the analysis of protein-protein interactions and the visualization of protein complex formations in vivo. Transient expression of proteins is a convenient approach to study protein functions in planta or in other organisms and minimizes the need for time-consuming generation of stably expressing transgenic organisms. Here we describe protocols for BiFC analyses in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves transiently transformed by Agrobacterium infiltration. Further, we discuss different BiFC applications and provide examples for proper BiFC analyses in planta.",

We describe here a robust and flexible methodology that couples disruption of protein-protein complexes to host cell survival. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated through monitoring a small-molecule-mediated protein-protein association (FKBP12-rapamycin-FRAP) and two cases of dissociation (homodimeric HIV-1 protease and heterodimeric ribonucleotide reductase). For ribonucleotide reductase, we identified cyclic peptide inhibitors from genetically encoded libraries that dissociated the enzyme subunits. A solid-phase synthetic strategy and peptide ELISAs were developed to characterize these inhibitors, resulting in the discovery of cyclic peptides that operate in an unprecedented manner, thus highlighting the strengths of a functional approach. The ability of this method to process large libraries, coupled with the benefits of a genetic selection, allowed us to identify rare, uniquely active small-molecule modulators of protein-protein interactions at a frequency of less than one in 10 million.",

        "abstract": "Protein function is often mediated via formation of stable or transient complexes. Here we report the determination of protein-protein interactions in plants using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). The yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was split into two non-overlapping N-terminal (YN) and C-terminal (YC) fragments. Each fragment was cloned in-frame to a gene of interest, enabling expression of fusion proteins. To demonstrate the feasibility of BiFC in plants, two pairs of interacting proteins were utilized: (i) the alpha and beta subunits of the Arabidopsis protein farnesyltransferase (PFT), and (ii) the polycomb proteins, FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) and MEDEA (MEA). Members of each protein pair were transiently co-expressed in leaf epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana or Arabidopsis. Reconstitution of a fluorescing YFP chromophore occurred only when the inquest proteins interacted. No fluorescence was detected following co-expression of free non-fused YN and YC or non-interacting protein pairs. Yellow fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm of cells that expressed PFT alpha and beta subunits, or in nuclei and cytoplasm of cells that expressed FIE and MEA. In vivo measurements of fluorescence spectra emitted from reconstituted YFPs were identical to that of a non-split YFP, confirming reconstitution of the chromophore. Expression of the inquest proteins was verified by immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibodies directed against tags within the hybrid proteins. In addition, protein interactions were confirmed by immunoprecipitations. These results demonstrate that plant BiFC is a simple, reliable and relatively fast method for determining protein-protein interactions in plants.",

The solute-solvent interactions are considered to be unique for each homo- and hetero-multimer in solution. The effect of the various generalized free-solvent model parameters on the osmotic pressure are examined for a single protein solution with a homo-dimer, a binary protein solution with no protein-protein interactions, and a binary protein solution with a hetero-dimer. Finally, the limitations associated with the generalized free-solvent model are discussed. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

The functionality of this system and its compatibility with FACS screening are demonstrated in the forward and reverse direction using known interacting protein-partners and their cyclic peptide inhibitors.

Using two Bacillus subtilis regulator proteins, we demonstrate that this method is well suited to isolate protein complexes with high purity and virtually no background. Plasmids allowing the high-level expression of proteins carrying an N- or C-terminal Strep-tag in B. subtilis were constructed.",

We have here established self-assembly and surface modification of plasmonic nanostructures on solid support suitable for quantitative protein-protein interaction analysis by spectroscopic and microscopic LSPR detection. These architectures were obtained by layer-by-layer assembly via electrostatic attraction. Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) were adsorbed on a biocompatible amine-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer brush and further functionalized by poly-l-lysine graft PEG (PLL-PEG) copolymers. Stable yet reversible protein immobilization was achieved via tris(nitrilotriacetic acid) groups incorporated into the PLL-PEG coating. Thus, site-specific immobilization of His-tagged proteins via complexed Ni(II) ions was achieved. Functional protein immobilization on the surface was confirmed by real-time detection of LSPR scattering by reflectance spectroscopy. Association and dissociation rate constants obtained for a reversible protein-protein interaction were in good agreement with the data obtained by other surface-sensitive detection techniques. For spatially resolved detection, AuNP were assembled into micropatterns by means of photolithographic uncaging of surface amines. LSPR imaging of reversible protein-protein interactions was possible in a conventional wide field microscope, yielding detection limits of \u223c30 protein molecules within a diffraction-limited surface area.",

Most of the existing methods assume that protein-protein interaction data are given as binary data (i.e. whether or not each protein pair interacts). However, multiple biological experiments are performed for the same protein pairs and thus the ratio (strength) of the number of observed interactions to the number of experiments is available for each protein pair.  Results: We propose a new method for inference of protein-protein   interactions from such experimental data. This method tries to minimize the errors between the ratios of observed interactions and the predicted probabilities in training data, where this problem is formalized as a linear program based on a probabilistic model. We compared the proposed method with the association method, the EM method and the SVM-based method using real interaction data. It is shown that a variant of the method is comparable to existing methods for binary data. It is also shown that the method outperforms existing methods for numerical data.

Consequently, determination of the mechanism of functional regulation in such systems requires elucidation of the mechanism switching between binding partners. The central protein of the Escherichia coli biotin regulatory system, BirA, switches between its function as a metabolic enzyme or a transcriptional repressor in response to binding either the biotin carboxyl carrier protein subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase or a second BirA monomer. These two protein-protein interactions are structurally mutually exclusive. The results of earlier studies suggest that the system is regulated by kinetic partitioning between the two protein-protein interactions. In this work, sedimentation velocity was employed to monitor the partitioning directly. The results indicate similar equilibrium parameters governing formation of the two protein-protein interactions. Kinetic analysis of the sedimentation velocity data indicated that holoBirA dimerization is governed by very slow forward and reverse rate constants. The slow kinetics of holoBirA dimerization combined with fluctuations in the intracellular apoBCCP pool are critical determinants in partitioning BirA between its distinct biological functions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, several techniques have been developed for detection of protein-protein interactions in living cells, among which split luciferase complementation has been applied in animal and plant cells. Here, we examined whether the split luciferase assay could be used in filamentous ascomycetes, such as Gibberella zeae and Cochliobolus heterostrophus. The coding sequences of two strongly interacting proteins (the F-box protein, FBP1, and its partner SKP1) in G. zeae, under the control of the cryparin promoter from Cryphonectria parasitica, were translationally fused to the C- and N-terminal fragments of firefly luciferase (luc), respectively. Each fusion product inserted into a fungal transforming vector carrying the gene for resistance to either geneticin or hygromycin B, was transformed into both fungi. We detected complementation of split luciferase proteins driven by interaction of the two fungal proteins with a high luminescence intensity-to-background ratio only in the fungal transformants expressing both N-luc and C-luc fusion constructs. Using this system, we also confirmed a novel protein interaction between transcription factors, GzMCM1 and FST12 in G. zeae, which could hardly be proven by the yeast two-hybrid method. This is the first study demonstrating that monitoring of split luciferase complementation is a sensitive and efficient method of studying in vivo protein-protein interactions in filamentous ascomycetes.",

The protein splicing induces connection of a DNA-binding protein (modified LexA; mLexA) with a transcription activation domain of a herpes simplex virus protein (VP16AD). We thereby circumvented the limitation of earlier methods for monitoring protein-protein interactions, including the two-hybrid systems, protein complementation systems (PCS), and protein reconstitution systems, and rather combined their advantages. To test the applicability of this method, we monitored epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced interactions on cell membranes of a known partner, an oncogenic product Ras and its target Raf-1. Ras was connected with N-terminal DnaE and mLexA, while Raf-1 was connected with C-terminal DnaE and VP16AD. Upon stimulation with EGF, the interaction between Ras and Raf-1 triggered folding of the DnaEs, thereby inducing protein splicing to form mLexA-VP16AD fusion protein, and transcription of a reporter gene, firefly luciferase. The extent of Ras-Raf-1 interaction was quantified by measuring the luciferase activity. The interaction was not able to be monitored by two-hybrid systems nor by PCS of split firefly luciferases; however, by using the protein splicing elements and the reporter gene, we obtained the bioluminescence signals sufficient for evaluation of the interactions close to cell membranes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identification of protein interacting sites is an important task in computational molecular biology. As more and more protein sequences are deposited without available structural information, it is strongly desirable to predict protein binding regions by their sequences alone. This paper presents a pattern mining approach to tackle this problem. It is observed that a functional region of protein structures usually consists of several peptide segments linked with large wildcard regions. Thus, the proposed mining technology considers large irregular gaps when growing patterns, in order to find the residues that are simultaneously conserved but largely separated on the sequences. A derived pattern is called a cluster-like pattern since the discovered conserved residues are always grouped into several blocks, which each corresponds to a local conserved region on the protein sequence.\\n\\nRESULTS: The experiments conducted in this work demonstrate that the derived long patterns automatically discover the important residues that form one or several hot regions of protein-protein interactions. The methodology is evaluated by conducting experiments on the web server MAGIIC-PRO based on a well known benchmark containing 220 protein chains from 72 distinct complexes. Among the tested 218 proteins, there are 900 sequential blocks discovered, 4.25 blocks per protein chain on average. About 92% of the derived blocks are observed to be clustered in space with at least one of the other blocks, and about 66% of the blocks are found to be near the interface of protein-protein interactions. It is summarized that for about 83% of the tested proteins, at least two interacting blocks can be discovered by this approach.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This work aims to demonstrate that the important residues associated with the interface of protein-protein interactions may be automatically discovered by sequential pattern mining. The detected regions possess high conservation and thus are considered as the computational hot regions. This information would be useful to characterizing protein sequences, predicting protein function, finding potential partners, and facilitating protein docking for drug discovery.",

The study of genes and their inter-relationships using methods such as network and pathway analysis requires high quality protein-protein interaction information. Extracting reliable interactions from most of the existing databases is challenging because they either contain only a subset of the available interactions, or a mixture of physical, genetic and predicted interactions. Automated integration of interactions is further complicated by varying levels of accuracy of database content and lack of adherence to standard formats. To address these issues, the latest version of HitPredict provides a manually curated dataset of 398 696 physical associations between 70 808 proteins from 105 species. Manual confirmation was used to resolve all issues encountered during data integration. For improved reliability assessment, this version combines a new score derived from the experimental information of the interactions with the original score based on the features of the interacting proteins. The combined interaction score performs better than either of the individual scores in HitPredict as well as the reliability score of another similar database. HitPredict provides a web interface to search proteins and visualize their interactions, and the data can be downloaded for offline analysis. Data usability has been enhanced by mapping protein identifiers across multiple reference databases. Thus, the latest version of HitPredict provides a significantly larger, more reliable and usable dataset of protein-protein interactions from several species for the study of gene groups.Database URL: http://hintdb.hgc.jp/htp.",

        "abstract": "In this postgenomic era, the ability to identify protein-protein interactions on a genomic scale is very important to assist in the assignment of physiological function. Because of the increasing number of solved structures involving protein complexes, the time is ripe to extend threading to the prediction of quaternary structure. In this spirit, a multimeric threading approach has been developed. The approach is comprised of two phases. In the first phase, traditional threading on a single chain is applied to generate a set of potential structures for the query sequences. In particular, we use our recently developed threading algorithm, PROSPECTOR. Then, for those proteins whose template structures are part of a known complex, we rethread on both partners in the complex and now include a protein-protein interfacial energy. To perform this analysis, a database of multimeric protein structures has been constructed, the necessary interfacial pairwise potentials have been derived, and a set of empirical indicators to identify true multimers based on the threading Z-score and the magnitude of the interfacial energy have been established. The algorithm has been tested on a benchmark set comprised of 40 homodimers, 15 heterodimers, and 69 monomers that were scanned against a protein library of 2478 structures that comprise a representative set of structures in the Protein Data Bank. Of these, the method correctly recognized and assigned 36 homodimers, 15 heterodimers, and 65 monomers. This protocol was applied to identify partners and assign quaternary structures of proteins found in the yeast database of interacting proteins. Our multimeric threading algorithm correctly predicts 144 interacting proteins, compared to the 56 (26) cases assigned by PSI-BLAST using a (less) permissive E-value of 1 (0.01). Next, all possible pairs of yeast proteins have been examined. Predictions (n = 2865) of protein-protein interactions are made; 1138 of these 2865 interactions have counterparts in the Database of Interacting Proteins. In contrast, PSI-BLAST made 1781 predictions, and 1215 have counterparts in DIP. An estimation of the false-negative rate for yeast-predicted interactions has also been provided. Thus, a promising approach to help assist in the assignment of protein-protein interactions on a genomic scale has been developed.",

Plastidial SP is a stromal enzyme existing as a multimeric protein in amyloplasts. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant maize SP indicated that the tetrameric form was catalytically active in both glucan-synthetic and phosphorolytic directions. Protein-protein interaction experiments employing the recombinant SP as an affinity ligand with amyloplast extracts showed that the multimeric state of SP determined interactions with other enzymes of the starch biosynthetic pathway. The monomeric form of SP interacts with starch branching enzyme I (SBEI) and SBEIIb, whereas only SBEI interacts with the tetrameric form of SP. In all cases, protein-protein interactions were broken when amyloplast lysates were dephosphorylated invitro, and enhanced following pre-treatment with ATP, suggesting a mechanism of protein complex formation regulated by protein phosphorylation. Invitro protein phosphorylation experiments with [\u03b3-32P]-ATP show that SP is phosphorylated by a plastidial protein kinase. Evidence is presented which suggests SBEIIb modulates the catalytic activity of SP through the formation of a heteromeric protein complex. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.",

We synthesized a polyvalent molecule displaying multiple copies of this peptide and showed that it is a much more potent inhibitor than the free peptide.

Protein-protein interactions by extrusion or gelation were investigated through protein solubility studies of raw and finished products. All samples except for extrudates exhibited similar patterns of solubility in four selected extractants. Phosphate buffer (PB) extracted the least amount of protein. Addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) to PB improved protein solubility, indicating the presence of disulfide bonds. PB + Urea and PB + Urea + DTT gave the highest and almost equal amount of extractable proteins from all samples, except for the extrudates from which protein could not be extracted effectively by PB + Urea, implying that disulfide bonding was more pronounced during extrusion than gelation. The results support our hypothesis that soy protein gels and extrudates both have the same types of chemical bonds, namely covalent disulfide bonds and non-covalent interactions. It is the relative proportion of each type of bonds in their structures that differentiates the two with respect to reversibility and structure rigidity. In forming protein gels during heat-induced gelation, non-covalent bonds play a dominant role over disulfide bonds; whereas for forming the fibrous structure of protein extrudates, non-covalent bonds and covalent disulfide bonds are both important.",

In an attempt to better understand hEST1A function, we have started to dissect the molecular interactions between hEST1A and telomerase. Here, we demonstrate that the interaction between hEST1A and telomerase is mediated by protein-RNA and protein-protein contacts. We identify a domain within hEST1A that binds the telomerase RNA moiety hTR while full-length hEST1A establishes in addition RNase-resistant and hTR-independent protein-protein contacts with the human telomerase reverse transcriptase polypeptide (TERT). Conversely, within hTERT, we identify a hEST1A interaction domain, which comprises hTR-binding activity and RNA-independent hEST1A-binding activity. Purified, recombinant hEST1A binds the telomerase RNA moiety (hTR) with high affinity (apparent overall K(d) = 25 nM) but low specificity. We propose that hEST1A assembles specifically with telomerase in the context of the hTR-hTERT ribonucleoprotein, through the high affinity of hEST1A for hTR and specific protein-protein contacts with hTERT.",

        "abstract": "Peptides can be developed as effective antagonists of protein-protein interactions, but conventional peptides (i.e., oligomers of l-\u03b1-amino acids) suffer from significant limitations in vivo. Short half-lives due to rapid proteolytic degradation and an inability to cross cell membranes often preclude biological applications of peptides. Oligomers that contain both \u03b1- and \u03b2-amino acid residues (\"\u03b1/\u03b2-peptides\") manifest decreased susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, and when properly designed these unnatural oligomers can mimic the protein-recognition properties of analogous \"\u03b1-peptides\". This report documents an extension of the \u03b1/\u03b2-peptide approach to target intracellular protein-protein interactions. Specifically, we have generated \u03b1/\u03b2-peptides based on a \"stapled\" Bim BH3 \u03b1-peptide, which contains a hydrocarbon cross-link to enhance \u03b1-helix stability. We show that a stapled \u03b1/\u03b2-peptide can structurally and functionally mimic the parent stapled \u03b1-peptide in its ability to enter certain types of cells and block protein-protein interactions associated with apoptotic signaling. However, the \u03b1/\u03b2-peptide is nearly 100-fold more resistant to proteolysis than is the parent stapled \u03b1-peptide. These results show that backbone modification, a strategy that has received relatively little attention in terms of peptide engineering for biomedical applications, can be combined with more commonly deployed peripheral modifications such as side chain cross-linking to produce synergistic benefits.",

In this paper, a novel method based on Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) with feature combination was proposed for PPIs prediction. PNN is a statistic model and is robust to noise. It need not to be trained compared with other computational models such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). So it is very fast and can deal with large scale noisy PPIs data more properly. In addition, in order to obtain the more informative features from protein pairs, three most import physicochemical properties were adopted for featuring, then the three different features are combined as the input for PNN training and the different combinations were tested to get the best combination. Experiments show that our proposed method produces the best performance compared with the other popular methods. 1548-7741/Copyright \u00a9 2014 Binary Information Press.",

These techniques can detect and quantify protein behaviours down to the single-molecule level, all inside living cells. More recent developments in TCSPC (time-correlated single-photon counting) imaging are now also driving towards being able to determine protein interaction rates with similar spatial resolution, and together, these experimental advances allow investigators to perform biochemical experiments inside living cells.",

An attractive approach is to develop systems that allow for clonal selection of interacting protein pairs from large molecular libraries. In this study, we have characterized a novel approach for identification and selection of protein-protein interactions, denoted SPIRE (selection of protein interactions by receptor engagement), which is based on a mammalian expression system. We have demonstrated proof of concept by creating a general plasma membrane bound decoy receptor, by displaying a protein or a peptide genetically fused to a trunctated version of the CD40 molecule. When this decoy receptor is engaged by a ligand to the displayed protein/peptide, the receptor expressing cell is rescued from apoptosis. To design a high-throughput system with a highly parallel capacity, we utilized the B cell line WEHI-231, as carrier of the decoy receptor. One specific peptide-displaying cell could be identified and amplified, based on a specific receptor engagement, in a background of 12 500 wild-type cells after four selections. This demonstrates that the approach may serve as a tool in post-genomic research for identifying protein-protein interactions, without prior knowledge of either component.",

        "abstract": "Structurally conserved residues at protein-protein interfaces correlate with the experimental alanine-scanning hot spots. Here, we investigate the organization of these conserved, computational hot spots and their contribution to the stability of protein associations. We find that computational hot spots are not homogeneously distributed along the protein interfaces; rather they are clustered within locally tightly packed regions. Within the dense clusters, they form a network of interactions and consequently their contributions to the stability of the complex are cooperative; however the contributions of independent clusters are additive. This suggests that the binding free energy is not a simple summation of the single hot spot residue contributions. As expected, around the hot spot residues we observe moderately conserved residues, further highlighting the crucial role of the conserved interactions in the local densely packed environment. The conserved occurrence of these organizations suggests that they are advantageous for protein-protein associations. Interestingly, the total number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges contributed by hot spots is as expected. Thus, H-bond forming residues may use a \"hot spot for water exclusion\" mechanism. Since conserved residues are located within highly packed regions, water molecules are easily removed upon binding, strengthening electrostatic contributions of charge-charge interactions. Hence, the picture that emerges is that protein-protein associations are optimized locally, with the clustered, networked, highly packed structurally conserved residues contributing dominantly and cooperatively to the stability of the complex. When addressing the crucial question of \"what are the preferred ways of proteins to associate\", these findings point toward a critical involvement of hot regions in protein-protein interactions. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report the determination of protein-protein interactions in plants using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). The yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was split into two non-overlapping N-terminal (YN) and C-terminal (YC) fragments. Each fragment was cloned in-frame to a gene of interest, enabling expression of fusion proteins. To demonstrate the feasibility of BiFC in plants, two pairs of interacting proteins were utilized: (i) the alpha and beta subunits of the Arabidopsis protein farnesyltransferase (PFT), and (ii) the polycomb proteins, FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) and MEDEA (MEA). Members of each protein pair were transiently co-expressed in leaf epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana or Arabidopsis. Reconstitution of a fluorescing YFP chromophore occurred only when the inquest proteins interacted. No fluorescence was detected following co-expression of free non-fused YN and YC or non-interacting protein pairs. Yellow fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm of cells that expressed PFT alpha and beta subunits, or in nuclei and cytoplasm of cells that expressed FIE and MEA. In vivo measurements of fluorescence spectra emitted from reconstituted YFPs were identical to that of a non-split YFP, confirming reconstitution of the chromophore. Expression of the inquest proteins was verified by immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibodies directed against tags within the hybrid proteins. In addition, protein interactions were confirmed by immunoprecipitations. These results demonstrate that plant BiFC is a simple, reliable and relatively fast method for determining protein-protein interactions in plants.",

        "abstract": "Protein function is often mediated via formation of stable or transient complexes. Here we report the determination of protein-protein interactions in plants using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). The yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was split into two non-overlapping N-terminal (YN) and C-terminal (YC) fragments. Each fragment was cloned in-frame to a gene of interest, enabling expression of fusion proteins. To demonstrate the feasibility of BiFC in plants, two pairs of interacting proteins were utilized: (i) the alpha and beta subunits of the Arabidopsis protein farnesyltransferase (PFT), and (ii) the polycomb proteins, FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) and MEDEA (MEA). Members of each protein pair were transiently co-expressed in leaf epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana or Arabidopsis. Reconstitution of a fluorescing YFP chromophore occurred only when the inquest proteins interacted. No fluorescence was detected following co-expression of free non-fused YN and YC or non-interacting protein pairs. Yellow fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm of cells that expressed PFT alpha and beta subunits, or in nuclei and cytoplasm of cells that expressed FIE and MEA. In vivo measurements of fluorescence spectra emitted from reconstituted YFPs were identical to that of a non-split YFP, confirming reconstitution of the chromophore. Expression of the inquest proteins was verified by immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibodies directed against tags within the hybrid proteins. In addition, protein interactions were confirmed by immunoprecipitations. These results demonstrate that plant BiFC is a simple, reliable and relatively fast method for determining protein-protein interactions in plants.",

        "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are governed by the change in free energy upon binding, \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S. These interactions are often marginally stable, so one must examine the balance between the change in enthalpy, \u0394H, and the change in entropy, \u0394S, when investigating known complexes, characterizing the effects of mutations, or designing optimized variants. To perform a large-scale study into the contribution of conformational entropy to binding free energy, we developed a technique called GOBLIN (Graphical mOdel for BiomoLecular INteractions) that performs physics-based free energy calculations for protein-protein complexes under both side-chain and backbone flexibility. Goblin uses a probabilistic graphical model that exploits conditional independencies in the Boltzmann distribution and employs variational inference techniques that approximate the free energy of binding in only a few minutes. We examined the role of conformational entropy on a benchmark set of more than 700 mutants in eight large, well-studied complexes. Our findings suggest that conformational entropy is important in protein-protein interactions--the root mean square error (RMSE) between calculated and experimentally measured \u0394\u0394Gs decreases by 12% when explicit entropic contributions were incorporated. GOBLIN models all atoms of the protein complex and detects changes to the binding entropy along the interface as well as positions distal to the binding interface. Our results also suggest that a variational approach to entropy calculations may be quantitatively more accurate than the knowledge-based approaches used by the well-known programs FOLDX and Rosetta--GOBLIN's RMSEs are 10 and 36% lower than these programs, respectively.",

Structural evidence has shown that usually interacting pairs of close homologs (interologs) physically interact in the same way. Moreover, conservation of an interaction depends on the conservation of the interface between interacting partners. In this article we make use of both, structural similarities among domains of known interacting proteins found in the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) and conservation of pairs of sequence patches involved in protein-protein interfaces to predict putative protein interaction pairs. RESULTS: We have obtained a large amount of putative protein-protein interaction (approximately 130,000). The list is independent from other techniques both experimental and theoretical. We separated the list of predictions into three sets according to their relationship with known interacting proteins found in DIP. For each set, only a small fraction of the predicted protein pairs could be independently validated by cross checking with the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD). The fraction of validated protein pairs was always larger than that expected by using random protein pairs. Furthermore, a correlation map of interacting protein pairs was calculated with respect to molecular function, as defined in the Gene Ontology database. It shows good consistency of the predicted interactions with data in the HPRD database. The intersection between the lists of interactions of other methods and ours produces a network of potentially high-confidence interactions.",

Binding free energy can be approximated as a sum of pairwise atomic or residue contact energies, which are commonly inferred from contact frequencies observed in experimental protein structures. However, such statistically inferred potentials require certain assumptions and approximation. Here, we explore the possibility of deriving atomic and residue contact potentials directly from experimental binding free energy changes following mutation and present a number of such potentials. The first set of potentials is obtained by unweighted least-squares fitting and bootsrap aggregating. The second set is calculated using a weighting scheme optimized against absolute binding affinity data, so as to account for the over-representation of certain complexes, residues, and families of interactions. The congruence of the potentials with known physical chemistry is investigated. The potentials are further validated by ranking and clustering protein\u2013protein docking poses.",

This method includes (i) addition of a histidine-biotin-histidine tag to the bait proteins via recombinant DNA techniques, (ii) in vivo cross-linking with formaldehyde, (iii) tandem affinity purification of bait proteins under fully denaturing conditions, and (iv) identification of the proteins cross-linked to the bait proteins by liquid-chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass-spectrometry. In vivo cross-linking stabilized protein interactions and permitted the subsequent two-step purification step conducted under denaturing conditions. The two-step purification greatly reduced nonspecific binding of noncross-linked proteins to bait proteins. Two different negative controls were employed to eliminate the possibility of identifying background and nonspecific proteins as interacting partners, especially those caused by nonspecific binding to the stationary phase used for protein purification. In an initial demonstration of this approach, we tagged three Salmonella proteinsHimD, PduB and PhoPwith known binding partners that ranged from stable (e.g., HimD) to transient (i.e., PhoP). Distinct sets of interacting proteins were identified for each bait protein, including the known binding partners such as HimA for HimD, as well as unexpected binding partners.

        "abstract": "For decades, formaldehyde has been routinely used to cross-link proteins in cells, tissue, and in some instances, even entire organisms. Due to its small size, formaldehyde can readily permeate cell walls and membranes, resulting in efficient cross-linking, i.e. the formation of covalent bonds between proteins, DNA, and other reactive molecules. Indeed, formaldehyde cross-linking is an instrumental component of many mainstream analytical/cell biology techniques including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of protein-DNA complexes found in nuclei; immunohistological analysis of protein expression and localization within cells, tissues, and organs; and mass spectrometry (MS)-compatible silver-staining methodologies used to visualize low abundance proteins in polyacrylamide gels. However, despite its exquisite suitability for use in the analysis of protein environments within cells, formaldehyde has yet to be commonly employed in the directed analysis of protein\u2013protein interactions and cellular networks. The general purpose of this article is to discuss recent advancements in the use of formaldehyde cross-linking in combination with MS-based methodologies. Key advantages and limitations to the use of formaldehyde over other cross-linkers and technologies currently used to study protein\u2013protein interactions are highlighted, and formaldehyde-based experimental approaches that are proving very promising in their ability to accurately and efficiently identify novel protein\u2013protein and multiprotein interaction complexes are presented.",

Nevertheless, it is an artificial system that is sensitive to errors resulting in the identification of false-positive and false-negative interactions. In this study, plant MADS box transcription factor interactions identified by yeast two-hybrid systems where studied in living plant cells by a technique based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Petunia MADS box proteins were fused to either cyan fluorescent protein or yellow fluorescent protein and transiently expressed in protoplasts followed by FRET-spectral imaging microscopy and FRET-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to detect FRET and hence protein-protein interactions. All petunia MADS box heterodimers identified in yeast were confirmed in protoplasts. However, in contrast to the yeast two-hybrid results, homodimerization was demonstrated in plant cells for three petunia MADS box proteins. Heterodimers were identified between the ovule-specific MADS box protein FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 11 and members of the petunia FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 2 subfamily, which are also expressed in ovules, suggesting that these dimers play a role in ovule development. Furthermore, the role of dimerization in translocation of MADS box protein dimers to the nucleus is demonstrated, and the nuclear localization signal of MADS box proteins has been mapped to the N-terminal region of the MADS domain by means of mutant analyses.",

How this apparent duality in the properties of a protein is achieved has been a relatively little-studied subject until recently. In this review we aim to summarize the current knowledge regarding some important amphitrophic systems in which the interaction with the membrane does not require post-translational functional groups, but is an intrinsic property of the protein. We discuss mechanisms and driving forces involved in membrane binding in the context of two related concepts in protein folding and function that appear to have implications for understanding the association of proteins with membranes; first, the existence of some proteins with low-energy barrier heights for protein folding. Low folding barriers and the ability of proteins to form stable molten globule states are rationales that can explain how a protein can gain access to an ensemble (or continuum) of non-native conformations that are competent membrane binders. Second, the focus on order-disorder and disorder-order transitions to explain protein function, a concept which has been mainly developed within the novel protein trinity paradigm. Here, protein function can arise from any of three thermodynamic states: a solid, crystal-like state; a dense fluid state; and an extended disordered state. Together these concepts aid to understand amphitrophic mechanism and to unify interpretations of protein behaviour with respect to the degree of 8 (un)unfolding of the membrane-bound proteins.",

Resonance energy transfer approaches represent a promising avenue to directly probe these interactions in real time. The present study aims at establishing a proof of principle that bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) can be used to study the regulation of protein-protein interaction in cells from transgenic animals. A transgenic mouse line coexpressing the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor fused to Renilla luciferase (beta(2)AR-Rluc) and beta arrestin-2 fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP2-beta arr2) was generated. The fusion proteins were found to be functional in the transgenic animals and the beta(2)AR-Rluc maintained pharmacological properties, comparable to that of the native receptor. Sufficiently high luminescence signal was generated to allow detection of BRET in testis cells where the beta(2)AR-Rluc transgene was expressed at levels significantly higher than that of the endogenous receptor in this tissue but remain within physiological range when compared with other beta(2)AR-expressing tissues. Stimulation with a beta-adrenergic agonist led to a significant dose- and time-dependent increase in BRET, which reflected ligand-promoted recruitment of beta arr2 to the receptor. Our study demonstrates that BRET can be used to monitor the dynamic regulation of protein-protein interactions in cells derived from transgenic mice.",

The main features to learn from known 3-D structures of protein-protein complexes and the extensive literature which analyzes them computationally and experimentally include the interaction details which permit undertaking structure-based drug discovery, the evolution of complexes and their interactions, the consequences of alterations such as post-translational modifications, ligand binding, disease causing mutations, host pathogen interactions, oligomerization, aggregation and the roles of disorder, dynamics, allostery and more to the protein and the cell. This review highlights some of the recent advances in these areas, including design, inhibition and prediction of protein-protein complexes. The field is broad, and much work has been carried out in these areas, making it challenging to cover it in its entirety. Much of this is due to the fast increase in the number of molecules whose structures have been determined experimentally and the vast increase in computational power.

        "abstract": "Interactions between proteins are often sufficiently weak that their study through the use of conventional structural techniques becomes problematic. Of the few techniques capable of providing experimental measures of weak protein-protein interactions, perhaps the most useful is the second virial coefficient, B22, which quantifies a protein solution's deviations from ideal behavior. It has long been known that B22 can in principle be computed, but only very recently has it been demonstrated that such calculations can be performed using protein models of true atomic detail (Biophys. J. 1998, 75:2469\u20132477). The work reported here extends these previous efforts in an attempt to develop a transferable energetic model capable of reproducing the experimental trends obtained for two different proteins over a range of pH and ionic strengths. We describe protein-protein interaction energies by a combination of three separate terms: (i) an electrostatic interaction term based on the use of effective charges, (ii) a term describing the electrostatic desolvation that occurs when charged groups are buried by an approaching protein partner, and (iii) a solvent-accessible surface area term that is used to describe contributions from van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions. The magnitude of the third term is governed by an adjustable, empirical parameter, \u03b3, that is altered to optimize agreement between calculated and experimental values of B22. The model is applied separately to the proteins lysozyme and chymotrypsinogen, yielding optimal values of \u03b3 that are almost identical. There are, however, clear difficulties in reproducing B22 values at the extremes of pH. Explicit calculation of the protonation states of ionizable amino acids in the 200 most energetically favorable protein-protein structures suggest that these difficulties are due to a neglect of the protonation state changes that can accompany complexation. Proper reproduction of the pH dependence of B22 will, therefore, almost certainly require that account be taken of these protonation state changes. Despite this problem, the fact that almost identical \u03b3 values are obtained from two different proteins suggests that the basic energetic formulation used here, which can be evaluated very rapidly, might find use in dynamical simulations of weak protein-protein interactions at intermediate pH values.",

Here we establish the efficient synthesis of protein-DNA conjugates for several members of a small family of GTPases. The family of Rab/Ypt GTPases is intimately involved in vesicular trafficking in yeast and serves as a model for the much larger group of analogous human proteins, the Rab protein family, with more than 60 members. The Ypt-DNA hybrid molecules described here are used for DNA-directed immobilization on glass- and silica-based microarrays. Methods for the detection of protein-DNA conjugates, as well as approaches for nucleotide exchange and distinguishing between GDP- and GTP-bound Ypts on microarrays, are reported. The high specificity of different Rab/Ypt-effector interactions, which also depends on the bound nucleotide, is shown by fluorescence readout of microarrays. Furthermore, initial experiments demonstrate that direct readout by mass spectrometry can be achieved with commercially available instruments. These developments will significantly contribute to the elucidation of complex transport networks in eukaryotic cells.",

        "abstract": "Protein\u2013protein interactions are crucial for the vast majority of biological processes. To fully understand these processes therefore requires methods for identifying protein interactions within the complex cellular environment. To isolate interacting proteins, we have developed a simple and reliable genetic selection by exploiting the inbuilt \u201chitchhiker\u201d mechanism of the Escherichia coli twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway. This method is based on the unique ability of the Tat system to effi ciently co-localize noncovalent complexes of two folded polypeptides to the periplasmic space of E. coli . The genetic selection is comprised of two engineered fusion proteins: an N-terminal Tat signal peptide fused to the protein of interest, and the known or putative partner protein fused to mature TEM-1 \u03b2 -lactamase. The effi ciency with which co- localized \u03b2 -lactamase chimeras are exported in the periplasm, and thus confer ampicillin resistance to cells, is directly linked to the relative binding affi nity of the protein-ligand system. Thus, ampicillin resistance can be used as a convenient readout for identifying and optimizing protein interactions in E. coli. Furthermore, because Tat substrates must be correctly folded for export, our method favors the identifi cation of soluble, non-aggregating, protease-resistant protein pairs. Overall, we anticipate that this new selection tool will be useful for discovering and engineering protein drugs, protein complexes for structural biology, factors that inhibit PPIs, and components for synthetic biology.",

Ectopic expression of the Antennapedia (ANTP) homeodomain protein in Drosophila imaginal discs induces distinct phenotypes, including an antenna-to-leg transformation and eye reduction. We have proposed that the eye loss phenotype is a consequence of a negative posttranslational control mechanism because of direct protein-protein interactions between ANTP and Eyeless (EY). In the present work, we analyzed the effect of various ANTP homeodomain mutations for their interaction with EY and for head development. Contrasting with the eye loss phenotype, we provide evidence that the antenna-to-leg transformation involves ANTP DNA-binding activity. In a complementary genetic screen performed in yeast, we isolated mutations located in the N terminus of the ANTP homeodomain that inhibit direct interactions with EY without abolishing DNA binding in vitro and in vivo. In a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, we detected the ANTP-EY interaction in vivo, these interactions occurring through the paired domain and/or the homeodomain of EY. These results demonstrate that the homeodomain supports multiple molecular regulatory functions in addition to protein-DNA and protein-RNA interactions; it is also involved in protein-protein interactions.",

Small-scale fluctuations are present even in globular proteins, and alternative conformations can have a significant influence on the binding process. However, flexibility becomes highly prominent in complexes involving intrinsically disordered proteins. The importance of disordered regions in protein interactions has been recognized only relatively recently. In this survey we examine the basic properties of the complexes of disordered and ordered proteins from three different directions. The comparison of the interface properties shows that although disordered proteins can also adopt well-defined conformations in their bound form, their inherently dynamic nature is cast into their complexes. Furthermore, an overview of prediction methods indicates that disordered proteins as well as their binding regions can be recognized from the amino acid sequence by capturing the basic biophysical properties of these segments. Finally, we propose the generalization of the 'energy landscape model' for the description of complex formation that can help to put the various types of protein associations on a common ground.",

        "abstract": "When Othello concluded, on the basis of flimsy evidence, that Desdemona had indulged in inappropriate physical interactions, great tragedy ensued. We believe that many reported protein interactions are similarly based on insufficient data, and therefore risk skewing the literature. This is particularly relevant in the burgeoning field of bioinformatics, in which protein-interaction maps are constructed from published data.  It has become dangerously acceptable to conclude that proteins interact directly provided that (i) the interaction is biologically plausible; (ii) the proteins are co-expressed; and (iii) an interaction is demonstrated by glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pulldowns and/or co-immunoprecipitations (co-IPs). Indeed, the co-IP is becoming something of a \u2018gold standard\u2019. For example, the ultimate criterion for reliability in the Molecular Interactions Database (MINT; http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/mint/) is the existence of co-IP data.  Over the past eight years, we have used biophysical techniques to follow up not, vert, similar20 reported protein\u2013protein interactions (predominantly between transcriptional regulators) and have found that less than half of the published interactions could be validated. We conclude that problems exist with the original methods used to identify new interactions, or with the interpretation of data generated using these methods.  The most obvious caveat with co-IP data is that a positive result does not imply a direct interaction between two proteins \u2013 binding could be mediated by other partners. This point is often ignored in papers, even though false positives arising from DNA-mediated interactions are known (for example in [1]). Others have also noted this shortcoming of co-IPs [2]. In addition, a widespread misconception is that co-IPs from extracts provide in vivo evidence for the existence of an interaction. This is not accurate, particularly when the experiment is carried out using overexpressed proteins in cell lines.  Pulldown-type experiments that rely on GST or other affinity tags can give rise to many problems. On several occasions, we have observed robust GST-pulldowns using bacterial-expressed protein domains, but have not then detected any interaction between the same two domains by NMR or isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Further, we have observed significant changes in the apparent affinity of an interaction in a GST-pulldown following the introduction of a point mutation in one of the proteins, but subsequently failed to see any change in affinity using biophysical methods.  What causes these inconsistencies? There are several possible explanations. For example, one of the proteins might not be properly folded and an artificial interaction might result from the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. This issue is not usually addressed, but in several cases, careful biophysical analyses have confirmed this type of false positive. In one case [3], the problem was probably caused by the inappropriate use of EDTA as a buffer component for a zinc-binding protein (a surprisingly common occurrence [4]). In another case, the DNA-binding properties of the zinc-binding protein Churchill [5] (which had been characterized using a GST fusion construct) could not be reproduced in another laboratory using purified protein. Further scrutiny revealed that the presence of an N-terminal fusion partner disrupted the Churchill fold, exposing a hydrophobic surface that could interact non-specifically with DNA [6]. Similar situations might be considerably more common than researchers appreciate, particularly given the ability of fusion partners such as GST to enhance the solubility of proteins that might be only partially folded. Another possibility is that the environment in a GST-pulldown experiment (i.e. the internal cavities of an agarose bead) might give rise to restricted mobility and therefore enhance the apparent affinity of an interaction. Finally, GST can artificially increase the apparent affinity of a protein for a target \u2013 particularly a nucleic acid \u2013 by virtue of its ability to dimerize [7] and thereby make multiple contacts with the target.  Careful mutagenic analysis can provide some reassurance that an interaction is specific but the common practice of showing deletions that abrogate an interaction is of limited value. If a deletion cuts a folded interaction domain in half then neither half might be sufficient for binding a partner, even though both halves are necessary. Thus, the lack of binding of a deletion mutant does not constitute proof that the deleted part alone is the full binding domain. The more important experiment \u2013 demonstration that the deleted part alone can interact with the partner protein \u2013 is often not reported.  A further issue with both co-IPs and pulldowns is that the experimental conditions (quantities, salt, detergents, blocking agents) can be manipulated to \u2018improve\u2019 the signal over background and lead to the detection of potentially spurious signals.  If GST-pulldowns and co-IP data are not sufficient for claiming the existence of a new partnership, what evidence should we require? We offer the following:  (i) We have found that interactions that can be observed robustly in yeast-two-hybrid assays in both (bait and prey) orientations are more likely to be confirmed in subsequent studies. An advantage of this approach is that unlike in co-IPs and pulldowns, little manipulation of assay conditions is possible.  (ii) Interactions observed in the presence of lysates should be confirmed using purified proteins, after demonstration that the proteins are not aggregated at the concentrations used.  (iii) Biophysical methods provide strong evidence for direct interactions. Several methods can detect weak interactions (Table 1), and the analysis of an interaction by NMR will also confirm correct folding of the proteins and reveal specific molecular details.      Table 1.      Detection limits of common methods for measuring protein interactions     Method Weakest detectable KD Comments     Co-IP NA Sensitivity difficult to judge because of ability to manipulate conditions.     GST-pulldowns ca. 10 mM Rough estimate, but the detection limit will be influenced by conditions.     NMR spectroscopy ca. 1 mM Detects a direct interaction. Additionally, provides structural information.     ITC ca. 100 \u03bcM Detects a direct interaction. Widely used to assess binding affinity.     Yeast-two-hybrid system 10\u2013100 \u03bcM Limit depends on  strain and reporter gene. Less easily manipulated. Best for nuclear proteins.     Surface plasmon resonance ca. 100 \u03bcM Detects a direct interaction. Can also provide kinetic information.      Note that the detection limits achievable in practice will be contingent on the solubility of the proteins.  (iv) GST-pulldown data are useful if point mutations can be found that abrogate an interaction while preserving the structure of the mutated protein.  Biophysical analyses will generally require purified recombinant partner proteins. If an interaction is observed, it is clear that all of the necessary components are present. Because post-translational modifications might be lacking in recombinant proteins, such experiments can alert the researcher to the possibility that interactions might depend on missing modifications. By contrast, co-IPs and pulldowns carried out with in vitro translated proteins usually do not investigate these issues.  It is noteworthy that \u2018weak\u2019 and \u2018non-specific\u2019 interactions are not the same thing. Weak interactions are stoichiometric and can be disrupted by targeted mutations. The distinction between these interactions can normally be made using biophysical analyses, whereas co-IPs, pulldowns and yeast-two-hybrid assays might not distinguish specific from non-specific interactions.  It is somewhat ironic that although protein interactions are often published in highly respected journals on the basis of GST and/or co-IP data, subsequent refutations of interactions (i.e. genuine \u2018negative interactions\u2019) will generally never be published because rigorously disproving an alleged interaction is almost impossible. One suggestion to mitigate this situation is that negative interaction data be available as commentary in databases such as MINT.  In summary, we believe that these issues constitute a warning that many of the protein interactions reported in the literature might not occur as presented, and that the minimum requirements for evidence to assert the existence of a direct protein interaction should be increased. It is likely that many proteins currently implicated in liaisons actually remain unattached and are worthy of further pursuit.  References  1 J.S. Lai and W.

However, due to difficulties in characterizing membrane protein-protein interactions, the nature of the sterol biosynthetic complex as well as in vivo interactions between various enzymes have not been described. We employed a split-ubiquitin membrane protein yeast two-hybrid system to characterize interactions between sterol biosynthetic proteins. Fourteen bait constructs were co-transformed into a reporter yeast strain with 14 prey constructs representing all sterol enzymatic reactions beginning with the synthesis of squalene. Our results not only confirmed several previous interactions, but also allowed us to identify novel interactions. Based on these results, ergosterol biosynthetic enzymes display specific protein-protein interactions forming a functional complex we designate, the ergosome. In this complex, Erg11p, Erg25p, Erg27p, and Erg28p appear to form a core center that can interact with other enzymes in the pathway. Also Erg24p and Erg2p, two enzymes that are sensitive to morpholine antifungals, appear to interact with one another; however, the profile of protein interaction partners appears to be unique. Erg2p and Erg3p, two enzymes catalyzing sequential reactions also appear to have different interaction partners. Our results provide a working model as to how sterol biosynthetic enzymes are topologically organized not only in yeast but in plant and animal systems that share many of these biosynthetic reactions. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The second virial coefficient in SIC is evaluated directly from the measured retention coefficient for the protein using a column packed with resin on which the same protein has been immobilized on the pore surface. One of the challenges in determining the retention coefficient is the evaluation of the dead volume, which is the retention volume that would be measured for a noninteracting solute with the same effective size as the protein of interest. Previous studies of SIC have used a \"dead column\" packed with the same resin but without the immobilized protein to evaluate the dead volume, but this creates several experimental and theoretical challenges. We have developed a new approach using a dextran standard with effective size equal to that of the protein (as determined by size exclusion chromatography). The second virial coefficient was evaluated for a monoclonal antibody over a range of buffer conditions using this new approach. The data were in good agreement with independent measurements obtained by membrane osmometry under conditions dominated by repulsive interactions. The simplicity and accuracy of this method should facilitate the use of self-interaction chromatography for quantifying protein-protein interactions.",

Although originally established as a flow cytometric approach, FRET has been adapted for microscopy, allowing for analysis of sub-cellular co-localization at the single cell level. In this chapter, we provide theoretical introduction to the phenomenon of FRET, and a protocol - including labeling techniques, measurement, and evaluation of microscopy images - of the simplest microscopic FRET approach, acceptor photobleaching FRET. This technique is generally usable for studying protein interactions and requires only a standard confocal laser scanning microscope. To demonstrate the value of image based FRET for testing pharmacological disruption of protein-protein interactions, we show how inhibition of the hetero-dimerization of ErbB2 and ErbB1 by the humanized monoclonal antibody pertuzumab can be validated using this technique.",

Nevertheless, it is an artificial system that is sensitive to errors resulting in the identification of false-positive and false-negative interactions. In this study, plant MADS box transcription factor interactions identified by yeast two-hybrid systems where studied in living plant cells by a technique based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Petunia MADS box proteins were fused to either cyan fluorescent protein or yellow fluorescent protein and transiently expressed in protoplasts followed by FRET-spectral imaging microscopy and FRET-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to detect FRET and hence protein-protein interactions. All petunia MADS box heterodimers identified in yeast were confirmed in protoplasts. However, in contrast to the yeast two-hybrid results, homodimerization was demonstrated in plant cells for three petunia MADS box proteins. Heterodimers were identified between the ovule-specific MADS box protein FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 11 and members of the petunia FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 2 subfamily, which are also expressed in ovules, suggesting that these dimers play a role in ovule development. Furthermore, the role of dimerization in translocation of MADS box protein dimers to the nucleus is demonstrated, and the nuclear localization signal of MADS box proteins has been mapped to the N-terminal region of the MADS domain by means of mutant analyses.",

        "abstract": "Information transfer from activated heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) to downstream effectors occurs through noncovalent protein-protein interactions. Such interactions involve multiple regions of contact between the G protein and the effector. Some of these regions mediate information transfer, as defined by their ability to change the activity of their downstream binding partners, whereas other interactions appear to contribute solely to binding affinity. Such modular configurations occur in functionally diverse proteins such as myosin and a regulator of the double-stranded DNA stimulated protein kinase (PKR) called PACT. In most cases, it appears that both charge complementarity and the architecture of the interacting surfaces provide the appropriate balance between specificity of interactions and their reversibility. Information transfer regions appear to display conformational flexibility in interactions. Such flexible interactions may be essential for the local conformational changes necessary to induce change in activity by an induced fit-type mechanism. Thus, a general mechanism for information transfer by protein-protein interactions could use specific regions that induce conformation changes in the downstream partner. Other binding regions may be arranged within the protein to impart specificity of recognition and thereby maintain overall contact between the partners during the conformational dynamics that occur in the signal-transfer process.",

On the basis of extensive canonical and replica exchange MD simulations, we could transfer these findings to water as the solvent of physiological relevance. We show that rationally designed beta-peptides exhibit a higher folding tendency and a more robust hairpin structure formation in water compared with alpha-peptides. Furthermore, our designed scaffold enables the addition of a wide variety of functions without disrupting the structure. Since hairpins are often involved in protein interactions, the very stable hairpin-like fold of our designed beta-peptides might be used as a lead scaffold for the design of molecules that specifically modulate protein-protein interactions. This is demonstrated by application of this concept to the recognition of proline-rich sequences (PRS) by WW domains, an important interaction in cell signaling. We focus on the possibility to imitate the strands 2 and 3 of any WW domain as a minimal motif to recognize their target sequences PPXY. We conclude that rationally designed beta-peptide hairpins can serve as scaffolds not only to tackle PPII recognition but also to open up a way to influence a wide variety of protein-protein interactions.",

The main idea is based on the cross-correlation analysis of temporal fluorescence intensity fluctuations of two fluorescent proteins to obtain their co-diffusion and relative concentration. But, when performing these experiments, the spectral overlap in the emission of the two colors produces an artifact that corrupts the cross-correlation data: spectral bleed-through. We have shown that problems with cross talk are overcome with Fluorescence Lifetime Correlation Spectroscopy (FLCS). FLCS applied to dual-color cross-correlation, utilizing for example eGFP and mCherry fluorescent proteins, allows the determination of protein-protein interactions in living cells without the need of spectral bleed-through calibration. Here, we present in detail how this methodology can be implemented using a commercial setup (Microtime from PicoQuant, SP8 SMD from Leica or any conventional confocal with PicoQuant TCSPC module, and also with a Becker and Hickl TCSPC module). The dual-color FLCS experimental procedure where the different laser intensities do not have to be controlled during the experiment constitutes a very powerful technique to quantitatively study protein interactions in live samples.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge of protein-protein interaction is useful for elucidating protein function via the concept of 'guilt-by-association'. A statistical learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), has recently been explored for the prediction of protein-protein interactions using artificial shuffled sequences as hypothetical noninteracting proteins and it has shown promising results (Bock, J. R., Gough, D. A., Bioinformatics 2001, 17, 455-460). It remains unclear however, how the prediction accuracy is affected if real protein sequences are used to represent noninteracting proteins. In this work, this effect is assessed by comparison of the results derived from the use of real protein sequences with that derived from the use of shuffled sequences. The real protein sequences of hypothetical noninteracting proteins are generated from an exclusion analysis in combination with subcellular localization information of interacting proteins found in the Database of Interacting Proteins. Prediction accuracy using real protein sequences is 76.9% compared to 94.1% using artificial shuffled sequences. The discrepancy likely arises from the expected higher level of difficulty for separating two sets of real protein sequences than that for separating a set of real protein sequences from a set of artificial sequences. The use of real protein sequences for training a SVM classification system is expected to give better prediction results in practical cases. This is tested by using both SVM systems for predicting putative protein partners of a set of thioredoxin related proteins. The prediction results are consistent with observations, suggesting that real sequence is more practically useful in development of SVM classification system for facilitating protein-protein interaction prediction.",

Yet, each such interaction composes its own unique network, in which vertices represent amino acid residues, and edges represent atomic contacts. Recent studies have shown that analyses of the data encapsulated in these detailed networks may impact predictions of structure-function correlation. Here, we study homologous families of protein-protein interfaces, which share the same fold but vary in sequence. In this context, we address what properties of the network are shared among relatives with different sequences (and hence different atomic interactions) and which are not. Herein, we develop the general mathematical framework needed to compare the modularity of homologous networks. We then apply this analysis to the structural data of a few interface families, including hemoglobin alpha-beta, growth hormone-receptor, and Serine protease-inhibitor. Our results suggest that interface modularity is an evolutionarily conserved property. Hence, protein-protein interfaces can be clustered down to a few modules, with the boundaries being evolutionarily conserved along homologous complexes. This suggests that protein engineering of protein-protein binding sites may be simplified by varying each module, but retaining the overall modularity of the interface.",

Among those proteins the so-called Type IV Coupling Protein plays a central role in the process. One of the best studied members of this family is TrwB, the conjugative coupling protein of R388 plasmid. Previous studies indicated that the transmembrane domain of TrwB plays a role beyond the mere anchoring of the protein to the membrane. TrwB has also been shown to interact with other conjugative proteins, such as the VirB10-like protein of R388 TrwE. The goal of this study is to elucidate the role of the different domains of TrwB and TrwE in their biological function, and in both self- and TrwB-TrwE interactions. To this aim, a series of TrwB and TrwE deletion mutant proteins were constructed. Conjugation and interaction studies revealed that the transmembrane domain of TrwB, and particularly its second transmembrane helix, is needed for TrwB self-interaction and for R388 conjugative transfer and that there are contacts between TrwB and TrwE in the membrane. On the contrary, the lack of the TMD of TrwE does not completely abolish R388 conjugation although the interaction between TrwE-TrwB is lost. These results identify protein-protein interactions inside the membrane needed for T4SS function. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

High-throughput experimental techniques enable the study of protein-protein interactions at the proteome scale through systematic identification of physical interactions among all proteins in an organism. High-throughput protein-protein interaction data, with ever-increasing volume, are becoming the foundation for new biological discoveries. A great challenge to bioinformatics is to manage, analyze, and model these data. In this review, we describe several databases that store, query, and visualize protein-protein interaction data. Comparison between experimental techniques shows that each high-throughput technique such as yeast two-hybrid assay or protein complex identification through mass spectrometry has its limitations in detecting certain types of interactions and they are complementary to each other. In silico methods using protein/DNA sequences, domain and structure information to predict protein-protein interaction can expand the scope of experimental data and increase the confidence of certain protein-protein interaction pairs. Protein-protein interaction data correlate with other types of data, including protein function, subcellular location, and gene expression profile. Highly connected proteins are more likely to be essential based on the analyses of the global architecture of large-scale interaction network in yeast. Use of protein-protein interaction networks, preferably in conjunction with other types of data, allows assignment of cellular functions to novel proteins and derivation of new biological pathways. As demonstrated in our study on the yeast signal transduction pathway for amino acid transport, integration of high-throughput data with traditional biology resources can transform the protein-protein interaction data from noisy information into knowledge of cellular mechanisms.",

So many computational methods have been developed to facilitate the identification of novel PPIs.

In this article, a sequence-based method is proposed by combining a new feature representation using auto covariance (AC) and support vector machine (SVM). AC accounts for the interactions between residues a certain distance apart in the sequence, so this method adequately takes the neighbouring effect into account. When performed on the PPI data of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the method achieved a very promising prediction result. An independent data set of 11,474 yeast PPIs was used to evaluate this prediction model and the prediction accuracy is 88.09%. The performance of this method is superior to those of the existing sequence-based methods, so it can be a useful supplementary tool for future proteomics studies.

One such example is the assembly of active RNA polymerase II transcription elongation complex originating from HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter that involves HIV-1-encoded Tat protein and viral mRNA structure, trans-activation responsive RNA, and human CyclinT1 which is a subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor complex b. By using genetically encoded fluorescent proteins fused with Tat and human CyclinT1, here we demonstrate that human CyclinT1 was diffused throughout the nucleus and specific interactions between Tat and human CyclinT1 altered the localization of human CyclinT1 to specific nuclear foci. We also found that trans-activation responsive RNA enhanced protein-protein interactions between human CyclinT1 and Tat in living cells. Our results highlights the importance of trans-activation responsive RNA as a scaffold for stable and high affinity assembly of two protein partners to form a regulatory switch essential in HIV-1 gene regulation. RNA-mediated assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes could be a general mechanism for stable ribonucleoprotein complex formation and a key step in regulating other cellular processes and viral replication.

In order to fully understand protein functions, a knowledge of protein-protein interactions is necessary. Prediction of PPI is challenging, especially when the three-dimensional structure of interacting partners is not known. Recently, a novel prediction method was proposed by exploiting physical interactions of constituent domains. We propose here a novel knowledge-based prediction method, namely PPI_SVM, which predicts interactions between two protein sequences by exploiting their domain information. We trained a two-class support vector machine on the benchmarking set of pairs of interacting proteins extracted from the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP). The method considers all possible combinations of constituent domains between two protein sequences, unlike most of the existing approaches. Moreover, it deals with both single-domain proteins and multi domain proteins; therefore it can be applied to the whole proteome in high-throughput studies. Our machine learning classifier, following a brainstorming approach, achieves accuracy of 86%, with specificity of 95%, and sensitivity of 75%, which are better results than most previous methods that sacrifice recall values in order to boost the overall precision. Our method has on average better sensitivity combined with good selectivity on the benchmarking dataset.

These techniques detect only a small proportion of all PPIs and are labor intensive and time consuming. Therefore, the development of computational methods capable of predicting PPIs accelerates the pace of discovery of new interactions. This paper reports a machine learning-based prediction model, the Universal In Silico Predictor of Protein-Protein Interactions (UNISPPI), which is a decision tree model that can reliably predict PPIs for all species (including proteins from parasite-host associations) using only 20 combinations of amino acids frequencies from interacting and non-interacting proteins as learning features. UNISPPI was able to correctly classify 79.4% and 72.6% of experimentally supported interactions and non-interacting protein pairs, respectively, from an independent test set. Moreover, UNISPPI suggests that the frequencies of the amino acids asparagine, cysteine and isoleucine are important features for distinguishing between interacting and non-interacting protein pairs. We envisage that UNISPPI can be a useful tool for prioritizing interactions for experimental validation.",

        "abstract": "The osmotic second virial coefficient, B(2), obtained by light scattering from protein solutions has two principal components: the Donnan contribution and a contribution due to protein-protein interactions in the limit of infinite dilution. The Donnan contribution accounts for electroneutrality in a multicomponent solution of (poly)electrolytes. The importance of distinguishing this ideal contribution to B(2) is emphasized, thereby allowing us to model the interaction part of B(2) by molecular computations. The model for protein-protein interactions that we use here extends earlier work (Neal et al., 1998) by accounting for long-range electrostatic interactions and the specific hydration of the protein by strongly associated water molecules. Our model predictions are compared with measurements of B(2) for lysozyme at 25 degrees C over pH from 5.0 to 9.0, and 7-60 mM ionic strength. We find that B(2) is positive at all solution conditions and decreases with increasing ionic strength, as expected, whereas the interaction part of B(2) is negative at all conditions and becomes progressively less negative with increasing ionic strength. Although long-range electrostatic interactions dominate this contribution, particularly at low ionic strength, short-range electrostatic/dispersion interactions with specific hydration are essential for an accurate description of B(2) derived from experiment.",

In this study, we adopted a mammalian two-hybrid system to screen the genome-wide intraviral protein-protein interactions of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and therefrom revealed a number of novel interactions which could be partly confirmed by in vitro biochemical assays. Three pairs of the interactions identified were detected in both directions: non-structural protein (nsp) 10 and nsp14, nsp10 and nsp16, and nsp7 and nsp8. The interactions between the multifunctional nsp10 and nsp14 or nsp16, which are the unique proteins found in the members of Nidovirales with large RNA genomes including coronaviruses and toroviruses, may have important implication for the mechanisms of replication/transcription complex assembly and functions of these viruses. Using a SARS-CoV replicon expressing a luciferase reporter under the control of a transcription regulating sequence, it has been shown that several viral proteins (N, X and SUD domains of nsp3, and nsp12) provided in trans stimulated the replicon reporter activity, indicating that these proteins may regulate coronavirus replication and transcription. Collectively, our findings provide a basis and platform for further characterization of the functions and mechanisms of coronavirus proteins.",

        "abstract": "Recent advance in FTIR spectroscopy has shown the usefulness of 13C uniform isotope labeling in proteins to study protein-protein interactions. 13C uniform isotope labeling can significantly resolve the spectral overlap in the amide I/I\u2032 region in the spectra of protein-protein complexes, and therefore allows more accurate determination of secondary structures of individual protein component in the complex than does the conventional FTIR spectroscopy. Only a limited number of biophysical techniques can be used effectively to obtain structural information of large protein-protein complex in solution. Though X-ray crystallography and NMR have been used to provide structural information of proteins at atomic resolution, they are limited either by the ability of protein to crystallize or the large molecular weight of protein. Vibrational spectroscopy, including FTIR and Raman spectroscopies, has been extensively employed to investigate secondary structures and conformational dynamics of protein-protein complexes. However, significant spectral overlap in the amide I/I\u2032 region in the spectra of protein-protein complexes often hinders the utilization of vibrational spectroscopy in the study of protein-protein complex. In this review, we shall discuss our recent work involving the application of isotope labeled FTIR to the investigation of protein-protein complexes such as cytokine-receptor complexes. One of the examples involves G-CSF/receptor complex. To determine unambiguously the conformations of G-CSF and the receptor in the complex, we have prepared uniformly 13C/15N isotope labeled G-CSF to resolve its amide I\u2032 band from that of its receptor in the IR spectrum of the complex. Conformational changes and structural stability of individual protein subunit in G-CSF/receptor complex have then been investigated by using FTIR spectroscopy (Li et al., Biochemistry 29 (1997), 8849-8859). Another example involves BDNF/trkB complex in which 13C/15N uniformly labeled BDNF is complexed with its receptor trkB (Li et al., Biopolymers 67(1) (2002), 10-19). Interactions of 13C/15N uniformly labeled brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with the extracellular domain of its receptor, trkB, have been investigated by employing FTIR spectroscopy. Conformational changes and structural stability and dynamics of BDNF/trkB complex have been determined unambiguously by FTIR spectroscopy, since amide I/I\u2032 bands of 13C/15N labeled BDNF are resolved from those of the receptor. Together, those studies have shown that isotope edited FTIR spectroscopy can be successfully applied to the determination of protein secondary structures of protein complexes containing either the same or different types of secondary structures. It was observed that 13C/15N uniform labeling also affects significantly the frequency of amide II\u2032 band, which may permit the determination of hydrogen-deuterium exchange in individual subunit of protein-protein complexes.",

Although large amount of protein-protein interaction data for different species has been generated by high-throughput experimental techniques, the number is still limited compared to the total number of possible PPIs. Furthermore, the experimental methods for identifying PPIs are both time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is urgent and challenging to develop automated computational methods to efficiently and accurately predict PPIs. In this article, we propose a novel MapReduce-based parallel SVM model for large-scale predicting protein-protein interactions only using the information of protein sequences. First, the local sequential features represented by autocorrelation descriptor are extracted from protein sequences. Then the MapReduce framework is employed to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in a distributed way, obtaining significant improvement in training time while maintaining a high level of accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed parallel algorithms not only can tackle large-scale PPIs dataset, but also perform well in terms of the evaluation metrics of speedup and accuracy. Consequently, the proposed approach can be considered as a new promising and powerful tools for large-scale predicting PPI with excellent performance and less time. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

Recently, split-Cre fragments have been described that advance control of recombinase activity in mammalian cells. However, whether these fragments can be utilized for monitoring protein-protein interactions has not been reported. In this work, we developed a protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA) based on split-Cre for monitoring and engineering pairwise protein interactions in living Escherichia coli cells. This required creation of a dual-fluorescent reporter plasmid that permits visualization of reconstituted Cre recombinase activity by switching from red to green in the presence of an interacting protein pair. The resulting split-Cre PCA faithfully links cell fluorescence with differences in binding affinity, thereby allowing the facile isolation of high-affinity binders based on phenotype. Given the resolution of its activity and sensitivity to interactions, our system may prove a viable option for poorly expressed or weakly interacting protein pairs that evade detection in other PCA formats. Based on these findings, we anticipate that our split-Cre PCA will become a highly complementary and useful new addition to the protein-protein interaction toolbox.",

Methods for predicting interactions between homogeneous proteins are not appropriate for finding those between heterogeneous proteins since they do not distinguish the interactions between proteins of the same species from those of different species.\\n\\nRESULTS: We developed a new method for representing a protein sequence of variable length in a frequency vector of fixed length, which encodes the relative frequency of three consecutive amino acids of a sequence. We built a support vector machine (SVM) model to predict human proteins that interact with virus proteins. In two types of viruses, human papillomaviruses (HPV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), our SVM model achieved an average accuracy above 80%, which is higher than that of another SVM model with a different representation scheme. Using the SVM model and Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of proteins, we predicted new interactions between virus proteins and human proteins.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Encoding the relative frequency of amino acid triplets of a protein sequence is a simple yet powerful representation method for predicting protein-protein interactions across different species. The representation method has several advantages: (1) it enables a prediction model to achieve a better performance than other representations, (2) it generates feature vectors of fixed length regardless of the sequence length, and (3) the same representation is applicable to different types of proteins.",

These processes are dynamically regulated by a network of proteins. New developments in interaction proteomics and yeast two-hybrid methods allow unbiased detection of interactors.

Reliable predictions of interactions from other data sources such as gene expression measurements would provide a useful route to function annotation. We investigate the global relationship of protein-protein interactions with gene expression. This relationship is studied in four evolutionarily diverse species, for which substantial information regarding their interactions and expression is available: human, mouse, yeast and Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In E.coli the expression of interacting pairs is highly correlated in comparison to random pairs, while in the other three species, the correlation of expression of interacting pairs is only slightly stronger than that of random pairs. To strengthen the correlation, we developed a protocol to integrate ortholog information into the interaction and expression datasets. In all four genomes, the likelihood of predicting protein interactions from highly correlated expression data is increased using our protocol. In yeast, for example, the likelihood of predicting a true interaction, when the correlation is > 0.9, increases from 1.4 to 9.4. The improvement demonstrates that protein interactions are reflected in gene expression and the correlation between the two is strengthened by evolution information. The results establish that co-expression of interacting protein pairs is more conserved than that of random ones.",

First and foremost, when expressed in bacteria alone, or as a fusion, GST is not sequestered in inclusion bodies (in contrast to previous fusion protein systems). Second, GST can be affinity-purified without denaturation because it binds to immobilized glutathione, which provides the basis for simple purification. Consequently, GST fusion proteins are routinely used for antibody generation and purification, protein-protein interaction studies, and biochemical analysis. This article describes the use of GST fusion proteins as probes for the identification of protein-protein interactions.",

To achieve this, 39 selected genes of potential ODV structural proteins were cloned and expressed in the Gal4 yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system. The direct-cross Y2H assays identified 22 interactions comprising 13 binary interactions [HA9-ODV-EC43, ODV-E56-38K, ODV-E56-PIF3, LEF3-helicase, LEF3-alkaline nuclease (AN), GP41-38K, GP41-HA90, 38K-PIF3, 38K-PIF2, VP80-HA100, ODV-E66-PIF3, ODV-E66-PIF2 and PIF3-PIF2] and nine self-associations (IE1, HA44, LEF3, HA66, GP41, CG30, 38K, PIF3 and P24). Five of these interactions - LEF3-helicase and LEF3-AN, and the self-associations of IE1, LEF3 and 38K - have been reported previously in Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus. As HA44 and HA100 were two newly identified ODV proteins of group II viruses, their interactions were further confirmed. The self-association of HA44 was verified with a His pull-down assay and the interaction of VP80-HA100 was confirmed by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. A summary of the protein-protein interactions of baculoviruses reported so far, comprising 68 interactions with 45 viral proteins and five host proteins, is presented, which will facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of baculovirus infection.",

This HTP-YTH system has been applied to the study of protein-protein interactions that are involved in rice defense signal transduction pathways. More than 100 genes involved in plant defense responses were selected from DuPont's rice expressed sequence tag (EST) databases as baits for HTP-YTH screening. Results from YTH screening of eight of these rice genes are presented in this paper. Not only have we identified known protein-protein interactions, but we have also discovered novel interactions, which may ultimately reveal the regulatory network of host defense signal transduction pathways. We have demonstrated that our HTP-YTH method can be used to map protein-protein interaction networks and signal transduction pathways in any system. In combination with other approaches, such efficient YTH screens can help us systemically to study the functions of known and unknown genes in the genomics era.",

Here, we describe a redesigned method to screen transient protein-protein interactions by using a novel signal amplification circuit, which is incorporated into yeast to artificially magnify the signal responding to the interactions. This refined method is based on the previously established G\u03b3 recruitment system, which utilizes yeast G-protein signaling and mating growth selection to screen interacting protein pairs. In the current study, to test the capability of our method, we chose mutants of the Z-domain derived from Staphylococcus\u2003aureus protein\u2003A as candidate proteins, and the Fc region of human IgG as the counterpart. By introduction of an artificial signal amplifier into the previous G\u03b3 recruitment system, the signal transduction responding to transient interactions between Z-domain mutants and the Fc region with significantly low affinity (8.0\u2003\u00d7\u200310(3) \u2003m(-1) ) was successfully amplified in recombinant haploid yeast cells. As a result of zygosis with the opposite mating type of wild-type haploid cells, diploid colonies were vigorously and selectively generated on the screening plates, whereas our previous system rarely produced positive colonies. This new approach will be useful for exploring the numerous transient interactions that remain undefined because of the lack of powerful screening tools for their identification.",

However, substantial non-FRET fluorescence background can obscure small FRET signals, making many potential interactions unobservable by conventional FRET techniques. Here we demonstrate time-resolved microscopy of luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) for live-cell imaging of protein-protein interactions. A luminescent terbium complex, TMP-Lumi4, was introduced into cultured cells using two methods: (i) osmotic lysis of pinocytic vesicles; and (ii) reversible membrane permeabilization with streptolysin O. Upon intracellular delivery, the complex was observed to bind specifically and stably to transgenically expressed Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) fusion proteins. LRET between the eDHFR-bound terbium complex and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was detected as long-lifetime, sensitized GFP emission. Background signals from cellular autofluorescence and directly excited GFP fluorescence were effectively eliminated by imposing a time delay (10 micros) between excitation and detection. Background elimination made it possible to detect interactions between the first PDZ domain of ZO-1 (fused to eDHFR) and the C-terminal YV motif of claudin-1 (fused to GFP) in single microscope images at subsecond time scales. We observed a highly significant (P<10(-6)), six-fold difference between the mean, donor-normalized LRET signal from cells expressing interacting fusion proteins and from control cells expressing noninteracting mutants. The results show that time-resolved LRET microscopy with a selectively targeted, luminescent terbium protein label affords improved speed and sensitivity over conventional FRET methods for a variety of live-cell imaging and screening applications.",

This work describes a fast, flexible and quantitative workflow for the discovery of novel protein-protein interactions. A cleavable cross-linker, dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] (DSP), is utilized to stabilize protein complexes before immunoprecipitation. Protein complex detachment from the antibody is achieved by limited proteolysis. Finally, protein quantitation is performed via (18)O labeling. The workflow has been optimized concerning (i) DSP concentration and (ii) incubation times for limited proteolysis, using the stem cell-associated transcription cofactor ZNF521 as a model target. The interaction of ZNF521 with the core components of the nuclear remodelling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, already reported in the literature, was confirmed. Additionally, interactions with newly discovered molecular partners of potentially relevant functional role, such as ZNF423, Spt16, Spt5, were discovered and validated by Western blotting.",

The existing mammalian systems are unsatisfactory for drug screening due to nonregulated expression of interacting proteins. To construct a tightly regulated system, the tetracycline repressor was fused with the inhibitory KRAB domain as a suppressor. The binding of the suppressor to the tet operator entirely blocked expression of two interacting proteins. When both the inducer doxycycline and drugs were added to the culture, the reporter gene was either activated by interaction of the paired proteins with ineffective drugs or remained silent due to disruption of the protein interactions by the effective drugs. We demonstrate that interactions of the type I receptor for TGFbeta with FKBP12 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with p85 are effectively disrupted by FK506 and EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478, respectively. The power of this system for drug screening was further demonstrated by rapid identification of inhibitors from a druglike library for the receptor kinases.",

        "abstract": "The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) carries out both catalytic and regulatory functions. It catalyzes the transport and phosphorylation of a variety of sugars and sugar derivatives but also carries out numerous regulatory functions related to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate metabolism, to chemotaxis, to potassium transport, and to the virulence of certain pathogens. For these different regulatory processes, the signal is provided by the phosphorylation state of the PTS components, which varies according to the availability of PTS substrates and the metabolic state of the cell. PEP acts as phosphoryl donor for enzyme I (EI), which, together with HPr and one of several EIIA and EIIB pairs, forms a phosphorylation cascade which allows phosphorylation of the cognate carbohydrate bound to the membrane-spanning EIIC. HPr of firmicutes and numerous proteobacteria is also phosphorylated in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by the bifunctional HPr kinase/phosphorylase. PTS-mediated regulatory mechanisms are based either on direct phosphorylation of the target protein or on phosphorylation-dependent interactions. For regulation by PTS-mediated phosphorylation, the target proteins either acquired a PTS domain by fusing it to their N or C termini or integrated a specific, conserved PTS regulation domain (PRD) or, alternatively, developed their own specific sites for PTS-mediated phosphorylation. Protein-protein interactions can occur with either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated PTS components and can either stimulate or inhibit the function of the target proteins. This large variety of signal transduction mechanisms allows the PTS to regulate numerous proteins and to form a vast regulatory network responding to the phosphorylation state of various PTS components.",

However, large quantity of the knowledge often hides in the literature, such as journal articles, reports, books and so on. Many approaches focusing on extracting information from unstructured text, such as pattern matching, shallow and deep parsing, have been proposed especially for extracting protein-protein interactions (Zhou and He, 2008). A semantic parser based on the Hidden Vector State (HVS) model for extracting protein-protein interactions is presented in (Zhou et al., 2008). The HVS model is an extension of the basic discrete Markov model in which context is encoded as a stack-oriented state vector. Maximum Likelihood estimation (MLE) is used to derive the parameters of the HVS model. In this paper, we propose a discriminative approach based on parse error measure to train the HVS model. To adjust the HVS model to achieve minimum parse error rate, the generalized probabilistic descent (GPD) algorithm (Kuo et al., 2002) is used. Experiments have been conducted on the GENIA corpus. The results demonstrate modest improvements when the discriminatively trained HVS model outperforms its MLE trained counterpart by 2.5% in F-measure on the GENIA corpus.",

In this article, an atomic level potential of mean force (PMF) considering volume correction is presented for the prediction of protein-protein binding affinity. The potential is obtained by statistically analyzing X-ray structures of protein-protein complexes in the Protein Data Bank. This approach circumvents the complicated steps of the volume correction process and is very easy to implement in practice. It can obtain more reasonable pair potential compared with traditional PMF and shows a classic picture of nonbonded atom pair interaction as Lennard-Jones potential. To evaluate the prediction ability for protein-protein binding affinity, six test sets are examined. Sets 1-5 were used as test set in five published studies, respectively, and set 6 was the union set of sets 1-5, with a total of 86 protein-protein complexes. The correlation coefficient (R) and standard deviation (SD) of fitting predicted affinity to experimental data were calculated to compare the performance of ours with that in literature. Our predictions on sets 1-5 were as good as the best prediction reported in the published studies, and for union set 6, R = 0.76, SD = 2.24 kcal/mol. Furthermore, we found that the volume correction can significantly improve the prediction ability. This approach can also promote the research on docking and protein structure prediction.",

The  b 2  trends observed for ovalbumin and catalase show that protein interactions become increasingly attractive with decreasing pH. This trend is in good agreement with ovalbumin phase behavior, which was observed to evolve progressively with decreasing pH, leading to formation of amorphous aggregates instead of gel bead-like aggregates, and spherulites instead of needle-like crystals. For both acidic and basic proteins, the aggregate solubility during protein salting-out decreased with decreasing pH, and contrary to what is commonly believed, neither aggregate nor crystal solubility had a minimum at the isoelectric point. \u03b2-Lactoglobulin B was the only protein investigated to show salting-in behavior, and crystals were obtained at low salt concentrations in the vicinity of its isoelectric point. The physical origin of the different trends observed during protein salting-in and salting-out is discussed, and the implications for protein crystallization are emphasized.",

Here we describe a rapid and efficient method for sampling off-rotamer side-chain conformations by torsion space minimization during protein-protein docking starting from discrete rotamer libraries supplemented with side-chain conformations taken from the unbound structures, and show that the new method improves side-chain modeling and increases the energetic discrimination between good and bad models. Analysis of the distribution of side-chain interaction energies within and between the two protein partners shows that the new method leads to more native-like distributions of interaction energies and that the neglect of side-chain entropy produces a small but measurable increase in the number of residues whose interaction energy cannot compensate for the entropic cost of side-chain freezing at the interface. The power of the method is highlighted by a number of predictions of unprecedented accuracy in the recent CAPRI (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions) blind test of protein-protein docking methods.",

The same HhaI dimer interface is also observed in the previously characterized binary (M.HhaI-AdoMet) and ternary (M.HhaI-DNA-AdoHcy) complex structures, crystallized in different space groups. The dimer is characterized either by a non-crystallographic two-fold symmetry or a crystallographic symmetry. The dimer interface involves three segments: the amino-terminal residues 2-8, the carboxy-terminal residues 313-327, and the linker (amino acids 179-184) between the two functional domains--the catalytic methylation domain and the DNA target recognition domain. Both the amino- and carboxy-terminal segments are part of the methylation domain. We also examined protein-protein interactions of other structurally characterized DNA MTases, which are often found as a 2-fold related 'dimer' with the largest dimer interface area for the group-beta MTases. A possible evolutionary link between the Type I and Type II restriction-modification systems is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Recombination-dependent replication is an integral part of the process by which double-strand DNA breaks are repaired to maintain genome integrity. It also serves as a means to replicate genomic termini. We reported previously on the reconstitution of a recombination-dependent replication system using purified herpes simplex virus type 1 proteins (Nimonkar A. V., and Boehmer, P. E. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 100, 10201-10206). In this system, homologous pairing by the viral single-strand DNA-binding protein (ICP8) is coupled to DNA synthesis by the viral DNA polymerase and helicase-primase in the presence of a DNA-relaxing enzyme. Here we show that DNA synthesis in this system is dependent on the viral polymerase processivity factor (UL42). Moreover, although DNA synthesis is strictly dependent on topoisomerase I, it is only stimulated by the viral helicase in a manner that requires the helicase-loading protein (UL8). Furthermore, we have examined the dependence of DNA synthesis in the viral system on species-specific protein-protein interactions. Optimal DNA synthesis was observed with the herpes simplex virus type 1 replication proteins, ICP8, DNA polymerase (UL30/UL42), and helicase-primase (UL5/UL52/UL8). Interestingly, substitution of each component with functional homologues from other systems for the most part did not drastically impede DNA synthesis. In contrast, recombination-dependent replication promoted by the bacteriophage T7 replisome was disrupted by substitution with the replication proteins from herpes simplex virus type 1. These results show that although DNA synthesis performed by the T7 replisome is dependent on cognate protein-protein interactions, such interactions are less important in the herpes simplex virus replisome.",

We find that both parsers perform worse on biomedical English than previously reported on general English.

Only one ligand-receptor interaction has been identified, that between P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein (PvDBP) and the erythrocyte Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC), and strain-specific immune responses to PvDBP make it a complex vaccine target. To broaden the repertoire of potential P. vivax merozoite-stage vaccine targets, we exploited a recent breakthrough in expressing full-length ectodomains of Plasmodium proteins in a functionally-active form in mammalian cells and initiated a large-scale study of P. vivax merozoite proteins that are potentially involved in reticulocyte binding and invasion.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We selected 39 P. vivax proteins that are predicted to localize to the merozoite surface or invasive secretory organelles, some of which show homology to P. falciparum vaccine candidates. Of these, we were able to express 37 full-length protein ectodomains in a mammalian expression system, which has been previously used to express P. falciparum invasion ligands such as PfRH5. To establish whether the expressed proteins were correctly folded, we assessed whether they were recognized by antibodies from Cambodian patients with acute vivax malaria. IgG from these samples showed at least a two-fold change in reactivity over na\u00efve controls in 27 of 34 antigens tested, and the majority showed heat-labile IgG immunoreactivity, suggesting the presence of conformation-sensitive epitopes and native tertiary protein structures. Using a method specifically designed to detect low-affinity, extracellular protein-protein interactions, we confirmed a predicted interaction between P. vivax 6-cysteine proteins P12 and P41, further suggesting that the proteins are natively folded and functional. This screen also identified two novel protein-protein interactions, between P12 and PVX_110945, and between MSP3.10 and MSP7.1, the latter of which was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We produced a new library of recombinant full-length P. vivax ectodomains, established that the majority of them contain tertiary structure, and used them to identify predicted and novel protein-protein interactions. As well as identifying new interactions for further biological studies, this library will be useful in identifying P. vivax proteins with vaccine potential, and studying P. vivax malaria pathogenesis and immunity.\\n\\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00663546.",

Interaction of hsp90 with human glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) was found by genetic screening, co-immunoprecipitation, and in vitro binding experiments. This interaction was sensitive to the hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, and also ATP, suggesting that the chaperone activity of hsp90 is required for interaction with EPRS. Interaction of EPRS with hsp90 was targeted to the region of three tandem repeats linking the two catalytic domains of EPRS that is also responsible for the interaction with isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IRS). Interaction of EPRS and IRS also depended on the activity of hsp90, implying that their association was mediated by hsp90. EPRS and IRS form a macromolecular protein complex with at least six other tRNA synthetases and three cofactors. hsp90 preferentially binds to most of the complex-forming enzymes rather than those that are not found in the complex. In addition, inactivation of hsp90 interfered with the in vivo incorporation of the nascent aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases into the multi-ARS complex. Thus, hsp90 appears to mediate protein-protein interactions of mammalian tRNA synthetases.",

        "abstract": "Glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides play critical roles in many cellular processes, ranging from viral invasion and angiogenesis to spinal cord injury. Their diverse biological activities are derived from an ability to regulate a remarkable number of proteins. However, few methods exist for the rapid identification of glycosaminoglycan-protein interactions and for studying the potential of glycosaminoglycans to assemble multimeric protein complexes. Here, we report a multidisciplinary approach that combines new carbohydrate microarray and computational modeling methodologies to elucidate glycosaminoglycan-protein interactions. The approach was validated through the study of known protein partners for heparan and chondroitin sulfate, including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and its receptor FGFR1, the malarial protein VAR2CSA, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). We also applied the approach to identify previously undescribed interactions between a specific sulfated epitope on chondroitin sulfate, CS-E, and the neurotrophins, a critical family of growth factors involved in the development, maintenance, and survival of the vertebrate nervous system. Our studies show for the first time that CS is capable of assembling multimeric signaling complexes and modulating neurotrophin signaling pathways. In addition, we identify a contiguous CS-E-binding site by computational modeling that suggests a potential mechanism to explain how CS may promote neurotrophin-tyrosine receptor kinase (Trk) complex formation and neurotrophin signaling. Together, our combined microarray and computational modeling methodologies provide a general, facile means to identify new glycosaminoglycan-protein-protein interactions, as well as a molecular-level understanding of those complexes.",

The classical view of crowding emphasizes the volume exclusion effect that generally favors compact, native states. Here, results from molecular dynamics simulations and NMR experiments show that protein crowders may destabilize native states via protein-protein interactions. In the model system considered here, mixtures of villin head piece and protein G at high concentrations, villin structures become increasingly destabilized upon increasing crowder concentrations. The denatured states observed in the simulation involve partial unfolding as well as more subtle conformational shifts. The unfolded states remain overall compact and only partially overlap with unfolded ensembles at high temperature and in the presence of urea. NMR measurements on the same systems confirm structural changes upon crowding based on changes of chemical shifts relative to dilute conditions. An analysis of protein-protein interactions and energetic aspects suggests the importance of enthalpic and solvation contributions to the crowding free energies that challenge an entropic-centered view of crowding effects.",

To this purpose the application of a manageable and simple assay in an appropriate biological system is of major concern. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is a novel method to analyze protein-protein interactions in vivo. The assay is based on the observation that N- and C-terminal subfragments of the yellow-fluorescent protein (YFP) can only reconstitute a functional fluorophore when they are brought into tight contact. Thus, proteins can be fused to the YFP subfragments and the interaction of the fusion proteins can be monitored by epifluorescence microscopy. Pairs of interacting proteins were tested after transient cotransfection in etiolated mustard seedlings, which is a well characterized plant model system for light signal transduction. BiFC could be demonstrated with the F-box protein EID1 (empfindlicher im dunkelroten Licht 1) and the Arabidopsis S-phase kinase-related protein 1 (ASK1). The interaction of both proteins was specific and strictly dependent on the presence of an intact F-box domain. Our studies also demonstrate that etiolated mustard seedlings provide a versatile transient assay system to study light-induced subcellular localization events.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play important roles in various cellular processes. However, the low quality of current PPI data detected from high-throughput screening techniques has diminished the potential usefulness of the data. We need to develop a method to address the high data noise and incompleteness of PPI data, namely, to filter out inaccurate protein interactions (false positives) and predict putative protein interactions (false negatives). RESULTS: In this paper, we proposed a novel two-step method to integrate diverse biological and computational sources of supporting evidence for reliable PPIs. The first step, interaction binning or InterBIN, groups PPIs together to more accurately estimate the likelihood (Bin-Confidence score) that the protein pairs interact for each biological or computational evidence source. The second step, interaction classification or InterCLASS, integrates the collected Bin-Confidence scores to build classifiers and identify reliable interactions. CONCLUSIONS: We performed comprehensive experiments on two benchmark yeast PPI datasets. The experimental results showed that our proposed method can effectively eliminate false positives in detected PPIs and identify false negatives by predicting novel yet reliable PPIs. Our proposed method also performed significantly better than merely using each of individual evidence sources, illustrating the importance of integrating various biological and computational sources of data and evidence.",

        "abstract": "Protein domains are functional and structural units of proteins. Therefore, identification of domain-domain interactions (DDIs) can provide insight into the biological functions of proteins. In this article, we propose a novel discriminative approach for predicting DDIs based on both protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and the derived information of non-PPIs. We make a threefold contribution to the work in this area. First, we take into account non-PPIs explicitly and treat the domain combinations that can discriminate PPIs from non-PPIs as putative DDIs. Second, DDI identification is formalized as a feature selection problem, in which it tries to find out a minimum set of informative features (i.e., putative DDIs) that discriminate PPIs from non-PPIs, which is plausible in biology and is able to predict DDIs in a systematic and accurate manner. Third, multidomain combinations including two-domain combinations are taken into account in the proposed method, where multidomain cooperations may help proteins to interact with each other. Numerical results on several DDI prediction benchmark data sets show that the proposed discriminative method performs comparably well with other top algorithms with respect to overall performance, and outperforms other methods in terms of precision. The PPI data sets used for prediction of DDIs and prediction results can be found at http://csb.shu.edu.cn/dipd.",

TCS require a conserved protein-protein interaction between partner transmitter and receiver domains for signal transduction. The complex prokaryote Myxococcus xanthus possesses an unusually large number of TCS genes, many of which have no obvious interaction partners. Interactions between TCS domains of M. xanthus were assessed using a yeast two-hybrid assay, in which domains were expressed as both bait and prey translational fusions. LacZ production was monitored as an indicator of protein-protein interaction, and the strength of interactions classified as weak, medium or strong. Two-hundred and fifty-five transmitter-receiver domain interactions were observed (46 strong), allowing identification of potential signalling partners for individual M. xanthus TCS proteins. In addition, the dataset provides interesting 'meta' information. For instance, many strong interactions were identified between different transmitter domain pairs (34) and receiver domain pairs (23), suggesting a surprisingly large degree of heterodimerisation of these domains. Proteins in our dataset that exhibited similar 'profiles' of interactions, often shared a similar biological function, suggesting that interaction profiles can provide information on biological function, even considering sets of homologous domains.",

        "abstract": "Coiled coils are bundles of intertwined alpha-helices that provide protein-protein interaction sites for the dynamic assembly and disassembly of protein complexes. The coiled-coil motif combines structural versatility and adaptability with mechanical strength and specificity. Multimeric proteins that rely on coiled-coil interactions are structurally and functionally very diverse, ranging from simple homodimeric transcription factors to elaborate heteromultimeric scaffolding clusters. Several coiled-coil-bearing proteins are of outstanding pharmacological importance, most notably SNARE proteins involved in vesicular trafficking of neurotransmitters and viral fusion proteins. Together with their crucial roles in many physiological and pathological processes, the structural simplicity and reversible nature of coiled-coil associations render them a promising target for pharmacological interference, as successfully exemplified by botulinum toxins and viral fusion inhibitors.The alpha-helical coiled coil is a ubiquitous protein domain that mediates highly specific homo- and heteromeric protein-protein interactions among a wide range of proteins. The coiled-coil motif was first proposed by Crick on the basis of X-ray diffraction data on alpha-keratin more than 50 years ago (Crick 1952, 1953) and nowadays belongs to the best-characterized protein interaction modules. By definition, a coiled coil is an oligomeric protein assembly consisting of several right-handed amphipathic alpha-helices that wind around each other into a superhelix (or a supercoil) in which the hydrophobic surfaces of the constituent helices are in continuous contact, forming a hydrophobic core. Both homomeric and heteromeric coiled coils with different stoichiometries are possible, and the helices can be aligned in either a parallel or an antiparallel topology (Harbury et al. 1993, 1994). Stoichiometry and topology are governed by the primary structure, that is, the sequence of the polypeptide chains, and a given protein can participate in multiple assembly-disassembly equilibria among several coiled coils differing in stoichiometry and topology (Portwich et al. 2007).Protein complexes whose oligomeric quaternary structures - and, hence, biological activities - depend on coiled-coil interactions include transcription factors, tRNA synthetases (Biou et al. 1994; Cusack et al. 1990), cytoskeletal and signal-transduction proteins, enzyme complexes, proteins involved in vesicular trafficking, viral coat proteins, and membrane proteins (Langosch and Heringa 1998). It is thus not surprising that coiled-coil motifs have gained great attention as potential targets for modulating protein-protein interactions implicated in a large number of diseases.In this review, we will first discuss some fundamental functional and structural aspects of a simple and well-characterized representative of coiled-coil transcription factors (Sect. 1) before considering two more complex coiled coils found in scaffolding proteins involved in mitosis and meiosis and vesicular trafficking Sect. 2). This will set the stage for addressing the role of coiled coils in viral infection (Sect. 3) as well as strategies of interfering with such protein-protein interactions therapeutically (Sect. 4 and 5).",

Here we carried out affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry to reconstruct an interaction network among 12 chromosomally encoded bait and 90 prey proteins based on 134 bait-prey interactions identified to be of high confidence. Protein-protein interaction data are often plagued by the lack of adequate controls and replication analyses necessary to assess confidence in the results, including identification of potential false positives. We addressed these issues through the use of biological replication, exponentially modified protein abundance indices, results from an experimental negative control, and a statistical test to assign confidence to each putative interacting pair applicable to small interaction data studies. We discuss the biological significance of metabolic features of D. vulgaris revealed by these protein-protein interaction data and the observed protein modifications. These include the distinct role of the putative carbon monoxide-induced hydrogenase, unique electron transfer routes associated with different oxidoreductases, and the possible role of methylation in regulating sulfate reduction.",

Control experiments can be used to limit false-positive results, but in many cases, there are still a surprising number of prey proteins that appear to copurify specifically with the bait. Here, we have identified one source of false-positive interactions in such studies. We have found that a combination of: 1) the variable sequence of the C-terminus of the bait with 2) a C-terminal valine \"cloning scar\" present in a commercially available ORF library, can in some cases create a peptide motif that results in the aberrant co-purification of endogenous cellular proteins. Control experiments may not identify false positives resulting from such artificial motifs, as aberrant binding depends on sequences that vary from one bait to another. It is possible that such cryptic protein binding might occur in other systems using affinity tagged proteins; this study highlights the importance of conducting careful follow-up studies where novel protein-protein interactions are suspected.",

Among the soluble phosphoproteins detected in plastids, three forms of starch branching enzyme (SBE) were phosphorylated in amyloplasts (SBEI, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb), and both forms of SBE in chloroplasts (SBEI and SBEIIa) were shown to be phosphorylated after sequencing of the immunoprecipitated (32)P-labeled phosphoproteins using quadrupole-orthogonal acceleration time of flight mass spectrometry. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphorylated SBE forms indicated that the proteins are all phosphorylated on Ser residues. Analysis of starch granule-associated phosphoproteins after incubation of intact amyloplasts with gamma-(32)P-ATP indicated that the granule-associated forms of SBEII and two granule-associated forms of starch synthase (SS) are phosphorylated, including SSIIa. Measurement of SBE activity in amyloplasts and chloroplasts showed that phosphorylation activated SBEIIa (and SBEIIb in amyloplasts), whereas dephosphorylation using alkaline phosphatase reduced the catalytic activity of both enzymes. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation had no effect on the measurable activity of SBEI in amyloplasts and chloroplasts, and the activities of both granule-bound forms of SBEII in amyloplasts were unaffected by dephosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation experiments using peptide-specific anti-SBE antibodies showed that SBEIIb and starch phosphorylase each coimmunoprecipitated with SBEI in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, suggesting that these enzymes may form protein complexes within the amyloplast in vivo. Conversely, dephosphorylation of immunoprecipitated protein complex led to its disassembly. This article reports direct evidence that enzymes of starch metabolism (amylopectin synthesis) are regulated by protein phosphorylation and indicate a wider role for protein phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions in the control of starch anabolism and catabolism.",

In spite of the importance of protein-protein interactions among these transcription factors, the mechanisms involved in these interactions are largely unknown. In this study, we isolated six intragenic suppressors of an auxin insensitive mutant, Osiaa23. Among these suppressors, Osiaa23-R5 successfully rescued all the defects of the mutant. Sequence analysis revealed that an amino acid substitution occurred in the Tryptophan (W) residue in Domain IV of Osiaa23. Yeast two-hybrid experiments showed that the mutation in Domain IV prevents the protein-protein interactions between Osiaa23 and OsARFs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the W residue is conserved in both OsIAAs and OsARFs. Next, we performed site-specific amino acid substitutions within Domain IV of OsARFs, and the conserved W in Domain IV was exchanged by Serine (S). The mutated OsARF(WS)s can be released from the inhibition of Osiaa23 and maintain the transcriptional activities. Expression of OsARF(WS)s in Osiaa23 mutant rescued different defects of the mutant. Our results suggest a previously unknown importance of Domain IV in both families and provide an indirect way to investigate functions of OsARFs.",

Arginine is very sensitive to radiolytic oxidation, giving rise to a characteristic product with a 43 Da mass reduction as a result of the loss of guanidino group and conversion to gamma-glutamyl semialdehyde, consistent with previous metal-catalyzed oxidation studies. Histidine was oxidized to generate a mixture of products with characteristic mass changes primarily involving rupture of and addition to the imidazole ring. Lysine was converted to hydroxylysine or carbonylysine by radiolysis. The development of methods to probe these residues due to their high frequency of occurrence, their typical presence on the protein surface, and their frequent participation in protein-protein interactions considerably extends the utility of protein footprinting.",

        "abstract": "Hydroxyl radicals generated from a variety of methods, including not only synchrotron radiation but also Fenton reactions involving chelated iron, have become an accepted macromolecular footprinting tool. Hydroxyl radicals react with proteins via multiple mechanisms that lead to both polypeptide backbone cleavage events and side chain modifications (e.g., hydroxylation and carbonyl formation). The use of site-specifically tethered iron chelates can reveal protein-protein interactions, but the interpretation of such experiments will be strengthened by improving our understanding of how hydroxyl radicals produced at a point on a protein react with other protein sites. We have developed methods for monitoring carbonyl formation on proteins as a function of distance from a hydroxyl generator, iron-(S)-1-[p-(bromoacetamido)benzyl]EDTA (FeBABE), conjugated to an engineered cysteine residue. After activation of the chelated iron with ascorbate and peroxide produces new protein carbonyl groups, their positions can be identified using element-coded affinity tagging (ECAT), with carbonyl-specific tags {e.g., rare earth chelates of (S)-2-[4-(2-aminooxy)acetamidobenzyl]-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (AOD)} that allow for affinity purification, identification, and relative quantitation of oxidation sites using mass spectrometry. Intraprotein oxidation of single-cysteine mutants of Escherichia coli sigma(70) by tethered FeBABE was used to calibrate the reach of hydroxyl radical by comparison to the crystal structure; the application to protein-protein interactions was demonstrated using the same sigma(70) FeBABE conjugates in complexes with the RNA polymerase core enzyme. The results provide fundamental information for interpreting protein footprinting experiments in other systems.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microsomal CYPs are integral membrane proteins that are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is critical for their function. CYPs are co-translationally inserted into the rough ER membrane and are then either directly retained in the smooth ER or retained by a retrieval mechanism or targeted for ER-associated degradation. Protein-protein interactions are likely to be important for proper cellular targeting of CYPs. OBJECTIVE: Progress in understanding the mechanisms of cellular targeting and ER retention of CYPs is reviewed with emphasis on the role of protein-protein interactions. Possible mechanisms of direct retention are the incorporation of CYPs into an immobile complex in the ER membrane, homooligomerization that prevents inclusion in transport vesicles, exclusion of CYP monomers from transport vesicles or targeting of CYPs to an ER subdomain away from sites of transport vesicle formation. Degradation of CYPs occurs either by lysosomal mechanisms or by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. METHODS: The scope of this review includes studies published in the research literature that have defined the targeting of CYPs to the ER, the retention of CYPs in the ER and the degradation of CYPs. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Targeting of CYPs to the ER is well understood and involves signal recognition particle-mediated delivery to the sec61 complex. The mechanism of ER retention of CYPs remains unclear, but self-oligomerization or binding to large immobile networks do not underlie ER retention of CYPs. An ER retention 'receptor' remains elusive, but BAP31 is important for the proper cellular localization of CYPs and Dap1p is a CYP-binding protein that is a candidate for such a receptor. Identification of protein binding partners of CYPs will be critical to understanding the mechanism of ER retention.",

The presence of a well-defined binding pocket on the surface of protein complexes, particularly at their interface, can be used for docking-based virtual screening of chemical libraries.

These programs enable the scoring of these pockets to determine whether they are suitable to accommodate high-affinity small molecules. Virtual screening of commercial or combinatorial libraries can be carried out to enrich these libraries and select compounds for further experimental validation. In virtual screening, a compound library is docked to the target protein. The resulting structures are scored and ranked for the selection and experimental validation of top candidates. Molecular docking has been implemented in a number of computer programs such as AutoDock Vina. We select a set of protein-protein interactions that have been successfully inhibited with small molecules in the past. Several computer programs are applied to identify pockets on the surface, and molecular docking is conducted in an attempt to reproduce the binding pose of the inhibitors.

However, existing antibody-based methods for phosphorylation detection have been found to lack specificity, and methods developed for examining PPIs in vitro cannot be easily adapted for tissues samples. In this study, we eliminated some of these limitations by developing a specific immunohistochemical staining method that uses \"dual binders\" (DBs), which are bispecific detection agents consisting of two Fab fragment molecules joined by a flexible linker, to detect PPIs and protein phosphorylation. We engineered DBs by selecting Fab fragments with fast off-rate kinetics, which allowed us to demonstrate that stable target binding was achieved only upon simultaneous, cooperative binding to both epitopes. We show that DBs specifically detect the activated HER2/HER3 complex in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cancer cells and exhibit superior detection specificity for phospho-HER3 compared to the corresponding monoclonal antibody. Overall, the performance of DBs makes them attractive tools for future development for clinical applications. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

In the present study, we report the crystal structure of a macromolecular complex, in which human transthyretin, human holo-retinol-binding protein and a murine anti-retinol-binding protein Fab are assembled according to a 1 : 2 : 2 stoichiometry. The main interactions, both polar and apolar, between retinol-binding protein and transthyretin involve the retinol hydroxyl group and a limited number of solvent exposed residues. The relevance of transthyretin residues in complex formation with retinol-binding protein has been examined by mutational analysis, and the structural consequences of some transthyretin point mutations affecting protein-protein recognition have been investigated. Despite a few exceptions, in general, the substitution of a hydrophilic for a hydrophobic side chain in contact regions results in a decrease or even a loss of binding affinity, thus revealing the importance of interfacial hydrophobic interactions and a high degree of complementarity between retinol-binding protein and transthyretin. The effect is particularly evident when the mutation affects an interacting residue present in two distinct subunits of transthyretin participating simultaneously in two interactions with a retinol-binding protein molecule. This is the case of the amyloidogenic I84S replacement, which abolishes the interaction with retinol-binding protein and is associated with an altered retinol-binding protein plasma transport in carriers of this mutation. Remarkably, some of the residues in mutated human transthyretin that weaken or abolish the interaction with retinol-binding protein are present in piscine transthyretin, consistent with the lack of interaction between retinol-binding protein and transthyretin in fish.",

Here, we employ mechanism-based crosslinkers to successfully probe ACP and ketosynthase (KS) domain interactions in NR-PKSs. We found that crosslinking efficiency is closely correlated with the strength of ACP??KS interactions and that KS demonstrates strong starter unit selectivity. We further identified positively charged surface residues by KS mutagenesis, which mediates key interactions with the negatively charged ACP surface. Such complementary/matching contact pairs can serve as \"adapter surfaces\" for future efforts to generate new polyketides using NR-PKSs. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Protein-protein interactions were investigated using the yeast two-hybrid system. A strong protein-protein interaction was detected between the transmembrane activation protein Wzd and the protein tyrosine kinase Wze. Weaker protein-protein interactions were detected between two duplicate Wze proteins and between Wze and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase Wzh. Protein-protein interactions involving a Wzd/Wze fusion protein and Wzd and Wze may indicate that these proteins form multi-protein complexes. All combinations of the Wzh, Wzd, Wze, Wzg (regulation), CpsE (glycosyl-1-phosphate transferase), CpsS (polymerization), CpsL (unknown), CpsW (regulation) and CpsU (membrane translocation) were analysed for protein-protein interactions but no additional interactions were discovered using the yeast two-hybrid system. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions among the phosphotyrosine phosphatase, tyrosine kinase, and transmembrane activation protein are important in the regulation of capsule biosynthesis in Strep. thermophilus MR-1C. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides some valuable insight into the organization and interactions between the many proteins involved in EPS production.

Here, we propose a scheme that allows performing large-scale screening of all protein complexes and finding putative small-molecule and/or peptide binding sites overlapping with protein-protein binding sites (so-called \"multibinding sites\"). We find more than 600 nonredundant proteins from 60 protein families with multibinding sites. Moreover, we show that the multibinding sites are mostly observed in transient complexes, largely overlap with the binding hotspots and are more evolutionarily conserved than other interface sites.

Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is an in vivo method to monitor such interactions in plant cells. In the presented protocol the investigated candidate proteins are fused to complementary halves of fluorescent proteins and the respective constructs are introduced into plant cells via agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Subsequently, the proteins are transiently expressed in tobacco leaves and the restored fluorescent signals can be detected with a confocal laser scanning microscope in the intact cells. This allows not only visualization of the interaction itself, but also the subcellular localization of the protein complexes can be determined. For this purpose, marker genes containing a fluorescent tag can be coexpressed along with the BiFC constructs, thus visualizing cellular structures such as the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, the Golgi apparatus or the plasma membrane. The fluorescent signal can be monitored either directly in epidermal leaf cells or in single protoplasts, which can be easily isolated from the transformed tobacco leaves. BiFC is ideally suited to study protein-protein interactions in their natural surroundings within the living cell. However, it has to be considered that the expression has to be driven by strong promoters and that the interaction partners are modified due to fusion of the relatively large fluorescence tags, which might interfere with the interaction mechanism. Nevertheless, BiFC is an excellent complementary approach to other commonly applied methods investigating protein-protein interactions, such as coimmunoprecipitation, in vitro pull-down assays or yeast-two-hybrid experiments.",

Where the inhibition of critical viral enzymes by small molecules has proven effective for many viruses, there is considerable merit in pursuing protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as targets for therapeutic intervention. The mammalian protein-protein interaction trap (MAPPIT) is a two-hybrid system used for the study of PPIs. The bait and prey proteins are linked to deficient cytokine receptor chimeras, where the bait and prey interaction and subsequent ligand stimulation restores JAK-STAT signaling, resulting in reporter gene expression controlled by a STAT3-responsive promoter. We report the use of MAPPIT as a high-throughput screening assay for the discovery of inhibitors or stimulators of the Vif-APOBEC3G interaction and the reverse transcriptase heterodimerization (RTp66-RTp51) for HIV and the NS4A-NS3 interaction for HCV",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As protein domains are functional and structural units of proteins, a large proportion of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are achieved by domain-domain interactions (DDIs), many computational efforts have been made to identify DDIs from experimental PPIs since high throughput technologies have produced a large number of PPIs for different species. These methods can be separated into two categories: deterministic and probabilistic. In deterministic methods, parsimony assumption has been utilized. Parsimony principle has been widely used in computational biology as the evolution of the nature is considered as a continuous optimization process. In the context of identifying DDIs, parsimony methods try to find a minimal set of DDIs that can explain the observed PPIs. This category of methods are promising since they can be formulated and solved easily. Besides, researches have shown that they can detect specific DDIs, which is often hard for many probabilistic methods. We notice that existing methods just view PPI networks as simply assembled by single interactions, but there is now ample evidence that PPI networks should be considered in a global (systematic) point of view for it exhibits general properties of complex networks, such as 'scale-free' and 'small-world'.\\n\\nRESULTS: In this work, we integrate this global point of view into the parsimony-based model. Particularly, prior knowledge is extracted from these global properties by plausible reasoning and then taken as input. We investigate the role of the added information extensively through numerical experiments. Results show that the proposed method has improved performance, which confirms the biological meanings of the extracted prior knowledge.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This work provides us some clues for using these properties of complex networks in computational models and to some extent reveals the biological meanings underlying these general network properties.",

A fast Fourier transform-based docking algorithm was used to generate a model for a dimeric version of the 56-amino-acid beta1 domain of streptococcal protein G. Computational amino acid sequence design of 24 residues at the dimer interface resulted in a heterodimer comprised of 12-fold and eightfold variants of the wild-type protein. The designed proteins were expressed, purified, and characterized using analytical ultracentrifugation and heteronuclear NMR techniques. Although the measured dissociation constant was modest ( approximately 300 microM), 2D-[(1)H,(15)N]-HSQC NMR spectra of one of the designed proteins in the absence and presence of its binding partner showed clear evidence of specific dimer formation.",

        "abstract": "We report a new method, Interaction-Dependent PRobe Incorporation Mediated by Enzymes, or ID-PRIME, for imaging protein-protein interactions (PPIs) inside living cells. ID-PRIME utilizes a mutant of Escherichia coli lipoic acid ligase, LplA(W37V), which can catalyze the covalent ligation of a coumarin fluorophore onto a peptide recognition sequence called LAP1. The affinity between the ligase and LAP1 is tuned such that, when each is fused to a protein partner of interest, LplA(W37V) labels LAP1 with coumarin only when the protein partners to which they are fused bring them together. Coumarin labeling in the absence of such interaction is low or undetectable. Characterization of ID-PRIME in living mammalian cells shows that multiple protein-protein interactions can be imaged (FRB-FKBP, Fos-Jun, and neuroligin-PSD-95), with as little as 10 min of coumarin treatment. The signal intensity and detection sensitivity are similar to those of the widely used fluorescent protein complementation technique (BiFC) for PPI detection, without the disadvantage of irreversible complex trapping. ID-PRIME provides a powerful and complementary approach to existing methods for visualization of PPIs in living cells with spatial and temporal resolution.",

        "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions play a critical role in cellular processes such as signal transduction. Although many methods for identifying the binding partners of a protein of interest are available, it is currently difficult or impossible to assess the functional consequences of a specific interaction in vivo. To address this issue, we propose to modify proteins by addition of an artificial protein binding interface, thereby forcing them to interact in the cell in a pairwise fashion and allowing the functional consequences to be determined. For this purpose, we have developed an artificial binding interface consisting of a anti-Myc single-chain antibody (ScFv) and its peptide epitope. We found that the binding of an ScFv derived from anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 was relatively weak in vivo, so we selected an improved clone, 3DX, by in vitro mutagenesis and phage display. 3DX bound well to its epitope in a yeast two-hybrid system, and GST-fused 3DX also bound to several Myc-tagged proteins in mammalian cells. In vivo binding was relatively insensitive to the position of the ScFv in a fusion protein, but was improved by including multiple tandem copies of the Myc epitope in the binding partner. To test the system, we successfully replaced the SH3 domain-mediated interaction between the Abl tyrosine kinase and adaptor proteins Crk and Nck with an engineered interaction between 3DX and multiple Myc tags. We expect that this approach, which we term a functional interaction trap, will be a powerful proteomic tool for investigating protein-protein interactions.",

        "abstract": "Accurate identification of protein-protein interactions (PPI) is the key step in understanding proteins' biological functions, which are typically context-dependent. Many existing PPI predictors rely on aggregated features from protein sequences, however only a few methods exploit local information about specific residue contacts. In this work we present a two-stage machine learning approach for prediction of protein-protein interactions. We start with the carefully filtered data on protein complexes available for Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database. First, we build linear descriptions of interacting and non-interacting sequence segment pairs based on their inter-residue distances. Secondly, we train machine learning classifiers to predict binary segment interactions for any two short sequence fragments. The final prediction of the protein-protein interaction is done using the 2D matrix representation of all-against-all possible interacting sequence segments of both analysed proteins. The level-I predictor achieves 0.88 AUC for micro-scale, i.e., residue-level prediction. The level-II predictor improves the results further by a more complex learning paradigm. We perform 30-fold macro-scale, i.e., protein-level cross-validation experiment. The level-II predictor using PSIPRED-predicted secondary structure reaches 0.70 precision, 0.68 recall, and 0.70 AUC, whereas other popular methods provide results below 0.6 threshold (recall, precision, AUC). Our results demonstrate that multi-scale sequence features aggregation procedure is able to improve the machine learning results by more than 10% as compared to other sequence representations.

Each possible pairwise interaction among more than 6000 encoded proteins is evaluated against a dimer database of 768 complex structures by using a confidence estimate of the fold assignment and the magnitude of the statistical interfacial potentials. In total, 7321 interactions between pairs of different proteins are predicted, based on 304 complex structures. Quality estimation based on the coincidence of subcellular localizations and biological functions of the predicted interactors shows that our approach ranks third when compared with all other large-scale methods. Unlike other in silico methods, MULTIPROSPECTOR is able to identify the residues that participate directly in the interaction. Three hundred seventy-four of our predictions can be found by at least one of the other studies, which is compatible with the overlap between two different other methods. From the analysis of the mRNA abundance data, our method does not bias towards proteins with high abundance. Finally, several relevant predictions involved in various functions are presented. In summary, we provide a novel approach to predict protein-protein interactions on a genomic scale that is a useful complement to experimental methods.",

This fact motivated us to create and evaluate new high-throughput datasets of interacting proteins. We extracted interaction data from DIP, MINT, BioGRID and IntAct databases. Then we constructed descriptive features for machine learning purposes based on data from Gene Ontology and DOMINE. Thereafter, four well-established machine learning methods: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Na\u00efve Bayes, were used on these datasets to build an Ensemble Learning method based on majority voting. In cross-validation experiment, sensitivity exceeded 80% and classification/prediction accuracy reached 90% for the Ensemble Learning method. We extended the experiment to a bigger and more realistic dataset maintaining sensitivity over 70%.

        "abstract": "SUMMARY: There are many resources that contain information about binary interactions between proteins. However, protein interactions are defined by only a subset of residues in any protein. We have implemented a web resource that allows the investigation of protein interactions in the Protein Data Bank structures at the level of Pfam domains and amino acid residues. This detailed knowledge relies on the fact that there are a large number of multidomain proteins and protein complexes being deposited in the structure databases. The resource called iPfam is hosted within the Pfam UK website. Most resources focus on the interactions between proteins; iPfam includes these as well as interactions between domains in a single protein.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY: iPfam is available on the Web for browsing at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/iPfam/; the source-data for iPfam is freely available in relational tables via the ftp site ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/database_files/.",

In this chapter, we present several methods utilizing mass spectrometry (MS) for the analysis of protein-protein, protein-drug, and protein-metal interactions. We describe the analysis of protein interactions with hydrogen exchange MS methods. Hydrogen exchange methods can be used to analyze conformational changes on binding, to estimate dissociation constants, and to locate the sites of interaction/binding between binding partners. We also discuss more direct MS methods, including the analysis of metal ion complexation with proteins.",

        "abstract": "Interactions at the molecular level in the cellular environment play a very crucial role in maintaining the physiological functioning of the cell. These molecular interactions exist at varied levels viz. protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions or protein-small molecules interactions. Presently in the field, these interactions and their mechanisms mark intensively studied areas. Molecular interactions can also be studied computationally using the approach named as Molecular Docking. Molecular docking employs search algorithms to predict the possible conformations for interacting partners and then calculates interaction energies. However, docking proposes number of solutions as different docked poses and hence offers a serious challenge to identify the native (or near native) structures from the pool of these docked poses. Here, we propose a rigorous scoring scheme called DockScore which can be used to rank the docked poses and identify the best docked pose out of many as proposed by docking algorithm employed. The scoring identifies the optimal interactions between the two protein partners utilising various features of the putative interface like area, short contacts, conservation, spatial clustering and the presence of positively charged and hydrophobic residues. DockScore was first trained on a set of 30 protein-protein complexes to determine the weights for different parameters. Subsequently, we tested the scoring scheme on 30 different protein-protein complexes and native or near-native structure were assigned the top rank from a pool of docked poses in 26 of the tested cases. We tested the ability of DockScore to discriminate likely dimer interactions that differ substantially within a homologous family and also demonstrate that DOCKSCORE can distinguish correct pose for all 10 recent CAPRI targets.",

Despite the challenges, several studies provided evidences for the development of small molecules modulating protein-protein interactions. Here we consider a typical case of protein-protein interaction stabilization: the complex between FKBP12 and FRB with rapamycin. We have analyzed the stability of the complex and characterized its interactions at the atomic level by performing free energy calculations and computational alanine scanning. It is shown that rapamycin stabilizes the complex by acting as a bridge between the two proteins; and the complex is stable only in the presence of rapamycin.?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Despite extensive efforts in tuberculosis (TB) drug research, very few novel inhibitors have been discovered. This issue emphasizes the need for innovative methods to discover new anti-TB drugs. In this study, we established a new high-throughput screen (HTS) platform technology that differs from traditional TB drug screens because it utilizes Mycobacterial-Protein Fragment Complementation (M-PFC) to identify small molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions in mycobacteria. Several examples of protein-protein interactions were tested with M-PFC to highlight the diversity of selectable drug targets that could be used for screening. These included interactions of essential regulators (IdeR dimerization), enzymatic complexes (LeuCD), secretory antigens (Cfp10-Esat6), and signaling pathways (DevR dimerization). The feasibility of M-PFC in a HTS platform setting was tested by performing a proof-of-concept quantitative HTS of 3,600 small molecule compounds on DevR-DevR interaction, which was chosen because of its strong implications in Mycobacterium tuberculosis persistence and the need for effective drugs against latent TB. The calculated Z'-factor was consistently >/=0.8, indicating a robust and reproducible assay. Completion of the proof-of-concept screen allowed for the identification of advantages and disadvantages in the current assay design, where improvements made will further pioneer M-PFC-based applications in a large-scale HTS format.",

        "abstract": "Transcription of the Escherichia coli biotin (bio) operon is regulated by BirA, a protein that is not only the repressor that regulates bio operon expression by DNA binding but also the enzyme that covalently attaches biotin to its cognate acceptor proteins. Binding of BirA to the bio operator requires dimerization of the protein that is triggered by BirA-catalyzed synthesis of biotinoyl-adenylate (bio-AMP), the obligatory intermediate of the attachment reaction. The current model postulates that the unmodified acceptor protein binds the monomeric BirA:bio-AMP complex and thereby blocks assembly (dimerization) of the form of BirA that binds DNA. We report that expression of fusion proteins that carry synthetic biotin-accepting peptide sequences was as effective as the natural acceptor protein in derepression of bio operon transcription. These peptide sequences have sequences that are remarkably dissimilar to that of the natural acceptor protein, and our data thus argue that the regulatory switch does not require the extensive protein-protein interactions postulated in the current model. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a dynamic organelle that consists of numerous regions or 'subdomains' that have discrete morphological features and functional properties. Although it is generally accepted that these subdomains differ in their protein and perhaps lipid compositions, a clear understanding of how they are assembled and maintained has not been well established. We previously demonstrated that two diacylglycerol acyltransferase enzymes (DGAT1 and DGAT2) from tung tree (Vernicia fordii) were located in different subdomains of ER, but the mechanisms responsible for protein targeting to these subdomains were not elucidated. Here we extend these studies by describing two glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-like (GPAT) enzymes from tung tree, GPAT8 and GPAT9, that both colocalize with DGAT2 in the same ER subdomains. Measurement of protein-protein interactions using the split-ubiquitin assay revealed that GPAT8 interacts with itself, GPAT9 and DGAT2, but not with DGAT1. Furthermore, mutational analysis of GPAT8 revealed that the protein's first predicted hydrophobic region, which contains an amphipathic helix-like motif, is required for interaction with DGAT2 and for DGAT2-dependent colocalization in ER subdomains. Taken together, these results suggest that the regulation and organization of ER subdomains is mediated at least in part by higher-ordered, hydrophobic-domain-dependent homo- and hetero-oligomeric protein-protein interactions.",
