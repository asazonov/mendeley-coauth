        "abstract": "The identification of molecular target and mechanism of action of compounds is a key hurdle in drug discovery. Multiplexed techniques for bead-based expression profiling allow the measurement of transcriptional signatures of compound-treated cells in high-throughput mode. Such profiles can be used to gain insight into compounds' mode of action and the protein targets they are modulating. Through the proxy of target prediction from such gene signatures we explored important aspects of the use of transcriptional profiles to capture biological variability of perturbed cellular assays. We found that signatures derived from expression data and signatures derived from biological interaction networks performed equally well, and we showed that gene signatures can be optimised using a genetic algorithm. Gene signatures of approximately 128 genes seemed to be most generic, capturing a maximum of the perturbation inflicted on cells through compound treatment. Moreover, we found evidence for oxidative phosphorylation to be one of the most general ways to capture compound perturbation.",

        "abstract": "Gene expression signatures encompassing dozens to hundreds of genes have been associated with many important parameters of cancer, but mechanisms of their control are largely unknown. Here we present a method based on genetic linkage that can prospectively identify functional regulators driving large-scale transcriptional signatures in cancer. Using this method we show that the wound response signature, a poor-prognosis expression pattern of 512 genes in breast cancer, is induced by coordinate amplifications of MYC and CSN5 (also known as JAB1 or COPS5). This information enabled experimental recapitulation, functional assessment and mechanistic elucidation of the wound signature in breast epithelial cells.",

        "abstract": "Calorie restriction (CR) enhances longevity and mitigates aging phenotypes in numerous species. Physiological responses to CR are cell-type specific and variable throughout the lifespan. However, the mosaic of molecular changes responsible for CR benefits remains unclear, particularly in brain regions susceptible to deterioration during aging. We examined the influence of long-term CR on the CA1 hippocampal region, a key learning and memory brain area that is vulnerable to age-related pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Through mRNA sequencing and NanoString nCounter analysis, we demonstrate that one year of CR feeding suppresses age-dependent signatures of 882 genes functionally associated with synaptic transmission-related pathways, including calcium signaling, long-term potentiation (LTP), and Creb signaling in wild-type mice. By comparing the influence of CR on hippocampal CA1 region transcriptional profiles at younger-adult (5 months, 2.5 months of feeding) and older-adult (15 months, 12.5 months of feeding) timepoints, we identify conserved upregulation of proteome quality control and calcium buffering genes, including heat shock 70 kDa protein 1b (Hspa1b) and heat shock 70 kDa protein 5 (Hspa5), protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4 (Pdia4) and protein disulfide isomerase family A member 6 (Pdia6), and calreticulin (Calr). Expression levels of putative neuroprotective factors, klotho (Kl) and transthyretin (Ttr), are also elevated by CR in adulthood, although the global CR-specific expression profiles at younger and older timepoints are highly divergent. At a previously unachieved resolution, our results demonstrate conserved activation of neuroprotective gene signatures and broad CR-suppression of age-dependent hippocampal CA1 region expression changes, indicating that CR functionally maintains a more youthful transcriptional state within the hippocampal CA1 sector.",

        "abstract": "A critical component of vaccine design is to generate and maintain antigen-specific memory lymphocytes of sufficient quantity and quality to give the host life-long protection against re-infection. Therefore, it is important to understand how memory T cells acquire the ability for self-renewal while retaining a potential for heightened recall of effector functions. During acute viral infection or following vaccination, antigen-specific T cells undergo extensive phenotypic and functional changes during differentiation to the effector and memory phases of the immune response. The changes in cell phenotype that accompany memory T-cell differentiation are predominantly mediated through acquired transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, in part achieved through epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones. Here we review our current understanding of epigenetic mechanisms regulating the off-on-off expression of CD8 and CD4 T-cell effector molecules at naive, effector and memory stages of differentiation, respectively, and how covalent modifications to the genome may serve as a mechanism to preserve 'poised' transcriptional states in homeostatically dividing memory cells. We discuss the potential of such mechanisms to control genes that undergo on-off-on patterns of expression including homing and pro-survival genes, and the implications on the development of effector-memory and central-memory T-cell differentiation. Lastly, we review recent studies demonstrating epigenetic modifications as a mechanism for the progressive loss of transcriptional adaptation in antigen-specific T cells that undergo sustained high levels of T-cell receptor signalling.",

        "abstract": "Adoptive Cell Therapies (ACT) with T cell receptor-engineered (TCReng) T cells have shown promising results. Unfortunately, for a fuller understanding of their biology, currently available immunological assays have proven inadequate. Given that RNA-Seq using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) offers substantial opportunities, we carried out NGS of the MART-127-35 specific TCReng human primary CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells following cognate stimulation, to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional signatures underlying their biology. Data analyses revealed approximately 30,000 transcripts, a sizeable number of which showing up- or down-regulation covering virtually all relevant aspects of T cell biology (i.e., effector function, differentiation, proliferative activities, apoptosis, etc.) when stimulated by the cognate epitope. The transcriptional profiles of the TCReng CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were found to be remarkably similar. Additionally, 72,000 known isoforms and about 20,000 previously undescribed isoforms were detected. Interestingly, a number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) - some with known functions (e.g., NEAT1 and MALAT1, both implicated in RNA editing, were up-regulated in the two cell types), and others with unknown function (e.g., GAS5, MIAT, and FTX showing modulations in expression), were also detected in both cell types. Although a comprehensive knowledge of the transcriptional signatures and a clear understanding of the spliced variants, the novel isoforms, and the lncRNAs in T cell biology will require further work, our study shows that NGS of specific epitope reactive T cells will be a very useful tool in deciphering the transcriptional controls underlying the function and the fate of epitope specific anti-tumor T cells.

        "abstract": "To date, it remains impossible to guarantee that short-term treatment given to a patient suffering from a major depressive episode (MDE) will improve long-term efficacy. Objective biological measurements and biomarkers that could help in predicting the clinical evolution of MDE are still warranted. To better understand the reason nearly half of MDE patients respond poorly to current antidepressive treatments, we examined the gene expression profile of peripheral blood samples collected from 16 severe MDE patients and 13 matched controls. Using a naturalistic and longitudinal design, we ascertained mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression at baseline, 2 and 8 weeks later. On a genome-wide scale, we detected transcripts with roles in various biological processes as significantly dysregulated between MDE patients and controls, notably those involved in nucleotide binding and chromatin assembly. We also established putative interactions between dysregulated mRNAs and miRNAs that may contribute to MDE physiopathology. We selected a set of mRNA candidates for quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) to validate that the transcriptional signatures observed in responders is different from nonresponders. Furthermore, we identified a combination of four mRNAs (PPT1, TNF, IL1B and HIST1H1E) that could be predictive of treatment response. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of studies investigating the tight relationship between peripheral transcriptional changes and the dynamic clinical progression of MDE patients to provide biomarkers of MDE evolution and prognosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammal macrophages (MPhi) display a wide range of functions which contribute to surveying and maintaining tissue integrity. One such function is phagocytosis, a process known to be subverted by parasites like Leishmania (L). Indeed, the intracellular development of L. amazonensis amastigote relies on the biogenesis and dynamic remodelling of a phagolysosome, termed the parasitophorous vacuole, primarily within dermal MPhi.\\n\\nRESULTS: Using BALB/c mouse bone marrow-derived MPhi loaded or not with amastigotes, we analyzed the transcriptional signatures of MPhi 24 h later, when the amastigote population was growing. Total RNA from MPhi cultures were processed and hybridized onto Affymetrix Mouse430_2 GeneChips, and some transcripts were also analyzed by Real-Time quantitative PCR (RTQPCR). A total of 1,248 probe-sets showed significant differential expression. Comparable fold-change values were obtained between the Affymetrix technology and the RTQPCR method. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software pinpointed the up-regulation of the sterol biosynthesis pathway (p-value = 1.31e-02) involving several genes (1.95 to 4.30 fold change values), and the modulation of various genes involved in polyamine synthesis and in pro/counter-inflammatory signalling.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the amastigote growth relies on early coordinated gene expression of the MPhi lipid and polyamine pathways. Moreover, these MPhi hosting multiplying L. amazonensis amastigotes display a transcriptional profile biased towards parasite-and host tissue-protective processes.",

        "title": "A semi-supervised approach for refining transcriptional signatures of drug response and repositioning predictions",
        "abstract": "We present a novel strategy to identify drug-repositioning opportunities. The starting point of our method is the generation of a signature summarising the consensual transcriptional response of multiple human cell lines to a compound of interest (namely the seed compound). This signature can be derived from data in existing databases, such as the connectivity-map, and it is used at first instance to query a network interlinking all the connectivity-map compounds, based on the similarity of their transcriptional responses. This provides a drug neighbourhood, composed of compounds predicted to share some effects with the seed one. The original signature is then refined by systematically reducing its overlap with the transcriptional responses induced by drugs in this neighbourhood that are known to share a secondary effect with the seed compound. Finally, the drug network is queried again with the resulting refined signatures and the whole process is carried on for a number of iterations. Drugs in the final refined neighbourhood are then predicted to exert the principal mode of action of the seed compound. We illustrate our approach using paclitaxel (a microtubule stabilising agent) as seed compound. Our method predicts that glipizide and splitomicin perturb microtubule function in human cells: a result that could not be obtained through standard signature matching methods. In agreement, we find that glipizide and splitomicin reduce interphase microtubule growth rates and transiently increase the percentage of mitotic cells-consistent with our prediction. Finally, we validated the refined signatures of paclitaxel response by mining a large drug screening dataset, showing that human cancer cell lines whose basal transcriptional profile is anti-correlated to them are significantly more sensitive to paclitaxel and docetaxel.",

We illustrate the methodological pipeline by reanalyzing the time course gene expression data from a study with healthy human subjects challenged by live influenza virus. We observed clear differences in the number of significant dynamic response genes (DRGs) between the symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects and also identified DRG signatures for symptomatic subjects with influenza infection. The 505 common DRGs shared by the symptomatic subjects have high consistency with the signature genes for predicting viral infection identified in previous works. The temporal response patterns and network response features were carefully analyzed and investigated.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Recent studies suggest that pericardial adipose tissue (PCAT) secretes inflammatory factors that contribute to the development of CVD. To better characterize the role of PCAT in the pathogenesis of disease, we performed a large-scale unbiased analysis of the transcriptional differences between PCAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue, analysing 53 microarrays across 19 individuals. As it was unknown whether PCAT-secreted factors are produced by adipocytes or cells in the supporting stromal fraction, we also sought to identify differentially expressed genes in isolated pericardial adipocytes vs. isolated subcutaneous adipocytes. Using microarray analysis, we found that: 1) pericardial adipose tissue and isolated pericardial adipocytes both overexpress atherosclerosis-promoting chemokines and 2) pericardial and subcutaneous fat depots, as well as isolated pericardial adipocytes and subcutaneous adipocytes, express specific patterns of homeobox genes. In contrast, a core set of lipid processing genes showed no significant overlap with differentially expressed transcripts. These depot-specific homeobox signatures and transcriptional profiles strongly suggest different functional roles for the pericardial and subcutaneous adipose depots. Further characterization of these inter-depot differences should be a research priority.",

However, the molecular pathways affected by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment are largely unknown. We sought to assess the system-wide consequences of CPAP therapy by transcriptionally profiling peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). METHODS: Subjects in whom severe OSA was diagnosed were treated with CPAP, and whole-genome expression measurement of PBLs was performed at baseline and following therapy. We used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify pathways that were differentially enriched. Network analysis was then applied to highlight key drivers of processes influenced by CPAP. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects with significant OSA underwent CPAP therapy and microarray analysis of their PBLs. Treatment with CPAP improved apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), daytime sleepiness, and blood pressure, but did not affect anthropometric measures. GSEA revealed a number of enriched gene sets, many of which were involved in neoplastic processes and displayed downregulated expression patterns in response to CPAP. Network analysis identified several densely connected genes that are important modulators of cancer and tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: Effective therapy of OSA with CPAP is associated with alterations in circulating leukocyte gene expression. Functional enrichment and network analyses highlighted transcriptional suppression in cancer-related pathways, suggesting potentially novel mechanisms linking OSA with neoplastic signatures.",

However, each breast cancer subtype is also heterogeneous. Some of the heterogeneity may be attributable to genetic instability, but recent data emphasize that developmental plasticity may also contribute. The p53 tumor suppressor could constitute a nodal control point underlying both sources of heterogeneity because it is frequently inactivated during malignant progression and has recently been shown to function as a potent barrier preventing fully differentiated cells from reverting to pluripotent stem cells after expression of appropriate oncogenes. Using archival microarray datasets, we tested the hypothesis that a p53 mutation could allow cells within a tumor to acquire a stem cell-like state by looking for coordinate expression of stem cell identity genes. We show that breast and lung cancers with p53 mutations do exhibit stem cell-like transcriptional patterns. Such tumors were also depleted for differentiation genes regulated by the polycomb repressor complex 2. These data are consistent with a model in which loss of p53 function enables acquisition of stem cell properties, which are positively selected during tumor progression.",

Here, using cryopreserved PBMC, we analyzed larger RO T1D and HC cohorts, examined T1D progression in pre-onset samples, and compared the RO T1D signature to those associated with three disorders characterized by airway infection and inflammation. The RO T1D signature, consisting of interleukin-1 cytokine family members, chemokines involved in immunocyte chemotaxis, immune receptors and signaling molecules, was detected during early pre-diabetes and found to resolve post-onset. The signatures associated with cystic fibrosis patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, patients with confirmed bacterial pneumonia, and subjects with H1N1 influenza all reflected immunological activation, yet each were distinct from one another and negatively correlated with that of T1D.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory illness (ARI) is the leading cause of asthma exacerbations yet the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. To address the deficiencies in our understanding of the molecular events characterizing ARI-induced asthma exacerbations, we undertook a transcriptional profiling study of the nasal mucosa over the course of ARI amongst individuals with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis and no underlying respiratory disease.\\n\\nMETHODS: Transcriptional profiling experiments were performed using the Agilent Whole Human Genome 4X44K array platform. Time point-based microarray and principal component analyses were conducted to identify and distinguish ARI-associated transcriptional profiles over the course of our study. Gene enrichment analysis was conducted to identify biological processes over represented within each ARI-associated profile and gene expression subsequently confirmed by quantitative PCR.\\n\\nRESULTS: We found that ARI is characterized by dynamic, time-specific transcriptional profiles whose magnitudes of expression are influenced by underlying respiratory disease and the mucosal repair signature evoked during ARI. Most strikingly, we report that asthmatics that experience ARI-induced exacerbations are characterized by a reduced but prolonged inflammatory immune response, inadequate activation of mucosal repair and the expression of a newly described exacerbation-specific transcriptional signature.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Findings from our study represent a significant contribution towards clarifying the complex molecular interactions which typify ARI-induced asthma exacerbations.",

        "abstract": "RalA and RalB are small GTPases that support malignant development and progression in experimental models of bladder, prostate, and squamous cancer. However, demonstration of their clinical relevance in human tumors remains lacking. Here, we developed tools to evaluate Ral protein expression, activation, and transcriptional output and evaluated their association with clinicopathologic parameters in common human tumor types. To evaluate the relevance of Ral activation and transcriptional output, we correlated RalA and RalB activation with the mutational status of key human bladder cancer genes. We also identified and evaluated a transcriptional signature of genes that correlates with depletion of RalA and RalB in vivo. The Ral transcriptional signature score, but not protein expression as evaluated by immunohistochemistry, predicted disease stage, progression to muscle invasion, and survival in human bladder cancers and metastatic and stem cell phenotypes in bladder cancer models. In prostate cancer, the Ral transcriptional signature score was associated with seminal vesicle invasion, androgen-independent progression, and reduced survival. In squamous cell carcinoma, this score was decreased in cancer tissues compared with normal mucosa, validating the experimental findings that Ral acts as a tumor suppressor in this tumor type. Together, our findings show the clinical relevance of Ral in human cancer and provide a rationale for the development of Ral-directed therapies.",

        "abstract": "GABAA receptors mediate the majority of inhibitory neurotransmission in the CNS. Genetic deletion of the alpha1 subunit of GABAA receptors results in a loss of alpha1-mediated fast inhibitory currents and a marked reduction in density of GABAA receptors. A grossly normal phenotype of alpha1-deficient mice suggests the presence of neuronal adaptation to these drastic changes at the GABA synapse. We used cDNA microarrays to identify transcriptional fingerprints of cellular plasticity in response to altered GABAergic inhibition in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of alpha1 mutants. In silico analysis of 982 mutation-regulated transcripts highlighted genes and functional groups involved in regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, suggesting an adaptive response of the brain to an altered inhibitory tone. Public gene expression databases permitted identification of subsets of transcripts enriched in excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as some glial cells, providing evidence for cellular plasticity in individual cell types. Additional analysis linked some transcriptional changes to cellular phenotypes observed in the knock-out mice and suggested several genes, such as the early growth response 1 (Egr1), small GTP binding protein Rac1 (Rac1), neurogranin (Nrgn), sodium channel beta4 subunit (Scn4b), and potassium voltage-gated Kv4.2 channel (Kcnd2) as cell type-specific markers of neuronal plasticity. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of genes enriched in Bergman glia suggests an active role of these astrocytes in synaptic plasticity. Overall, our results suggest that the loss of alpha1-mediated fast inhibition produces diverse transcriptional responses that act to regulate neuronal excitability of individual neurons and stabilize neuronal networks, which may account for the lack of severe abnormalities in alpha1 null mutants.",

Design: Animal experiment. Setting: Reproductive immunology laboratory. Animal(s): All 6- to 8-week-old C57Bl/6 female mice. Main Outcome Measure(s): We analyzed gene expression of IMCs isolated from placentas of pregnant mice (n = 3) and Lewis lung carcinoma tumors (n = 3), using flow cytometry. Expression patterns were compared to primary muscle cells (n = 4), using Affymetrix microarrays. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to validate microarray data. Similarity of gene expression was evaluated with the mass-distance algorithm. Result(s): The IMCs that infiltrate mouse placentas share \u223c500 expressed genes with tumor IMCs (set a). This gene set is enriched with proangiogenic and inflammatory genes. Unique gene expression sets for tumor IMCs (set b) and placenta IMCs (set c) were also detected. Conclusion(s): The IMCs derived from placentas and tumors express common molecular signatures, suggesting similar origins and functions. This observation lends further support to the notion that the placenta uses a similar angiogenic machinery as tumors for survival and growth. Unique gene-sets, differentially expressed in tumor versus placenta-derived IMCs, may be required for specific IMC-hosting tissue interactions. \u00a92013 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.",

We analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) the DIS3 PIN and RNB domains in purified bone marrow PCs from 164 representative patients, including 130 cases with MM, 24 with primary PC leukemia and 10 with secondary PC leukemia. DIS3 mutations were found respectively in 18.5%, 25% and 30% of cases. Identified variants were predominantly missense mutations localized in the RNB domain, and were often detected at low allele frequency. DIS3 mutations were preferentially carried by IGH-translocated/nonhyperdiploid patients. Sequential analysis at diagnosis and relapse in a subset of cases highlighted some instances of increasing DIS3 mutation burden during disease progression. NGS also revealed that the majority of DIS3 variants in mutated cases were comparably detectable at transcriptional level. Furthermore, gene expression profiling analysis in DIS3-mutated patients identified a transcriptional signature suggestive for impaired RNA exosome function. In conclusion, these data further support the pathological relevance of DIS3 mutations in plasma cell dyscrasias and suggest that DIS3 may represent a potential tumor suppressor gene in such disorders.",

Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we identified a statistically significant transcriptional signature of 1,109 genes in PBMCs from 26 MS patients, irrespective of disease activation state or immunomodulatory treatment. This signature contains genes that implicate underlying processes involved in MS pathogenesis including T-cell activation and expansion, inflammation, and apoptosis. Another transcriptional signature of 721 genes involved in cellular recruitment, epitope spreading, and escape from regulatory immune surveillance identified MS patients in acute relapse compared with remission. Our results offer new opportunity for understanding the mechanisms involved in MS and indicate that gene expression patterns in PBMCs contain information about a remote-target disease process that may be useful for diagnosis and future tailoring of therapeutic strategies for MS.",

        "abstract": "The debate on the origin and evolution of flowers has recently entered the field of developmental genetics, with focus on the design of the ancestral floral regulatory program. Flowers can differ dramatically among angiosperm lineages, but in general, male and female reproductive organs surrounded by a sterile perianth of sepals and petals constitute the basic floral structure. However, the basal angiosperm lineages exhibit spectacular diversity in the number, arrangement, and structure of floral organs, whereas the evolutionarily derived monocot and eudicot lineages share a far more uniform floral ground plan. Here we show that broadly overlapping transcriptional programs characterize the floral transcriptome of the basal angiosperm Persea americana (avocado), whereas floral gene expression domains are considerably more organ specific in the model eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings therefore support the \"fading borders\" model for organ identity determination in basal angiosperm flowers and extend it from the action of regulatory genes to downstream transcriptional programs. Furthermore, the declining expression of components of the staminal transcriptome in central and peripheral regions of Persea flowers concurs with elements of a previous hypothesis for developmental regulation in a gymnosperm \"floral progenitor.\" Accordingly, in contrast to the canalized organ-specific regulatory apparatus of Arabidopsis, floral development may have been originally regulated by overlapping transcriptional cascades with fading gradients of influence from focal to bordering organs.",

In this review, we will detail the broad use of gene expression profiling to decipher the complexity of immune responses from disease biomarkers identification to cell activation, polarisation or functional specialisation. We will also describe how such data-driven strategies revealed the flexibility of immune function with common and specific transcriptional programme under multiple stimuli.",

        "abstract": "The first stages of embryonic differentiation are driven by signaling pathways hardwired to induce particular fates. Endoderm commitment is controlled by the TGF-?? superfamily member, Nodal, which utilizes the transcription factors, SMAD2/3, SMAD4 and FOXH1, to drive target gene expression. While the role of Nodal is well defined within the context of endoderm commitment, mechanistically it is unknown how this signal interacts with chromatin on a genome wide scale to trigger downstream responses. To elucidate the Nodal transcriptional network that governs endoderm formation, we used ChIP-seq to identify genomic targets for SMAD2/3, SMAD3, SMAD4, FOXH1 and the active and repressive chromatin marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and derived endoderm. We demonstrate that while SMAD2/3, SMAD4 and FOXH1 associate with DNA in a highly dynamic fashion, there is an optimal bivalent signature at 32 gene loci for driving endoderm commitment. Initially, this signature is marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 as a very broad bivalent domain in hESCs. Within the first 24. h, SMAD2/3 accumulation coincides with H3K27me3 reduction so that these loci become monovalent marked by H3K4me3. JMJD3, a histone demethylase, is simultaneously recruited to these promoters, suggesting a conservation of mechanism at multiple promoters genome-wide. The correlation between SMAD2/3 binding, monovalent formation and transcriptional activation suggests a mechanism by which SMAD proteins coordinate with chromatin at critical promoters to drive endoderm specification. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

Distinguishing those responses is important for understanding side effects of drugs and for elucidating molecular mechanisms of toxic chemicals.\\n\\nRESULTS: We explored this problem by exposing cells to the environmental contaminant benzo-[a]-pyrene (B[a]P). B[a]P exposure activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) and causes toxic stress resulting in transcriptional changes that are not regulated through Ahr. We sought to distinguish these two types of responses based on a time course of expression changes measured after B[a]P exposure. Using Random Forest machine learning we classified 81 primary Ahr responders and 1,308 genes regulated as side effects. Subsequent weighted clustering gave further insight into the connection between expression pattern, mode of regulation, and biological function. Finally, the accuracy of the predictions was supported through extensive experimental validation.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Using a combination of machine learning followed by extensive experimental validation, we have further expanded the known catalog of genes regulated by the environmentally sensitive transcription factor Ahr. More broadly, this study presents a strategy for distinguishing receptor-dependent responses and side effects based on expression time courses.",

We show that the classifier mod-els can be used to predict cardiac cell subtype cis-regulatory activities. Associating the predicted en-hancers with an expression atlas of cardiac genes further uncovered clusters of genes with transcrip-tion and function limited to individual cardiac cell subtypes. Further, the cell-specific enhancer models revealed chromatin, TF binding and sequence fea-tures that distinguish enhancer activities in distinct subsets of heart cells. Collectively, our results show that computational modeling combined with empiri-cal testing provides a powerful platform to uncover the enhancers, TF motifs and gene expression pro-files which characterize individual cardiac cell fates.",

We observed marked cellular, structural and gene expression changes in the midguts of Drosophila melanogaster third instar larvae that were fed wheat germ agglutinin. Some of these changes were similar to those observed in the midguts of starved D. melanogaster. Dietary wheat germ agglutinin caused shortening, branching, swelling, distortion and in some cases disintegration of the midgut microvilli. Starvation was accompanied primarily by shortening of the microvilli. Microarray analyses revealed that dietary wheat germ agglutinin evoked differential expression of 61 transcripts; seven of these were also differentially expressed in starved D. melanogaster. The differentially transcribed gene clusters in wheat germ agglutinin-fed larvae were associated with (1) cytoskeleton organization; (2) digestive enzymes; (3) detoxification reactions; and (4) energy metabolism. Four possible transcription factor binding motifs were associated with the differentially expressed genes. One of these exhibited substantial similarity to MyoD, a transcription factor binding motif associated with cellular structures in mammals. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that wheat germ agglutinin caused a starvation-like effect and structural changes of midgut cells of D. melanogaster third-instar larvae.",

Recent evidence suggests that skin fibroblasts could represent a non-neural peripheral model useful for investigating molecular alterations in psychiatric disorders.\\n\\nMETHODS: A microarray expression study was conducted comparing skin fibroblast transcriptomic profiles from 20 SCZ patients and 20 controls. All genes strongly differentially expressed were validated by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in fibroblasts and analyzed in a sample of peripheral blood cell (PBC) RNA from patients (n = 25) and controls (n = 22). To evaluate the specificity for SCZ, alterations in gene expression were tested in additional samples of fibroblasts and PBCs RNA from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (n = 16; n = 21, respectively) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) patients (n = 15; n = 20, respectively).\\n\\nRESULTS: Six genes (JUN, HIST2H2BE, FOSB, FOS, EGR1, TCF4) were significantly upregulated in SCZ compared to control fibroblasts. In blood, an increase in expression levels was confirmed only for EGR1, whereas JUN was downregulated; no significant differences were observed for the other genes. EGR1 upregulation was specific for SCZ compared to MDD and BD.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study reports the upregulation of JUN, HIST2H2BE, FOSB, FOS, EGR1 and TCF4 in the fibroblasts of SCZ patients. A significant alteration in EGR1 expression is also present in SCZ PBCs compared to controls and to MDD and BD patients, suggesting that this gene could be a specific biomarker helpful in the differential diagnosis of major psychoses.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant contributor to intensive care unit (ICU) morbidity and mortality and presents a significant diagnostic challenge. Our hypothesis was that blood RNA expression profiles can be used to track the response to VAP in children, using the same methods that proved informational in adults. DESIGN: A pilot, nonrandomized, repeated measures case-control study of changes in the abundance of total RNA in buffy coat and clinical scores for VAP. SETTING: A large, multispecialty university-based pediatric ICU and cardiac ICU. PATIENTS: Seven children requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: Blood samples were drawn at time of enrollment and every 48 hours for a maximum of 11 samples (21 days). Patients ranged in age from 1 to 18 months (mean 8 months). All patients survived to the end of the study. Of the 7 patients studied, 4 developed VAP. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Statistical analysis of the Affymetrix Human Genome Focus GeneChip signal was conducted on normalized expression values of 8793 probe sets using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a false discovery rate of 0.10. The expression patterns of 48 genes appeared to discriminate between the 2 classes of ventilated children: those with and those without pneumonia. Gene expression network analysis revealed several gene ontologies of interest, including cell proliferation, differentiation, growth, and apoptosis, as well as genes not previously implicated in sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data are the first in critically ill children supporting the hypothesis that there is a detectable VAP signal in gene expression profiles. Larger studies are needed to validate these preliminary findings and test the diagnostic value of longitudinal changes in leukocyte RNA signatures.",

        "abstract": "Migration is a key life history strategy for many animals and requires a suite of behavioural, morphological and physiological adaptations which together form the \u2018migratory syndrome\u2019. Genetic variation has been demonstrated for many traits that make up this syndrome, but the underlying genes involved remain elusive. Recent studies investigating migration-associated genes have focussed on sampling migratory and nonmigratory populations from different geographic locations but have seldom explored phenotypic variation in a migratory trait. Here, we use a novel combination of tethered flight and next-generation sequencing to determine transcriptomic differences associated with flight activity in a globally invasive moth pest, the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera. By developing a state-of-the-art phenotyping platform, we show that field-collected H. armigera display continuous variation in flight performance with individuals capable of flying up to 40 km during a single night. Comparative transcriptomics of flight phenotypes drove a gene expression analysis to reveal a suite of expressed candidate genes which are clearly related to physiological adaptations required for long-distance flight. These include genes important to the mobilization of lipids as flight fuel, the development of flight muscle structure and the regulation of hormones that influence migratory physiology. We conclude that the ability to express this complex set of pathways underlines the remarkable flexibility of facultative insect migrants to respond to deteriorating conditions in the form of migratory flight and, more broadly, the results provide novel insights into the fundamental transcriptional changes required for migration in insects and other taxa.",

        "abstract": ": Growth of atherosclerotic plaque requires neovascularization (angiogenesis). To elucidate the involvement of angiotensin II (Ang II) in angiogenesis, we performed gene microarray and microRNA (miRNA) polymerase chain reaction array analyses on human coronary artery endothelial cells exposed to moderate concentration of Ang II for 2 and 12 hours. At 12, but not 2, hours, cultures treated with Ang II exhibited shifts in transcriptional activity involving 267 genes (>1.5-fold difference; P < 0.05). Resulting transcriptome was most significantly enriched for genes associated with blood vessel development, angiogenesis, and regulation of proliferation. Majority of upregulated genes implicated in angiogenesis shared a commonality of being either regulators (HES1, IL-18, and CXCR4) or targets (ADM, ANPEP, HES1, KIT, NOTCH4, PGF, and SOX18) of STAT3. In line with these findings, STAT3 inhibition attenuated Ang II-dependent stimulation of tube formation in Matrigel assay. Expression analysis of miRNAs transcripts revealed that the pattern of differential expression for miRNAs was largely consistent with proangiogenic response with a prominent theme of upregulation of miRs targeting PTEN (miR-19b-3p, miR-21-5p, 23b-3p, and 24-3p), many of which are directly or indirectly STAT3 dependent. We conclude that STAT3 signaling may be an intrinsic part of Ang II-mediated proangiogenic response in human endothelial cells.",

        "title": "Microarray analysis of a salamander hopeful monster reveals transcriptional signatures of paedomorphic brain development.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Mexican axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is considered a hopeful monster because it exhibits an adaptive and derived mode of development - paedomorphosis - that has evolved rapidly and independently among tiger salamanders. Unlike related tiger salamanders that undergo metamorphosis, axolotls retain larval morphological traits into adulthood and thus present an adult body plan that differs dramatically from the ancestral (metamorphic) form. The basis of paedomorphic development was investigated by comparing temporal patterns of gene transcription between axolotl and tiger salamander larvae (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum) that typically undergo a metamorphosis.\\n\\nRESULTS: Transcript abundances from whole brain and pituitary were estimated via microarray analysis on four different days post hatching (42, 56, 70, 84 dph) and regression modeling was used to independently identify genes that were differentially expressed as a function of time in both species. Collectively, more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified as unique to the axolotl (n = 76) and tiger salamander (n = 292) than were identified as shared (n = 108). All but two of the shared DEGs exhibited the same temporal pattern of expression and the unique genes tended to show greater changes later in the larval period when tiger salamander larvae were undergoing anatomical metamorphosis. A second, complementary analysis that directly compared the expression of 1320 genes between the species identified 409 genes that differed as a function of species or the interaction between time and species. Of these 409 DEGs, 84% exhibited higher abundances in tiger salamander larvae at all sampling times.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Many of the unique tiger salamander transcriptional responses are probably associated with metamorphic biological processes. However, the axolotl also showed unique patterns of transcription early in development. In particular, the axolotl showed a genome-wide reduction in mRNA abundance across loci, including genes that regulate hypothalamic-pituitary activities. This suggests that an axolotls failure to undergo anatomical metamorphosis late in the larval period is indirectly associated with a mechanism(s) that acts earlier in development to broadly program transcription. The axolotl hopeful monster provides a model to identify mechanisms of early brain development that proximally and ultimately affect the expression of adult phenotypes.",

        "abstract": "Changes in gene expression in a panel of primary normal human mammary epithelial cell strains, developed from healthy breast tissue obtained at reduction mammoplasty from different donors, in response to benzo[a]pyrene exposure have been investigated. It was expected that both gene expression changes common to cell strains derived from different donors as well as inter-individual variation would be observed. Therefore, the strategy that has been adopted is to identify potentially important changes, or useful changes from a biomonitoring perspective, using gene-array technology and a small number of donors; then investigate selected transcription responses using a large number of tissue donors and a cheaper method of transcript detection (real-time polymerase chain reaction). Here we report results from four primary normal human mammary epithelial cell strains that were treated with benzo[a]pyrene in vitro for either 6 or 24 h. Transcription was monitored using high-density oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix HuGeneFL). Total RNA was used for the preparation of labeled targets that were hybridized to microarrays containing probes representing more than 6800 human genes and expressed sequence tags. Gene expression data were analyzed using the GeneChip?? software (MAS 5.0). Altered gene expression patterns were observed in response to benzo[a]pyrene in human mammary epithelial cell strains from different donors. Specifically, the dioxin inducible cytochrome P450 CYP1B1 was consistently induced in response to 6 and 24 h exposure to benzo[a]pyrene in cell strains from all four donors. Two other genes that were relatively consistently induced were IL1?? and MMP1. Less consistent changes in other metabolism genes (CYP1A1, CYP11B2, and NQO1) and certain cell cycle control genes GOS2 and AF1Q were also induced, while EGR1 was suppressed. Although no change in p53 transcription was observed, an accumulation of p53 protein was detected using antibodies. A similar accumulation of Waf1 (p21) was also observed using immunohistochemistry, this was expected since p53 is p21's transcription factor. Significant inter-individual variations in both the levels and patterns of gene expression were observed, in response to benzo[a]pyrene exposure. These studies provide a complementary approach to molecular epidemiology for the investigation of differential susceptibility to chemical carcinogens, and specifically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",

It is known, however, that epigenetic mechanisms can mediate alterations in transcription due to environmental influences. In order to identify genes susceptible to regulation in the adult cortex by one type of epigenetic mechanism, histone, and protein acetylation, we treated mice with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA). After 1 week of treatment with TSA, RNA was extracted from the brain cortices of mice and gene expression differences were analyzed by microarray profiling. The altered genes were then compared with genes differentially expressed in microarray studies of disease by database and literature searches. Genes regulated by TSA were found to significantly overlap with differentially expressed genes in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Several TSA-regulated genes involved in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic reprogramming including histone cluster 1, H4 h (Hist1H4 h), methionine adenosyltransferase II, alpha (Mat2a), and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine reductase (Mtrr) overlapped with genes altered in early-stage AD in gray matter. We also show that the expression of hemoglobin, which has been shown to be altered in neurons in the AD brain, is regulated by TSA treatment. This analysis suggests involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in neurons in early stages of AD.",

In many disorders, the associated peripheral cytokine milieu is dilute and difficult to measure, necessitating development of more sensitive and informative biomarkers for mechanistic studies, earlier diagnosis, and monitoring therapeutic interventions. Previously, we have shown that plasma of recent-onset (RO) Type 1 diabetes patients induces a disease-specific proinflammatory transcriptional profile in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) compared with that of healthy controls (HC). To eliminate assay variance introduced through the use of multiple donors or multiple draws of the same person over time, we evaluated human leukemia cell lines as potential surrogates for fresh PBMC. We 1) tested seven different cell lines in their power to differentiate RO from HC plasma and 2) compared the similarity of the signatures generated across the seven cell lines to that obtained with fresh PBMC. While each cell line tested exhibited a distinct transcriptional response when cultured with RO or HC plasma, the expression profile induced in any single cell line shared little identity with that of the other cell lines or fresh PBMC. In terms of regulated biological pathways, the transcriptional response of each cell line shared varying degrees of functional identity with fresh PBMC. These results indicate that use of human leukemia cell lines as surrogates for fresh PBMC has potential in detecting perturbations to the peripheral cytokine milieu. However, the response of each is distinct, possessing varying degrees of functional relatedness to that observed with PBMC.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Differences in the expression of Natural Killer cell receptors have been reported to reflect divergent clinical courses in patients with chronic infections or tumors. However, extensive molecular characterization at the transcriptional level to support this view is lacking. The aim of this work was to characterize baseline differences in purified NK cell transcriptional activity stratified by response to treatment with PEG-IFNalpha/RBV in patients chronically infected with HCV. METHODS: To this end we here studied by flow cytometer and gene expression profile, phenotypic and transcriptional characteristics of purified NK cells in patients chronically infected with HCV genotype-1 virus who were subsequently treated with PEG-IFNalpha/RBV. Results were further correlated with divergent clinical response obtained after treatment. RESULTS: The pre-treatment transcriptional patterns of purified NK cells from patients subsequently undergoing a sustained virologic response (SVR) clearly segregated from those of non-responder (NR) patients. A set of 476 transcripts, including molecules involved in RNA processing, ubiquitination pathways as well as HLA class II signalling were differently expressed among divergent patients. In addition, treatment outcome was associated with differences in surface expression of NKp30 and NKG2D. A complex relationship was observed that suggested for extensive post-transcriptional editing. Only a small number of the NK cell transcripts identified were correlated with chronic HCV infection/replication indicating that inherent transcriptional activity prevails over environment effects such as viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, inherent/genetic modulation of NK cell transcription is involved in setting the path to divergent treatment outcomes and could become useful to therapeutic advantage.",

In this study, we subjected greenhouse grown grapevine, variety Aragonez, to two individual abiotic stresses, water deficit stress(WDS), and heat stress (HS). The adaptation of plants to stress is a complex response triggered by cascades of molecular net works involved in stress perception, signal transduction, and the expression of specific stress-related genes and metabolites. Approaches such as array-based transcript profiling allow assessing the expression of thousands of genes in control and stress tissues. Using microarrays, we analyzed the leaf transcriptomic profile of the grapevine plants. Photosynthesis measurements verified that the plants were significantly affected by the stresses applied. Leaf gene expression was obtained using a high-throughput transcriptomic grapevine array, the 23K custom-made Affymetrix Vitis GeneChip. We identified 1,594 genes as differentially expressed between control and treatments and grouped them into ten major functional categories using MapMan software. The transcriptome of Aragonez was more significantly affected by HS when compared with WDS. The number of genes coding for heat-shock proteins and transcription factors expressed solely in response to HS suggesting their expression as unique signatures of HS. However, across-talk between the response pathways to both stresses was observed at the level of AP2/ERF transcription factors.",

        "abstract": "The soil-dwelling nematode C. elegans is a powerful system for comparative molecular analyses of environmental stress response mechanisms. Infection of worms with bacterial and fungal pathogens causes the activation of well-characterized innate immune transcriptional programs in pathogen-exposed hypodermal and intestinal tissues. However, the pathophysiological events that drive such transcriptional responses are not understood. Here, we show that infection-activated transcriptional responses are, in large part, recapitulated by either physiological or genetic activation of the osmotic stress response. Microarray profiling of wild type worms exposed to non-lethal hypertonicity identified a suite of genes that were also regulated by infection. Expression profiles of five different osmotic stress resistant (osr) mutants under isotonic conditions reiterated the wild type transcriptional response to osmotic stress and also showed substantial similarity to infection-induced gene expression under isotonic conditions. Computational, transgenic, and functional approaches revealed that two GATA transcription factors previously implicated in infection-induced transcriptional responses, elt-2 and elt-3, are also essential for coordinated tissue-specific activation of osmosensitive gene expression and promote survival under osmotically stressful conditions. Together, our data suggest infection and osmotic adaptation share previously unappreciated transcriptional similarities which might be controlled via regulation of tissue-specific GATA transcription factors.",

        "abstract": "Stress response pathways allow cells to sense and respond to environmental changes and adverse pathophysiological states. Pharmacological modulation of cellular stress pathways has implications in the treatment of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The quinone methide triterpene celastrol, derived from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has numerous pharmacological properties, and it is a potent activator of the mammalian heat shock transcription factor HSF1. However, its mode of action and spectrum of cellular targets are poorly understood. We show here that celastrol activates Hsf1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae at a similar effective concentration seen in mammalian cells. Transcriptional profiling revealed that celastrol treatment induces a battery of oxidant defense genes in addition to heat shock genes. Celastrol activated the yeast Yap1 oxidant defense transcription factor via the carboxy-terminal redox center that responds to electrophilic compounds. Antioxidant response genes were likewise induced in mammalian cells, demonstrating that the activation of two major cell stress pathways by celastrol is conserved. We report that celastrol\u2019s biological effects, including inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor activity, can be blocked by the addition of excess free thiol, suggesting a chemical mechanism for biological activity based on modification of key reactive thiols by this natural product",

The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist infliximab was recently found to reduce depressive symptoms in patients with increased baseline inflammation as reflected by a plasma C-reactive protein concentration > 5. mg/L. To further explore predictors and targets of response to infliximab, differential gene expression was examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infliximab responders (n=. 13) versus non-responders (n=. 14) compared to placebo at baseline and 6. h, 24. h, and 2. weeks after the first infliximab infusion. Treatment response was defined as 50% reduction in depressive symptoms at any point during the 12-week trial. One-hundred-forty-eight gene transcripts were significantly associated (1.2-fold, adjusted p???. 0.01) with response to infliximab and were distinct from placebo responders. Transcripts predictive of infliximab response were associated with gluconeogenesis and cholesterol transport, and were enriched in a network regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)4-alpha, a transcription factor involved in gluconeogenesis and cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. Of the 148 transcripts differentially expressed at baseline, 48% were significantly regulated over time in infliximab responders, including genes related to gluconeogenesis and the HNF4-alpha network, indicating that these predictive genes were responsive to infliximab. Responders also demonstrated inhibition of genes related to apoptosis through TNF signaling at 6. h and 24. h after infusion. Transcripts down-regulated in responders 2. weeks after infliximab were related to innate immune signaling and nuclear factor-kappa B. Thus, baseline transcriptional signatures reflective of alterations in glucose and lipid metabolism predicted antidepressant response to infliximab, and infliximab response involved regulation of metabolic genes and inhibition of genes related to innate immune activation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

As people with access to antiretroviral treatments live longer, HAND can be found in increasing segments of populations at risk for other chronic, neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). If brain diseases of diverse etiologies utilize similar biological pathways in the brain, they may coexist in a patient and possibly exacerbate neuropathogenesis and morbidity. To test this proposition, we conducted comparative meta-analysis of selected publicly available microarray datasets from brain tissues of patients with HAND, AD, and MS. In pair-wise and three-way analyses, we found a large number of dysregulated genes and biological processes common to either HAND and AD or HAND and MS, or to all three diseases. The common characteristic of all three diseases was up-regulation of broadly ranging immune responses in the brain. In addition, HAND and AD share down-modulation of processes involved, among others, in synaptic transmission and cell-cell signaling while HAND and MS share defective processes of neurogenesis and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity. Our approach could provide insight into the identification of common disease mechanisms and better intervention strategies for complex neurocognitive disorders.",

Beech trees changed their transcript levels in response to ozone.

Furthermore, we obtained differences in mRNA expression patterns between shade and sun leaves. In the ozone-treated sun leaves of 2005, slightly up- and down-regulated transcript levels were detected, particularly in the spring and autumn, whereas shade leaves clearly exhibited reduced mRNA levels, particularly at the end of the vegetation period. In 2006, this pattern could not be confirmed, and in the autumn, four other transcripts were slightly up-regulated in ozone-treated shade leaves. In addition, two other transcripts were found to be influenced in sun leaves in the spring/summer. While we detected changes in the levels of only a few transcripts, the observed effects were not identical in both years. In conclusion, elevated ozone exhibited very small influence on the transcription levels of genes of mature beech trees. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The therapeutic benefit of physical activity to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes is commonly accepted. However, the impact of the disease on the acute metabolic response is less clear. To this end, we investigated the effect of type 2 diabetes on exercise-induced plasma metabolite changes and the muscular transcriptional response using a complementary metabolomics/transcriptomics approach. METHODS: We analysed 139 plasma metabolites and hormones at nine time points, and whole genome expression in skeletal muscle at three time points, during a 60 min bicycle ergometer exercise and a 180 min recovery phase in type 2 diabetic patients and healthy controls matched for age, percentage body fat and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2). RESULTS: Pathway analysis of differentially regulated genes upon exercise revealed upregulation of regulators of GLUT4 (SLC2A4RG, FLOT1, EXOC7, RAB13, RABGAP1 and CBLB), glycolysis (HK2, PFKFB1, PFKFB3, PFKM, FBP2 and LDHA) and insulin signal mediators in diabetic participants compared with controls. Notably, diabetic participants had normalised rates of lactate and insulin levels, and of glucose appearance and disappearance, after exercise. They also showed an exercise-induced compensatory regulation of genes involved in biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids (PSPH, GATM, NOS1 and GLDC), which responded to differences in the amino acid profile (consistently lower plasma levels of glycine, cysteine and arginine). Markers of fat oxidation (acylcarnitines) and lipolysis (glycerol) did not indicate impaired metabolic flexibility during exercise in diabetic participants. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Type 2 diabetic individuals showed specific exercise-regulated gene expression. These data provide novel insight into potential mechanisms to ameliorate the disturbed glucose and amino acid metabolism associated with type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: In searching for a noninvasive surrogate tissue mimicking the pro-oxidant/proinflammatory hypertensive heart disease (HHD) phenotype, we turned to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We tested whether iterations in [Ca2+]i, [Zn2+]i, and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes and PBMCs would complement each other, eliciting similar shifts in gene expression profiles in these tissues demonstrable during the preclinical (week 1) and pathological (week 4) stages of aldosterone/salt treatment (ALDOST).\nBACKGROUND: Inappropriate neurohormonal activation contributes to pathological remodeling of myocardium in HHD associated with aldosteronism. In rats receiving long-term ALDOST, evidence of reparative fibrosis replacing necrotic cardiomyocytes and coronary vasculopathy appears at week 4 associated with the induction of oxidative stress by mitochondria that overwhelms endogenous, largely Zn2+-based, antioxidant defenses. Biomarker-guided prediction of risk before the appearance of cardiac pathology would prove invaluable.\nMETHODS: In PBMCs and cardiomyocytes, quantitation of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ and Zn2+, H2O2, and 8-iosprostane levels and isolation of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and gene expression together with statistical and clustering analyses and confirmation of genes by in situ hybridization and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed.\nRESULTS: Compared with controls, at weeks 1 and 4 of ALDOST, we found comparable increments in [Ca2+]i, [Zn2+]i, and 8-isoprotane coupled with increased H2O2 production in cardiac mitochondria and PBMCs, together with the common networks of expression profiles dominated by genes involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and repair. These included 3 central Ingenuity pathway-linked genes: p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, a stress-responsive protein; nuclear factor-\u03baB, a redox-sensitive transcription factor and a proinflammatory cascade that it regulates; and transforming growth factor-\u03b21, a fibrogenic cytokine involved in tissue repair.\nCONCLUSIONS: Significant overlapping demonstrated in the molecular mimicry of PBMCs and cardiomyocytes during preclinical and pathological stages of ALDOST implies that transcriptional signatures of PBMCs may serve as early noninvasive and novel sentinels predictive of impending pathological remodeling in HHD.",

        "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of malignancies that may be sensitive to the NK cell antitumor response. However, NK cells are frequently defective in AML. In this study, we found in an exploratory cohort (n = 46) that NK cell status at diagnosis of AML separated patients in two groups with a different clinical outcome. Patients with a deficient NK cell profile, including reduced expression of some activating NK receptors (e.g., DNAX accessory molecule-1, NKp46, and NKG2D) and decreased IFN-\u03b3 production, had a significantly higher risk of relapse (p = 0.03) independently of cytogenetic classification in multivariate analysis. Patients with defective NK cells showed a profound gene expression decrease in AML blasts for cytokine and chemokine signaling (e.g., IL15, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, and CXCR4), Ag processing (e.g., HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, and CD74) and adhesion molecule pathways (e.g., PVR and ICAM1). A set of 388 leukemic classifier genes defined in the exploratory cohort was independently validated in a multicentric cohort of 194 AML patients. In total, these data evidenced the interplay between NK cells and AML blasts at diagnosis allowing an immune-based stratification of AML patients independently of clinical classifications.",

        "abstract": "Background Lung donation after cardiac death (DCD), in contrast to donation after brain death (DBD), is a promising and increasingly common method to help relieve the shortage of donor organs. We aimed to study the differential gene expression profiles in lungs of DCD and DBD patients and interpreted the differences using functional pathway analysis. Methods We performed microarray studies on pre- and post-transplant lung tissues from 7 DCD and 12 matched DBD patients. Gene profiling was performed by Affymetrix human gene U-133 plus 2 GeneChip on 35 lung tissues. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) and Hierarchical Clustering were performed to identify gross gene expression features and the lists of significantly regulated genes. We used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to determine functional significance and the genomic network relationship. Results Gene expression profiles between DCD and DBD demonstrated a clear distinction by PCA, especially in the pre-transplant period. The gene sets enriched in DBD mapped to innate immunity, intracellular signaling, cytokine interaction, cell communication and apoptosis pathways. The networks produced by IPA showed that pro-inflammatory nodes played major role in pre-transplant DBD networks. However, the number of differentially regulated transcripts or gene sets decreased markedly after transplantation between DBD and DCD. Conclusion Analysis of gene expression profiles in donor lungs showed significant differences in pathway activation between DBD and DCD lungs. The observation of fewer inflammatory features of DCD donor lungs suggests safe application of lung transplantation in properly preserved DCD donor lungs. ?? 2011 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

While in C57BL/6 mice, the amastigote population size was increasing progressively, in DBA/2 mice, it was rapidly controlled. This latter rapid control did not prevent intracellular amastigotes to persist in the ear pinna and in the ear-draining lymph node/ear-DLN.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Upon co-stimulation with CD3/CD28 antibodies, activated CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells were found to lose their susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, exhibiting an induced resistant phenotype. This rather unexpected phenomenon has been repeatedly confirmed but the underlying cell and molecular mechanisms are still unknown.\\n\\nMETHODS: We first replicated the reported system using the specified Dynal beads with PHA/IL-2-stimulated and un-stimulated cells as controls. Genome-wide expression and analysis were then performed by using Agilent whole genome microarrays and established bioinformatics tools.\\n\\nRESULTS: We showed that following CD3/CD28 co-stimulation, a homogeneous population emerged with uniform expression of activation markers CD25 and CD69 as well as a memory marker CD45RO at high levels. These cells differentially expressed 7,824 genes when compared with the controls on microarrays. Series-Cluster analysis identified 6 distinct expression profiles containing 1,345 genes as the representative signatures in the permissive and resistant cells. Of them, 245 (101 potentially permissive and 144 potentially resistant) were significant in gene ontology categories related to immune response, cell adhesion and metabolism. Co-expression networks analysis identified 137 \"key regulatory\" genes (84 potentially permissive and 53 potentially resistant), holding hub positions in the gene interactions. By mapping these genes on KEGG pathways, the predominance of actin cytoskeleton functions, proteasomes, and cell cycle arrest in induced resistance emerged. We also revealed an entire set of previously unreported novel genes for further mining and functional validation.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This initial microarray study will stimulate renewed interest in exploring this system and open new avenues for research into HIV-1 susceptibility and its reversal in target cells, serving as a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic and clinical treatments.",

        "abstract": "Microarrays are used to study gene expression in a variety of biological systems. A number of different platforms have been developed, but few studies exist that have directly compared the performance of one platform with another. The goal of this study was to determine array variation by analyzing the same RNA samples with three different array platforms. Using gene expression responses to benzo[a]pyrene exposure in normal human mammary epithelial cells (NHMECs), we compared the results of gene expression profiling using three microarray platforms: photolithographic oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix), spotted oligonucleotide arrays (Amersham), and spotted cDNA arrays (NCI). While most previous reports comparing microarrays have analyzed pre-existing data from different platforms, this comparison study used the same sample assayed on all three platforms, allowing for analysis of variation from each array platform. In general, poor correlation was found with corresponding measurements from each platform. Each platform yielded different gene expression profiles, suggesting that while microarray analysis is a useful discovery tool, further validation is needed to extrapolate results for broad use of the data. Also, microarray variability needs to be taken into consideration, not only in the data analysis but also in specific probe selection for each array type.",

        "abstract": "Diet is highly linked to breast cancer risk, yet little is known about its influence on mammary epithelial populations with distinct regenerative and hence, tumorigenic potential. To investigate this, we evaluated the relative frequency of lineage-negative CD29hiCD24+, CD29loCD24+ and CD29hiThy1+CD24+ epithelial subpopulations in pre-neoplastic mammary tissue of adult virgin MMTV-Wnt1-transgenic mice fed either control (Casein) or soy-based diets. We found that mammary epithelial cells exposed to soy diet exhibited a lower percentage of CD29hiCD24+Lin- population, decreased ability to form mammospheres in culture, lower mammary outgrowth potential when transplanted into cleared fat pads, and reduced appearance of tumor-initiating CD29hiThy1+CD24+ cells, than in those of control diet-fed mice. Diet had no comparable influence on the percentage of the CD29loCD24+Lin- population. Global gene expression profiling of the CD29hiCD24+subpopulation revealed markedly altered expression of genes important to inflammation, cytokine and chemokine signaling, and proliferation. Soy-fed relative to casein-fed mice showed lower mammary tumor incidence, shorter tumor latency, and reduced systemic levels of estradiol 17-??, progesterone and interleukin-6. Our results provide evidence for the functional impact of diet on specific epithelial subpopulations that may relate to breast cancer risk and suggest that diet-regulated cues can be further explored for breast cancer risk assessment and prevention. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The Gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a pivotal role in AIDS pathogenesis as it is the primary site for viral transmission, replication and CD4(+) T cell destruction. Accordingly, GI disease (enteropathy) has become a well-known complication and a driver of AIDS progression. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying GI disease we analyzed global gene expression profiles sequentially in the intestinal epithelium of the same animals before SIV infection and at 21 and 90 days post infection (DPI). More importantly we obtained sequential excisional intestinal biopsies and examined distinct mucosal components (epithelium. intraepithelial lymphocytes, lamina propria lymphocytes, fibrovascular stroma) separately. Here we report data pertaining to the epithelium. Overall genes associated with epithelial cell renewal/proliferation/differentiation, permeability and adhesion were significantly down regulated (<1.5-7 fold) at 21 and 90DPI. Genes regulating focal adhesions (n\u200a=\u200a6), gap junctions (n\u200a=\u200a3), ErbB (n\u200a=\u200a3) and Wnt signaling (n\u200a=\u200a4) were markedly down at 21DPI and the number of genes in each of these groups that were down regulated doubled between 21 and 90DPI. Notable genes included FAK, ITGA6, PDGF, TGF\u03b23, Ezrin, FZD6, WNT10A, and TCF7L2. In addition, at 90DPI genes regulating ECM-receptor interactions (laminins and ITGB1), epithelial cell gene expression (PDX1, KLF6), polarity/tight junction formation (PARD3B&6B) and histone demethylase (JMJD3) were also down regulated. In contrast, expression of NOTCH3, notch target genes (HES4, HES7) and EZH2 (histone methyltransferase) were significantly increased at 90DPI. The altered expression of genes linked to Wnt signaling together with decreased expression of PDX1, PARD3B, PARD6B and SDK1 suggests marked perturbations in intestinal epithelial function and homeostasis leading to breakdown of the mucosal barrier. More importantly, the divergent expression patterns of EZH2 and JMJD3 suggests that an epigenetic mechanism involving histone modifications may contribute to the massive decrease in gene expression at 90DPI leading to defects in enterocyte maturation and differentiation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The neonatal bovine mammary fat pad (MFP) surrounding the mammary parenchyma (PAR) is thought to exert proliferative effects on the PAR through secretion of local modulators of growth induced by systemic hormones. We used bioinformatics to characterize transcriptomics differences between PAR and MFP from approximately 65 d old Holstein heifers. Data were mined to uncover potential crosstalk through the analyses of signaling molecules preferentially expressed in one tissue relative to the other.\\n\\nRESULTS: Over 9,000 differentially expressed genes (DEG; False discovery rate <or= 0.05) were found of which 1,478 had a >or=1.5-fold difference between PAR and MFP. Within the DEG highly-expressed in PAR vs. MFP (n = 736) we noted significant enrichment of functions related to cell cycle, structural organization, signaling, and DNA/RNA metabolism. Only actin cytoskeletal signaling was significant among canonical pathways. DEG more highly-expressed in MFP vs. PAR (n = 742) belong to lipid metabolism, signaling, cell movement, and immune-related functions. Canonical pathways associated with metabolism and signaling, particularly immune- and metabolism-related were significantly-enriched. Network analysis uncovered a central role of MYC, TP53, and CTNNB1 in controlling expression of DEG highly-expressed in PAR vs. MFP. Similar analysis suggested a central role for PPARG, KLF2, EGR2, and EPAS1 in regulating expression of more highly-expressed DEG in MFP vs. PAR. Gene network analyses revealed putative inter-tissue crosstalk between cytokines and growth factors preferentially expressed in one tissue (e.g., ANGPTL1, SPP1, IL1B in PAR vs. MFP; ADIPOQ, IL13, FGF2, LEP in MFP vs. PAR) with DEG preferentially expressed in the other tissue, particularly transcription factors or pathways (e.g., MYC, TP53, and actin cytoskeletal signaling in PAR vs. MFP; PPARG and LXR/RXR Signaling in MFP vs. PAR).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Functional analyses underscored a reciprocal influence in determining the biological features of MFP and PAR during neonatal development. This was exemplified by the potential effect that the signaling molecules (cytokines, growth factors) released preferentially (i.e., more highly-expressed) by PAR or MFP could have on molecular functions or signaling pathways enriched in the MFP or PAR. These bidirectional interactions might be required to coordinate mammary tissue development under normal circumstances or in response to nutrition.",

        "abstract": "Global genomic approaches in cancer research have provided new and innovative strategies for the identification of signatures that differentiate various types of human cancers. Computational analysis of the promoter composition of the genes within these signatures may provide a powerful method for deducing the regulatory transcriptional networks that mediate their collective function. In this study we have systematically analyzed the promoter composition of gene classes derived from previously established genetic signatures that recently have been shown to reliably and reproducibly distinguish five molecular subtypes of breast cancer associated with distinct clinical outcomes. Inferences made from the trends of transcription factor binding site enrichment in the promoters of these gene groups led to the identification of regulatory pathways that implicate discrete transcriptional networks associated with specific molecular subtypes of breast cancer. One of these inferred pathways predicted a role for nuclear factor-kappaB in a novel feed-forward, self-amplifying, autoregulatory module regulated by the ERBB family of growth factor receptors. The existence of this pathway was verified in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation and shown to be deregulated in breast cancer cells overexpressing ERBB2. This analysis indicates that approaches of this type can provide unique insights into the differential regulatory molecular programs associated with breast cancer and will aid in identifying specific transcriptional networks and pathways as potential targets for tumor subtype-specific therapeutic intervention.",

        "title": "Comparative transcriptional network modeling of three ppar-??/?? co-agonists reveals distinct metabolic gene signatures in primary human hepatocytes",
        "abstract": "AIMS: To compare the molecular and biologic signatures of a balanced dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b1/\u03b3 agonist, aleglitazar, with tesaglitazar (a dual PPAR-\u03b1/\u03b3 agonist) or a combination of pioglitazone (Pio; PPAR-\u03b3 agonist) and fenofibrate (Feno; PPAR-\u03b1 agonist) in human hepatocytes.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Gene expression microarray profiles were obtained from primary human hepatocytes treated with EC(50)-aligned low, medium and high concentrations of the three treatments. A systems biology approach, Causal Network Modeling, was used to model the data to infer upstream molecular mechanisms that may explain the observed changes in gene expression. Aleglitazar, tesaglitazar and Pio/Feno each induced unique transcriptional signatures, despite comparable core PPAR signaling. Although all treatments inferred qualitatively similar PPAR-\u03b1 signaling, aleglitazar was inferred to have greater effects on high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than tesaglitazar and Pio/Feno, due to a greater number of gene expression changes in pathways related to high-density and low-density lipoprotein metabolism. Distinct transcriptional and biologic signatures were also inferred for stress responses, which appeared to be less affected by aleglitazar than the comparators. In particular, Pio/Feno was inferred to increase NFE2L2 activity, a key component of the stress response pathway, while aleglitazar had no significant effect. All treatments were inferred to decrease proliferative signaling.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Aleglitazar induces transcriptional signatures related to lipid parameters and stress responses that are unique from other dual PPAR-\u03b1/\u03b3 treatments. This may underlie observed favorable changes in lipid profiles in animal and clinical studies with aleglitazar and suggests a differentiated gene profile compared with other dual PPAR-\u03b1/\u03b3 agonist treatments.",

        "abstract": "The specialized cell types of tissues and organs are generated during development and are replenished over lifetime though the process of differentiation. During differentiation the characteristics and identity of cells are changed to meet their functional requirements. Differentiated cells then faithfully maintain their characteristic gene expression patterns. On the molecular level transcription factors have a key role in instructing speci fi c gene expression programs. They act together with chromatin regulators which stabilize expression patterns. Current evidence indicates that epigenetic mechanisms are essential for maintaining stable cell identi- ties. Conversely, the disruption of chromatin regulators is associated with disease and cellular transformation. In mammals, a large number of chro- matin regulators have been identi fi ed. The Polycomb group complexes and the DNA methylation system have been widely studied in develop- ment. Other chromatin regulators remain to be explored. This chapter focuses on recent advances in understanding epigenetic regulation in embryonic and adult stem cells in mammals. The available data illustrate that several chromatin regulators control key lineage speci fi c genes. Different epigenetic systems potentially could provide stability and guard against loss or mutation of individual components. Recent experiments also suggest intervals in cell differentiation and development when new epigenetic patterns are established. Epigenetic patterns have been observed to change at a progenitor state after stem cells commit to differentiation. This fi nding is consistent with a role of epigenetic regulation in stabilizing expression patterns after their establishment by transcription factors. However, the available data also suggest that additional, presently unidenti fi ed, chromatin regulatory mechanisms exist. Identification of these mechanisms is an important aim for future research to obtain a more complete framework for understanding stem cell differentiation during tissue homeostasis.",

Comparing the blood transcriptional response of tuberculosis to other similar pulmonary diseases will advance knowledge of disease pathways and help distinguish diseases with similar clinical presentations.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES: To determine the factors underlying the immunopathogenesis of the granulomatous diseases, sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, by comparing the blood transcriptional responses in these and other pulmonary diseases.\\n\\nMETHODS: We compared whole blood genome-wide transcriptional profiles in pulmonary sarcoidosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, to community acquired pneumonia and primary lung cancer and healthy controls, before and after treatment, and in purified leucocyte populations.\\n\\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An Interferon-inducible neutrophil-driven blood transcriptional signature was present in both sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, with a higher abundance and expression in tuberculosis. Heterogeneity of the sarcoidosis signature correlated significantly with disease activity. Transcriptional profiles in pneumonia and lung cancer revealed an over-abundance of inflammatory transcripts. After successful treatment the transcriptional activity in tuberculosis and pneumonia patients was significantly reduced. However the glucocorticoid-responsive sarcoidosis patients showed a significant increase in transcriptional activity. 144-blood transcripts were able to distinguish tuberculosis from other lung diseases and controls.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis and sarcoidosis revealed similar blood transcriptional profiles, dominated by interferon-inducible transcripts, while pneumonia and lung cancer showed distinct signatures, dominated by inflammatory genes. There were also significant differences between tuberculosis and sarcoidosis in the degree of their transcriptional activity, the heterogeneity of their profiles and their transcriptional response to treatment.",

        "title": "Transcriptional profiling develops molecular signatures for ovarian tumors",
        "abstract": "Of the cancers unique to women, ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate. Over 26,000 women are diagnosed with this disease in the U.S. annually, and 60% of those diagnosed will die of the disease. One of the greatest problems with this disease is the lack of strong early warning signs or symptoms resulting in advanced stage at presentation in most women, followed by the outgrowth of chemotherapy-resistant disease in the majority of patients. The 5-year survival for patients with early stage disease ranges from 50-90%, but it is less than 25% for advanced-stage disease. In collaboration with researchers at Millennium Predictive Medicine (Cambridge, MA), the Ovarian Cancer Program of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center analyzed gene expression in over 50 primary ovarian tumors, as compared with normal ovarian epithelial cells. The technologies utilized included microarray analysis with nitrocellulose filters containing 25,000 arrayed human cDNAs, as well as the construction of subtraction suppression hybridization cDNA libraries and their subsequent sequencing. Our specific focus has been on genes that are underexpressed during the development of ovarian cancer, although this analysis has revealed a large number of consistently up- and down-regulated genes. There were more down-regulated genes in ovarian tumors than up-regulated genes. In addition, the number of genes that had altered expression levels was quite large. For example, we found 409 genes down-regulated at least 5-fold, and 72 genes up-regulated at least 5-fold in 33% of the tumors analyzed. We also observed that most of the expression alterations observed in later stage (Stages III/IV) tumors were also observed in early-stage tumors (Stages I/II). This was corroborated using comparative genomic hybridization analysis on the same tumors that were expression profiled. This analysis revealed that the late-stage tumors had more gene amplification than early-stage tumors, but most regions of change (either increases or decreases) were in common between different stage tumors. We also have verified the altered expression levels of several of these genes using several complementary strategies. Finally, we are taking top candidate genes that are consistently under-expressed in ovarian tumors and attempting to determine their functional role in the development of ovarian cancer.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is a rare form of plasma cell dyscrasia that presents either as a progression of previously diagnosed multiple myeloma, namely secondary PCL, or as initial manifestation of disease, namely primary PCL (pPCL). Although the presenting signs and symptoms include those seen in multiple myeloma, pPCL is characterized by several aspects that define a more aggressive course. Here, we have investigated the transcriptome of pPCLs and correlated differential expression profiles with outcome to provide insights into the biology of the disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression profiles of 21 newly diagnosed pPCLs included in a multicenter prospective clinical trial were generated using high-density microarray, then evaluated in comparison with a representative series of patients with multiple myeloma and in association with clinical outcome. RESULTS: All but one of the pPCLs had one of the main immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus translocations, whose associated transcriptional signatures resembled those observed in multiple myeloma. A 503-gene signature distinguished pPCL from multiple myeloma, from which emerged 26 genes whose expression trend was associated with progressive stages of plasma cells dyscrasia in a large dataset from multiple institutions, including samples from normal donors throughout PCL. Finally, 3 genes were identified as having expression levels that correlated with response to the first-line treatment with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, whereas a 27-gene signature was associated with overall survival independently of molecular alterations, hematologic parameters, and renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data contribute to a fine dissection of pPCL and may provide novel insights into the molecular definition of patients with poorer prognosis.",

To gain new insights into the diversity and developmental regulation of human NK cells, we used data from high-resolution microarrays with independent verification to describe a comprehensive comparative analysis between immature decidual NK (idNK) cells with a CD56(bright) CD16(-) T-bet(-) phenotype and mature peripheral NK (mpNK) cells with a CD56(dim) CD16(+) T-bet(+) phenotype. This study shows that many novel growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines are expressed by NK cells, and they may regulate NK-cell development or function in an autocrine manner. Notably, we present that idNK and mpNK cells are enriched for homeobox and zinc-finger transcription factors (TFs), respectively. Additionally, many novel candidate transcriptional regulators are common to both idNK and mpNK cells. We further describe the transcriptional regulatory networks of NK cells and show that the endogenous growth factors, cytokines, and TFs enriched in idNK cells regulate each other and may contribute to idNK-cell immaturity. Together, these findings provide novel molecular signatures for immature and mature NK cells, and the novel candidate regulators identified here can be used to describe and further understand NK-cell differentiation and function.",

We determined the chromatin modification states in high resolution along 30 Mb of the human genome and found that active promoters are marked by trimethylation of Lys4 of histone H3 (H3K4), whereas enhancers are marked by monomethylation, but not trimethylation, of H3K4. We developed computational algorithms using these distinct chromatin signatures to identify new regulatory elements, predicting over 200 promoters and 400 enhancers within the 30-Mb region. This approach accurately predicted the location and function of independently identified regulatory elements with high sensitivity and specificity and uncovered a novel functional enhancer for the carnitine transporter SLC22A5 (OCTN2). Our results give insight into the connections between chromatin modifications and transcriptional regulatory activity and provide a new tool for the functional annotation of the human genome.",

        "abstract": "The majority of women diagnosed with lymph node-negative breast cancer are unnecessarily treated with damaging chemotherapeutics after surgical resection. This highlights the importance of understanding and more accurately predicting patient prognosis. In the present study, we define the transcriptional networks regulating well-established prognostic gene expression signatures. We find that the same set of transcriptional regulators consistently lie upstream of both 'prognosis' and 'proliferation' gene signatures, suggesting that a central transcriptional network underpins a shared phenotype within these signatures. Strikingly, the master transcriptional regulators within this network predict recurrence risk for lymph node-negative breast cancer better than currently used multigene prognostic assays, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive patients. Simultaneous examination of p16(INK4A\u00a0) expression, which predicts tumours that have bypassed cellular senescence, revealed that intermediate levels of p16(INK4A) correlate with an intact pRB pathway and improved survival. A combination of these master transcriptional regulators and p16(INK4A) , termed the OncoMasTR score, stratifies tumours based on their proliferative and senescence capacity, facilitating a clearer delineation of lymph node-negative breast cancer patients at high risk of recurrence, and thus requiring chemotherapy. Furthermore, OncoMasTR accurately classifies over 60% of patients as 'low risk', an improvement on existing prognostic assays, which has the potential to reduce overtreatment in early-stage patients. Taken together, the present study provides new insights into the transcriptional regulation of cellular proliferation in breast cancer and provides an opportunity to enhance and streamline methods of predicting breast cancer prognosis.",

        "abstract": "The six major genes involved in hereditary susceptibility for pheochromocytoma (PCC)/paraganglioma (PGL) (RET, VHL, NF1, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD) have been recently integrated into the same neuronal apoptotic pathway where mutations in any of these genes lead to cell death. In this model, prolyl hydroxylase 3 (EglN3) abrogation plays a pivotal role, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its inactivation are currently unknown. The aim of the study was to decipher specific alterations associated with the different genetic classes of PCCs/PGLs. With this purpose, 84 genetically characterized tumors were analyzed by means of transcriptional profiling. The analysis revealed a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-related signature common to succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumors, that differentiated them from RET and neurofibromatosis type 1 cases. Both canonical HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 target genes were overexpressed in the SDH/VHL cluster, suggesting that a global HIF deregulation accounts for this common profile. Nevertheless, when we compared VHL tumors with SDHB cases, which often exhibit a malignant behavior, we found that HIF-1\u03b1 target genes showed a predominant activation in the VHL PCCs. Expression data from 67 HIF target genes was sufficient to cluster SDHB and VHL tumors into two different groups, demonstrating different pseudo-hypoxic signatures. In addition, VHL-mutated tumors showed an unexpected overexpression of EglN3 mRNA that did not lead to significantly different EglN3 protein levels. These findings pave the way for more specific therapeutic approaches for malignant PCCs/PGLs management based on the patient's genetic alteration.",

Recent years have witnessed a major shift from microorganism-centric toward host-oriented characterization and categorization of viral infections and infection related diseases. We established host transcriptional response (HTR) relationships among 23 different types of human viral pathogens based on calculating HTR similarities using computational integration of 587 public available gene expression profiles. We further identified five virus clusters that show consensus internal HTRs and defined cluster signatures using common dysregulated genes. Individual cluster signature genes were distinguished from one another, and functional analysis revealed common and specific host cellular bioprocesses and signaling pathways involved in confronting viral infections. Through literature investigation and support from epidemiological studies, these were confirmed to be important gene factors associating viral infections with cluster-common and cluster-specific non-infectious human disease(s). Our analyses were the first to feature differential HTRs to viral infections as clusters, and they present a new perspective for understanding infection-disease associations and the underlying pathogeneses.",

        "abstract": "Evidence implicating differential gene expression as a significant driver of evolutionary novelty continues to accumulate, but our understanding of the underlying sources of variation in expression, both environmental and genetic, is wanting. Heritability in particular may be underestimated when inferred from genetic mapping studies, the predominant \"genetical genomics\" approach to the study of expression variation. Such uncertainty represents a fundamental limitation to testing for adaptive evolution at the transcriptomic level. By studying the inheritance of expression levels in 10,495 genes (10,527 splice variants) in a threespine stickleback pedigree consisting of 563 individuals, half of which were subjected to a thermal treatment, we show that 74-98% of transcripts exhibit significant additive genetic variance. Dominance variance is also prevalent (41-99% of transcripts), and genetic sources of variation seem to play a more significant role in expression variance in the liver than a key environmental variable, temperature. Among-population comparisons suggest that the majority of differential expression in the liver is likely due to neutral divergence; however, we also show that signatures of directional selection may be more prevalent than those of stabilizing selection. This predominantly aligns with the neutral model of evolution for gene expression but also suggests that natural selection may still act on transcriptional variation in the wild. As genetic variation both within- and among-populations ultimately defines adaptive potential, these results indicate that broad adaptive potential may be found within the transcriptome.",

        "abstract": "Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) is a selective, non-ATP-competitive inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)-1/2. The range of antitumor activity seen preclinically and in patients highlights the importance of identifying determinants of response to this drug. In large tumor cell panels of diverse lineage, we show that MEK inhibitor response does not have an absolute correlation with mutational or phospho-protein markers of BRAF/MEK, RAS, or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. We aimed to enhance predictivity by measuring pathway output through coregulated gene networks displaying differential mRNA expression exclusive to resistant cell subsets and correlated to mutational or dynamic pathway activity. We discovered an 18-gene signature enabling measurement of MEK functional output independent of tumor genotype. Where the MEK pathway is activated but the cells remain resistant to selumetinib, we identified a 13-gene signature that implicates the existence of compensatory signaling from RAS effectors other than PI3K. The ability of these signatures to stratify samples according to functional activation of MEK and/or selumetinib sensitivity was shown in multiple independent melanoma, colon, breast, and lung tumor cell lines and in xenograft models. Furthermore, we were able to measure these signatures in fixed archival melanoma tumor samples using a single RT-qPCR-based test and found intergene correlations and associations with genetic markers of pathway activity to be preserved. These signatures offer useful tools for the study of MEK biology and clinical application of MEK inhibitors, and the novel approaches taken may benefit other targeted therapies.",

        "abstract": "The immune system has evolved complex and specialized mechanisms to mount specific defense responses against the various types of pathogens it encounters. For the development of new vaccines, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of what these mechanisms are and how they work. The field of vaccinology has adopted high-throughput profiling techniques to gain more detailed insights into the various immune responses elicited by different vaccines and natural infections. From all detailed transcriptional profiles generated today, a general picture of immunological responses emerges. First, almost every type of vaccine induces an early interferon-dominated signature. Second, different vaccine formulations induce distinct transcriptional signatures, representing the highly specialized defense mechanisms that must cope with the different pathogens and insults they cause. Transcriptional profiling has shifted its attention toward early molecular signatures, with a growing awareness that early innate responses are likely critical instructors for the development of adaptive immunity at later time points.",

        "abstract": "Wood formation occurs via cell division, primary cell wall and secondary wall formation, and programmed cell death in the vascular cambium. Transcriptional profiling of secondary xylem differentiation is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying wood formation. Differential gene expression in secondary xylem differentiation of Populus has been previously investigated using cDNA microarray analysis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms from a genome-wide perspective. In this study, the Affymetrix poplar genome chips containing 61,413 probes were used to investigate the changes in the transcriptome during secondary xylem differentiation in Chinese white poplar (Populus tomentosa). Two xylem tissues (newly formed and lignified) were sampled for genome-wide transcriptional profiling. In total, 6843 genes (~11%) were identified with differential expression in the two xylem tissues. Many genes involved in cell division, primary wall modification, and cellulose synthesis were preferentially expressed in the newly formed xylem. In contrast, many genes, including 4-coumarate:cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), and caffeoyl CoA 3-O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), associated with lignin biosynthesis were more transcribed in the lignified xylem. The two xylem tissues also showed differential expression of genes related to various hormones; thus, the secondary xylem differentiation could be regulated by hormone signaling. Furthermore, many transcription factor genes were preferentially expressed in the lignified xylem, suggesting that wood lignification involves extensive transcription regulation. The genome-wide transcriptional profiling of secondary xylem differentiation could provide additional insights into the molecular basis of wood formation in poplar species.",

        "title": "Metabolic network topology reveals transcriptional regulatory signatures of type 2 diabetes",
        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disorder characterized by both insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Recent transcriptomics studies related to T2DM have revealed changes in expression of a large number of metabolic genes in a variety of tissues. Identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying these transcriptional changes and their impact on the cellular metabolic phenotype is a challenging task due to the complexity of transcriptional regulation and the highly interconnected nature of the metabolic network. In this study we integrate skeletal muscle gene expression datasets with human metabolic network reconstructions to identify key metabolic regulatory features of T2DM. These features include reporter metabolites--metabolites with significant collective transcriptional response in the associated enzyme-coding genes, and transcription factors with significant enrichment of binding sites in the promoter regions of these genes. In addition to metabolites from TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and lipid metabolism (known to be associated with T2DM), we identified several reporter metabolites representing novel biomarker candidates. For example, the highly connected metabolites NAD+/NADH and ATP/ADP were also identified as reporter metabolites that are potentially contributing to the widespread gene expression changes observed in T2DM. An algorithm based on the analysis of the promoter regions of the genes associated with reporter metabolites revealed a transcription factor regulatory network connecting several parts of metabolism. The identified transcription factors include members of the CREB, NRF1 and PPAR family, among others, and represent regulatory targets for further experimental analysis. Overall, our results provide a holistic picture of key metabolic and regulatory nodes potentially involved in the pathogenesis of T2DM.",

        "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms that regulate the rapid transcriptional changes that occur during cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) proliferation and differentiation in response to infection are poorly understood. We have utilized ChIP-seq to assess histone H3 methylation dynamics within naive, effector, and memory virus-specific Tcells isolated directly exvivo after influenza A virus infection. Our results show that within naive Tcells, codeposition of the permissive H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 modifications is a signature of gene loci associated with gene transcription, replication, and cellular differentiation. Upon differentiation into effector and/or memory CTLs, the majority of these gene loci lose repressive H3K27me3 while retaining the permissive H3K4me3 modification. In contrast, immune-related effector gene promoters within naive Tcells lacked the permissive H3K4me3 modification, with acquisition of this modification occurring upon differentiation into effector/memory CTLs. Thus, coordinate transcriptional regulation of CTL genes with related functions is achieved via distinct epigenetic mechanisms.",

        "title": "Transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of zygotic genome activation during early Drosophila embryogenesis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In all Metazoa, transcription is inactive during the first mitotic cycles after fertilisation. In Drosophila melanogaster, Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA) occurs in two waves, starting respectively at mitotic cycles 8 (approximately 60 genes) and 14 (over a thousand genes). The regulatory mechanisms underlying these drastic transcriptional changes remain largely unknown.\\n\\nRESULTS: We developed an original gene clustering method based on discretized transition profiles, and applied it to datasets from three landmark early embryonic transcriptome studies. We identified 417 genes significantly up-regulated during ZGA. De novo\u2009motif discovery returned nine motifs over-represented in their non-coding sequences (upstream, introns, UTR), three of which correspond to previously known transcription factors: Zelda, Tramtrack and Trithorax-like (Trl). The nine discovered motifs were combined to scan ZGA-associated regions and predict about 1300 putative cis-regulatory modules. The fact that Trl is known to act as chromatin remodelling factor suggests that epigenetic regulation might play an important role in zygotic genome activation. We thus systematically compared the locations of predicted CRMs with ChIP-seq profiles for various transcription factors, 38 epigenetic marks from ModENCODE, and DNAse1 accessibility profiles. This analysis highlighted a strong and specific enrichment of predicted ZGA-associated CRMs for Zelda, CBP, Trl binding sites, as well as for histone marks associated with active enhancers (H3K4me1) and for open chromatin regions.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Based on the results of our computational analyses, we suggest a temporal model explaining the onset of zygotic genome activation by the combined action of transcription factors and epigenetic signals. Although this study is mainly based on the analysis of publicly available transcriptome and ChiP-seq datasets, the resulting model suggests novel mechanisms that underly the coordinated activation of several hundreds genes at a precise time point during embryonic development.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) caused by tsetse fly-transmitted protozoa of the genus Trypanosoma is a major constraint on livestock and agricultural production in Africa and is among the top ten global cattle diseases impacting on the poor. Here we show that a functional genomics approach can be used to identify temporal changes in host peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression due to disease progression. We also show that major gene expression differences exist between cattle from trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible breeds. Using bovine long oligonucleotide microarrays and real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) validation we analysed PBMC gene expression in na\u00efve trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible cattle experimentally challenged with Trypanosoma congolense across a 34-day infection time course. RESULTS: Trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle displayed a rapid and distinct transcriptional response to infection, with a ten-fold higher number of genes differentially expressed at day 14 post-infection compared to trypanosusceptible Boran cattle. These analyses identified coordinated temporal gene expression changes for both breeds in response to trypanosome infection. In addition, a panel of genes were identified that showed pronounced differences in gene expression between the two breeds, which may underlie the phenomena of trypanotolerance and trypanosusceptibility. Gene ontology (GO) analysis demonstrate that the products of these genes may contribute to increased mitochondrial mRNA translational efficiency, a more pronounced B cell response, an elevated activation status and a heightened response to stress in trypanotolerant cattle. CONCLUSION: This study has revealed an extensive and diverse range of cellular processes that are altered temporally in response to trypanosome infection in African cattle. Results indicate that the trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle respond more rapidly and with a greater magnitude to infection compared to the trypanosusceptible Boran cattle. Specifically, a subset of the genes analyzed by real time qRT-PCR, which display significant breed differences, could collectively contribute to the trypanotolerance trait in N'Dama.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The role of interferon-\u03b1 (IFN\u03b1) in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is strongly supported by gene expression studies. The aim of this study was to improve characterization of the blood IFN signature in adult SLE patients. METHODS: Consecutive patients were enrolled and followed up prospectively. Microarray data were generated using Illumina BeadChips. A modular transcriptional repertoire was used as a framework for the analysis. RESULTS: Our repertoire of 260 modules, which consisted of coclustered gene sets, included 3 IFN-annotated modules (M1.2, M3.4, and M5.12) that were strongly up-regulated in SLE patients. A modular IFN signature was observed in 54 of 62 patients (87%) or 131 of all 157 samples (83%). The IFN signature was more complex than expected, with each module displaying a distinct activation threshold (M1.2 < M3.4 < M5.12), thus providing a modular score by which to stratify SLE patients based on the presence of 0, 1, 2, or 3 active IFN modules. A similar gradient in modular IFN signature was observed within patients with clinically quiescent disease, for whom moderate/strong modular scores (2 or 3 active IFN modules) were associated with higher anti-double-stranded DNA titers and lower lymphocyte counts than those in patients with absent/mild modular scores (0 or 1 active IFN modules). Longitudinal analyses revealed both stable (M1.2) and variable (M3.4 and M5.12) components of modular IFN signature over time in single patients. Interestingly, mining of other data sets suggested that M3.4 and M5.12 could also be driven by IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3. CONCLUSION: Modular repertoire analysis reveals complex IFN signatures in SLE, which are not restricted to the previous IFN\u03b1 signature, but which also involve IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3.",

        "abstract": "The Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent sinking produced the largest oil spill in U. S. history. One of the most prominent portions of the response is mapping the extent to which oil has reached thousands of miles of shoreline. The most common method of detecting oil remains visual spotting from airframes, supplemented by panchromatic / multispectral aerial photography and satellite imagery. While this imagery provides a synoptic view, it is often ambiguous in its ability to discriminate water from hydrocarbon materials. By employing spectral libraries for material identification and discrimination, imaging spectroscopy supplements traditional imaging techniques by providing specific criteria for more accurate petroleum detection and discrimination from water on terrestrial backgrounds. This paper applies a new hydrocarbon-substrate spectral library to SpecTIR HST-3 airborne imaging spectroscopy data from the Hurricane Katrina disaster in 2005. Using common material identification algorithms, this preliminary analysis demonstrates the applicability and limitations of hyperspectral data to petroleum/water discrimination in certain conditions. The current work is also the first application of the petroleum-substrate library to imaging spectroscopy data and shows potential for monitoring long term impacts of Deepwater Horizon.",

METHODS: 44 vasculitis patients, 13 SLE patients and 25 age and sex-matched controls were enrolled. CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, monocytes and neutrophils were isolated from each patient and, together with unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), were hybridised to spotted oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: Using expression data obtained from purified cells a substantial number of differentially expressed genes were identified that were not detectable in the analysis of PBMC. Analysis of purified T cells identified a SLE-associated, CD4 T-cell signature consistent with type 1 interferon signalling driving the generation and survival of tissue homing T cells and thereby contributing to disease pathogenesis. Moreover, hierarchical clustering using expression data from purified monocytes provided significantly improved discrimination between the patient groups than that obtained using PBMC data, presumably because the differentially expressed genes reflect genuine differences in processes underlying disease pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: Analysis of leucocyte subsets enabled the identification of gene signatures of both pathogenic relevance and with better disease discrimination than those identified in PBMC. This approach thus provides substantial advantages in the search for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in autoimmune disease.",

        "abstract": "Delivery of the transcription factors Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc via integrating viral vectors has been widely employed to generate induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from both normal and disease-specific somatic tissues, providing an invaluable resource for medical research and drug development. Residual reprogramming transgene expression from integrated viruses nevertheless alters the biological properties of iPSCs and has been associated with a reduced developmental competence both in vivo and in vitro. We performed transcriptional profiling of mouse iPSC lines before and after excision of a polycistronic lentiviral reprogramming vector to systematically define the overall impact of persistent transgene expression on the molecular features of iPSCs. We demonstrate that residual expression of the Yamanaka factors prevents iPSCs from acquiring the transcriptional program exhibited by embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and that the expression profiles of iPSCs generated with and without c-Myc are indistinguishable. After vector excision, we find 36% of iPSC clones show normal methylation of the Gtl2 region, an imprinted locus that marks ESC-equivalent iPSC lines. Furthermore, we show that the reprogramming factor Klf4 binds to the promoter region of Gtl2. Regardless of Gtl2 methylation status, we find similar endodermal and hepatocyte differentiation potential comparing syngeneic Gtl2(ON) vs Gtl2(OFF) iPSC clones. Our findings provide new insights into the reprogramming process and emphasize the importance of generating iPSCs free of any residual transgene expression.",

Because drug resistance/susceptibilities result from the complex associations of genetic and transcriptional activities, we predicted the inter-relationships between genetic and transcriptional signatures. With this concept, captured genetic polymorphisms and transcriptional profiles were prepared in cancer samples. By splitting ninety-nine samples into a trial set (n = 30) and a test set (n = 69), the outperformance of relationship-focused model (0.84 of area under the curve in trial set, P = 2.90 x 10\u207b\u2074) was presented in the trial set and validated in the test set, respectively. The prediction results of modeling show that considering the relationships between genetic and transcriptional features is an effective approach to determine outcome predictions of drug-treatment.",

        "title": "Chromatin signatures at transcriptional start sites separate two equally populated yet distinct classes of intergenic long noncoding RNAs.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian transcriptomes contain thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Some lncRNAs originate from intragenic enhancers which, when active, behave as alternative promoters producing transcripts that are processed using the canonical signals of their host gene. We have followed up this observation by analyzing intergenic lncRNAs to determine the extent to which they might also originate from intergenic enhancers.\\n\\nRESULTS: We integrated high-resolution maps of transcriptional initiation and transcription to annotate a conservative set of intergenic lncRNAs expressed in mouse erythroblasts. We subclassified intergenic lncRNAs according to chromatin status at transcriptional initiation regions, defined by relative levels of histone H3K4 mono- and trimethylation. These transcripts are almost evenly divided between those arising from enhancer-associated (elncRNA) or promoter-associated (plncRNA) elements. These two classes of 5' capped and polyadenylated RNA transcripts are indistinguishable with regard to their length, number of exons or transcriptional orientation relative to their closest neighboring gene. Nevertheless, elncRNAs are more tissue-restricted, less highly expressed and less well conserved during evolution. Of considerable interest, we found that expression of elncRNAs, but not plncRNAs, is associated with enhanced expression of neighboring protein-coding genes during erythropoiesis.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We have determined globally the sites of initiation of intergenic lncRNAs in erythroid cells, allowing us to distinguish two similarly abundant classes of transcripts. Different correlations between the levels of elncRNAs, plncRNAs and expression of neighboring genes suggest that functional lncRNAs from the two classes may play contrasting roles in regulating the transcript abundance of local or distal loci.",

        "abstract": "According to the developmental origins of health and diseases (DOHaD), and in line with the findings of many studies, obesity during pregnancy is clearly a threat to the health and well-being of the offspring, later in adulthood. We previously showed that 20% of male and female inbred mice can cope with the obesogenic effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks after weaning, remaining lean. However the feeding of a control diet (CD) to DIO mice during the periconceptional/gestation/lactation period led to a pronounced sex-specific shift (17% to 43%) from susceptibility to resistance to HFD, in the female offspring only. Our aim in this study was to determine how, in the context of maternal obesity and T2D, a CD could increase resistance on female fetuses. Transcriptional analyses were carried out with a custom-built mouse liver microarray and by quantitative RT-PCR for muscle and adipose tissue. Both global DNA methylation and levels of pertinent histone marks were assessed by LUMA and western blotting, and the expression of 15 relevant genes encoding chromatin-modifying enzymes was analyzed in tissues presenting global epigenetic changes. Resistance was associated with an enhancement of hepatic pathways protecting against steatosis, the unexpected upregulation of neurotransmission-related genes and the modulation of a vast imprinted gene network. Adipose tissue displayed a pronounced dysregulation of gene expression, with an upregulation of genes involved in lipid storage and adipocyte hypertrophy or hyperplasia in obese mice born to lean and obese mothers, respectively. Global DNA methylation, several histone marks and key epigenetic regulators were also altered. Whether they were themselves lean (resistant) or obese (sensitive), the offspring of lean and obese mice clearly differed in terms of several metabolic features and epigenetic marks suggesting that the effects of a HFD depend on the leanness or obesity of the mother.",

        "abstract": "Plants use multiple interacting signaling systems to identify and respond to biotic stresses. Although it is often assumed that there is specificity in signaling responses to specific pests, this is rarely examined outside of the gene-for-gene relationships of plant-pathogen interactions. In this study, we first compared early events in gene expression and later events in metabolite profiles of Arabidopsis thaliana following attack by either the caterpillar Spodoptera exigua or avirulent (DC3000 avrRpm1) Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato at three time points. Transcriptional responses of the plant to caterpillar feeding were rapid, occurring within 1 h of feeding, and then decreased at 6 and 24 h. In contrast, plant response to the pathogen was undetectable at 1 h but grew larger and more significant at 6 and 24 h. There was a surprisingly large amount of overlap in jasmonate and salicylate signaling in responses to the insect and pathogen, including levels of gene expression and individual hormones. The caterpillar and pathogen treatments induced different patterns of expression of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes and levels of glucosinolates. This suggests that when specific responses develop, their regulation is complex and best understood by characterizing expression of many genes and metabolites. We then examined the effect of feeding by the caterpillar Spodoptera exigua on Arabidopsis susceptibility to virulent (DC3000) and avirulent (DC3000 avrRpm1) P. syringae pv. tomato, and found that caterpillar feeding enhanced Arabidopsis resistance to the avirulent pathogen and lowered resistance to the virulent strain. We conclude that efforts to improve plant resistance to bacterial pathogens are likely to influence resistance to insects and vice versa. Studies explicitly comparing plant responses to multiple stresses, including the role of elicitors at early time points, are critical to understanding how plants organize responses in natural settings.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: In lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR and KRAS mutations dominate the mutational spectrum and have clear therapeutic implications. We sought to determine whether transcriptional subgroups of clinical relevance exist within EGFR-mutated, KRAS-mutated, or EGFR and KRAS wild-type (EGFRwt/KRASwt) adenocarcinomas.\\n\\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiles from 1,186 adenocarcinomas, including 215 EGFR-mutated, 84 KRAS-mutated, and 219 EGFRwt/KRASwt tumors, were assembled and divided into four discovery (n = 522) and four validation cohorts (n = 664). Subgroups within the mutation groups were identified by unsupervised consensus clustering, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) analysis, and centroid classification across discovery cohorts. Genomic alterations in identified mutation subgroups were assessed by integration of genomic profiles for 158 cases with concurrent data. Multicohort expression subgroup predictors were built for each mutation group using the discovery cohorts, and validated in the four validation cohorts.\\n\\nRESULTS: Consensus clustering within the mutation groups identified reproducible transcriptional subgroups in EGFR-mutated and EGFRwt/KRASwt tumors, but not in KRAS-mutated tumors. Subgroups displayed differences in genomic alterations, clinicopathologic characteristics, and overall survival. Multicohort gene signatures derived from the mutation subgroups added independent prognostic information in their respective mutation group, for adenocarcinoma in general and stage I tumors specifically, irrespective of mutation status, when applied to the validation cohorts. Consistent with their worse clinical outcome, high-risk subgroups showed higher expression of proliferation-related genes, higher frequency of copy number alterations/amplifications, and association with a poorly differentiated tumor phenotype.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified transcriptional subgroups in EGFR-mutated and EGFRwt/KRASwt adenocarcinomas with significant differences in clinicopathologic characteristics and patient outcome, not limited to a mutation-specific setting.

It is generally characterized by the coexistence of ductal carcinomatous and transdifferentiated sarcomatous components, but the underlying molecular alterations, possibly related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), remain elusive. We performed transcriptional profiling using half-a-genome oligonucleotide microarrays to elucidate genetic profiles of MCBs and their differences to those of ductal carcinoma of breasts (DCBs) using discarded specimens of four MCBs and 34 DCBs. Unsupervised clustering disclosed distinctive expression profiles between MCBs and DCBs. Supervised analysis identified gene signatures discriminating MCBs from DCBs and between MCB subclasses. Notably, many of the discriminator genes were associated with downregulation of epithelial phenotypes and with synthesis, remodeling and adhesion of extracellular matrix, with some of them have known or inferred roles related to EMT. Importantly, several of the discriminator genes were upregulated in a mutant Snail-transfected MCF7 cell known to exhibit features of EMT, thereby indicating a crucial role for EMT in the pathogenesis of MCBs. Finally, the identification of SPARC and vimentin as poor prognostic factors reinforced the role of EMT in cancer progression. These data advance our understanding of MCB and offer clues to the molecular alterations underlying EMT.",

However, few studies have sought to evaluate the importance of these environments as abiotic drivers in the diversification of plant species. Of particular interest is the Late Tertiary radiation of Pachycladon, an endemic New Zealand genus of alpine cress. Here we report observations on genome-wide levels of differential expression measured in the habitats of two closely related species of Pachycladon with distinct altitudinal preferences. Using Arabidopsis microarrays, we have identified 310 predominantly hormone- and stress-response genes up-regulated in Pachycladon fastigiata and 324 genes up-regulated in Pachycladon enysii. Expression patterns for glucosinolate biosynthesis and hydrolysis genes (MAM1, MAM-I, MAM-D, AOP2, ESP, ESM1) as well as flavonoid biosynthesis genes (F3'H, FLS, FAH1) were found to be species specific. Predicted differences in flavonoid contents were partly confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Differences in glucosinolate profiles and glucosinolate hydrolysis products obtained by high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, respectively, also supported inferences from expression analyses. Five glucosinolate chemotypes were matched to known Arabidopsis ecotypes, and the potential adaptive significance of these chemotypes has been discussed. Our findings, in contrast to expectations for evolution of the New Zealand flora, suggest that biotic drivers, such as plant-herbivore interactions, are likely to be as important as abiotic drivers in the diversification of Pachycladon.",

In order to investigate the pathogenesis of AA at the molecular level, we examined the gene expression profiles in skin samples from lesional (n= 10) and non-lesional sites (n= 10) of AA patients using Affymetrix Hu95A-v2 arrays. 363 genes were found to be differentially expressed in AA skin compared to non-lesional skin; 97 were up-regulated and 266 were down-regulated. Functional classification of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) provides evidence for T-cell mediated immune response (CCL5, CXCL10, CD27, ICAM2, ICAM3, IL7R, and CX3CL1), and a possible humoral mechanism (IGHG3, IGHM, and CXCR5) in AA. We also find modulation in gene expression favoring cellular proliferation arrest at various levels (FGF5, FGF18, EREG, and FOXC2) with apoptotic dysregulation (LCK, TNF, TRAF2, and SFN) and decreased expression of hair follicle structural proteins. Further analysis of patients with AAT (< 1. year duration, n= 4) and AAP (> 1. year duration, n= 6) of disease revealed 262 DEGs distinctly separating the 2 groups, indicating the existence of gene profiles unique to the initial and later stages of disease. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human natural killer (NK) cells are the key contributors of innate immune response and the effector functions of these cells are enhanced by cytokines such as interleukine 2 (IL2). We utilized genome-wide transcriptional profiling to identify gene expression signatures and pathways in resting and IL2 activated NK cell isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors. RESULTS: Gene expression profiling of resting NK cells showed high expression of a number of cytotoxic factors, cytokines, chemokines and inhibitory and activating surface NK receptors. Resting NK cells expressed many genes associated with cellular quiescence and also appeared to have an active TGFbeta (TGFB1) signaling pathway. IL2 stimulation induced rapid downregulation of quiescence associated genes and upregulation of genes associated with cell cycle progression and proliferation. Numerous genes that may enhance immune function and responsiveness including activating receptors (DNAM1, KLRC1 and KLRC3), death receptor ligand (TNFSF6 (FASL) and TRAIL), chemokine receptors (CX3CR1, CCR5 and CCR7), interleukin receptors (IL2RG, IL18RAB and IL27RA) and members of secretory pathways (DEGS1, FKBP11, SSR3, SEC61G and SLC3A2) were upregulated. The expression profile suggested PI3K/AKT activation and NF-kappaB activation through multiple pathways (TLR/IL1R, TNF receptor induced and TCR-like possibly involving BCL10). Activation of NFAT signaling was supported by increased expression of many pathway members and downstream target genes. The transcription factor GATA3 was expressed in resting cells while T-BET was upregulated on activation concurrent with the change in cytokine expression profile. The importance of NK cells in innate immune response was also reflected by late increased expression of inflammatory chemotactic factors and receptors and molecules involved in adhesion and lymphocyte trafficking or migration. CONCLUSION: This analysis allowed us to identify genes implicated in cellular quiescence and the cytokines and cytotoxic factors ready for immediate immune response. It also allowed us to observe the sequential immunostimulatory effects of IL2 on NK cells improving our understanding of the biology and molecular mediators behind NK cell activation.",

To elucidate transcription factor activities that function in a stage-specific fashion, we used gene sets that share transcription factor targets and found that germinal center B cells had a robust enrichment of up-regulated and down-regulated signatures compared with the other B-cell subsets. Notably, we found Yy1 and its targets to be central regulators of the germinal center B (GCB)-specific transcriptional program with binding of Yy1 to select signature genes in GCB cells, and translation of the Yy1 signatures to human GCB cells. We then tested whether our newly generated, stage-specific transcriptional signatures could be used to link murine lymphoma models to stages of normal B-cell development. Although each of the molecularly defined murine lymphoma models conserved certain stage-specific features of normal B-cell development, there was a significant alteration of the normal differentiation signature following malignant transformation. These findings offer important tools and insights for elucidating differences between normal and malignant B cells.",

We demonstrate that species-specific RNA signatures can be used to identify a broad spectrum of infectious agents, including bacteria, viruses, yeast, and parasites. Moreover, we show that the behavior of a small set of bacterial transcripts after a brief antibiotic pulse can rapidly differentiate drug-susceptible and -resistant organisms and that these measurements can be made directly from clinical materials. Thus, transcriptional signatures could form the basis of a uniform diagnostic platform applicable across a broad range of infectious agents.",

We developed a statistical framework for constructing genome-wide signatures of TF activity, and for using such signatures in the analysis of gene expression data produced by complex transcriptional regulatory programs. Our framework integrates ChIP-seq data and appropriately matched gene expression profiles to identify True REGulatory (TREG) TF-gene interactions. It provides genome-wide quantification of the likelihood of regulatory TF-gene interaction that can be used to either identify regulated genes, or as genome-wide signature of TF activity. To effectively use ChIP-seq data, we introduce a novel statistical model that integrates information from all binding \"peaks\" within 2 Mb window around a gene's transcription start site (TSS), and provides gene-level binding scores and probabilities of regulatory interaction. In the second step we integrate these binding scores and regulatory probabilities with gene expression data to assess the likelihood of True REGulatory (TREG) TF-gene interactions. We demonstrate the advantages of TREG framework in identifying genes regulated by two TFs with widely different distribution of functional binding events (ER\u03b1 and E2f1). We also show that TREG signatures of TF activity vastly improve our ability to detect involvement of ER\u03b1 in producing complex diseases-related transcriptional profiles. Through a large study of disease-related transcriptional signatures and transcriptional signatures of drug activity, we demonstrate that increase in statistical power associated with the use of TREG signatures makes the crucial difference in identifying key targets for treatment, and drugs to use for treatment. All methods are implemented in an open-source R package treg. The package also contains all data used in the analysis including 494 TREG binding profiles based on ENCODE ChIP-seq data.

Clinical data included 8-year overall survival, tumor staging, histological grading, regional localization, and molecu-lar tumor characteristics. The acquired quantitative proteomic dataset was subjected to the development of biomarker signatures predicting prognostic clinical endpoints. Protein candidates were selected into the signatures based on significance testing and a stepwise protein selection, each within 10-fold cross-validation. A six-protein biomarker signature of patient outcome could predict survival beyond clinical stage and was able to stratify patients into groups of better and worse prognosis. We further evaluated the performance of the signature on the mRNA level and assessed its prognostic value in the context of previously published transcriptional signatures. Additional signatures predicting regional tumor localization and disease dissemination were also identified. The integration of rich clinical data, quantitative proteomic technologies, and tailored computational modeling facilitated the characterization of these signatures in patient circulation. These findings highlight the value of a simultaneous assessment of important prognostic disease characteristics within a single measurement.",

        "abstract": "We define the mesh signature primitive as an anonymous signature similar in spirit to ring signatures, but with a much richer language for expressing signer ambiguity. The language can represent complex access structures, and in particular allows individual signature components to be replaced with complete certificate chains. Because withholding one's public key from view is no longer a shield against being named as a possible cosignatory, mesh signatures may be used as a ring signature with compulsory enrollment. We give an efficient construction based on bilinear maps in the common random string model. Our signatures have linear size, achieve everlasting perfect anonymity, and reduce to very efficient ring signatures without random oracles as a special case. We prove non-repudiation from a mild extension of the SDH assumption, which we introduce and justify meticulously.",

Systems biology approaches have been used to determine signatures that can be used to predict vaccine-induced immunity in humans, but whether there is a 'universal signature' that can be used to predict antibody responses to any vaccine is unknown. Here we did systems analyses of immune responses to the polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines against meningococcus in healthy adults, in the broader context of published studies of vaccines against yellow fever virus and influenza virus. To achieve this, we did a large-scale network integration of publicly available human blood transcriptomes and systems-scale databases in specific biological contexts and deduced a set of transcription modules in blood. Those modules revealed distinct transcriptional signatures of antibody responses to different classes of vaccines, which provided key insights into primary viral, protein recall and anti-polysaccharide responses. Our results elucidate the early transcriptional programs that orchestrate vaccine immunity in humans and demonstrate the power of integrative network modeling.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In addition to their cytotoxic nature, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also signal molecules in diverse cellular processes in eukaryotic organisms. Linking genome-wide transcriptional changes to cellular physiology in oxidative stress-exposed Aspergillus nidulans cultures provides the opportunity to estimate the sizes of peroxide (O2(2-)), superoxide (O2*-) and glutathione/glutathione disulphide (GSH/GSSG) redox imbalance responses. RESULTS: Genome-wide transcriptional changes triggered by diamide, H2O2 and menadione in A. nidulans vegetative tissues were recorded using DNA microarrays containing 3533 unique PCR-amplified probes. Evaluation of LOESS-normalized data indicated that 2499 gene probes were affected by at least one stress-inducing agent. The stress induced by diamide and H2O2 were pulse-like, with recovery after 1 h exposure time while no recovery was observed with menadione. The distribution of stress-responsive gene probes among major physiological functional categories was approximately the same for each agent. The gene group sizes solely responsive to changes in intracellular O2(2-), O2*- concentrations or to GSH/GSSG redox imbalance were estimated at 7.7, 32.6 and 13.0 %, respectively. Gene groups responsive to diamide, H2O2 and menadione treatments and gene groups influenced by GSH/GSSG, O2(2-) and O2*- were only partly overlapping with distinct enrichment profiles within functional categories. Changes in the GSH/GSSG redox state influenced expression of genes coding for PBS2 like MAPK kinase homologue, PSK2 kinase homologue, AtfA transcription factor, and many elements of ubiquitin tagging, cell division cycle regulators, translation machinery proteins, defense and stress proteins, transport proteins as well as many enzymes of the primary and secondary metabolisms. Meanwhile, a separate set of genes encoding transport proteins, CpcA and JlbA amino acid starvation-responsive transcription factors, and some elements of sexual development and sporulation was ROS responsive. CONCLUSION: The existence of separate O2(2-), O2*- and GSH/GSSG responsive gene groups in a eukaryotic genome has been demonstrated. Oxidant-triggered, genome-wide transcriptional changes should be analyzed considering changes in oxidative stress-responsive physiological conditions and not correlating them directly to the chemistry and concentrations of the oxidative stress-inducing agent.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that primary Th1Th17 cells are highly permissive to HIV-1, whereas Th1 cells are relatively resistant. Molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain unknown.\\n\\nRESULTS: Exposure to replication competent and single-round VSV-G pseudotyped HIV strains provide evidence that superior HIV replication in Th1Th17 vs. Th1 cells was regulated by mechanisms located at entry and post-entry levels. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling identified transcripts upregulated (n = 264) and downregulated (n = 235) in Th1Th17 vs. Th1 cells (p-value < 0.05; fold change cut-off 1.3). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed pathways enriched in Th1Th17 (nuclear receptors, trafficking, p38/MAPK, NF-\u03baB, p53/Ras, IL-23) vs. Th1 cells (proteasome, interferon \u03b1/\u03b2). Differentially expressed genes were classified into biological categories using Gene Ontology. Th1Th17 cells expressed typical Th17 markers (IL-17A/F, IL-22, CCL20, RORC, IL-26, IL-23R, CCR6) and transcripts functionally linked to regulating cell trafficking (CEACAM1, MCAM), activation (CD28, CD40LG, TNFSF13B, TNFSF25, PTPN13, MAP3K4, LTB, CTSH), transcription (PPAR\u03b3, RUNX1, ATF5, ARNTL), apoptosis (FASLG), and HIV infection (CXCR6, FURIN). Differential expression of CXCR6, PPAR\u03b3, ARNTL, PTPN13, MAP3K4, CTSH, SERPINB6, PTK2, and ISG20 was validated by RT-PCR, flow cytometry and/or confocal microscopy. The nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b3 was preferentially expressed by Th1Th17 cells. PPAR\u03b3 RNA interference significantly increased HIV replication at levels post-entry and prior HIV-DNA integration. Finally, the activation of PPAR\u03b3 pathway via the agonist Rosiglitazone induced the nuclear translocation of PPAR\u03b3 and a robust inhibition of viral replication.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Thus, transcriptional profiling in Th1Th17 vs. Th1 cells demonstrated that HIV permissiveness is associated with a superior state of cellular activation and limited antiviral properties and identified PPAR\u03b3 as an intrinsic negative regulator of viral replication. Therefore, triggering PPAR\u03b3 pathway via non-toxic agonists may contribute to limiting covert HIV replication and disease progression during antiretroviral treatment.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundCurrent views on the control of cell development are anchored on the notion that phenotypes are defined by networks of transcriptional activity. The large amounts of information brought about by transcriptomics should allow the definition of these networks through the analysis of cell-specific transcriptional signatures. Here we test this principle by applying an analogue to comparative anatomy at the cellular level, searching for conserved transcriptional signatures, or conserved small gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) on root hairs (RH) and pollen tubes (PT), two filamentous apical growing cells that are a striking example of conservation of structure and function in plants.ResultsWe developed a new method for isolation of growing and mature root hair cells, analysed their transcriptome by microarray analysis, and further compared it with pollen and other single cell transcriptomics data. Principal component analysis shows a statistical relation between the datasets of RHs and PTs which is suggestive of a common transcriptional profile pattern for the apical growing cells in a plant, with overlapping profiles and clear similarities at the level of small GTPases, vesicle-mediated transport and various specific metabolic responses. Furthermore, cis-regulatory element analysis of co-regulated genes between RHs and PTs revealed conserved binding sequences that are likely required for the expression of genes comprising the apical signature. This included a significant occurrence of motifs associated to a defined transcriptional response upon anaerobiosis.ConclusionsOur results suggest that maintaining apical growth mechanisms synchronized with energy yielding might require a combinatorial network of transcriptional regulation. We propose that this study should constitute the foundation for further genetic and physiological dissection of the mechanisms underlying apical growth of plant cells.",

        "abstract": "The molecular anatomy of cancer cells is being explored through unbiased approaches aimed at the identification of cancer-specific transcriptional signatures. An alternative biased approach is exploitation of molecular tools capable of inducing cellular transformation. Transcriptional signatures thus identified can be readily validated in real cancers and more easily reverse-engineered into signaling pathways, given preexisting molecular knowledge. We exploited the ability of the adenovirus early region 1 A protein (E1A) oncogene to force the reentry into the cell cycle of terminally differentiated cells in order to identify and characterize genes whose expression is upregulated in this process. A subset of these genes was activated through a retinoblastoma protein/E2 viral promoter required factor-independent (pRb/E2F-independent) mechanism and was overexpressed in a fraction of human cancers. Furthermore, this overexpression correlated with tumor progression in colon cancer, and 2 of these genes predicted unfavorable prognosis in breast cancer. A proof of principle biological validation was performed on one of the genes of the signature, skeletal muscle cell reentry-induced (SKIN) gene, a previously undescribed gene. SKIN was found overexpressed in some primary tumors and tumor cell lines and was amplified in a fraction of colon adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, knockdown of SKIN caused selective growth suppression in overexpressing tumor cell lines but not in tumor lines expressing physiological levels of the transcript. Thus, SKIN is a candidate oncogene in human cancer.",

        "abstract": "Uterine leiomyomata (UL), the most common neoplasm in reproductive-age women, are classified into distinct genetic subgroups based on recurrent chromosome abnormalities. To develop a molecular signature of UL with t(12;14)(q14-q15;q23-q24), we took advantage of the multiple UL arising as independent clonal lesions within a single uterus. We compared genome-wide expression levels of t(12;14) UL to non-t(12;14) UL from each of nine women in a paired analysis, with each sample weighted for the percentage of t(12;14) cells to adjust for mosaicism with normal cells. This resulted in a transcriptional profile that confirmed HMGA2, known to be overexpressed in t(12;14) UL, as the most significantly altered gene. Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed significant association with cell proliferation, particularly G1/S checkpoint regulation. This is consistent with the known larger size of t(12;14) UL relative to karyotypically normal UL or to UL in the deletion 7q22 subgroup. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering demonstrated that patient variability is relatively dominant to the distinction of t(12;14) UL compared with non-t(12;14) UL or of t(12;14) UL compared with del(7q) UL. The paired design we employed is therefore important to produce an accurate t(12;14) UL-specific gene list by removing the confounding effects of genotype and environment. Interestingly, myometrium not only clustered away from the tumors, but generally separated based on associated t(12;14) versus del(7q) status. Nine genes were identified whose expression can distinguish the myometrium origin. This suggests an underlying constitutional genetic predisposition to these somatic changes which could potentially lead to improved personalized management and treatment.",

These glands produce the major protein fraction of a protein- and lipid-rich jelly used to sustain developing larvae. Pollen intake is positively correlated with HG growth, but growth in the first three days is similar regardless of diet, suggesting that initial growth is a pre-determined process while later HG development depends on nutrient availability during a critical window in early adulthood (>3. d). It is unclear whether the resultant size differences in nurse HG are simply due to growth arrest or active degradation of the tissue. To determine what processes cause such differences in HG size, we catalogued the differential expression of both gene transcripts and proteins in the HGs of 8. d old bees that were fed diets containing pollen or no pollen. 3438 genes and 367 proteins were differentially regulated due to nutrition. Of the genes and proteins differentially expressed, undernourished bees exhibited more gene and protein up-regulation compared to well-nourished bees, with the affected processes including salivary gland apoptosis, oogenesis, and hormone signaling. Protein secretion was virtually the only process up-regulated in well-nourished bees. Further assays demonstrated that inhibition of ultraspiracle, one component of the ecdysteroid receptor, in the fat body caused larger HGs. Undernourished bees also had higher acid phosphatase activity, a physiological marker of cell death, compared to well-nourished bees. These results support a connection between poor nutrition, hormonal signaling, and HG degradation.",

The combination of genome-wide transcriptional profiling of degenerating hippocampal tissue with microscopy analyses reveals that the sustained inhibition of CREB function in A-CREB mice is associated with dark neuron degeneration, whereas its strong chronic activation in VP16-CREB mice primarily causes excitotoxic cell death and inflammation. Furthermore, the meta-analysis with gene expression profiles available in public databases identifies relevant common markers to other neurodegenerative processes and highlights the importance of the immune response in neurodegeneration. Overall, these analyses define the ultrastructural and transcriptional signatures associated with these two forms of hippocampal neurodegeneration, confirm the importance of fine-tuned regulation of CREB-dependent gene expression for CA1 neuron survival and function, and provide novel insight into the function of CREB in the etiology of neurodegenerative processes.",

        "abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) infection in humans and non-human primates (NHPs) is highly lethal, and there is limited understanding of the mechanisms associated with pathogenesis and survival. Here, we describe a transcriptomic analysis of NHPs that survived lethal EBOV infection, compared to NHPs that did not survive. It has been previously demonstrated that anticoagulant therapeutics increase the survival rate in EBOV-infected NHPs, and that the characteristic transcriptional profile of immune response changes in anticoagulant-treated NHPs. In order to identify transcriptional signatures that correlate with survival following EBOV infection, we compared the mRNA expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from EBOV-infected NHPs that received anticoagulant treatment, to those that did not receive treatment. We identified a small set of 20 genes that are highly confident predictors and can accurately distinguish between surviving and non-surviving animals. In addition, we identified a larger predictive signature of 238 genes that correlated with disease outcome and treatment; this latter signature was associated with a variety of host responses, such as the inflammatory response, T cell death, and inhibition of viral replication. Notably, among survival-associated genes were subsets of genes that are transcriptionally regulated by (1) CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, (2) tumor protein 53, and (3) megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 and myocardin-like protein 2. These pathways merit further investigation as potential transcriptional signatures of host immune response to EBOV infection.",

Our new approach is based on the construction of a reference map of transcriptional signatures of both healthy and cancer affected individuals using circulating miRNA from a large number of subjects. Once such a map is available, the diagnosis for a new patient can be performed by observing the relative position on the map of his/her transcriptional signature. To demonstrate its efficacy for this specific application we report the results of the application of our method to published datasets of circulating miRNA, and we quantify its performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods. A number of additional features make this method an ideal candidate for large-scale use, for example, as a mass screening tool for early cancer detection or for at-home diagnostics. Specifically, our method is minimally invasive (because it works well with circulating miRNA), it is robust with respect to lab-to-lab protocol variability and batch effects (it requires that only the relative ranking of expression value of miRNA in a profile be accurate not their absolute values), and it is scalable to a large number of subjects. Finally we discuss the need for HPC capability in a widespread application of our or similar methods.",

LINCS data include genome-wide transcriptional signatures, biochemical protein binding profiles, cellular phenotypic response profiles and various other datasets for a wide range of cell model systems and molecular and genetic perturbations. Here we present a partial survey of this data facilitated by data standards and in particular a robust compound standardization workflow; we integrated several types of LINCS signatures and analyzed the results with a focus on mechanism of action (MoA) and chemical compounds. We illustrate how kinase targets can be related to disease models and relevant drugs. We identified some fundamental trends that appear to link Kinome binding profiles and transcriptional signatures to chemical information and biochemical binding profiles to transcriptional responses independent of chemical similarity. To fill gaps in the datasets we developed and applied predictive models. The results can be interpreted at the systems level as demonstrated based on a large number of signaling pathways. We can identify clear global relationships, suggesting robustness of cellular responses to chemical perturbation. Overall, the results suggest that chemical similarity is a useful measure at the systems level, which would support phenotypic drug optimization efforts.

The transcriptional response of M. tuberculosis to antimycobacterial compounds may be determined in isolation, in comparison with other compound classes, or between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant mycobacterial isolates. Additional information confirming the growth state of mycobacteria on addition of the antibacterial compound, and the effect that this compound has on mycobacterial growth, is essential for interpreting the transcriptional signatures acquired.

Analysis of the CD4(+) T-cell transcriptome, at consecutive stages of escalating dose immunotherapy, reveals progressive suppression of transcripts positively regulating inflammatory effector function and repression of cell cycle pathways. We identify transcription factors, c-Maf and NFIL3, and negative co-stimulatory molecules, LAG-3, TIGIT, PD-1 and TIM-3, which characterize this regulatory CD4(+) T-cell population and whose expression correlates with the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10.

Genes involved in pluripotency, oxygen regulation and the cell cycle were downregulated in rhesus ESC generated from in vitro cultured embryos (in vitro ESC). Significantly, several gene differences are similarly downregulated in preimplantation embryos cultured in vitro, which have been associated with long term developmental consequences and disease predisposition. This data indicates that prior to derivation, embryo quality may influence the molecular signature of ESC lines, and may differentially impact the physiology of cells prior to or following differentiation.",

A new kind of signature scheme, which is called anonymous signatures, has been proposed. And we indicate that the previously proposed group signature is actually a kind of anonymous signatures. In order to realize the anonymous signatures, we design two kinds of implementation schemes, whose performances are analyzed and compared.

This approach led to the definition of 18,250 transcriptional signatures (TS) that were tested for functional enrichment using the DAVID knowledgebase. Over-representation of functional terms was found in a large proportion of these TS (84%). We developed a JAVA application, TBrowser that comes with an open plug-in architecture and whose interface implements a highly sophisticated search engine supporting several Boolean operators (http://tagc.univ-mrs.fr/tbrowser/). User can search and analyze TS containing a list of identifiers (gene symbols or AffyIDs) or associated with a set of functional terms.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As proof of principle, TBrowser was used to define breast cancer cell specific genes and to detect chromosomal abnormalities in tumors. Finally, taking advantage of our large collection of transcriptional signatures, we constructed a comprehensive map that summarizes gene-gene co-regulations observed through all the experiments performed on HGU133A Affymetrix platform. We provide evidences that this map can extend our knowledge of cellular signaling pathways.",

Effective antituberculosis treatment monitoring is difficult as there are no existing biomarkers of poor adherence or inadequate treatment earlier than 2 months after treatment initiation. Inadequate treatment leads to worsening disease, disease transmission and drug resistance.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES: To determine if blood transcriptional signatures change in response to antituberculosis treatment and could act as early biomarkers of a successful response.\\n\\nMETHODS: Blood transcriptional profiles of untreated active tuberculosis patients in South Africa were analysed before, during (2 weeks and 2 months), at the end of (6 months) and after (12 months) antituberculosis treatment, and compared to individuals with latent tuberculosis. An active-tuberculosis transcriptional signature and a specific treatment-response transcriptional signature were derived. The specific treatment response transcriptional signature was tested in two independent cohorts. Two quantitative scoring algorithms were applied to measure the changes in the transcriptional response. The most significantly represented pathways were determined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS: An active tuberculosis 664-transcript signature and a treatment specific 320-transcript signature significantly diminished after 2 weeks of treatment in all cohorts, and continued to diminish until 6 months. The transcriptional response to treatment could be individually measured in each patient.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Significant changes in the transcriptional signatures measured by blood tests were readily detectable just 2 weeks after treatment initiation.

While the majority of effector CTLs die upon clearance of the pathogen, a small proportion of them survive to become long-lived memory CTLs. Memory CTLs can provide protective immunity against re-exposure to the same pathogen and are the principle motivation behind T-cell- based vaccine design. While a large body of cellular immunologic research has proven invaluable to define effector and memory CTLs by their different phenotypes and functions, an emerging focus in the field has been to understand how environmental cues regulate CTL differentiation on a genomic level. Genome-wide studies to profile transcriptional and epigenetic changes during infection have revealed that dynamic changes in DNA methylation patterns and histone modifications accompany transcriptional signatures that define and regulate CTL differentiation states. In this review, we emphasize the importance of epigenetic regulation of CD8(+) T-cell differentiation and the likely role that transcription factors play in this process.",

BPTF is required for the activation of the full c-MYC transcriptional programme in fibroblasts. BPTF knockdown leads to decreased c-MYC recruitment to DNA and changes in chromatin accessibility. In Bptf-null MEFs, BPTF is necessary for c-MYC-driven proliferation, G1-S progression and replication stress, but not for c-MYC-driven apoptosis. Bioinformatics analyses unveil that BPTF levels correlate positively with c-MYC-driven transcriptional signatures. In vivo, Bptf inactivation in pre-neoplastic pancreatic acinar cells significantly delays tumour development and extends survival. Our findings uncover BPTF as a crucial c-MYC co-factor required for its biological activity and suggest that the BPTF-c-MYC axis is a potential therapeutic target in cancer.",

However, little is known whether the two processes share common signaling molecules or cells defective in the two processes share common transcriptional signatures. To address these questions, we first assessed 77 kinase-deletion strains for NS-induced G0-arrest phenotypes. Our result indicated that 10 out of 77 kinase-deletion strains exhibited defect in G0-arrest, only 3 of which were defective in sexual development based on a previous study, suggesting that the two processes hardly share common signaling components. We subsequently performed transcriptional profiling analysis. Our result indicated that NS-induced transcriptional change was so robust that it prevailed the alteration by individual kinase-deletion alleles. Based on comparison between kinase-deletion strains proficient and deficient in sexual development or G0-arrest, we identified subsets of genes that were associated with sexual development-deficient or G0-arrest-deficient kinase-deletion strains. Multiple pairing analyses allowed grouping of functional related kinases. Furthermore, we showed that Pka1-mediated pathways were required for upregulation of NS-induced genes upon NS and downregulation of the same set of genes under the N-replete conditions. Taken together, our analyses indicate that sexual development and NS-induced G0-arrest are unrelated; and sexual development-deficient and G0-arrest-deficient kinase-deletion strains possess distinct transcriptional signatures. We propose that Pka1 is a key regulator of nitrogen metabolic pathways and Pka1-mediated signaling pathways play roles in regulation of NS-induced genes under both N-depleted and N-replete conditions.",

        "abstract": "We developed a method for systematically comparing gene expression patterns across organisms using genome-wide comparative analysis of DNA microarray experiments. We identified analogous gene expression programs comprising shared patterns of regulation across orthologous genes. Biological features of these patterns could be identified as highly conserved subpatterns that correspond to Gene Ontology categories. Here, we demonstrate these methods by analyzing a specific biological process, aging, and show that similar analysis can be applied to a range of biological processes. We found that two highly diverged animals, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, implement a shared adult-onset expression program of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, DNA repair, catabolism, peptidolysis and cellular transport. Most of these changes were implemented early in adulthood. Using this approach to search databases of gene expression data, we found conserved transcriptional signatures in larval development, embryogenesis, gametogenesis and mRNA degradation.",

        "abstract": "To understand the aetiology and the phenotypic severity of Down syndrome, we searched for transcriptional signatures in a substructure of the brain (cerebellum) during post-natal development in a segmental trisomy 16 model, the Ts1Cje mouse. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of trisomy on changes in gene expression across development time. The primary gene-dosage effect on triplicated genes (approximately 1.5) was observed at birth [post-natal day 0 (P0)], at P15 and P30. About 5% of the non-triplicated genes were significantly differentially expressed between trisomic and control cerebellum, while 25% of the transcriptome was modified during post-natal development of the cerebellum. Indeed, only 165, 171 and 115 genes were dysregulated in trisomic cerebellum at P0, P15 and P30, respectively. Surprisingly, there were only three genes dysregulated in development and in trisomic animals in a similar or opposite direction. These three genes (Dscr1, Son and Hmg14) were, quite unexpectedly, triplicated in the Ts1Cje model and should be candidate genes for understanding the aetiology of the phenotype observed in the cerebellum.",

In this paper, we first show that Boneh et al.'s verifiably encrypted signature is not secure against rogue-key attacks. Moreover, the fairness of fair exchange protocols of signatures with the adjudicator relies on the neutrality of the adjudicator, which has become a major practical hindrance to fair exchange protocols of signatures getting widely deployed. Then we propose a fair exchange protocol of signatures from pairings by using aggregate signatures. We not only enhance the fair exchange protocol of signatures against three types of inside attackers but also relax the need of the trust in the adjudicator so that it only needs to be trusted by the signer. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

NS is genetically heterogeneous, being caused by germline mutations affecting various genes implicated in the RAS signaling network.

To explore the transcriptional consequences of NS-causing mutations, we performed global mRNA expression profiling on peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 23 NS patients carrying heterozygous mutations in PTPN11 or SOS1. Gene expression profiling was also resolved in five subjects with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS/LAH), a condition clinically related to NS and caused by an invariant mutation in SHOC2. Robust transcriptional signatures were found to specifically discriminate each of the three mutation groups from 21 age- and sex-matched controls. Despite the only partial overlap in terms of gene composition, the three signatures showed a notable concordance in terms of biological processes and regulatory circuits affected. These data establish expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a powerful tool to appreciate differential perturbations driven by germline mutations of transducers involved in RAS signaling and to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying NS and other RASopathies.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that excessive computational demands of public key cryptography have made its use limited especially when constrained devices are of concern. To reduce the costs of generating public key signatures one viable method is to employ a third party; the server. In open networks, getting help from a verifiable-server has an advantage over proxy-based solutions since as opposed to proxy-server, verifiable-server's cheating can be proven. Verifiable-server assisted signatures were proposed in the past but they could not totally eliminate public key operations for the signer. In this paper, we propose a new alternative called SAOTS (server assisted one-time signatures) where just like proxy signatures generating a public key signature is possible without performing any public key operations at all. This feature results in both computational efficiency and implementation simplicity (e.g. a reduction in the code size) of the proposed protocol. In addition, SAOTS is a more promising approach since the signature is indistinguishable from a standard signature, no storage is necessary for the signer to prove the server's cheating and the protocol works in less number of rounds (two instead of three). On the other hand, the drawback of SAOTS is the increased bandwidth requirement between the sender and server. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Unsupervised classification revealed that hematopoietic cell lines of diverse origin, but with the same primary genetic changes, segregated together, suggesting that pathogenetically important regulatory networks remain conserved despite numerous passages. Moreover, primary leukemias cosegregated with cell lines carrying identical genetic rearrangements, further supporting that critical regulatory pathways remain intact in hematopoietic cell lines. Transcriptional signatures correlating with clinical subtypes/primary genetic changes were identified and annotated based on their biological/molecular properties and chromosomal localization. Furthermore, the expression profile of tyrosine kinase-encoding genes was investigated, identifying several differentially expressed members, segregating with primary genetic changes, which may be targeted with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The identified conserved signatures are likely to reflect regulatory networks of importance for the transforming abilities of the primary genetic changes and offer important pathogenetic insights as well as a number of targets for future rational drug design.",

        "abstract": "Global transcript analysis is increasingly used to describe cancer taxonomies beyond the microscopic reach of the eye. Diagnostic and prognostic portraits are formulated by ranking cancers according to transcriptional proximity. However, the role that distinct biological factors play in defining these portraits remains undefined. It is likely that the transcriptional repertoire of cancers depends, on one hand, on the anamnestic retention of their ontogenesis and, on the other, on the emergence of novel expression patterns related to oncogenesis. We compared the transcriptional profile of primary renal cell cancers (RCCs) with that of normal kidney tissue and several epithelial cancers of nonrenal origin to weigh the contribution that ontogeny and oncogenesis make in molding their genetic profile. Unsupervised global transcript analysis demonstrated that RCCs retain transcriptional signatures related to their ontogeny and cluster close to normal renal epithelium. When renal lineage-associated genes are removed from the analysis and cancer-specific genes are analyzed, RCCs segregate with other cancers with limited lineage specificity underlying a predominance of the oncogenic process over lineage specificity. However, a RCC-specific set of oncogenesis-related genes was identified and surprisingly shared by sarcomas. In summary, the transcriptional portrait of primary RCCs is largely dominated by ontogeny. Genes responsible for lineage specificity may represent poor molecular targets for immune or drug therapy. Most genes associated with oncogenesis are shared with other cancers and may represent better therapeutic targets. Finally, a small subset of genes is associated with lineage-specific oncogenesis, and these may provide information regarding the biological behavior of RCCs and facilitate diagnostic classification of RCCs.",

In this study, we analyze gene models at the transcriptional regulation level, which incorporate the complexity of promoter structure (PS) defined as transcriptional exits (i.e., ON states of the promoter) and the transition pattern (described by a matrix consisting of transition rates among promoter activity states). We show that multiple exits of transcription are the essential origin of generating multimodal distributions of mRNA, but promoters with the same transition pattern can lead to multimodality of different modes, depending on the regulation of transcriptional factors. In turn, for similar mRNA distributions in the models, the mean ON or OFF time distributions may exhibit different characteristics, thus providing the supplemental information on PS. In addition, we demonstrate that the transcriptional noise can be characterized by a nonlinear function of mean ON and OFF times. These results not only reveal essential characteristics of promoter-mediated transcriptional dynamics but also provide signatures useful for inferring PS based on characteristics of transcriptional outputs. ?? 2014 Biophysical Society.",

Regulatory signals for TC differentiation are not still well-known. The two-component signaling system (2CS) and reactive oxygen species are proposed as inductors of TC identity, while, 2CSs-related genes are not major contributors to differential gene expression in early developing NFCs. Transcriptomic and functional studies have assigned a major role to auxin and ethylene as regulatory signals on early developing TCs. Genes encoding proteins with similar functions expressed in both early developing NFCs and typical TCs are putatively involved in upstream or downstream responses mediated by auxin and ethylene. Yet, no function directly associated to the TCs identity of NFCs, such as the formation of CIs is described for most of them. Thus, we reviewed similarities between transcriptional changes observed during the early stages of NFCs formation and those described during differentiation of TCs to hypothesize about putative signals leading to TC-like differentiation of NFCs with particular emphasis on auxin an ethylene.",

Concurrently, we reconstructed a fully compartmentalized genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of rice cells, iOS2164, containing 2164 unique genes, 2284 reactions and 1999 metabolites. We then combined the model with transcriptome profiles to elucidate the light-specific transcriptional signatures of rice metabolism. Clearly, light signals mediated rice gene expressions, differentially regulating numerous metabolic pathways: photosynthesis and secondary metabolism was upregulated in B whereas reserve carbohydrates degradation was pronounced in D. The topological analysis of gene expression data with rice GEM further uncovered that phytohormones such as abscisate, ethylene, gibberellin and jasmonate are the key biomarkers of light-mediated regulation and the subsequent analysis of the associated genes' promoter regions identified several light-specific transcription factors. Finally, the transcriptional control of rice metabolism by red- and blue-light signals was assessed by integrating the transcriptome and metabolome data with constraint-based modeling. The biological insights gained from current integrative systems biology approach offer several potential applications such as improving the agronomic traits of food crops and the designing of light-specific synthetic gene circuits in microbial and mammalian systems.",

        "abstract": "The primary objective of most gene expression studies is the identification of one or more gene signatures; lists of genes whose transcriptional levels are uniquely associated with a specific biological phenotype. Whilst thousands of experimentally derived gene signatures are published, their potential value to the community is limited by their computational inaccessibility. Gene signatures are embedded in published article figures, tables or in supplementary materials, and are frequently presented using non-standard gene or probeset nomenclature. We present GeneSigDB (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/genesigdb) a manually curated database of gene expression signatures. GeneSigDB release 1.0 focuses on cancer and stem cells gene signatures and was constructed from more than 850 publications from which we manually transcribed 575 gene signatures. Most gene signatures (n = 560) were successfully mapped to the genome to extract standardized lists of EnsEMBL gene identifiers. GeneSigDB provides the original gene signature, the standardized gene list and a fully traceable gene mapping history for each gene from the original transcribed data table through to the standardized list of genes. The GeneSigDB web portal is easy to search, allows users to compare their own gene list to those in the database, and download gene signatures in most common gene identifier formats.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Robust transcriptional signatures in cancer can be identified by data similarity-driven meta-analysis of gene expression profiles. An unbiased data integration and interrogation strategy has not previously been available.\\n\\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We implemented and performed a large meta-analysis of breast cancer gene expression profiles from 223 datasets containing 10,581 human breast cancer samples using a novel data similarity-based approach (iterative EXALT). Cancer gene expression signatures extracted from individual datasets were clustered by data similarity and consolidated into a meta-signature with a recurrent and concordant gene expression pattern. A retrospective survival analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive power of a novel meta-signature deduced from transcriptional profiling studies of human breast cancer. Validation cohorts consisting of 6,011 breast cancer patients from 21 different breast cancer datasets and 1,110 patients with other malignancies (lung and prostate cancer) were used to test the robustness of our findings. During the iterative EXALT analysis, 633 signatures were grouped by their data similarity and formed 121 signature clusters. From the 121 signature clusters, we identified a unique meta-signature (BRmet50) based on a cluster of 11 signatures sharing a phenotype related to highly aggressive breast cancer. In patients with breast cancer, there was a significant association between BRmet50 and disease outcome, and the prognostic power of BRmet50 was independent of common clinical and pathologic covariates. Furthermore, the prognostic value of BRmet50 was not specific to breast cancer, as it also predicted survival in prostate and lung cancers.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We have established and implemented a novel data similarity-driven meta-analysis strategy. Using this approach, we identified a transcriptional meta-signature (BRmet50) in breast cancer, and the prognostic performance of BRmet50 was robust and applicable across a wide range of cancer-patient populations.",

Therefore, the identification of a transcriptional signature in an accessible tissue can meaningfully complement current efforts in clinical biomarker development. Gene expression normalization represents an essential step in transcriptional signatures identification, and since many reference genes show altered expressions in several pathologies, the definition of stable genes in the desired tissue is required to allow correct result interpretations. OBJECTIVE: The present work aimed at identifying a set of suitable reference genes for expression normalization in blood of HD patients and R6/2 mice. METHODS: By crossing literature investigation and analysis of microarrays performed on blood of HD patients and healthy subjects, a set of genes was selected and tested by RT-qPCR. Employment of statistical algorithms allowed the identification of the most stable genes in human samples that were than confirmed in R6/2. RESULTS: PPIB, PGK1, ACTB and YWHAZ represent the best possible genes combination, useful to normalize blood transcriptional analysis. To link clinical and preclinical studies, the identified genes were investigated also in blood of R6/2 and wild type mice, confirming that Ppib, Actb and Ywhaz were appropriate for expression normalization. Selected references were subsequently applied to evaluate expression of genes known to be involved in Huntington's pathological progression. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the importance for correct data normalization to avoid misinterpretation of results, while providing a suitable method to support quantitative gene expression analysis in preclinical and clinical investigations.",

Based on immunohistochemical and molecular analyses of inflamed tissues from patients with chronic destructive periodontal disease, these cells, found in the inflammatory infiltrate, may drive the progressive periodontal pathogenesis. To investigate early transcriptional signatures and subsequent proteomic responses to the periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis, donor-matched human blood monocytes, differentiated DCs, and macrophages were exposed to P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and gene expression levels were measured by oligonucleotide microarrays. In addition to striking differences in constitutive transcriptional profiles between these myeloid populations, we identify a P. gingivalis LPS-inducible convergent, transcriptional core response of more than 400 annotated genes/ESTs among these populations, reflected by a shared, but quantitatively distinct, proteomic response. Nonetheless, clear differences emerged between the monocytes, DCs, and macrophages. The finding that long-lived myeloid inflammatory cells, particularly DCs, rapidly and aggressively respond to P. gingivalis LPS by generating chemokines, proteases, and cytokines capable of driving T-helper cell lineage polarization without evidence of corresponding immunosuppressive pathways highlights their prominent role in host defense and progressive tissue pathogenesis. The shared, unique, and/or complementary transcriptional and proteomic profiles may frame the context of the host response to P. gingivalis, contributing to the destructive nature of periodontal inflammation.",

While modest successes have been reported for mammalian and even vertebrate genomes, more divergent groups continue to pose a stiff challenge, mostly because current models of genomic evolution support too many choices. RESULTS: We describe a novel type of genomic signature based on rearrangements that characterizes evolutionary changes that must be common to all minimal rearrangement scenarios; by focusing on global patterns of rearrangements, such signatures bypass individual variations and sharply restrict the search space. We present the results of extensive simulation studies demonstrating that these signatures can be used to reconstruct accurate ancestral genomes and phylogenies even for widely divergent collections. CONCLUSION: Focusing on genome triples rather than genomes pairs unleashes the full power of evolutionary analysis. Our genomic signature captures shared evolutionary events and thus can form the basis of a robust analysis and reconstruction of evolutionary history.",

If quadratic divergences are canceled by terms linear in the Higgs field, then the collider phenomenology is well covered by current electroweakino and fourth generation searches. If quadratic divergences are canceled by terms bilinear in the Higgs field, then the signatures are highly dependent on the quantum numbers of the new particles. Precision Higgs measurements can reveal the presence of new particles with either vevs or Standard Model charges. If the new particles are scalar dark matter candidates, their direct and indirect detection signatures will be highly correlated and within the reach of XENON100 and Fermi. Observation at one of these experiments would imply observation at the other one. Observable LHC decay channels can also arise if the new particles mix with lighter states. This decay channel involves only the Higgs boson and not the gauge bosons. Observation of such decays would give evidence that the new particle is tied to the naturalness problem.",

        "abstract": "The hypothalamus is an essential relay in the neural circuitry underlying energy metabolism that needs to continually adapt to changes in the energetic environment. The neuroendocrine control of food intake and energy expenditure is associated with, and likely dependent upon, hypothalamic plasticity. Severe disturbances in energy metabolism, such as those that occur in obesity, are therefore likely to be associated with disruption of hypothalamic transcriptomic plasticity. In this paper, we investigated the effects of two well-characterized antiaging interventions, caloric restriction and voluntary wheel running, in two distinct physiological paradigms, that is, diabetic (db/db) and nondiabetic wild-type (C57/Bl/6) animals to investigate the contextual sensitivity of hypothalamic transcriptomic responses. We found that, both quantitatively and qualitatively, caloric restriction and physical exercise were associated with distinct transcriptional signatures that differed significantly between diabetic and non-diabetic mice. This suggests that challenges to metabolic homeostasis regulate distinct hypothalamic gene sets in diabetic and non-diabetic animals. A greater understanding of how genetic background contributes to hypothalamic response mechanisms could pave the way for the development of more nuanced therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic disorders that occur in diverse physiological backgrounds.",

But these attempts have been only modestly successful which suggests that alternative approaches may be needed to define the biology of PD. Therefore, using recently developed genome-wide gene expression profiling, we explored whether transcriptional signatures associated with PD are present in lymphoblast cell line. The expression of 2,469 transcripts in lymphoblast cell lines from 16 subjects was arithmetically increased in every line and significantly increased overall and 354 transcripts was arithmetically decreased in every cell line and significantly decreased overall as compared to those lymphoblast lines from 17 subjects without a history of behavioral illness. Further sex specific analyses showed that in those 10 lines derived from female probands, the expression of a further 67 transcripts was arithmetically increased in every line and significantly increased overall and a further 332 transcripts was arithmetically decreased in every cell line and significantly decreased. Conversely, in cell lines from the six male probands, the expression of an additional 212 was arithmetically increased in every line and significantly increased overall and a further 332 transcripts was arithmetically decreased in every cell line. We conclude that lymphoblast cell lines derived from subjects with PD have significant, partially sex dependent changes in gene transcription. Further studies are necessary to correlate these changes in these hemopoetically derived cells with those changes postulated to occur in the CNS in association with PD.",

To identify the genes dysregulated by the aberrant transcriptional activity of RUNX1-RUNX1T1, we used microarrays to determine the effect of this mutation on gene expression in human progenitor cells and during subsequent development. Gene signatures of these developmental subsets were very dissimilar indicating that effects of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 are highly context dependent. We focused on gene changes associated with the granulocytic lineage and identified a clinically relevant subset of these by comparison with 235 leukaemia patient transcriptional signatures. We confirmed the overexpression of a number of significant genes (Sox4, IL-17BR, CD200 and gamma-catenin). Further, we show that overexpression of CD200 and gamma-catenin is also associated with the inv(16) abnormality which like RUNX1-RUNX1T1 disrupts core binding factor activity. We investigated the functional significance of CD200 and gamma-catenin overexpression in normal human progenitor cells. The effect of IL17 on growth was also assessed. Individually, none of these changes were sufficient to recapitulate the effects of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 on normal development. These data provide the most comprehensive and pertinent assessment of the effect of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 on gene expression and demonstrate the highly context-dependent effects of this fusion gene.",

The canonical stress regulators CtsR and HrcA play a central role in the adaptations to a plethora of stresses in a variety of organisms. Here, we determined the CtsR and HrcA regulons of the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 grown under reference (28\u00b0C) and elevated (40\u00b0C) temperatures, using ctsR, hrcA, and ctsR-hrcA deletion mutants.\\n\\nRESULTS: While the maximum specific growth rates of the mutants and the parental strain were similar at both temperatures (0.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 h(-1) and 0.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 h(-1), respectively), DNA microarray analyses revealed that the CtsR or HrcA deficient strains displayed altered transcription patterns of genes encoding functions involved in transport and binding of sugars and other compounds, primary metabolism, transcription regulation, capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis, as well as fatty acid metabolism. These transcriptional signatures enabled the refinement of the gene repertoire that is directly or indirectly controlled by CtsR and HrcA of L. plantarum. Deletion of both regulators, elicited transcriptional changes of a large variety of additional genes in a temperature-dependent manner, including genes encoding functions involved in cell-envelope remodeling. Moreover, phenotypic assays revealed that both transcription regulators contribute to regulation of resistance to hydrogen peroxide stress. The integration of these results allowed the reconstruction of CtsR and HrcA regulatory networks in L. plantarum, highlighting the significant intertwinement of class I and III stress regulons.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results enabled the refinement of the CtsR and HrcA regulatory networks in L. plantarum, illustrating the complex nature of adaptive stress responses in this bacterium.",

        "abstract": "Significance: Reactive oxygen species (ROS), important signaling molecules in plants, are involved in developmental control and stress adaptation. ROS production can trigger broad transcriptional changes; however it is not clear how specificity in transcriptional regulation is achieved. Recent advances: A large collection of public transcriptome data from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is available for analysis. This data can be used for the analysis of biological processes associated with ROS signaling and for the identification of suitable transcriptional indicators. Several online tools, such as Genevestigator and Expression Angler, have simplified the task to analyze, interpret, and visualize this wealth of data. Critical issues: The analysis of the exact transcriptional responses to ROS requires the production of specific ROS in distinct subcellular compartments with precise timing which is experimentally difficult. Analyses are further complicated by the effect of ROS production in one subcellular location on the ROS accumulation in other compartments. In addition, even subtle differences in the method of ROS production or treatment can lead to significantly different outcomes when various stimuli are compared. Future directions: Due to the difficulty of inducing ROS production specifically with respect to ROS type, subcellular localization and timing, we propose that the concept of a \"ROS marker gene\" should be re-evaluated. We suggest guidelines for the analysis of transcriptional data in ROS signaling. The use of \"ROS signatures\", which consist of a set of genes that together can show characteristic and indicative responses, should be preferred over the use of individual marker genes.",

These findings have fueled great interest in the application of transcriptional profiling to samples available from real-time clinical trials, and clinical pharmacogenomic objectives utilizing transcriptional profiling strategies are becoming increasingly incorporated into clinical trial study designs. Over the last few years several retrospective studies based on the profiling of archival tumor tissues suggest that transcriptional analysis of oncology samples may provide general prognosis measures, and in some cases may even predict response to specific therapies. Recently the FDA released a voluntary genomic data guidance meant to assist both regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies alike in evaluating the potential benefit of implementing expression profiling studies during the preclinical and clinical phases of drug development. Despite the great promise afforded by this technology, the ultimate benefit of applying transcriptional profiling in prospective clinical trials has yet to be realized because a number of practical impediments to this process exist. The multi-fold purpose of the current review is to highlight the increasing evidence from studies that have identified transcriptional signatures in archived tumors prognostic of patient outcome, to describe some of the drivers for the implementation of transcriptional profiling strategies in real-time drug development, to discuss the use of transcriptional profiling in the context of increasingly complex translational medicine strategies, and to highlight the practical issues and potential approaches involved in the successful application of clinical pharmacogenomic objectives during real-time clinical trials. Strategic implementation of transcriptional profiling in early oncology clinical trials can provide an opportunity to identify predictive markers of clinical response and eventually provide a substantial step forward towards the era of personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "Transcriptional regulation in human cells is a complex process involving a multitude of regulatory elements encoded by the genome. Recent studies have shown that distinct chromatin signatures mark a variety of functional genomic elements and that subtle variations of these signatures mark elements with different functions. To identify novel chromatin signatures in the human genome, we apply a de novo pattern-finding algorithm to genome-wide maps of histone modifications. We recover previously known chromatin signatures associated with promoters and enhancers. We also observe several chromatin signatures with strong enrichment of H3K36me3 marking exons. Closer examination reveals that H3K36me3 is found on well-positioned nucleosomes at exon 5\u2032 ends, and that this modification is a global mark of exon expression that also correlates with alternative splicing. Additionally, we observe strong enrichment of H2BK5me1 and H4K20me1 at highly expressed exons near the 5\u2032 end, in contrast to the opposite distribution of H3K36me3-marked exons. Finally, we also recover frequently occurring chromatin signatures displaying enrichment of repressive histone modifications. These signatures mark distinct repeat sequences and are associated with distinct modes of gene repression. Together, these results highlight the rich information embedded in the human epigenome and underscore its value in studying gene regulation.",

        "abstract": "Background: Systematic analysis of cancer gene-expression patterns using high-throughput transcriptional profiling technologies has led to the discovery and publication of hundreds of gene-expression signatures. However, few public signature values have been cross-validated over multiple studies for the prediction of cancer prognosis and chemosensitivity in the neoadjuvant setting. Methods: To analyze the prognostic and predictive values of publicly available signatures, we have implemented a systematic method for high-throughput and efficient validation of a large number of datasets and gene-expression signatures. Using this method, we performed a meta-analysis including 351 publicly available signatures, 37,000 random signatures, and 31 breast cancer datasets. Survival analyses and pathologic responses were used to assess prediction of prognosis, chemoresponsiveness, and chemo-drug sensitivity. Results: Among 31 breast cancer datasets and 351 public signatures, we identified 22 validation datasets, two robust prognostic signatures (BRmet50 and PMID18271932Sig33) in breast cancer and one signature (PMID20813035Sig137) specific for prognosis prediction in patients with ER-negative tumors. The 22 validation datasets demonstrated enhanced ability to distinguish cancer gene profiles from random gene profiles. Both prognostic signatures are composed of genes associated with TP53 mutations and were able to stratify the good and poor prognostic groups successfully in 82%and 68% of the 22 validation datasets, respectively. We then assessed the abilities of the two signatures to predict treatment responses of breast cancer patients treated with commonly used chemotherapeutic regimens. Both BRmet50 and PMID18271932Sig33 retrospectively identified those patients with an insensitive response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (mean positive predictive values 85%-88%). Among those patients predicted to be treatment sensitive, distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) was improved (negative predictive values 87%-88%). BRmet50 was further shown to prospectively predict taxane-anthracycline sensitivity in patients with HER2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. Conclusions: We have developed and applied a high-throughput screening method for public cancer signature validation. Using this method, we identified appropriate datasets for cross-validation and two robust signatures that differentiate TP53 mutation status and have prognostic and predictive value for breast cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Ribosomal signatures, idiosyncrasies in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and/or proteins, are characteristic of the individual domains of life. As such, insight into the early evolution of the domains can be gained from a comparative analysis of their respective signatures in the translational apparatus. In this work, we identify signatures in both the sequence and structure of the rRNA and analyze their contributions to the universal phylogenetic tree using both sequence- and structure-based methods. Domain-specific ribosomal proteins can be considered signatures in their own right. Although it is commonly assumed that they developed after the universal ribosomal proteins, we present evidence that at least one may have been present before the divergence of the organismal lineages. We find correlations between the rRNA signatures and signatures in the ribosomal proteins showing that the rRNA signatures coevolved with both domain-specific and universal ribosomal proteins. Finally, we show that the genomic organization of the universal ribosomal components contains these signatures as well. From these studies, we propose the ribosomal signatures are remnants of an evolutionary-phase transition that occurred as the cell lineages began to coalesce and so should be reflected in corresponding signatures throughout the fabric of the cell and its genome.",

        "abstract": "Chemical exposures in fish have been linked to loss of olfaction leading to an inability to detect predators and prey and decreased survival. However, the mechanisms underlying olfactory neurotoxicity are not well characterized, especially in environmental exposures which involve chemical mixtures. We used zebrafish to characterize olfactory transcriptional responses by two model olfactory inhibitors, the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and mixtures of CPF with the neurotoxic metal copper (Cu). Microarray analysis was performed on RNA from olfactory tissues of zebrafish exposed to CPF alone or to a mixture of CPF and Cu. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering, whereas gene set analysis was used to identify biological themes in the microarray data. Microarray results were confirmed by real-time PCR on genes serving as potential biomarkers of olfactory injury. In addition, we mined our previously published Cu-induced zebrafish olfactory transcriptional response database (Tilton et al., 2008) for the purposes of discriminating pathways of olfaction impacted by either the individual agents or the CPF-Cu mixture transcriptional signatures. CPF exposure altered the expression of gene pathways associated with cellular morphogenesis and odorant binding, but not olfactory signal transduction, a known olfactory pathway for Cu. The mixture profiles shared genes from the Cu and CPF datasets, whereas some genes were altered only by the mixtures. The transcriptional signature of the mixtures was more similar to that in zebrafish exposed to Cu alone than for CPF. In conclusion, exposure to a mixture containing a common environmental metal and pesticide causes a unique transcriptional signature that is heavily influenced by the metal, even when organophosphate predominates. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

YAP physically interacts with mutant p53 proteins in breast cancer cells and potentiates their pro-proliferative transcriptional activity. We found YAP as well as mutant p53 and the transcription factor NF-Y onto the regulatory regions of cyclin A, cyclin B, and CDK1 genes. Either mutant p53 or YAP depletion down-regulates cyclin A, cyclin B, and CDK1 gene expression and markedly slows the growth of diverse breast cancer cell lines. Pharmacologically induced cytoplasmic re-localization of YAP reduces the expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin B, and CDK1 genes both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, primary breast cancers carrying p53 mutations and displaying high YAP activity exhibit higher expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin B, and CDK1 genes when compared to wt-p53 tumors.",

Here, we investigate the ability of a novel reverse engineering approach (System Response Inference) to unveil non-obvious transcriptional signatures of the system response induced by prion infection.\\n\\nRESULTS: To this end, we analyze previously published gene expression data, from which we extrapolate a putative full-scale model of transcriptional gene-gene dependencies in the mouse central nervous system. Then, we use this nominal model to interpret the gene expression changes caused by prion replication, aiming at selecting the genes primarily influenced by this perturbation. Our method sheds light on the mode of action of prions by identifying key transcripts that are the most likely to be responsible for the overall transcriptional rearrangement from a nominal regulatory network. As a first result of our inference, we have been able to predict known targets of prions (i.e. PrP(C)) and to unveil the potential role of previously unsuspected genes.\\n\\nCONTACT: altafini@sissa.it\\n\\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lassa virus and Marburg virus are two causative agents of viral hemorrhagic fever. Their diagnosis is difficult because patients infected with either pathogen present similar nonspecific symptoms early after infection. Current diagnostic tests are based on detecting viral proteins or nucleic acids in the blood, but these cannot be found during the early stages of disease, before the virus starts replicating in the blood. Using the transcriptional response of the host during infection can lead to earlier diagnoses compared to those of traditional methods.\\n\\nRESULTS: In this study, we use RNA sequencing to obtain a high-resolution view of the in vivo transcriptional dynamics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) throughout both types of infection. We report a subset of host mRNAs, including heat-shock proteins like HSPA1B, immunoglobulins like IGJ, and cell adhesion molecules like SIGLEC1, whose differences in expression are strong enough to distinguish Lassa infection from Marburg infection in non-human primates. We have validated these infection-specific expression differences by using microarrays on a larger set of samples, and by quantifying the expression of individual genes using RT-PCR.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that host transcriptional signatures are correlated with specific viral infections, and that they can be used to identify highly pathogenic viruses during the early stages of disease, before standard detection methods become effective.",

        "abstract": "Transcriptional signatures are an indispensible source of correlative information on disease-related molecular alterations on a genome-wide level. Numerous candidate genes involved in disease and in factors of predictive, as well as of prognostic, value have been deduced from such molecular portraits, e.g. in cancer. However, mechanistic insights into the regulatory principles governing global transcriptional changes are lagging behind extensive compilations of deregulated genes. To identify regulators of transcriptome alterations, we used an integrated approach combining transcriptional profiling of colorectal cancer cell lines treated with inhibitors targeting the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, computational prediction of regulatory elements in promoters of co-regulated genes, chromatin-based and functional cellular assays. We identified commonly co-regulated, proliferation-associated target genes that respond to the MAPK pathway. We recognized E2F and NFY transcription factor binding sites as prevalent motifs in those pathway-responsive genes and confirmed the predicted regulatory role of Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) by reporter gene, gel shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We also validated the MAPK-dependent gene signature in colorectal cancers and provided evidence for the association of YBX1 with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. This suggests that MEK/ERK-dependent, YBX1-regulated target genes are involved in executing malignant properties.",

        "abstract": "Although nitrogen (N) availability is known to alter constitutive resistance against herbivores, its influence on herbivore-induced responses, including signaling pathways, transcriptional signatures, and the subsequently elicited chemical defenses is poorly understood. We used the native tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, which germinates in the postfire environment and copes with large changes in soil N during postfire succession, to compare a suite of Manduca sexta- and elicitor-induced responses in plants grown under high- and low-N (LN) supply rates. LN supply decreased relative growth rates and biomass by 35% at 40 d compared to high-N plants; furthermore, it also attenuated (by 39 and 60%) the elicitor-induced jasmonate and salicylate bursts, two N-intensive direct defenses (nicotine and trypsin proteinase inhibitors, albeit by different mechanisms), and carbon-containing nonvolatile defenses (rutin, chlorogenic acid, and diterpene glycosides), but did not affect the induced release of volatiles (cis-alpha-bergamotene and germacrene A), which function as indirect defenses. M. sexta and methyl jasmonate-induced transcriptional responses measured with a microarray enriched in herbivore-induced genes were also substantially reduced in plants grown under LN supply rates. In M. sexta-attacked LN plants, only 36 (45%) up-regulated and 46 (58%) down-regulated genes showed the same regulation as those in attacked high-N plants. However, transcriptional responses frequently directly countered the observed metabolic changes. Changes in a leaf's sensitivity to elicitation, an attacked leaf's waning ability to export oxylipin wound signals, and/or resource limitations in LN plants can account for the observed results, underscoring the conclusion that defense activation is a resource-intensive response.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A major impediment to tuberculosis control in Africa is the difficulty in diagnosing active tuberculosis (TB), particularly in the context of HIV infection. We hypothesized that a unique host blood RNA transcriptional signature would distinguish TB from other diseases (OD) in HIV-infected and -uninfected patients, and that this could be the basis of a simple diagnostic test. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult case-control cohorts were established in South Africa and Malawi of HIV-infected or -uninfected individuals consisting of 584 patients with either TB (confirmed by culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [M.TB] from sputum or tissue sample in a patient under investigation for TB), OD (i.e., TB was considered in the differential diagnosis but then excluded), or healthy individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI). Individuals were randomized into training (80%) and test (20%) cohorts. Blood transcriptional profiles were assessed and minimal sets of significantly differentially expressed transcripts distinguishing TB from LTBI and OD were identified in the training cohort. A 27 transcript signature distinguished TB from LTBI and a 44 transcript signature distinguished TB from OD. To evaluate our signatures, we used a novel computational method to calculate a disease risk score (DRS) for each patient. The classification based on this score was first evaluated in the test cohort, and then validated in an independent publically available dataset (GSE19491). In our test cohort, the DRS classified TB from LTBI (sensitivity 95%, 95% CI [87-100]; specificity 90%, 95% CI [80-97]) and TB from OD (sensitivity 93%, 95% CI [83-100]; specificity 88%, 95% CI [74-97]). In the independent validation cohort, TB patients were distinguished both from LTBI individuals (sensitivity 95%, 95% CI [85-100]; specificity 94%, 95% CI [84-100]) and OD patients (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI [100-100]; specificity 96%, 95% CI [93-100]). Limitations of our study include the use of only culture confirmed TB patients, and the potential that TB may have been misdiagnosed in a small proportion of OD patients despite the extensive clinical investigation used to assign each patient to their diagnostic group. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, blood transcriptional signatures distinguished TB from other conditions prevalent in HIV-infected and -uninfected African adults. Our DRS, based on these signatures, could be developed as a test for TB suitable for use in HIV endemic countries. Further evaluation of the performance of the signatures and DRS in prospective populations of patients with symptoms consistent with TB will be needed to define their clinical value under operational conditions.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Age is an important factor in the development of osteoarthritis. Microarray studies provide insight into cartilage aging but do not reveal the full transcriptomic phenotype of chondrocytes such as small noncoding RNAs, pseudogenes, and microRNAs. RNA-Seq is a powerful technique for the interrogation of large numbers of transcripts including nonprotein coding RNAs. The aim of the study was to characterise molecular mechanisms associated with age-related changes in gene signatures. METHODS: RNA for gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq and real-time PCR analysis was isolated from macroscopically normal cartilage of the metacarpophalangeal joints of eight horses; four young donors (4 years old) and four old donors (>15 years old). RNA sequence libraries were prepared following ribosomal RNA depletion and sequencing was undertaken using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Differentially expressed genes were defined using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction with a generalised linear model likelihood ratio test (P < 0.05, expression ratios +/- 1.4 log2 fold-change). Ingenuity pathway analysis enabled networks, functional analyses and canonical pathways from differentially expressed genes to be determined. RESULTS: In total, the expression of 396 transcribed elements including mRNAs, small noncoding RNAs, pseudogenes, and a single microRNA was significantly different in old compared with young cartilage (+/- 1.4 log2 fold-change, P < 0.05). Of these, 93 were at higher levels in the older cartilage and 303 were at lower levels in the older cartilage. There was an over-representation of genes with reduced expression relating to extracellular matrix, degradative proteases, matrix synthetic enzymes, cytokines and growth factors in cartilage derived from older donors compared with young donors. In addition, there was a reduction in Wnt signalling in ageing cartilage. CONCLUSION: There was an age-related dysregulation of matrix, anabolic and catabolic cartilage factors. This study has increased our knowledge of transcriptional networks in cartilage ageing by providing a global view of the transcriptome.",

        "abstract": "With computer networks spreading into a variety of new environments, the need to authenticate and secure communication grows. Many of these new environments have particular requirements on the applicable cryptographic primitives. For instance, several applications require that communication overhead be small and that many messages be processed at the same time. In this paper we consider the suitability of public key signatures in the latter scenario. That is, we consider signatures that are 1) short and 2) where many signatures from (possibly) different signers on (possibly) different messages can be verified quickly. We propose the first batch verifier for messages from many (certified) signers without random oracles and with a verification time where the dominant operation is independent of the number of signatures to verify. We further propose a new signature scheme with very short signatures, for which batch verification for many signers is also highly efficient. Prior work focused almost exclusively on batching signatures from the same signer. Combining our new signatures with the best known techniques for batching certificates from the same authority, we get a fast batch verifier for certificates and messages combined. Although our new signature scheme has some restrictions, it is the only solution, to our knowledge, that is a candidate for some pervasive communication applications.",

        "abstract": "Ring signature was first introduced in 2001. In a ring signature, instead of revealing the actual identity of the message signer, it specifies a set of possible signers. The verifier can be convinced that the signature was indeed generated by one of the ring members, however, she is unable to tell which member actually produced the signature. In this paper, we propose a generalized ring signature scheme and a generalized multi-signer ring signature based on the original ElGamal signature scheme. The proposed ring signature can achieve unconditional signer ambiguity and is secure against adaptive chosen-message attacks in the random oracle model. Comparing to ring signature based on RSA algorithm, the proposed generalized ring signature scheme has three advantages: (1) all ring members can share the same prime number and all operations can be performed in the same domain; (2) by combining with multi-signatures, we can develop the generalized multi-signer ring signature schemes to enforce cross-organizational involvement in message leaking. It may result in a higher level of confidence or broader coverage on the message source; and (3) the proposed ring signature is a convertible ring signature. It enables the actual message signer to prove to a verifier that only she is capable of generating the ring signature.",

Steroid hormone receptors, which mediate the classic cellular responses to these hormones, were thought to be vertebrate specific, which left the molecular mechanisms of steroid action in invertebrates unresolved. Recently an estrogen receptor (ER) ortholog was isolated from the sea hare Aplysia californica, but the functional significance of the receptor was unclear because estrogens and other steroids are not known to be important in that species. Furthermore, the Aplysia ER was found to be a constitutive transcriptional activator, but it was unclear whether the estrogen independence of the ER was an Aplysia-specific novelty or a more ancient character general to the mollusks. Here we report on the isolation and functional characterization of the first ER ortholog from an invertebrate in which estrogens are produced and play an apparent role, the cephalopod Octopus vulgaris. We show that the Octopus ER is a strong constitutive transcriptional activator from canonical estrogen response elements. The receptor does not bind estradiol and is unresponsive to estrogens and other vertebrate steroid hormones. These characteristics are similar to those observed with the Aplysia ER and support the hypothesis that the evolving ER gained constitutive activity deep in the mollusk lineage. The apparent reproductive role of estrogens in Octopus and other mollusks is unlikely to be mediated by the ER and may take place through an ancient, non-ER-mediated pathway.",

The proposed scheme allows a user to sign a multi-dimensional vector of values, along with a description of the context within which the vector should be interpreted.  The scheme includes a unique malleability property, which we refer to as the stretch\\nproperty, that allows the components of the signed vector to be increased up to a pre-defined limit without access to the signing key.  Decreasing these values, however, remains computationally infeasible.  We prove the security of our construction under the strong RSA and decisional Diffie-Hellman assumptions in the random oracle model.  Finally, we underscore the utility of bounded vector signatures by discussing their use in distributed systems security applications.",

        "title": "Climatic signatures in ecology",
        "abstract": "In a recent TREE review, Hughes 1 focused on the biological consequences of global warming. Hughes relied on comparisons between temporal trends in atmospheric greenhouse gases and trends in ecology (physiology, phenology and distributions), and concluded that the most parsimonious explanation for these recent ecological changes is anthropogenic 1 . Although the review was not intended to be exhaustive, we think that Hughes' conclusion should be tempered by consideration of two additional aspects of climate change ecology: (1) the complexity of natural and human-induced climate dynamics; and (2) interactions between biological and climatic signatures. Climate dynamics are complex and although global temperature has increased in the past century, large regional differences exist 2 . For example, although the winter temperature in northern Europe has increased during the past 30 years, Northeastern America and Greenland have experienced increasingly colder winters in the same period 3 . Much of this variation in regional winter climate conditions in the Northern hemisphere can be attributed to variations in the atmospheric mass balance over the North Atlantic (the North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO) 3 . Although human-induced emission of greenhouse gases might be responsible for the recent change in the behaviour of the NAO (Ref. 4) and other large-scale atmospheric fluctuations, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation 5 , recent Northern hemisphere warming might be more directly related to the thermal structure of atmospheric circulation than to any anthropogenic forcing pattern 6 . Given the ambiguity in resolving the effects of human-induced and natural climatic changes, respectively, causality invoked from comparing temporal trends in climate and ecology might result in biased conclusions. For example, Hughes states that long-term trends in the breeding phenology of amphibians and birds provide the most compelling evidence for the impact of human-induced climate change, simply because alternative explanations are generally less plausible. However, this conclusion overlooks convincing examples of species responses to natural climate dynamics. For example, not only did the breeding of European amphibians and birds respond to the increasing trend in the NAO, but also it displayed interannual fluctuations following those of the NAO (Ref. 7). Similarly, changes in the hatching dates of tits and flycatchers (also a reference used by Hughes 1) display a significant relationship to the NAO (Fig.1). The signature of the NAO, which is the year-to-year NAO impact, has been demonstrated in numerous marine, freshwater and terrestrial organisms in both North America and Europe 7,9\u201312 . Biological processes might also interfere with the traceable influence of climatic fluctuations on ecology. For example, although warm winters (high NAO indices) positively affected the abundance of golden plovers in the UK, direct density dependence strongly depressed their numbers 7 . Interactions between density dependence and the NAO have also been reported in many large, long-lived species including ungulates 10 and the Canadian lynx 11 . Although we agree that human-induced climatic changes influence ecology, these relationships are, owing to ongoing interactions between natural climatic dynamics and biological processes, much more complex than the scenario presented by Hughes 1 .",

More than a hundred driver mutations have been characterized that confer the advantage of cell growth. However, how driver mutations regulate the transcriptome to affect cellular functions remains largely unexplored. Differential analysis of gene expression relative to a driver mutation on patient samples could provide us with new insights in understanding driver mutation dysregulation in tumor genome and developing personalized treatment strategies.\\n\\nRESULTS: Here, we introduce the Snowball approach as a highly sensitive statistical analysis method to identify transcriptional signatures that are affected by a recurrent driver mutation. Snowball utilizes a resampling-based approach and combines a distance-based regression framework to assign a robust ranking index of genes based on their aggregated association with the presence of the mutation, and further selects the top significant genes for downstream data analyses or experiments. In our application of the Snowball approach to both synthesized and TCGA data, we demonstrated that it outperforms the standard methods and provides more accurate inferences to the functional effects and transcriptional dysregulation of driver mutations.

Consequently, signatures are being incorporated into clinical practice and will soon influence everyday decisions in oncology. However, the slight overlap in the gene identity between signatures for the same cancer type or condition raises questions about their biological and clinical implications. To clarify these issues, better understanding of the molecular properties and possible interactions underlying apparently dissimilar signatures is needed. Here, we evaluated whether the signatures of 24 independent studies are related at the genome, transcriptome or proteome levels. Significant associations were consistently observed across these molecular layers, which suggest the existence of a common cancer cell phenotype. Convergence on cell proliferation and death supports the pivotal involvement of these processes in prognosis, metastasis and treatment response. In addition, functional and molecular associations were identified with the immune response in different cancer types and conditions that complement the contribution of cell proliferation and death. Examination of additional, independent, cancer datasets corroborated our observations. This study proposes a comprehensive strategy for interpreting cancer signatures that reveals common design principles and systems-level properties.",

The most obvious similarity is the accumulation of misfolded forms of the host proteins which forms aggregates in the brains of patients. Remarkably, one of the earliest pathological changes detected in degenerating brain tissue, well before clinical symptoms are observed, is synaptic dysfunction and loss. This pathology was recently shown to be reversible in early stages of mouse prion disease suggesting that synaptic regeneration and reestablishment of neuronal function is possible. Determination of the molecular events that underlie synapse degeneration and how this eventually results in neuronal loss is therefore a research priority that may contribute to the search for new therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative disorders. Functional genomic studies using unbiased whole genome expression analyses represent one method that can provide insights into these perplexing processes. However, transcriptional profiles from brain tissues are representative of a heterogeneous mixture of cell types that effectively mask the expression of low abundance transcripts, or molecular changes that occur only in a small population of affected neurons. One method that was recently applied to address these challenges was laser capture microdissection which was used to effectively isolate the CA1 neuronal rich region of the hippocampus prior to RNA extraction. Profiling of both mRNAs and microRNAs revealed previously unidentified neuronal-specific genes and expression signatures that are relevant to understanding the athophysiological processes involved in preclinical stages of prion disease. In this review we will highlight these molecular signatures and discuss their implications with respect to prioninduced neurodegeneration. \u00a9 2014 Landes Bioscience.",

        "abstract": "Short certificateless signatures have come into limelight in recent years. On the one hand, the property of certificateless eliminates the certificate management problem in traditional PKI and the key-escrow problem in some ID-based signature schemes. On the other hand, due to the short signature length, short certificateless signatures can be applied to systems where signatures are typed in by human or systems with low-bandwidth channels and/or low-computation power, such as PDAs or cell phones. However, there has been a trade-off between short certificateless signature schemes and their security levels. All existing short certificateless signature schemes can only be proven secure against a normal type adversary rather than a stronger one, who can obtain valid certificateless signatures under public keys replaced by the adversary. In this paper, we solve this open problem by given an efficient strongly secure short certificateless signature scheme. The proposed scheme has the following features. Firstly, it is strongly unforgeable. Secondly, the security can be reduced to the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption - a classic complexity assumption. Lastly, the proposed scheme is provably secure against adversaries with access to a super signing oracle which generates valid certificateless signatures of messages and public keys chosen by the adversary (without providing the corresponding secret values). ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The genes with the highest differential stability are highly biologically relevant, with enrichment for brain-related annotations, disease associations, drug targets and literature citations. Using genes with high differential stability, we identified 32 anatomically diverse and reproducible gene expression signatures, which represent distinct cell types, intracellular components and/or associations with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Genes in neuron-associated compared to non-neuronal networks showed higher preservation between human and mouse; however, many diversely patterned genes displayed marked shifts in regulation between species.

        "abstract": "Exercise provides numerous salutary effects, but our understanding of how these occur is limited. To gain a clearer picture of exercise-induced metabolic responses, we have developed comprehensive plasma metabolite signatures by using mass spectrometry to measure >200 metabolites before and after exercise. We identified plasma indicators of glycogenolysis (glucose-6-phosphate), tricarboxylic acid cycle span 2 expansion (succinate, malate, and fumarate), and lipolysis (glycerol), as well as modulators of insulin sensitivity (niacinamide) and fatty acid oxidation (pantothenic acid). Metabolites that were highly correlated with fitness parameters were found in subjects undergoing acute exercise testing and marathon running and in 302 subjects from a longitudinal cohort study. Exercise-induced increases in glycerol were strongly related to fitness levels in normal individuals and were attenuated in subjects with myocardial ischemia. A combination of metabolites that increased in plasma in response to exercise (glycerol, niacinamide, glucose-6-phosphate, pantothenate, and succinate) up-regulated the expression of nur77, a transcriptional regulator of glucose utilization and lipid metabolism genes in skeletal muscle in vitro. Plasma metabolic profiles obtained during exercise provide signatures of exercise performance and cardiovascular disease susceptibility, in addition to highlighting molecular pathways that may modulate the salutary effects of exercise.",

        "abstract": "A major goal in translational cancer research is to identify biological signatures driving cancer progression and metastasis. A common technique applied in genomics research is to cluster patients using gene expression data from a candidate prognostic gene set, and if the resulting clusters show statistically significant outcome stratification, to associate the gene set with prognosis, suggesting its biological and clinical importance. Recent work has questioned the validity of this approach by showing in several breast cancer data sets that \u201d random\u201d gene sets tend to cluster patients into prognostically variable subgroups. This work suggests that new rigorous statistical methods are needed to identify biologically informative prognostic gene sets. To address this problem, we developed Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures (SAPS) which integrates standard prognostic tests with a new prognostic significance test based on stratifying patients into prognostic subtypes with random gene sets. SAPS ensures that a significant gene set is not only able to stratify patients into prognostically variable groups, but is also enriched for genes showing strong univariate associations with patient prognosis, and performs significantly better than random gene sets. We use SAPS to perform a large meta-analysis (the largest completed to date) of prognostic pathways in breast and ovarian cancer and their molecular subtypes. Our analyses show that only a small subset of the gene sets found statistically significant using standard measures achieve significance by SAPS. We identify new prognostic signatures in breast and ovarian cancer and their corresponding molecular subtypes, and we show that prognostic signatures in ER negative breast cancer are more similar to prognostic signatures in ovarian cancer than to prognostic signatures in ER positive breast cancer. SAPS is a powerful new method for deriving robust prognostic biological signatures from clinically annotated genomic datasets. A major goal in biomedical research is to identify sets of genes (or \u201d biological signatures\u201d) associated with patient survival, as these genes could be targeted to aid in diagnosing and treating disease. A major challenge in using prognostic associations to identify biologically informative signatures is that in some diseases, \u201d random\u201d gene sets are associated with prognosis. To address this problem, we developed a new method called \u201d Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures\u201d (or \u201d SAPS\u201d) for the identification of biologically informative gene sets associated with patient survival. To test the effectiveness of SAPS, we use SAPS to perform a subtype-specific meta-analysis of prognostic signatures in large breast and ovarian cancer meta-data sets. This analysis represents the largest of its kind ever performed. Our analyses show that only a small subset of the gene sets found statistically significant using standard measures achieve significance by SAPS. We identify new prognostic signatures in breast and ovarian cancer and their corresponding molecular subtypes, and we demonstrate a striking similarity between prognostic pathways in ER negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, suggesting new shared therapeutic targets for these aggressive malignancies. SAPS is a powerful new method for deriving robust prognostic biological pathways from clinically annotated genomic datasets.",

        "abstract": "Group signatures are a useful cryptographic construct for privacy-preserving non-repudiable authentication, and there have been many group signature schemes. In this paper, we introduce a variant of group signatures that offers two new security properties called leak-freedom and immediate-revocation. Intuitively, the former ensures that an insider (i.e., an authorized but malicious signer) be unable to convince an outsider (e.g., a signature receiver) that she indeed signed a certain message; whereas the latter ensures that the authorization for a user to issue group signatures can be immediately revoked whenever the need arises (temporarily or permanently). These properties are not offered in existing group signature schemes, nor captured by their security definitions. However, these properties might be crucial to a large class of enterprise-centric applications because they are desirable from the perspective of the enterprises who adopt group signatures or are the group signatures liability-holders (i.e., will be held accountable for the consequences of group signatures). In addition to introducing these new security properties, we present a scheme that possesses both traditional and these newly introduced properties. Our scheme is constructed using an architectural approach where a mediation server is exploited to trade on-line communications for the extra security properties, which explains why the resulting scheme is called \u201cleak-free mediated group signatures\u201d.

They can also habituate themselves to a given social odour and can discriminate olfactory signatures of different male conspecifics.

        "abstract": "Hypoxia is a feature of most solid tumours and is associated with a poor prognosis. The hypoxic environment can reduce the efficacy of radiotherapy and some chemotherapeutics, and has been investigated extensively as a therapeutic target. The clinical use of hypoxia-targeting treatment will benefit from the development of a biomarker to assess tumour hypoxia. There are several possible techniques that measure either the level of oxygen or the tumour molecular response to hypoxia. The latter includes gene expression profiling, which measures the transcriptional response of a tumour to its hypoxic microenvironment. A systematic review identified 32 published hypoxia gene expression signatures. The methods used for their derivation varied, but are broadly classified as: (i) identifying genes with significantly higher or lower expression in cancer cells cultured under hypoxic versus normoxic conditions; (ii) using either previously characterised hypoxia-regulated genes/biomarkers to define hypoxic tumours and then identifying other genes that are over- or under-expressed in the hypoxic tumours. Both generated gene signatures useful in furthering our understanding of hypoxia biology. However, signatures derived using the second method seem to be superior in terms of providing prognostic information. Here we summarise all 32 published hypoxia signatures, discuss their commonalities and differences, and highlight their strengths and limitations. This review also highlights the importance of reproducibility and gene annotation, which must be accounted for to transfer signatures robustly for clinical application as biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "Repurposing FDA-approved drugs with the aid of gene signatures of disease can accelerate the development of new therapeutics. A major challenge to developing reliable drug predictions is heterogeneity. Different gene signatures of the same disease or drug treatment often show poor overlap across studies, as a consequence of both biological and technical variability, and this can affect the quality and reproducibility of computational drug predictions. Existing algorithms for signature-based drug repurposing use only individual signatures as input. But for many diseases, there are dozens of signatures in the public domain. Methods that exploit all available transcriptional knowledge on a disease should produce improved drug predictions. Here, we adapt an established meta-analysis framework to address the problem of drug repurposing using an ensemble of disease signatures. Our computational pipeline takes as input a collection of disease signatures, and outputs a list of drugs predicted to consistently reverse pathological gene changes. We apply our method to conduct the largest and most systematic repurposing study on lung cancer transcriptomes, using 21 signatures. We show that scaling up transcriptional knowledge significantly increases the reproducibility of top drug hits, from 44% to 78%. We extensively characterize drug hits in silico, demonstrating that they slow growth significantly in nine lung cancer cell lines from the NCI-60 collection, and identify CALM1 and PLA2G4A as promising drug targets for lung cancer. Our meta-analysis pipeline is general, and applicable to any disease context; it can be applied to improve the results of signature-based drug repurposing by leveraging the large number of disease signatures in the public domain.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Efforts to control it are hampered by difficulties with diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Most people infected with M. tuberculosis remain asymptomatic, termed latent TB, with a 10% lifetime risk of developing active TB disease. Current tests, however, cannot identify which individuals will develop disease. The immune response to M. tuberculosis is complex and incompletely characterized, hindering development of new diagnostics, therapies and vaccines. Here we identify a whole-blood 393 transcript signature for active TB in intermediate and high-burden settings, correlating with radiological extent of disease and reverting to that of healthy controls after treatment. A subset of patients with latent TB had signatures similar to those in patients with active TB. We also identify a specific 86-transcript signature that discriminates active TB from other inflammatory and infectious diseases. Modular and pathway analysis revealed that the TB signature was dominated by a neutrophil-driven interferon (IFN)-inducible gene profile, consisting of both IFN-gamma and type I IFN-alphabeta signalling. Comparison with transcriptional signatures in purified cells and flow cytometric analysis suggest that this TB signature reflects changes in cellular composition and altered gene expression. Although an IFN-inducible signature was also observed in whole blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), their complete modular signature differed from TB, with increased abundance of plasma cell transcripts. Our studies demonstrate a hitherto underappreciated role of type I IFN-alphabeta signalling in the pathogenesis of TB, which has implications for vaccine and therapeutic development. Our study also provides a broad range of transcriptional biomarkers with potential as diagnostic and prognostic tools to combat the TB epidemic.",

        "abstract": "The (c-)Myc oncoprotein and its cousins, the N-Myc and L-Myc proteins, show all hallmarks of transcriptional activator proteins: Myc carries a carboxy-terminal DNA binding domain, which mediates sequence-specific binding to DNA. At its amino-terminus, Myc carries a transcriptional regulatory domain that strongly activates transcription when fused to an ectopic DNA binding domain; moreover, the strength of activation of different members of the Myc family correlates with their ability to transform rodent cells. Furthermore, activation of conditional alleles of Myc, either tetracycline or estrogen inducible, upregulates expression of a large number of genes, both in tissue culture and in transgenic animals. Indeed, many of these genes have essential roles in cell proliferation, cell growth, and metabolism; two of them, odc, encoding ornithine decarboxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis, and rpl24, encoding a constituent of the large ribosomal subunit, are haploinsufficient for Myc-induced lymphomagenesis but not for normal development, arguing very strongly that upregulation of both genes is critical for Myc-dependent tumor formation. Undoubtedly, therefore, Myc exerts part of its biological activities via transcriptional upregulation of a large number of target genes. One of the key issues in the field is whether there are additional biochemical activities of the Myc protein and, if so, whether and how they contribute to Myc biology. This review summarizes evidence demonstrating that Myc has the ability to repress transcription and that this may be an important function during oncogenic transformation.",

This study reports the results of an expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing project from different tissues of Euphausia superba (the Antarctic krill). RESULTS: We have constructed and sequenced five cDNA libraries from different Antarctic krill tissues: head, abdomen, thoracopods and photophores. We have identified 1.770 high-quality ESTs which were assembled into 216 overlapping clusters and 801 singletons resulting in a total of 1.017 non-redundant sequences. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to quantify and validate the expression levels of ten genes presenting different EST countings in krill tissues. In addition, bioinformatic screening of the non-redundant E. superba sequences identified 69 microsatellite containing ESTs. Clusters, consensuses and related similarity and gene ontology searches were organized in a dedicated E. superba database http://krill.cribi.unipd.it. CONCLUSION: We defined the first tissue transcriptional signatures of E. superba based on functional categorization among the examined tissues. The analyses of annotated transcripts showed a higher similarity with genes from insects with respect to Malacostraca possibly as an effect of the limited number of Malacostraca sequences in the public databases. Our catalogue provides for the first time a genomic tool to investigate the biology of the Antarctic krill.",

Further assumptions about the neutralino and chargino masses leave 15 unrelated parameters. We check all 15!\u22481012 relevant mass orderings for the dominant decay chains and the corresponding collider signatures at the LHC. As preferred signatures, we consider charged leptons, missing transverse momentum, jets, and W, Z or Higgs bosons. We present the results for three different choices of the singlet to Higgs coupling \u03bb: (a)\u00a0small, O(\u03bb)<O(Y\u03c4), (b)\u00a0large, O(\u03bb)\u2243O(Ytop,Yb,Y\u03c4), and (c)\u00a0dominant, O(\u03bb)>O(Ytop). We compare these three scenarios with the MSSM expectations as well as among each other. We also mention a possible mass hierarchy leading to seven jets plus one lepton signatures at the LHC and comment briefly on the consequence of possible R-parity violation. ",

In this paper, we propose a generalization of currency metabolites to currency vertices. We investigate the network structural characteristics of such systems, both in model networks and in some empirical systems.

        "abstract": "A signature scheme is fully leakage resilient (Katz and Vaikuntanathan, ASIACRYPT \u201909) if it is existentially unforgeable under an adaptive chosen-message attack even in a setting where an adversary may obtain bounded (yet arbitrary) leakage information on all intermediate values that are used throughout the lifetime of the system . This is a strong and meaningful notion of security that captures a wide range of side-channel attacks. One of the main challenges in constructing fully leakage-resilient signature schemes is dealing with leakage that may depend on the random bits used by the signing algorithm, and constructions of such schemes are known only in the random-oracle model. Moreover, even in the random-oracle model, known schemes are only resilient to leakage of less than half the length of their signing key. In this paper we construct fully leakage-resilient signature schemes without random oracles. We present a scheme that is resilient to any leakage of length (1\u2013 o (1)) L bits, where L is the length of the signing key. Our approach relies on generic cryptographic primitives, and at the same time admits rather efficient instantiations based on specific number-theoretic assumptions. In addition, we show that our approach extends to the continual-leakage model, recently introduced by Dodis, Haralambiev, Lopez-Alt and Wichs (FOCS \u201910), and by Brakerski, Tauman Kalai, Katz and Vaikuntanathan (FOCS \u201910). In this model the signing key is allowed to be refreshed, while its corresponding verification key remains fixed, and the amount of leakage is assumed to be bounded only in between any two successive key refreshes.",

        "abstract": "There has been considerable recent interest in the potential application of nitrogen isotope analysis in discriminating between organically and conventionally grown crops. A prerequisite of this approach is that there is a difference in the nitrogen isotope compositions of the fertilizers used in organic and conventional agriculture. We report new measurements of \u03b415N values for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and present a compilation of the new data with existing literature nitrogen isotope data. Nitrogen isotope values for fertilizers that may be permitted in organic cultivation systems are also reported (manures, composts, bloodmeal, bonemeal, hoof and horn, fishmeal and seaweed based fertilizers). The \u03b415N values of the synthetic fertilizers in the compiled dataset fall within a narrow range close to 0\u2030 with 80% of samples lying between-2 and 2\u2030 and 98.5% of the data having \u03b415N values of less than 4\u2030 (mean=0.2\u2030 n=153). The fertilizers that may be permitted in organic systems have a higher mean \u03b415N value of 8.5\u2030 and exhibit a broader range in \u03b415N values from 0.6 to 36.7\u2030 (n=83). The possible application of the nitrogen isotope approach in discriminating between organically and conventionally grown crops is discussed in light of the fertilizer data presented here and with regard to other factors that are also important in determining crop nitrogen isotope values.

        "abstract": "Although recursion has been hypothesized to be a necessary capacity for the evolution of language, the multiplicity of definitions being used has undermined the broader interpretation of empirical results. I propose that only a definition focused on representational abilities allows the prediction of specific behavioural traits that enable us to distinguish recursion from non-recursive iteration and from hierarchical embedding: only subjects able to represent recursion, i.e. to represent different hierarchical dependencies (related by parenthood) with the same set of rules, are able to generalize and produce new levels of embedding beyond those specified a priori (in the algorithm or in the input). The ability to use such representations may be advantageous in several domains: action sequencing, problem-solving, spatial navigation, social navigation and for the emergence of conventionalized communication systems. The ability to represent contiguous hierarchical levels with the same rules may lead subjects to expect unknown levels and constituents to behave similarly, and this prior knowledge may bias learning positively. Finally, a new paradigm to test for recursion is presented. Preliminary results suggest that the ability to represent recursion in the spatial domain recruits both visual and verbal resources. Implications regarding language evolution are discussed.",

Previous genetic studies from our laboratory using inbred mice that are high [C57BL/6J (B6)] or low [C3H/HeJ (C3H)] responders to E2 led to the identification of quantitative trait (QT) loci associated with phenotypic variation in uterine growth and leukocyte infiltration. The mechanisms underlying differential responsiveness to E2, and the genes involved, are unknown. Therefore, we used a microarray approach to show association of distinct E2-regulated transcriptional signatures with genetically controlled high and low responses to E2 and their segregation in (C57BL/6J\u00d7C3H/HeJ) F1 hybrids. Among the 6664 E2-regulated transcripts, analysis of cellular functions of those that were strain specific indicated C3H-selective enrichment of apoptosis, consistent with a 7-fold increase in the apoptosis indicator CASP3, and a 2.4-fold decrease in the apoptosis inhibitor Naip1 (Birc1a) in C3H vs. B6 following treatment with E2. In addition, several differentially expressed transcripts reside within our previously identified QT loci, including the ER\u03b1-tethering factor Runx1, demonstrated to enhance E2-mediated transcript regulation. The level of RUNX1 in uterine epithelial cells was shown to be 3.5-fold greater in B6 compared to C3H. Our novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the genetic control of tissue sensitivity to estrogen have great potential to advance understanding of individualized effects in physiological and disease states.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: H37Rv and H37Ra are well-described laboratory strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis derived from the same parental strain, H37, that show dramatically different pathogenic phenotypes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, the transcriptomes of the two strains during axenic growth in broth and during intracellular growth within murine bone-marrow macrophages were compared by whole genome expression profiling. We identified and compared adaptations of either strain upon encountering an intracellular environment, and also contrasted the transcriptomes of the two strains while inside macrophages. In the former comparison, both strains induced genes that would facilitate intracellular survival including those involved in mycobactin synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. However, this response was stronger and more extensive for H37Rv than for H37Ra. This was manifested as the differential expression of a greater number of genes and an increased magnitude of expression for these genes in H37Rv. In comparing intracellular transcriptional signatures, fifty genes were found to be differentially expressed between the strains. Of these fifty, twelve were under control of the PhoPR regulon. Further differences between strains included genes whose products were members of the ESAT-6 family of proteins, or were associated with their secretion. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Along with the recent identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms in H37Ra when compared to H37Rv, our demonstration of differential expression of PhoP-regulated and ESX-1 region-related genes during macrophage infection further highlights the significance of these genes in the attenuation of H37Ra.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains a major health threat and its control depends on improved measures of prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Biosignatures can play a significant role in the development of novel intervention measures against TB and blood transcriptional profiling is increasingly exploited for their rational design. Such profiles also reveal fundamental biological mechanisms associated with the pathology of the disease. We have compared whole blood gene expression in TB patients, as well as in healthy infected and uninfected individuals in a cohort in The Gambia, West Africa and validated previously identified signatures showing high similarities of expression profiles among different cohorts. In this study, we applied a unique combination of classical gene expression analysis with pathway and functional association analysis integrated with intra-individual expression correlations. These analyses were employed for identification of new disease-associated gene signatures, identifying a network of Fc gamma receptor 1 signaling with correlating transcriptional activity as hallmark of gene expression in TB. Remarkable similarities to characteristic signatures in the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were observed. Functional gene clusters of immunoregulatory interactions involving the JAK-STAT pathway; sensing of microbial patterns by Toll-like receptors and IFN-signaling provide detailed insights into the dysregulation of critical immune processes in TB, involving active expression of both pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory systems. We conclude that transcriptomics (i) provides a robust system for identification and validation of biosignatures for TB and (ii) application of integrated analysis tools yields novel insights into functional networks underlying TB pathogenesis.

In particular we apply three statistical machine learning algorithms to automatically identify sig- natures for a range of applications. The results indicate that this approach is highly accurate and scales to allow online application identification on high speed links.

The molecular mechanism underlying this difference was previously unexplored. This study employs a comparative genomics approach to identify analogous and contrasting gene expression patterns between rice and barley. RESULTS: A hierarchical clustering approach identified several interesting expression trajectories among rice and barley genotypes. There were no major conserved expression patterns between the two species in response to salt stress. A wheat salt-stress dataset was queried for comparison with rice and barley. Roughly one-third of the salt-stress responses of barley were conserved with wheat while overlap between wheat and rice was minimal. These results demonstrate that, at transcriptome level, rice is strikingly different compared to the more closely related barley and wheat. This apparent lack of analogous transcriptional programs in response to salt stress is further highlighted through close examination of genes associated with root growth and development. CONCLUSION: The analysis provides support for the hypothesis that conservation of transcriptional signatures in response to environmental cues depends on the genetic similarity among the genotypes within a species, and on the phylogenetic distance between the species.",

Bioinformatic analysis showed that several transcription factors and their related stress signaling pathways might partly account for the transcriptional signature induced by BPDE. Additionally, gene ontology analysis of the microarray data showed down-regulation of transport, cytoskeleton and DNA repair by 0.5????M BPDE exposure. In conclusion, this genomic analysis helps to understand the mechanism of cellular response to BPDE. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Here, for the first time, we have been able to investigate gene expression changes in both Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major human pathogen, and its human host cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In addition to common responses, we could identify eukaryotic and microbial transcriptional signatures that are specific to the cell type involved in the infection process. In particular M. tuberculosis shows a marked stress response when inside dendritic cells, which is in accordance with the low permissivity of these specialized phagocytes to the tubercle bacillus and to other pathogens. In contrast, the mycobacterial transcriptome inside macrophages reflects that of replicating bacteria. On the host cell side, differential responses to infection in macrophages and dendritic cells were identified in genes involved in oxidative stress, intracellular vesicle trafficking and phagosome acidification.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides the proof of principle that probing the host and the microbe transcriptomes simultaneously is a valuable means to accessing unique information on host pathogen interactions. Our results also underline the extraordinary plasticity of host cell and pathogen responses to infection, and provide a solid framework to further understand the complex mechanisms involved in immunity to M. tuberculosis and in mycobacterial adaptation to different intracellular environments.",

The Microarray Quality Control Consortium II (MAQCII) project generated 262 signatures for ten clinical and three toxicological end points from six gene expression data sets, an unprecedented collection of diverse signatures that has permitted a wide-ranging analysis on the nature of such predictive models. A comprehensive analysis of the genes of these signatures and their nonredundant unions using ontology enrichment, biological network building and interactome connectivity analyses demonstrated the link between gene signatures and the biological basis of their predictive power. Different signatures for a given end point were more similar at the level of biological properties and transcriptional control than at the gene level. Signatures tended to be enriched in function and pathway in an end point and model-specific manner, and showed a topological bias for incoming interactions. Importantly, the level of biological similarity between different signatures for a given end point correlated positively with the accuracy of the signature predictions. These findings will aid the understanding, and application of predictive genomic signatures, and support their broader application in predictive medicine.",

We formally define the method used by Boneh et al., named reversed dynamic accumulator in this paper, and apply it on some previous group signatures to obtain improved ones with revocation capability, reduced bandwidth (signature size) and less signature generation computations.

The verifier must obtain no other information about the identity of the signer or the attributes he holds. This primitive has many applications in real scenarios requiring both authentication and anonymity/privacy properties. We propose in this paper an attribute-based signature scheme which uses RSA-like operations and keys. It is the first such scheme which does not need bilinear pairings. The scheme is proved to enjoy the required properties of privacy and unforgeability in the random oracle model, under well-established computational assumptions. Although we describe and analyze the scheme for threshold signing policies, for the sake of simplicity, it can be easily modified to support more general signing policies. Finally, the scheme admits modifications so that a special entity can identify authors of dishonest signatures, and so that users that are rejected from the system cannot compute more valid signatures. These two last properties are very desirable for real-life applications of attribute-based signatures. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Blood transcriptional signatures are promising for TB diagnosis but have not been evaluated among US patients. To be used clinically, transcriptional classifiers need reproducible accuracy in diverse populations that vary in genetic composition, disease spectrum and severity, and comorbidities. In a prospective case-control study, we identified novel transcriptional classifiers for active TB among US patients and systematically compared their accuracy to classifiers from published studies. Blood from HIV-uninfected US adults with active TB, pneumonia or latent TB infection underwent whole-transcriptome microarray. We used support vector machines to classify disease state based on transcriptional patterns. We externally validated our classifiers using data from sub-Saharan African cohorts and evaluated previously-published transcriptional classifiers in our population. Our classifier distinguishing active TB from pneumonia had area under the curve (AUC) of 96.5% (95.4-97.6) among US patients but AUC was lower[90.6% (89.6-91.7%)] in HIV-uninfected Sub-Saharan Africans. Comparable previously-published classifiers had AUC of 90.0% (87.7-92.3%) and 82.9% (80.8-85.1%) when tested in US patients. Our classifier distinguishing active TB from latent TB had AUC of 95.9% (95.2-96.6%) among US patients and 95.3% (94.7-96.0%) among Sub-Saharan Africans. Comparable previously-published classifiers had AUC of 98.0% (97.4-98.7%) and 94.8% (92.9-96.8%) when tested in US patients. Blood transcriptional classifiers accurately detected active TB among US adults. Accuracy of classifiers for active TB versus other diseases decreased when tested in new populations with different disease controls, suggesting additional studies are required to enhance generalizability. Classifiers that distinguish active TB from latent TB are both accurate and generalizable across populations and could be explored as screening assays.",

Pathophysiological and protective processes are initiated by pattern recognition of microbial structures. To provide the molecular framework for a better understanding of processes relevant to host defence in pneumonia, we performed pulmonary transcriptome analysis in mice infected with the major bacterial and viral agents of community-acquired pneumonia, Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza A virus. We detected differential expression of 1300 genes after infection with either pathogen. Of these, approximately 36% or 30% were specific for pneumococcal or influenza infection, respectively, yielding pathogen-specific as well as shared inflammatory transcriptional signatures. These results not only reveal a differential response on the cytokine and chemokine levels but also emphasize the important role of genes implicated in regulation and fine tuning of inflammation. As one, albeit unexpected, key feature of pneumococcal pneumonia we discovered down-regulation of B-cell responses, probably reflecting a pneumococcal virulence strategy. The pathophysiological consequences of influenza A virus infection were reflected by the emerging protective T-cell response and differential induction of genes involved in tissue regeneration and proliferation. These data provide new insights into pathogenesis of the most common forms of pneumonia, highlighting the value of transcriptional profiling for the elucidation of underlying mechanisms.",

However, there are substantial gaps in our knowledge about relations between the heart and personality in healthy individuals. Here, we investigated whether amplitude patterns of the electrocardiogram (ECG) correlate with neurotisicm, extraversion, agreeableness, warmth, positive emotion, and tender-mindedness as measured with the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness (NEO) personality inventory. Specifically, we investigated (a) whether a cardiac amplitude measure that was previously reported to be related to flattened affectivity (referred to as E\u03ba values) would explain variance of NEO scores, and (b) whether correlations can be found between NEO scores and amplitudes of the ECG.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: NEO scores and rest ECGs were obtained from 425 healthy individuals. Neuroticism and positive emotion significantly differed between individuals with high and low E\u03ba values. In addition, stepwise cross-validated regressions indicated correlations between ECG amplitudes and (a) agreeableness, as well as (b) positive emotion.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results are the first to demonstrate that ECG amplitude patterns provide information about the personality of an individual as measured with NEO personality scales and facets. These findings open new perspectives for a more efficient personality assessment using cardiac measures, as well as for more efficient risk-stratification and pre-clinical diagnosis of individuals at risk for cardiac, affective and psychosomatic disorders.",

TaqMan-MGB allelic discrimination assays targeting these SNPs were designed and experimentally screened against synthetic RNA templates and genomic RNAs. A total of 45 assays were validated to provide 100% coverage of the clades (outbreaks) and 91% at the strain level (21 out of the 23 targeted Marburgvirus strains) with built-in redundancy for increased robustness.

        "abstract": "Although structure and sequence signatures in ribosomal RNA and proteins are defining characteristics of the three domains of life and instrumental in constructing the modern phylogeny, little is known about their functional roles in the ribosome. In this work, the largest coevolving RNA/protein signatures in the bacterial 30S ribosome are investigated both experimentally and computationally through all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations. The complex includes the N-terminal fragment of the ribosomal protein S4, which is a primary binding protein that initiates 30S small subunit assembly from the 5??? domain, and helix 16 (h16), which is part of the five-way junction in 16S rRNA. Our results show that the S4 N-terminus signature is intrinsically disordered in solution, whereas h16 is relatively stable by itself. The dynamic disordered property of the protein is exploited to couple the folding and binding process to the five-way junction, and the results provide insight into the mechanism for the early and fast binding of S4 in the assembly of the ribosomal small subunit. ?? 2010 by the Biophysical Society.",

We propose two new generic constructions of MDVS from variants of existing cryptographic schemes, which are ring signature from anonymous subset and multi-chameleon hash. We first devise a single add-on protocol which enables many existing identity-based (ID-based) ring signature schemes to support anonymous subset, which gives us three ID-based MDVS schemes. We then construct a multi-chameleon hash from an existing scheme with key exposure freeness.

Signaling cascades account for some but not all such threshold responses, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms. Here we show that all-or-none responses can be generated at a transcriptional level. A graded rheostat mechanism obtained when either transactivators or transrepressors are present is converted to an on/off switch when these factors compete for the same DNA regulatory element. Hill coefficients of dose-response curves confirm that the synergistic responses generated by each factor alone are additive, obviating the need for feedback loops. We postulate that regulatory networks of competing transcription factors prevalent in cells and organisms are crucial for establishing true molecular on/off switches.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, the product of which leads to selective and progressive neuronal cell death in the striatum and cortex. Transcriptional dysregulation has emerged as a core pathologic feature in the CNS of human and animal models of HD. It is still unclear whether perturbations in gene expression are a consequence of the disease or importantly, contribute to the pathogenesis of HD.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: To examine if transcriptional dysregulation can be ameliorated with antisense oligonucleotides that reduce levels of mutant Htt and provide therapeutic benefit in the YAC128 mouse model of HD.\\n\\nMETHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was used to evaluate dysregulation of a subset of striatal genes in the YAC128 mouse model. Transcripts were then evaluated following ICV delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO). Rota rod and Porsolt swim tests were used to evaluate phenotypic deficits in these mice following ASO treatment.\\n\\nRESULTS: Transcriptional dysregulation was detected in the YAC128 mouse model and appears to progress with age. ICV delivery of ASOs directed against mutant Htt resulted in reduction in mutant Htt levels and amelioration in behavioral deficits in the YAC128 mouse model. These improvements were correlated with improvements in the levels of several dysregulated striatal transcripts.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The role of transcriptional dysregulation in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease is not well understood, however, a wealth of evidence now strongly suggests that changes in transcriptional signatures are a prominent feature in the brains of both HD patients and animal models of the disease. Our study is the first to show that a therapeutic agent capable of improving an HD disease phenotype is concomitantly correlated with normalization of a subset of dysregulated striatal transcripts. Our data suggests that correction of these disease-altered transcripts may underlie, at least in part, the therapeutic efficacy shown associated with ASO-mediated correction of HD phenotypes and may provide a novel set of early biomarkers for evaluating future therapeutic concepts for HD.",

Searches can be executed online against two large databases currently containing more than 28,000 gene expression signatures derived from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and published expression profiles of human cancer. Comparisons among gene expression signatures can be performed with homology analysis and co-expression analysis. Results can be visualized instantly in a plot or a heat map. Three typical use cases are illustrated.

If the radar cross section (RCS) of the vehicles is strong enough, they can be detected in the SAR data, and their speed can be measured. For system performance prediction and algorithm development, it is therefore indispensable to know the RCS of typical passenger cars. The geometry parameters that have to be considered are the radar look direction, incidence angle, and vehicle orientation. In this letter, the radar signatures of nonmoving or parking cars are presented. They are measured experimentally from airborne experimental SAR (E-SAR) data, which have been collected during flight campaigns in 2005 and 2006 with multiple overflights at different aircraft headings. The radar signatures could be measured for the whole range of aspect angles from 0 to 180 and with high angular resolution due to the large synthetic aperture length of the E-SAR radar sensor. The analysis for one type of passenger car and particular incidence angles showed that the largest radar cross-sectional values and, thus, the greatest chance of detection of the vehicles appear when the car is seen from the front, back, and side. Radar cross-sectional values for slanted views are much lower and are therefore less suitable for car detection. The measurements have been performed in the -band (9.6 GHz) with VV-polarization, and at incidence angles of 41.5deg and 42.5deg. The derived radar signature profile can also be used for the verification of radar cross-sectional simulation studies.",

Aberrant DNA methylation of individual genes is a hallmark of cancer and has been shown to play an important role in neurological disorders such as Rett syndrome. Here, we asked whether normal DNA methylation might distinguish individual brain regions. We determined the quantitative DNA methylation levels of 1,505 CpG sites representing 807 genes with diverse functions, including proliferation and differentiation, previously shown to be implicated in human cancer. We initially analyzed 76 brain samples representing cerebral cortex (n=35), cerebellum (n=34), and pons (n=7), along with liver samples (n=3) from 43 individuals. Unsupervised hierarchical analysis showed clustering of 33 of 35 cerebra distinct from the clustering of 33 of 34 cerebella, 7 of 7 pons, and all 3 livers. By use of comparative marker selection and permutation testing, 156 loci representing 118 genes showed statistically significant differences--a >or=17% absolute change in DNA methylation (P<.004)--among brain regions. These results were validated for all six genes tested in a replicate set of 57 samples. Our data suggest that DNA methylation signatures distinguish brain regions and may help account for region-specific functional specialization.",

        "abstract": "Highly programmed skilled movements are executed in such a way that their kinematic features adhere to certain rules referred to as minimization principles. One such principle is the isochrony principle, which states that the duration of voluntary movement remains approximately constant across a range of movement distances; that is, movement duration is independent of movement extent. The concept of isochrony suggests that some information stored in the motor program is constant, thus reducing the storage demands of the program. The aim of the present study was to examine whether forged signatures can be distinguished from genuine signatures on the basis of isochrony kinematics. Sixty writers were asked to write their own signatures and to forge model signatures representing three different writing styles: text-based, stylized, and mixed. All signatures were digitized to enable high precision dynamic analyses of stroke kinematics. Vertical stroke duration and absolute amplitude were measured for each pen stroke of the signatures using MovAlyzeR?? software. Slope coefficients derived from simple regression models of the relationship between stroke duration and amplitude served as our measure of isochrony. The slope coefficient reflects the degree to which stroke duration increases in relation to stroke amplitude. Higher coefficients indicate greater increases in stroke duration for a given stroke amplitude and thus violate the isochrony principle. We hypothesized that the duration-amplitude coefficients for forged signatures would be significantly greater than for genuine signatures suggesting non-adherence to the isochrony principle. Results indicated that regardless of the style of the writer, genuine signatures were associated with low slope coefficients Pen strokes forming forged signatures had significantly greater duration-amplitude slope coefficients than genuine signatures. These findings suggest that when forging signatures, writers execute pen movements having steeper duration-amplitude relationships than for genuine signatures. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by shifts in the vaginal microbiota from Lactobacillus dominant to a microbiota with diverse anaerobic bacteria. Few studies have linked specific metabolites with bacteria found in the human vagina. Here, we report dramatic differences in metabolite compositions and concentrations associated with BV using a global metabolomics approach. We further validated important metabolites using samples from a second cohort of women and a different platform to measure metabolites. In the primary study, we compared metabolite profiles in cervicovaginal lavage fluid from 40 women with BV and 20 women without BV. Vaginal bacterial representation was determined using broad-range PCR with pyrosequencing and concentrations of bacteria by quantitative PCR. We detected 279 named biochemicals; levels of 62% of metabolites were significantly different in women with BV. Unsupervised clustering of metabolites separated women with and without BV. Women with BV have metabolite profiles marked by lower concentrations of amino acids and dipeptides, concomitant with higher levels of amino acid catabolites and polyamines. Higher levels of the signaling eicosanoid 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), a biomarker for inflammation, were noted in BV. Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus jensenii exhibited similar metabolite correlation patterns, which were distinct from correlation patterns exhibited by BV-associated bacteria. Several metabolites were significantly associated with clinical signs and symptoms (Amsel criteria) used to diagnose BV, and no metabolite was associated with all four clinical criteria. BV has strong metabolic signatures across multiple metabolic pathways, and these signatures are associated with the presence and concentrations of particular bacteria. IMPORTANCE Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common but highly enigmatic condition that is associated with adverse outcomes for women and their neonates. Small molecule metabolites in the vagina may influence host physiology, affect microbial community composition, and impact risk of adverse health outcomes, but few studies have comprehensively studied the metabolomics profile of BV. Here, we used mass spectrometry to link specific metabolites with particular bacteria detected in the human vagina by PCR. BV was associated with strong metabolic signatures across multiple pathways affecting amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, highlighting the profound metabolic changes in BV. These signatures were associated with the presence and concentrations of particular vaginal bacteria, including some bacteria yet to be cultivated, thereby providing clues as to the microbial origin of many metabolites. Insights from this study provide opportunities for developing new diagnostic markers of BV and novel approaches for treatment or prevention of BV.",

Four types of surface boundary signatures are deployed for matching; The angle boundary signature, the curvature boundary signature, the distance boundary signature and the parameter boundary signature. These four signatures are constructed based on local and global geometric shape attributes of the boundary. Matching of objects to models is accomplished by the boundary signature error, which is a weighted sum of the four boundary signatures errors obtained by comparing the object's signatures to a model's signatures. A fuzzy approach is then employed to evaluate the performance of the matching.

Here we show that, in the standard setup under continuous laser illumination, the steady state of the mechanical oscillator can develop a non-classical, strongly negative Wigner density if the optomechanical coupling is large at the single-photon level. Because of its robustness, such a Wigner density can be mapped using optical homodyne tomography. These features are observed near the onset of the instability towards self-induced oscillations. We show that there are also distinct signatures in the photon-photon correlation function $g^{(2)}(t)$ in that regime, including oscillations decaying on a time scale not only much longer than the optical cavity decay time, but even longer than the \\emph{mechanical} decay time.",

Our emphasis will be on the phenomenology due to b <-> b' mass-mixing, present after electroweak symmetry breaking. We focus on aspects which distinguish a vector-like b' from a chiral b' and include tree-level decays of the b' into t W, b Z and b h final states.

Within this study, over 1.5 million hydrophobic-polar sequences were classified based on their ability to attain a unique, but not necessarily minimal energy conformation through co-translational folding. The sequence and structure properties of the sets were then compared to elucidate signatures of co-translational folding. The strongest signature of co-translational folding is a reduced number of possible favorable contacts in the amino terminus. There is no evidence of fewer contacts, more local contacts, or less-compact structures. Co-translational folding produces a more compact amino- than carboxy-terminal region and an amino-terminal-biased set of core residues. In real proteins these signatures are also observed and found most strongly in proteins of the alpha/beta structural class of proteins (SCOP) where 71 % have an amino-terminal set of core residues. The prominence of co-translational features in experimentally determined protein structures suggests that the importance of co-translational folding is currently underestimated.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a model of memristor oscillator with a piecewise function is taken into account. The classification and stability of equilibria of the model are discussed in detail. One of main findings is that there exist at least three types of singular continuum (pinched hysteresis loop) whose loci always pass through the origin in the voltage-current plane, and whose loop areas will shrink to zero, which is one of signatures of a memristor which distinguishes it from non-memristive devices. By using qualitative analysis and bifurcation theory, we have obtained two Hopf bifurcation surfaces and a unique unstable periodic orbit, whose existence and uniqueness are proved in a strict mathematical way. By using numerical simulations, we have given different phase portraits of equilibria, singular continuum and periodic orbits, which verify all analytical results. Our results demonstrate that the three types of singular continuum and a unique unstable periodic orbit may become some of important signatures of a memristor distinguishing from non-memristive devices, and the associated memristor circuits with piecewise functions may reflect more real aspects of functional roles of a memristor in electronic circuits.",

Employing a sensitive array-based bioassay where patient plasma is used to induce transcriptional responses in healthy leukocytes, we previously reported disease-specific, partially IL-1 dependent, signatures associated with pre and recent onset (RO) T1D relative to unrelated healthy controls (uHC). To better understand inherited susceptibility in T1D families, we conducted cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of healthy auto-antibody-negative (AA-) high HLA risk siblings (HRS, DR3 and/or DR4) and AA- low HLA risk siblings (LRS, non-DR3/non-DR4). Signatures, scored with a novel ontology-based algorithm, and confirmatory studies differentiated the RO T1D, uHC, HRS, and LRS plasma milieus. Relative to uHC, T1D family members exhibited an elevated inflammatory state, consistent with innate receptor ligation that was independent of HLA, AA, or disease status and included elevated plasma IL-1\u03b1, IL-12p40, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4 levels. Longitudinally, signatures of T1D progressors exhibited increasing inflammatory bias. Conversely HRS possessing decreasing AA titers revealed emergence of an IL-10/TGF-\u03b2 mediated regulatory state that paralleled temporal increases in peripheral activated CD4+/CD45RA-/FoxP3(high) regulatory T-cell frequencies. In AA- HRS, the familial innate inflammatory state was also temporally supplanted by immunoregulatory processes, suggesting a mechanism underlying the decline in T1D susceptibility with age.",

Samples were clustered based on gene expression profiles and specific gene sets for each renal tumor type were identified. Gene expression was correlated to disease progression and a metastasis gene signature was derived.\\n\\nRESULTS: Gene signatures were identified for each tumor type with 100% accuracy. Differentially expressed genes during early tumor formation and tumor progression to metastatic RCC were found. Subsets of these genes code for secreted proteins and membrane receptors and are both potential therapeutic or diagnostic targets. A gene pattern (\"metastatic signature\") derived from primary tumor was very accurate in classifying tumors with and without metastases at the time of surgery. A previously described \"global\" metastatic signature derived by another group from various non-RCC tumors was validated in RCC.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Unlike previous studies, we describe highly accurate and externally validated gene signatures for RCC subtypes and other renal tumors. Interestingly, the gene expression of primary tumors provides us information about the metastatic status in the respective patients and has the potential, if prospectively validated, to enrich the armamentarium of diagnostic tests in RCC. We validated in RCC, for the first time, a previously described metastatic signature and further showed the feasibility of applying a gene signature across different microarray platforms.

Although a number of transcriptional signatures have been revealed in different tissues after cadmium treatment, the genes involved in the cadmium caused male reproductive toxicity, and the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we observed that the mice treated with different amount of cadmium in their rodent chow for six months exhibited reduced serum testosterone. We then performed RNA-seq to comprehensively investigate the mice testicular transcriptome to further elucidate the mechanism. Our results showed that hundreds of genes expression altered significantly in response to cadmium treatment. In particular, we found several transcriptional signatures closely related to the biological processes of regulation of hormone, gamete generation, and sexual reproduction, respectively. The expression of several testosterone synthetic key enzyme genes, such as Star, Cyp11a1, and Cyp17a1, were inhibited by the cadmium exposure. For better understanding of the cadmium-mediated transcriptional regulatory mechanism of the genes, we computationally analyzed the transcription factors binding sites and the mircoRNAs targets of the differentially expressed genes. Our findings suggest that the reproductive toxicity by cadmium exposure is implicated in multiple layers of deregulation of several biological processes and transcriptional regulation in mice.",

        "abstract": "Codebooks constructed from Welch bound equality (WBE) sequences have been show to be optimal in terms of sum capacity in synchronous CDMA systems. Unfortunately, these codebooks are a function of the number of active signatures and need to be reassigned as the number of active users changes to maintain optimality. To mitigate the problems caused by the loss of the Welch bound equality property, in this paper we propose a special subclass of WBE sequences for which the interference power experienced by each user depends only on the number of active users and the dimensions of the code. In deference to the relationship with Grassmannian line packing, we refer to this as a Grassmannian signature set. We study the interference properties of this set, comment on the sequence design problem, and illustrate improvements over arbitrary WBE sequence sets via simulation.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of electronic signatures into the national law of each country and the consequential legal impact on businesses is an issue of immense importance and cannot be ignored. This article aims to look at the background of electronic signatures and the advantages of such signatures compared with manuscript signatures. The use of cryptography to create electronic signatures is examined together with the security and trust offered by the use of digital certificates and PKI. The article then analyses the different types of electronic signatures available in the market and, in particular, looks at biometric applications that seem to be back on the agenda as a result of the recent terrorist attacks. Different types of biometric technologies are examined together with privacy concerns on the use of such applications. The article then briefly looks at two other emerging types of signatures, namely steganography and quantum cryptography. Finally, some of the regulations governing electronic signatures in Europe (including the distinction between electronic signatures and advanced electronic signatures) are examined with particular reference to the laws enacted in the UK to deal with some of these issues. Trust and security are now, more than ever, critical issues in doing business, whether online or in the paper world. Thus, the increase in global legislation on areas such as data protection, electronic signatures, information security and the control of encryption technology coupled with the risks of cyber-crime make it a good time to analyse all these key areas now.

        "abstract": "Recent studies identified a poor-prognosis stem/serrated/mesenchymal (SSM) transcriptional subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC). We noted that genes upregulated in this subtype are also prominently expressed by stromal cells, suggesting that SSM transcripts could derive from stromal rather than epithelial cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed CRC expression data from patient-derived xenografts, where mouse stroma supports human cancer cells. Species-specific expression analysis showed that the mRNA levels of SSM genes were mostly due to stromal expression. Transcriptional signatures built to specifically report the abundance of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), leukocytes or endothelial cells all had significantly higher expression in human CRC samples of the SSM subtype. High expression of the CAF signature was associated with poor prognosis in untreated CRC, and joint high expression of the stromal signatures predicted resistance to radiotherapy in rectal cancer. These data show that the distinctive transcriptional and clinical features of the SSM subtype can be ascribed to its particularly abundant stromal component.",

        "abstract": "Mass vaccination has saved millions of human lives and improved the quality of life in both developing and developed countries. The emergence of new pathogens and inadequate protection conferred by some of the existing vaccines such as vaccines for tuberculosis, influenza and pertussis especially in certain age groups have resulted in a move from empirically developed vaccines toward more pathogen tailored and rationally engineered vaccines. A deeper understanding of the interaction of innate and adaptive immunity at molecular level enables the development of vaccines that selectively target certain type of immune responses without excessive reactogenicity. Adjuvants constitute an imperative element of modern vaccines. Although a variety of candidate adjuvants have been evaluated in the past few decades, only a limited number of vaccine adjuvants are currently available for human use. A better understanding of the mode of action of adjuvants is pivotal to harness the potential of existing and new adjuvants in shaping a desired immune response. Recent advancement in systems biology powered by the emerging cutting edge omics technology has led to the identification of molecular signatures rapidly induced after vaccination in the blood that correlate and predict a later protective immune response or vaccine safety. This can pave ways to prospectively determine the potency and safety of vaccines and adjuvants. This review is intended to highlight the importance of big data analysis in advancing our understanding of the mechanisms of actions of adjuvants to inform rational development of future human vaccines.",

Circumplanetary disks only accreting at 10-10 M \u2299 yr-1 around a 1 MJ planet can be brighter than the planet itself. A moderately accreting circumplanetary disk (\\dot{M}\u02dc 10-8 M\u2299 yr-1; enough to form a 10 MJ planet within 1 Myr) around a 1 MJ planet has a maximum temperature of ~2000 K, and at near-infrared wavelengths (J, H, K bands), this disk is as bright as a late-M-type brown dwarf or a 10 MJ planet with a \"hot start.\" To use direct imaging to find the accretion disks around low-mass planets (e.g., 1 MJ ) and distinguish them from brown dwarfs or hot high-mass planets, it is crucial to obtain photometry at mid-infrared bands (L', M, N bands) because the emission from circumplanetary disks falls off more slowly toward longer wavelengths than those of brown dwarfs or planets. If young planets have strong magnetic fields (gsim100 G), fields may truncate slowly accreting circumplanetary disks (\\dot{M}\u2272 10-9 M\u2299 yr-1) and lead to magnetospheric accretion, which can provide additional accretion signatures, such as UV/optical excess from the accretion shock and line emission.",

        "title": "Secure outsourced attribute-based signatures",
        "abstract": "Attribute-based signature (ABS) enables users to sign messages over attributes without revealing any information other than the fact that they have attested to the messages. However, heavy computational cost is required during signing in existing work of ABS, which grows linearly with the size of the predicate formula. As a result, this presents a significant challenge for resource-constrained devices (such as mobile devices or RFID tags) to perform such heavy computations independently. Aiming at tackling the challenge above, we first propose and formalize a new paradigm called Outsourced ABS, i.e., OABS, in which the computational overhead at user side is greatly reduced through outsourcing intensive computations to an untrusted signing-cloud service provider (S-CSP). Furthermore, we apply this novel paradigm to existing ABS schemes to reduce the complexity. As a result, we present two concrete OABS schemes: i) in the first OABS scheme, the number of exponentiations involving in signing is reduced from O(d) to O(1) (nearly three), where d is the upper bound of threshold value defined in the predicate; ii) our second scheme is built on Herranz et al.'s construction with constant-size signatures. The number of exponentiations in signing is reduced from O(d2) to O(d) and the communication overhead is O(1). Security analysis demonstrates that both OABS schemes are secure in terms of the unforgeability and attribute-signer privacy definitions specified in the proposed security model. Finally, to allow for high efficiency and flexibility, we discuss extensions of OABS and show how to achieve accountability as well.",

        "abstract": "The first definitive infrared signatures of the elusive NCCO radical have been measured using a microwave discharge technique combined with low-temperature matrix-isolation spectroscopy, resulting in a consistent set of vibrational assignments for six isotopologues. The infrared spectra of these NCCO isotopologues were concomitantly established by rigorous variational nuclear-motion computations based on a high-level coupled-cluster quartic vibrational force field [ROCCSD(T)/cc-pCVQZ] and cubic dipole field [ROCCSD/cc-pCVTZ]. Our experimental and theoretical results for NCCO overturn the vibrational assignments in a NIST-JANAF compilation and those from a recent two-dimensional cross-spectral correlation analysis. For the parent isotopologue at 11 K in a nitrogen matrix, we find the signature bands nu(2)(CO str.) = 1889.2 cm(-1) and nu(3)(CC str.) = 782.0 cm(-1). Our variational vibrational computations reveal strong mixing of the nu(3) stretching fundamental and the nu(4) + nu(5) bending combination level for all isotopologues. These Fermi resonances manifest a clear breakdown of the simple normal-mode picture of molecular vibrations at low energies.",

Clues to the responsible mechanisms may lie with the discovery of molecular signatures of stress, some of which include alterations to an individual's somatic genome. Here, using genome sequences from 11,670 women, we observed a highly significant association between a stress-related disease, major depression, and the amount of mtDNA (p = 9.00 \u00d7 10(-42), odds ratio 1.33 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29-1.37]) and telomere length (p = 2.84 \u00d7 10(-14), odds ratio 0.85 [95% CI = 0.81-0.89]). While both telomere length and mtDNA amount were associated with adverse life events, conditional regression analyses showed the molecular changes were contingent on the depressed state. We tested this hypothesis with experiments in mice, demonstrating that stress causes both molecular changes, which are partly reversible and can be elicited by the administration of corticosterone. Together, these results demonstrate that changes in the amount of mtDNA and telomere length are consequences of stress and entering a depressed state. These findings identify increased amounts of mtDNA as a molecular marker of MD and have important implications for understanding how stress causes the disease.",

We studied microRNA (miRNA) expression in clinical melanoma subtypes and evaluated different miRNA signatures in the background of gain of function somatic and inherited mutations associated with melanoma. Total RNA from 42 patient derived primary melanoma cell lines and three independent normal primary melanocyte cell cultures was evaluated by miRNA array. MiRNA expression was then analyzed comparing subtypes and additional clinicopathologic criteria including somatic mutations. The prevalence and association of an inherited variant in a miRNA binding site in the 3'UTR of the KRAS oncogene, referred to as the KRAS-variant, was also evaluated. We show that seven miRNAs, miR-142-3p, miR-486, miR-214, miR-218, miR-362, miR-650 and miR-31, were significantly correlated with acral as compared to non-acral melanomas (p < 0.04). In addition, we discovered that the KRAS-variant was enriched in non-acral melanoma (25%), and that miR-137 under expression was significantly associated with melanomas with the KRAS-variant. Our findings indicate that miRNAs are differentially expressed in melanoma subtypes and that their misregulation can be impacted by inherited gene variants, supporting the hypothesis that miRNA misregulation reflects biological differences in melanoma.",

The stromatolitic sample was primarily composed of quartz (SiO2) with fractional amounts of hematite (Fe2O3), greenalite ((Fe,Mg)(3)Si2O5(OH)(2)), and minor amounts of stilpnomelane (K(Fe2+,Mg,Fe3+, Al)(8)(Si,Al)(12)(O,OH)(27) . 2H(2)O). Iron-bearing minerals were present within thin, discontinuous bands aligned roughly parallel. Octahedral pseudomorphs of hematite after magnetite occurred as localized elongate clusters, as well as on the outer rims of detrital oncolitic structures. Microcrystalline greenalite was present as a clay occurring in layers subparallel to the stromatolitic layering. Greenalite was observed in both the silica- and iron-rich layers, as well as within oncolitic structures. Irregular aggregates of radiating stilpnomelane needles extended into the silica matrix. Optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed 5-10 mum diameter iron-mineralized or siliceous, concentrically laminated, ooid-like structures in localized patches. OM, SEM, and energy dispersive X-ray analyses (EDX) were used to characterize microfossils mineralized by iron-oxides in the stromatolite. The microfossils consisted of coccoidal and filamentous forms. The coccoids (similar to0.5 to 2 mum diameter) were present both in chains and individually throughout the silica- and iron-rich bands, while the filamentous remnants (similar to1-3 mum diameter, and up to 200 mum length) were localized and patchy in the sample. While the Gunflint Iron Formation does not provide us with a perfect analogue to the Martian hematite site, it does establish the potential for finding iron-mineralized microorganisms within Martian sediments.

Consequently, two major aims are the discovery of novel GCs and the identification of cGMP mediated processes. Recently, we have reported temporal signatures of ozone (O3)-induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) generation, their effect on cGMP generation, and consequent transcriptional changes of genes diagnostic for stress responses in tobacco. We demonstrated that O3 and NO induced early transcriptional activation of the scavenger encoding proteins, alternative oxidase (AOX1a), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and the induction of ethylene production through aminocyclopropancarboxylic acid synthase (ACS2) are cGMP-independent. By contrast, the early response of the phenylalanine ammonia lyase gene (PALa) and the late response of the gene encoding the pathogenesis-related protein (PR1a) show critical dependence on cGMP. Here we show differential cGMP responses to virulent and avirulent Pseudomonas syringae strains and propose that host-pathogen recognition and/or down-stream processes are transduced by complex cGMP signatures. This is in accordance with the identification of a growing number of multi-domain molecules in Arabidopsis that are reported to contain putative functional GC catalytic centers.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To address the progression, metastasis, and clinical heterogeneity of renal cell cancer (RCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Transcriptional profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays (22,283 genes) was done on 49 RCC tumors, 20 non-RCC renal tumors, and 23 normal kidney samples. Samples were clustered based on gene expression profiles and specific gene sets for each renal tumor type were identified. Gene expression was correlated to disease progression and a metastasis gene signature was derived. RESULTS: Gene signatures were identified for each tumor type with 100% accuracy. Differentially expressed genes during early tumor formation and tumor progression to metastatic RCC were found. Subsets of these genes code for secreted proteins and membrane receptors and are both potential therapeutic or diagnostic targets. A gene pattern (metastatic signature) derived from primary tumor was very accurate in classifying tumors with and without metastases at the time of surgery. A previously described global metastatic signature derived by another group from various non-RCC tumors was validated in RCC. CONCLUSION: Unlike previous studies, we describe highly accurate and externally validated gene signatures for RCC subtypes and other renal tumors. Interestingly, the gene expression of primary tumors provides us information about the metastatic status in the respective patients and has the potential, if prospectively validated, to enrich the armamentarium of diagnostic tests in RCC. We validated in RCC, for the first time, a previously described metastatic signature and further showed the feasibility of applying a gene signature across different microarray platforms. Transcriptional profiling allows a better appreciation of the molecular and clinical heterogeneity in RCC",

Combining ground-based GPS total electron content (TEC), EISCAT incoherent scattering radar (ISR), and DMSP F15 ion drift meter observations we have observed greatly elevated density over the European continent during storm recovery phase on 12 September 2005. The TEC seen over Europe has a tongue of enhanced ionization extending to higher latitudes, which is identical to the plasmaspheric plume signatures that have been often observed over North America. Therefore, our observations clearly demonstrate that ionospheric signatures of plasmaspheric plumes are not limited to the North American sector and suggest that they may be observed at any longitude as long as a dense array of instruments are available to identify these signatures.",

Thus, the simple fact that a cryptographic algorithm withstands cryptanalytic attacks for several years is often considered as a kind of validation procedure. A much more convincing line of research has tried to provide ``provable'' security for cryptographic protocols. Unfortunately, in many cases, provable security is at the cost of a considerable loss in terms of efficiency. Another way to achieve some kind of provable security is to identify concrete cryptographic objects, such as hash functions, with ideal random objects and to use arguments from relativized complexity theory. The model underlying this approach is often called the ``random oracle model.'' We use the word ``arguments'' for security results proved in this model. As usual, these arguments are relative to well-established hard algorithmic problems such as factorization or the discrete logarithm. In this paper we offer security arguments for a large class of known signature schemes. Moreover, we give for the first time an argument for a very slight variation of the well-known El Gamal signature scheme. In spite of the existential forgery of the original scheme, we prove that our variant resists existential forgeries even against an adaptively chosen-message attack. This is provided that the discrete logarithm problem is hard to solve. Next, we study the security of blind signatures which are the most important ingredient for anonymity in off-line electronic cash systems. We first define an appropriate notion of security related to the setting of electronic cash. We then propose new schemes for which one can provide security arguments.",

        "title": "Maximizing biomarker discovery by minimizing gene signatures",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of gene signatures can potentially be of considerable value in the field of clinical diagnosis. However, gene signatures defined with different methods can be quite various even when applied the same disease and the same endpoint. Previous studies have shown that the correct selection of subsets of genes from microarray data is key for the accurate classification of disease phenotypes, and a number of methods have been proposed for the purpose. However, these methods refine the subsets by only considering each single feature, and they do not confirm the association between the genes identified in each gene signature and the phenotype of the disease. We proposed an innovative new method termed Minimize Feature's Size (MFS) based on multiple level similarity analyses and association between the genes and disease for breast cancer endpoints by comparing classifier models generated from the second phase of MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC-II), trying to develop effective meta-analysis strategies to transform the MAQC-II signatures into a robust and reliable set of biomarker for clinical applications. RESULTS: We analyzed the similarity of the multiple gene signatures in an endpoint and between the two endpoints of breast cancer at probe and gene levels, the results indicate that disease-related genes can be preferably selected as the components of gene signature, and that the gene signatures for the two endpoints could be interchangeable. The minimized signatures were built at probe level by using MFS for each endpoint. By applying the approach, we generated a much smaller set of gene signature with the similar predictive power compared with those gene signatures from MAQC-II. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that gene signatures of both large and small sizes could perform equally well in clinical applications. Besides, consistency and biological significances can be detected among different gene signatures, reflecting the studying endpoints. New classifiers built with MFS exhibit improved performance with both internal and external validation, suggesting that MFS method generally reduces redundancies for features within gene signatures and improves the performance of the model. Consequently, our strategy will be beneficial for the microarray-based clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: There is certain degree of frustration and discontent in the area of microarray gene expression data analysis of cancer datasets. It arises from the mathematical problem called \u2018curse of dimensionality,\u2019 which is due to the small number of samples available in training sets, used for calculating transcriptional signatures from the large number of differentially expressed (DE) genes, measured by microarrays. The new generation of causal reasoning algorithms can provide solutions to the curse of dimensionality by transforming microarray data into activity of a small number of cancer hallmark pathways. This new approach can make feature space dimensionality optimal for mathematical signature calculations.Areas covered: The author reviews the reasons behind the current frustration with transcriptional signatures derived from DE genes in cancer. He also provides an overview of the novel methods for signature calculations based on differentially variable genes and expression regulators. Furthermore, the authors provide perspectives on causal reasoning algorithms that use prior knowledge about regulatory events described in scientific literature to identify expression regulators responsible for the differential expression observed in cancer samples.Expert opinion: The author advocates causal reasoning methods to calculate cancer pathway activity signatures. The current challenge for these algorithms is in ensuring quality of the knowledgebase. Indeed, the development of cancer hallmark pathway collections, together with statistical algorithms to transform activity of expression regulators into pathway activity, are necessary for causal reasoning to be used in cancer research.",

        "title": "Using context-specific effect of miRNAs to identify functional associations between miRNAs and gene signatures",
        "abstract": "Background: MicroRNAs are a class of short regulatory RNAs that act as post-transcriptional fine-tune regulators of a large host of genes that play key roles in many cellular processes and signaling pathways. A useful step for understanding their functional role is characterizing their influence on the protein context of the targets. Using miRNA context-specific influence as a functional signature is promising to identify functional associations between miRNAs and other gene signatures, and thus advance our understanding of miRNA mode of action. Results: In the current study we utilized the power of regularized regression models to construct functional associations between gene signatures. Genes that are influenced by miRNAs directly(computational miRNA target prediction) or indirectly (protein partners of direct targets) are defined as functional miRNA gene signature. The combined direct and indirect miRNA influence is defined as context-specific effects of miRNAs, and is used to identify regulatory effects of miRNAs on curated gene signatures. Elastic-net regression was used to build functional associations between context-specific effect of miRNAs and other gene signatures (disease, pathway signatures) by identifying miRNAs whose targets are enriched in gene lists. As a proof of concept, elastic-net regression was applied on lists of genes downregulated upon pre-miRNA transfection, and successfully identified the treated miRNA. This model was then extended to construct functional relationships between miRNAs and disease and pathway gene lists. Integrating context-specific effects of miRNAs on a protein network reveals more significant miRNA enrichment in prostate gene signatures compared to miRNA direct targets. The model identified novel list of miRNAs that are associated with prostate clinical variables. Conclusions: Elastic-net regression is used as a model to construct functional associations between miRNA signatures and other gene signatures. Defining miRNA context-specific functional gene signature by integrating the downstream effect of miRNAs demonstrates better performance compared to the miRNA signature alone (direct targets). miRNA functional signatures can greatly facilitate miRNA research to uncover new functional associations between miRNAs and diseases, drugs or pathways.

        "abstract": "Adversity, particularly in early life, can cause illness. Clues to the responsible mechanisms may lie with the discovery of molecular signatures of stress, some of which include alterations to an individual's somatic genome. Here, using genome sequences from 11,670 women, we observed a highly significant association between a stress-related disease, major depression, and the amount of mtDNA (p = 9.00 x 10(-42), odds ratio 1.33 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29-1.37]) and telomere length (p = 2.84 x 10(-14), odds ratio 0.85 [95% CI = 0.81-0.89]). While both telomere length and mtDNA amount were associated with adverse life events, conditional regression analyses showed the molecular changes were contingent on the depressed state. We tested this hypothesis with experiments in mice, demonstrating that stress causes both molecular changes, which are partly reversible and can be elicited by the administration of corticosterone. Together, these results demonstrate that changes in the amount of mtDNA and telomere length are consequences of stress and entering a depressed state. These findings identify increased amounts of mtDNA as a molecular marker of MD and have important implications for understanding how stress causes the disease.",

        "abstract": "Wave-induced fluid flow (WIFF) between fractures and the embedding matrix as well as within connected fractures tends to produce significant seismic attenuation and velocity dispersion. While WIFF between fractures and matrix is well understood, the corresponding effects related to fracture connectivity and the characteristics of the energy dissipation due to flow within fractures are largely unexplored. In this work, we use oscillatory relaxation simulations based on the quasi-static poroelastic equations to study these phenomena. We first consider synthetic rock samples containing connected and unconnected fractures and compute the corresponding attenuation and phase velocity. We also determine the relative fluid displacement and pressure fields in order to gain insight into the physical processes involved in the two manifestations of WIFF in fractured media. To quantify the contributions of the two WIFF mechanisms to the total seismic attenuation, we compute the spatial distribution of the local energy dissipation. Finally, we perform an exhaustive sensitivity analysis to study the role played by different characteristics of fracture networks on the seismic signatures. We show that in the presence of connected fractures both P wave attenuation and phase velocity are sensitive to some key characteristics of the probed medium, notably to the lengths, permeabilities, and intersection angles of the fractures as well as to the overall degree of connectivity of the fracture network. This, in turn, indicates that a deeper understanding of these two manifestations of WIFF in fractured media may eventually allow for the extraction of some of these properties from seismic data.",

        "abstract": "We investigate signatures of neutrino scattering in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and matter power spectra, and the extent to which present cosmological data can distinguish between a free streaming or tightly coupled fluid of neutrinos. If neutrinos have strong non-standard interactions, for example, through the coupling of neutrinos to a light boson, they may be kept in equilibrium until late times. We show how the power spectra for these models differ from more conventional neutrino scenarios, and use CMB and large scale structure data to constrain these models. CMB polarization data improves the constraints on the number of massless neutrinos, while the Lyman--$\\alpha$ power spectrum improves the limits on the neutrino mass. Neutrino mass limits depend strongly on whether some or all of the neutrino species interact and annihilate. The present data can accommodate a number of tightly-coupled relativistic degrees of freedom, and none of the interacting-neutrino scenarios considered are ruled out by current data -- although considerations regarding the age of the Universe disfavor a model with three annihilating neutrinos with very large neutrino masses.",

Applicability of primary DCs is restricted due to their scarcity and therefore DC models are commonly employed in DC-based immunotherapy strategies and in vitro tests assessing DC function. However, the interrelationship between the individual in vitro DC models and their relative resemblance to specific primary DC populations remain elusive.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: To describe and assess functionality and applicability of the available in vitro DC models by using a genome-wide transcriptional approach.\\n\\nMETHODS: Transcriptional profiling was performed with four commonly used in vitro DC models (MUTZ-3-DCs, monocyte-derived DCs, CD34-derived DCs and Langerhans cells (LCs)) and nine primary DC populations (dermal DCs, LCs, blood and tonsillar CD123(+), CD1c(+) and CD141(+) DCs, and blood CD16(+) DCs).\\n\\nRESULTS: Principal Component Analysis showed that transcriptional profiles of each in vitro DC model most closely resembled CD1c(+) and CD141(+) tonsillar myeloid DCs (mDCs) among primary DC populations. Thus, additional differentiation factors may be required to generate model DCs that more closely resemble other primary DC populations. Also, no model DC stood out in terms of primary DC resemblance. Nevertheless, hierarchical clustering showed clusters of differentially expressed genes among individual DC models as well as primary DC populations. Furthermore, model DCs were shown to differentially express immunologically relevant transcripts and transcriptional signatures identified for each model DC included several immune-associated transcripts.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The unique transcriptional profiles of in vitro DC models suggest distinct functionality in immune applications. The presented results will aid in the selection of an appropriate DC model for in vitro assays and assist development of DC-based immunotherapy.",

The visible manifestations of these two spectral features are ankle, which is intrinsic part of the dip, beginning of GZK cutoff in the differential spectrum and E1/2 in integral spectrum. Observed practically in all experiments since 1963, the ankle is usually interpreted as a feature caused by transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays. Using the mass composition measured by HiRes, Telescope Array and Auger detectors at energy (1-3) EeV, calculated anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays at these energies, and the elongation curves we strongly argue against the interpretation of the ankle given above. The transition must occur at lower energy, most probably at the second knee as the dip model predicts. The other prediction of the dip model, the shape of the dip, is well confirmed by HiRes, Telescope Array (TA), AGASA and Yakutsk detectors, and, after recalibration of energies, by Auger detector. Predicted beginning of GZK cutoff and E1/2 agree well with HiRes and TA data. However, directly measured mass composition remains a puzzle. While HiRes and TA detectors observe the proton-dominated mass composition, as required by the dip model, the data of Auger detector strongly evidence for nuclei mass composition becoming progressively heavier at energy higher than 4 EeV and reaching Iron at energy about 35 EeV. The Auger-based scenario is consistent with another interpretation of the ankle at energy Ea???4 EeV as transition from extragalactic protons to extragalactic nuclei. The heavy-nuclei dominance at higher energies may be provided by low-energy of acceleration for protons Epmax???4 EeV and rigidity-dependent EAmax=ZEpmax for nuclei. The highest energy suppression may be explained as nuclei-photodisintegration cutoff.",

Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin.

To gain an idea of how the solar UV radiation varies between different regions, including planned landing sites of two future Mars surface missions. we modelled the total solar UV surface flux throughout one Martian year for two different dust scenarios. To understand the degree of solar UV stress on micro-organisms and/or molecules essential for life on the surface of Mars, we also calculated the biologically effective dose (BED) for T7 and Uracil in relevant wavelength regions at the Martian surface as a function of season and latitude. and discuss the biological survival rates in the presence of Martian solar UV radiation. High T7/Uracil BED ratios indicate that even at high latitudes where the UV flux is significantly reduced, the radiation environment is still hostile for life due to the persisting UV-C component of the flux.

Microarray analysis of individual cortical layers across sensorimotor and association cortices identified robust and specific molecular signatures for individual cortical layers and areas, prominently involving genes associated with specialized neuronal function. Overall, transcriptome-based relationships were related to spatial proximity, being strongest between neighboring cortical areas and between proximal layers. Primary visual cortex (V1) displayed the most distinctive gene expression compared to other cortical regions in rhesus and human, both in the specialized layer 4 as well as other layers. Laminar patterns were more similar between macaque and human compared to mouse, as was the unique V1 profile that was not observed in mouse. These data provide a unique resource detailing neocortical transcription patterns in a nonhuman primate with great similarity in gene expression to human. Transcriptional profiling provides abundant information for understanding functional differentiation of brain regions and constituent cell types.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Molecular signatures are sets of genes, proteins, genetic variants or other variables that can be used as markers for a particular phenotype. Reliable signature discovery methods could yield valuable insight into cell biology and mechanisms of human disease. However, it is currently not clear how to control error rates such as the false discovery rate (FDR) in signature discovery. Moreover, signatures for cancer gene expression have been shown to be unstable, that is, difficult to replicate in independent studies, casting doubts on their reliability.\\n\\nRESULTS: We demonstrate that with modern prediction methods, signatures that yield accurate predictions may still have a high FDR. Further, we show that even signatures with low FDR may fail to replicate in independent studies due to limited statistical power. Thus, neither stability nor predictive accuracy are relevant when FDR control is the primary goal. We therefore develop a general statistical hypothesis testing framework that for the first time provides FDR control for signature discovery. Our method is demonstrated to be correct in simulation studies. When applied to five cancer data sets, the method was able to discover molecular signatures with 5% FDR in three cases, while two data sets yielded no significant findings.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our approach enables reliable discovery of molecular signatures from genome-wide data with current sample sizes. The statistical framework developed herein is potentially applicable to a wide range of prediction problems in bioinformatics.",

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Numerous microarray studies of aging have been conducted, yet given the noisy nature of gene expression changes with age, elucidating the transcriptional features of aging and how these relate to physiological, biochemical and pathological changes remains a critical problem.\\n\\nRESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of age-related gene expression profiles using 27 datasets from mice, rats and humans. Our results reveal several common signatures of aging, including 56 genes consistently overexpressed with age, the most significant of which was APOD, and 17 genes underexpressed with age. We characterized the biological processes associated with these signatures and found that age-related gene expression changes most notably involve an overexpression of inflammation and immune response genes and of genes associated with the lysosome. An underexpression of collagen genes and of genes associated with energy metabolism, particularly mitochondrial genes, as well as alterations in the expression of genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle and cellular senescence biomarkers, were also observed. By employing a new method that emphasizes sensitivity, our work further reveals previously unknown transcriptional changes with age in many genes, processes and functions. We suggest these molecular signatures reflect a combination of degenerative processes but also transcriptional responses to the process of aging. Overall, our results help to understand how transcriptional changes relate to the process of aging and could serve as targets for future studies.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY: http://genomics.senescence.info/uarrays/signatures.html.\\n\\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

We first describe how methods that analyze biological processes in terms of higher-level modules can identify robust signatures of disease mechanisms. We then discuss methods that aim to identify the regulatory mechanisms underlying these modules and processes. Finally, we show how comparative analysis, combining human data with model organisms, can lead to more robust findings.

        "abstract": "Here, we explore the role of splicing in transcription, employing both genome-wide analysis of human ChIP-seq data and experimental manipulation of exon-intron organization in transgenic cell lines. We show that the activating histone modifications H3K4me3 and H3K9ac map specifically to first exon-intron boundaries. This is surprising, because these marks help recruit general transcription factors (GTFs) to promoters. In genes with long first exons, promoter-proximal levels of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac are greatly reduced; consequently, GTFs and RNA polymerase II are low at transcription start sites (TSSs) and exhibit a second, promoter-distal peak from which transcription also initiates. In contrast, short first exons lead to increased H3K4me3 and H3K9ac at promoters, higher expression levels, accuracy in TSS usage, and a lower frequency of antisense transcription. Therefore, first exon length is predictive for gene activity. Finally, splicing inhibition and intron deletion reduce H3K4me3 levels and transcriptional output. Thus, gene architecture and splicing determines transcription quantity and quality as well as chromatin signatures.",

Recent chromatin genome-wide studies indicate that PcG targets sites are bivalent domains with overlapping repressive H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 mark domains. During S phase, the stability of epigenetic signatures is challenged by the replication fork passage. Hence, specific mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance might be provided to preserve epigenome structures. Recently, we have identified a critical time window before replication, during which high levels of PcG binding and histone marks on BX-C PRE target sites set the stage for subsequent dilution of epigenomic components, allowing proper transmission of epigenetic signatures to the next generation. Here, we extended this analysis to promoter elements, showing the same mechanism of inheritance. Furthermore, to gain insight into the inheritance of PREs bivalent marks, we analyzed dynamics of H3K4me3 deposition, a mark that correlates with transcriptionally active chromatin. Likewise, we found an early S-phase enrichment of H3K4me3 mark preceding the replication-dependent dilution. This evidence suggests that all epigenetic marks are inherited simultaneously to ensure their correct propagation through replication and to protect the \"bivalency\" of PREs.",

Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types.

In doing so, Polygraph leverages our insight that for a real-world exploit to function properly, multiple invariant substrings must often be present in all variants of a payload; these substrings typically correspond to protocol framing, return addresses, and in some cases, poorly obfuscated code. We contribute a definition of the polymorphic signature generation problem; propose classes of signature suited for matching polymorphic worm payloads; and present algorithms for automatic generation of signatures in these classes. Our evaluation of these algorithms on a range of polymorphic worms demonstrates that Polygraph produces signatures for polymorphic worms that exhibit low false negatives and false positives.",

The ability to predict which patients may develop DSS may improve triage and treatment. To this end, we conducted a nested case-control comparison of the early host transcriptional features in 24 DSS patients and 56 sex-, age-, and virus serotype-matched uncomplicated (UC) dengue patients. In the first instance, we defined the \"early dengue\" profile. The transcriptional signature in acute rather than convalescent samples (\u226472 h post-illness onset) was defined by an overabundance of interferon-inducible transcripts (31% of the 551 overabundant transcripts) and canonical gene ontology terms that included the following: response to virus, immune response, innate immune response, and inflammatory response. Pathway and network analyses identified STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, IRF7, IRF9, IRF1, CEBPB, and SP1 as key transcriptional factors mediating the early response. Strikingly, the only difference in the transcriptional signatures of early DSS and UC dengue cases was the greater abundance of several neutrophil-associated transcripts in patients who progressed to DSS, a finding supported by higher plasma concentrations of several canonical proteins associated with neutrophil degranulation (bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein [BPI], elastase 2 [ELA2], and defensin 1 alpha [DEF1A]). Elevated levels of neutrophil-associated transcripts were independent of the neutrophil count and also of the genotype of the infecting virus, as genome-length sequences of dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) (n = 15) and DENV-2 (n = 3) sampled from DSS patients were phylogenetically indistinguishable from those sampled from uncomplicated dengue patients (32 DENV-1 and 9 DENV-2 sequences). Collectively, these data suggest a hitherto unrecognized association between neutrophil activation, pathogenesis, and the development of DSS and point to future strategies for guiding prognosis.",

This technique is based on high-resolution scanning radiometric observations and digital image analysis. Two-dimensional, ocean thermal microwave emission features (signatures) are detected in the form of extended texture mosaics and distinct objects. Usually they are revealed as sets of low-contrast cold and hot spots. We hypothesize that the observed signatures can be associated with local oceanic phenomena and hydrodynamical disturbances.

Unbiased hierarchical clustering clearly separated patients from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched controls (MCRs; 'disease' signature), and active from remittent patients ('activity' signature). DEGs associated with these signatures are involved in immune response, cytoskeletal reorganization, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, oxidation-reduction and apoptosis. We further found that MCRs carrying the PV-associated HLA risk alleles cluster distinctly from unmatched controls (UMCR) revealing an HLA-associated 'control' signature. A subset of DEGs within the 'control' signature overlap with the 'disease' signature, but are inversely regulated in MCR when compared with either PV patients or UMCR, suggesting the existence of a 'protection' signature in healthy individuals carrying the PV HLA genetic risk elements. Finally, we identified 19 transcriptional 'hot spots' across the signatures, which may guide future studies aimed at pinpointing disease risk genes.",

        "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates chemical energy and generates heat to protect animals from cold and obesity. Rodents possess two types of UCP-1 positive brown adipocytes arising from distinct developmental lineages: \"classical\" brown adipocytes develop during the prenatal stage whereas \"beige\" or \"brite\" cells that reside in white adipose tissue (WAT) develop during the postnatal stage in response to chronic cold or PPAR\u03b3 agonists. Beige cells' inducible characteristics make them a promising therapeutic target for obesity treatment, however, the relevance of this cell type in humans remains unknown. In the present study, we determined the gene signatures that were unique to classical brown adipocytes and to beige cells induced by a specific PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone in mice. Subsequently we applied the transcriptional data to humans and examined the molecular signatures of human BAT isolated from multiple adipose depots. To our surprise, nearly all the human BAT abundantly expressed beige cell-selective genes, but the expression of classical brown fat-selective genes were nearly undetectable. Interestingly, expression of known brown fat-selective genes such as PRDM16 was strongly correlated with that of the newly identified beige cell-selective genes, but not with that of classical brown fat-selective genes. Furthermore, histological analyses showed that a new beige cell marker, CITED1, was selectively expressed in the UCP1-positive beige cells as well as in human BAT. These data indicate that human BAT may be primary composed of beige/brite cells.",

        "abstract": "Intrinsic radiosensitivity is an important factor underlying radiotherapy response, but there is no method for its routine assessment in human tumours. Gene signatures are currently being derived and some were previously generated by expression profiling the NCI-60 cell line panel. It was hypothesised that focusing on more homogeneous tumour types would be a better approach. Two cell line cohorts were used derived from cervix [n = 16] and head and neck [n = 11] cancers. Radiosensitivity was measured as surviving fraction following irradiation with 2 Gy (SF2) by clonogenic assay. Differential gene expression between radiosensitive and radioresistant cell lines (SF2</> median) was investigated using Affymetrix GeneChip Exon 1.0ST (cervix) or U133A Plus2 (head and neck) arrays. There were differences within cell line cohorts relating to tissue of origin reflected by expression of the stratified epithelial marker p63. Of 138 genes identified as being associated with SF2, only 2 (1.4%) were congruent between the cervix and head and neck carcinoma cell lines (MGST1 and TFPI), and these did not partition the published NCI-60 cell lines based on SF2. There was variable success in applying three published radiosensitivity signatures to our cohorts. One gene signature, originally trained on the NCI-60 cell lines, did partially separate sensitive and resistant cell lines in all three cell line datasets. The findings do not confirm our hypothesis but suggest that a common transcriptional signature can reflect the radiosensitivity of tumours of heterogeneous origins.",

        "abstract": " Signatures detect changes to data objects. Numerous schemes are in use, especially the cryptographically secure standards SHA-1. We propose a novel signature scheme which we call algebraic signatures. The scheme uses the Galois field calculations. Its major property is the sure detection of any changes up to a parameterized size. More precisely, we detect for sure any changes that do not exceed n-symbols for an n-symbol algebraic signature. This property is new for any known signature scheme. For larger changes, the collision probability is typically negligible, as for the other known schemes. We apply the algebraic signatures to the scalable distributed data structures (SDDS). We filter at the SDDS client node the updates that do not actually change the records. We also manage the concurrent updates to data stored in the SDDS RAM buckets at the server nodes. We further use the scheme for the fast disk backup of these buckets. We sign our objects with 4-byte signatures, instead of 20-byte standard SHA-1 signatures. Our algebraic calculus is then also about twice as fast.",

        "abstract": "Computational methods to identify functional genomic elements using genetic information have been very successful in determining gene structure and in identifying a handful of cis-regulatory elements. But the vast majority of regulatory elements have yet to be discovered, and it has become increasingly apparent that their discovery will not come from using genetic information alone. Recently, high-throughput technologies have enabled the creation of information-rich epigenetic maps, most notably for histone modifications. However, tools that search for functional elements using this epigenetic information have been lacking. Here, we describe an unsupervised learning method called ChromaSig to find, in an unbiased fashion, commonly occurring chromatin signatures in both tiling microarray and sequencing data. Applying this algorithm to nine chromatin marks across a 1% sampling of the human genome in HeLa cells, we recover eight clusters of distinct chromatin signatures, five of which correspond to known patterns associated with transcriptional promoters and enhancers. Interestingly, we observe that the distinct chromatin signatures found at enhancers mark distinct functional classes of enhancers in terms of transcription factor and coactivator binding. In addition, we identify three clusters of novel chromatin signatures that contain evolutionarily conserved sequences and potential cis-regulatory elements. Applying ChromaSig to a panel of 21 chromatin marks mapped genomewide by ChIP-Seq reveals 16 classes of genomic elements marked by distinct chromatin signatures. Interestingly, four classes containing enrichment for repressive histone modifications appear to be locally heterochromatic sites and are enriched in quickly evolving regions of the genome. The utility of this approach in uncovering novel, functionally significant genomic elements will aid future efforts of genome annotation via chromatin modifications.",

We reexamine the entire notion of group signatures from a systems perspective and identify two new security requirements: leak-freedom and immediate-revocation, which are crucial for a large class of applications. We then present a new group signature scheme that achieves all identified properties. Our scheme is based on the so-called systems architecture approach. It is more efficient than the state-of-the-art and facilitates easy implementation. Moreover, it reflects the well-known separation-of-duty principle. Another benefit of our scheme is the obviated reliance on underlying anonymous communication channels, which are necessary in previous schemes.",

One of the populations, detected together with an Alfv\u00e9n wave, is field-aligned and can be seen as trapped within the wave. The other electron population is detected before the wave and consists of electrons which have left the wave at a point with a velocity higher than the local Alfv\u00e9n speed. In the paper, the electrons leaving wave are modeled for different density profiles and are compared with the observed data. Depending on the density profile, the model can produce the same energy-time and pitch angle-time dispersion that is observed in the Freja data. The conclusion of the paper is that the Alfv\u00e9n wave can explain the observed particle signatures. It is shown that the Alfv\u00e9n wave acceleration can create electron signatures similar to inverted-V structures. The density distribution along a flux tube has an important role in the type of particle signatures that can be detected at low altitudes.",

Finally, this paper proposes one secure and efficient batch verifying multiple signatures algorithm, which would speed up the verifying by at least 50%. Moreover this paper proves that the proposed batch verifying algorithm has the same security level as the individual verifying algorithm of DSA-type signature. The price of the computation efficiency is the length of the signature, which is between 672 and 1184 bits, rather than 320 bits of that of DSA. If the signature scheme is based on an elliptic curve, the length of the signature can be reduced notably.

The initial set of SIGs went through a sequential process of inspection and removal of SIGs, which did not meet the attributed statistical thresholds. The SIGs that were found significant represent protein sets with minimal or no overall sequence similarity besides the similarity found at the termini. These SIGs were archived and are presented at ProTeus. The SIGs are sorted by their strong correspondence to functional annotation from external databases such as GO. ProTeus provides rich search and visualization tools for evaluating the quality of different SIGs. A search option allows the identification of terminal signatures in new sequences.

Such devices tend to have a feature in common: limited computational capabilities and equally limited power, as most operate on batteries. This makes them ill-suited for public key signatures. This article explores practical and conceptual implications of using Server-Aided Signatures (SAS) for these devices. SAS is a signature method that relies on partially-trusted servers for generating (normally expensive) public key signatures for regular users. Although the primary goal is to aid small, resource-limited devices in signature generation, SAS also offers fast certificate revocation, signature causality and reliable timestamping. It also has some interesting features such as built-in attack detection for users and DoS resistance for servers. Our experimental results also validate the feasibility of deploying SAS on smart devices.",

We build linearly homomorphic structure-preserving signatures under simple assumptions and show that the primitive makes it possible to verify the calculations performed by a server on outsourced encrypted data (i.e., combining secure computation and authenticated computation to allow reliable and secure cloud storage and computation, while freeing the client from retaining cleartext storage).

Naturally emitted gamma rays by these materials, while abundant and detectable when unshielded, are low in energy and readily shielded. X-ray radiography is useful in detecting the possible presence of shielding material. Positive detection of concealed nuclear materials requires methods which unequivocally detect specific attributes of the materials. These methods typically involve active interrogation by penetrating radiation of neutrons, photons or other particles. Fortunately, nuclear materials, probed by various types of radiation, yield very unique and often strong signatures. Paramount among them are the detectable fission signatures, namely prompt neutrons and gamma rays, and delayed neutrons gamma rays. Other useful signatures are the nuclear states excited by neutrons, via inelastic scattering, or photons, via nuclear resonance fluorescence and absorption. The signatures are very different in magnitude, level of specificity, ease of excitation and detection, signal to background ratios, etc. For example, delayed neutrons are very unique to the fission process, but are scarce, have low energy, and hence are easily absorbed. Delayed gamma rays are more abundant but \"featureless\", and have a higher background from natural sources and more importantly, from activation due to the interrogation sources. The prompt fission signatures need to be measured in the presence of the much higher levels of probing radiation. This requires taking special measures to look for the signatures, sometimes leading to a significant sensitivity loss or a complete inability to detect them. Characteristic gamma rays induced in nuclear materials reflecting their nuclear structure, while rather unique, require very high intensity of interrogation radiation and very high resolution in energy and/or time. The - trade off of signatures, their means of stimulation, and methods of detection, will be reviewed.",

Recently, two distinct stromal signatures derived from a macrophage response (colony-stimulating factor 1, CSF1) and a fibroblastic response (desmoid-type fibromatosis, DTF) were identified in breast carcinomas and correlated with clinicopathologic features including outcome. In this study, we explored whether these stromal signatures also apply to endometrioid carcinomas and how their expression patterns correlated with morphologic changes. We studied the stromal signatures both by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in 98 primary endometrioid carcinomas with (87 cases) and without (11 cases) myometrial invasion as well as in the corresponding regional lymph nodes metatases of 9 myoinvasive tumors. Desmoplasia correlated positively with the DTF expression signature. Likewise, mononuclear infiltrates were found in the stroma of tumors expressing CSF1. Twenty-four out of eighty-seven (27%) myoinvasive endometrioid carcinomas were positive for the macrophage signature and thirteen out of eighty-seven (15%) expressed the fibroblast signature. Eleven additional cases were positive for both DTF and CSF1 signatures (11/87; 13%). However, over half of the cases (39/87; 45%) and the majority of the non-myoinvasive tumors (8/11; 73%) failed to express any of the two stromal signatures. The macrophage response (CSF1) was associated with higher tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, and PIK3CA mutations (P<0.05). There was a concordance in the expression of the CSF1 signature in the primary tumors and their corresponding lymph node metastases. This study is the first characterization of stromal signatures in endometrioid carcinomas. Our findings shed new light on the relationship between genetically different endometrioid carcinomas and various stromal responses. Preservation of the CSF1 macrophage stromal response in the metastases leds support to targeting the CSF1 pathway in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas.",

        "abstract": "Molecular signatures are a powerful approach to characterize novel small molecules and derivatized small molecule libraries. While new experimental techniques are being developed in diverse model systems, informatics approaches lag behind these exciting advances. We propose an analysis pipeline for signature based drug annotation. We develop an integrated strategy, utilizing supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies that are bridged by network based statistics. Using this approach we can: 1, predict new examples of drug mechanisms that we trained our model upon; 2, identify \"New\" mechanisms of action that do not belong to drug categories that our model was trained upon; and 3, update our training sets with these \"New\" mechanisms and accurately predict entirely distinct examples from these new categories. Thus, not only does our strategy provide statistical generalization but it also offers biological generalization. Additionally, we show that our approach is applicable to diverse types of data, and that distinct biological mechanisms characterize its resolution of categories across different data types. As particular examples, we find that our predictive resolution of drug mechanisms from mRNA expression studies relies upon the analog measurement of a cell stress-related transcriptional rheostat along with a transcriptional representation of cell cycle state; whereas, in contrast, drug mechanism resolution from functional RNAi studies rely upon more dichotomous (e.g., either enhances or inhibits) association with cell death states. We believe that our approach can facilitate molecular signature-based drug mechanism understanding from different technology platforms and across diverse biological phenomena.",

Each process leaves a characteristic imprint - a mutational signature - on the cancer genome, which is defined by the type of DNA damage and DNA repair processes that result in base substitutions, insertions and deletions or structural variations. With the advent of whole-genome sequencing, researchers are identifying an increasing array of these signatures. Mutational signatures can be used as a physiological readout of the biological history of a cancer and also have potential use for discerning ongoing mutational processes from historical ones, thus possibly revealing new targets for anticancer therapies.",

However, the mechanism of dedifferentiation remains obscure. Here we performed comparative transcriptome analyses during dedifferentiation in mature adipocytes (MAs) to identify the transcriptional signatures of multipotent dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells derived from MAs. Using microarray systems, we explored similarly expressed as well as significantly differentially expressed genes in MAs during dedifferentiation. This analysis revealed significant changes in gene expression during this process, including a significant reduction in expression of genes for lipid metabolism concomitantly with a significant increase in expression of genes for cell movement, cell migration, tissue developmental processes, cell growth, cell proliferation, cell morphogenesis, altered cell shape, and cell differentiation. Our observations indicate that the transcriptional signatures of DFAT cells derived from MAs are summarized in terms of a significant decrease in functional phenotype-related genes and a parallel increase in cell proliferation, altered cell morphology, and regulation of the differentiation of related genes. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in dedifferentiation may enable scientists to control and possibly alter the plasticity of the differentiated state, which may lead to benefits not only in stem cell research but also in regenerative medicine. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

An alternative approach to the pathogen-detection strategy is based on a comprehensive analysis of the host response to the infection. This review focuses on the value of transcriptome analyses of blood leukocytes for the diagnosis and management of patients with infectious diseases.\\n\\nRECENT FINDINGS: Initial studies showed that RNA from blood leukocytes of children with acute viral and bacterial infections carried pathogen-specific transcriptional signatures. Subsequently, transcriptional signatures for several other infections have been described and validated in humans with malaria, dengue, salmonella, melioidosis, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, tuberculosis, and HIV. In addition, transcriptome analyses represent an invaluable tool to understand disease pathogenesis and to objectively classify patients according to the clinical severity.\\n\\nSUMMARY: Microarray studies have been shown to be highly reproducible using different platforms, and in different patient populations, confirming the value of blood transcriptome analyses to study pathogen-specific host immune responses in the clinical setting. Combining the detection of the pathogen with a comprehensive assessment of the host immune response will provide a new understanding of the correlations between specific causative agents, the host response, and the clinical manifestations of the disease.",

The underlying processes contributing to these adverse reactions remain largely unknown, and it is likely that genetic factors play a role. Here, we estimate heritability and attempt to localize genetic factors influencing IgG antibody levels against food-derived antigens using an integrative genomics approach. IgG antibody levels were determined by ELISA in >1,300 Mexican Americans for the following food antigens: wheat gliadin; bovine casein; and two forms of bovine serum albumin (BSA-a and BSA-b). Pedigree-based variance components methods were used to estimate additive genetic heritability (h(2) ), perform genome-wide association analyses, and identify transcriptional signatures (based on 19,858 transcripts from peripheral blood lymphocytes). Heritability estimates were significant for all traits (0.15-0.53), and shared environment (based on shared residency among study participants) was significant for casein (0.09) and BSA-a (0.33). Genome-wide significant evidence of association was obtained only for antibody to gliadin (P = 8.57 x 10(-8) ), mapping to the human leukocyte antigen II region, with HLA-DRA and BTNL2 as the best candidate genes. Lack of association of known celiac disease risk alleles HLA-DQ2.5 and -DQ8 with antigliadin antibodies in the studied population suggests a separate genetic etiology. Significant transcriptional signatures were found for all IgG levels except BSA-b. These results demonstrate that individual genetic differences contribute to food antigen antibody measures in this population.

However, as the number of platforms to measure genome-wide gene expression proliferates, there is an increasing need to develop models that can be ported across diverse platforms. Because of the range of technologies that measure gene expression, the resulting signal values can vary greatly. To understand how this variation can affect the prediction of gene expression signatures, we have investigated the ability of gene expression signatures to predict pathway activation across Affymetrix and Illumina microarrays. We hybridized the same RNA samples to both platforms and compared the resultant gene expression readings, as well as the signature predictions. Using a new approach to map probes across platforms, we found that the genes in the signatures from the two platforms were highly similar, and that the predictions they generated were also strongly correlated. This demonstrates that our method can map probes from Affymetrix and Illumina microarrays, and that this mapping can be used to predict gene expression signatures across platforms.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose two kinds of semantic signatures for 3D object retrieval (3DOR). Humans are capable of describing an object using attribute terms like \u201csymmetric\u201d and \u201cflyable\u201d, or using its similarities to some known object classes. We convert such qualitative descriptions into attribute signature (AS) and reference set signature (RSS), respectively, and use them for 3DOR. We also show that AS and RSS can be understood as two different quantization methods of the same semantic space of human descriptions of objects. The advantages of the semantic signatures are threefold. First, they are much more compact than low-level shape features yet working with comparable retrieval accuracy. Therefore, the proposed semantic signatures require less storage space and computation cost in retrieval. Second, the high-level signatures are a good complement to low-level shape features. As a result, by incorporating the signatures we can improve the performance of state-of-the-art 3DOR methods by a large margin. To the best of our knowledge, we obtain the best results on two popular benchmarks. Third, the AS enables us to build a user-friendly interface, with which the user can trigger a search by simply clicking attribute bars instead of finding a 3D object as the query. This interface is of great significance in 3DOR considering the fact that while searching, the user usually does not have a 3D query at hand that is similar to his/her targeted objects in the database.",

Hence, workflow signatures can be electronic evidence useful for auditing, that is proving compliance of business processes against some regulatory requirements. Furthermore, signing keys can be used to grant permissions to perform tasks. Since the signing keys are issued on-the-fly, authorization to execute a task within a workflow can be controlled and granted dynamically at runtime.

Some observables are unlikely to be detected at interstellar distances, but some scenarios are likely to produce significant changes in atmospheric composition that could be detected serendipitously with next?generation telescopes.

To identify patterns that could be used for sequence-based monitoring of the antibody response to dengue, we examined antibody heavy-chain gene rearrangements in longitudinal peripheral blood samples from 60 dengue patients. Comparing signatures between acute dengue, postrecovery, and healthy samples, we found increased expansion of B cell clones in acute dengue patients, with higher overall clonality in secondary infection. Additionally, we observed consistent antibody sequence features in acute dengue in the highly variable major antigen-binding determinant, complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), with specific CDR3 sequences highly enriched in acute samples compared to postrecovery, healthy, or non-dengue samples. Dengue thus provides a striking example of a human viral infection where convergent immune signatures can be identified in multiple individuals.

Though Sun et al. claimed that these schemes are quite secure against the forward forgery, we find that they suffered from substitution attacks, by which the signer can backward/forward forge signatures and the time-stamping service can also forge signatures.

Nodes cannot use standard signature schemes to authenticate the modified packets: this would require knowledge of the original sender\u2019s signing key. Network coding signature schemes offer a cryptographic solution to this problem. Very roughly, such signatures allow signing vector spaces (or rather bases of such spaces), and these signatures are homomorphic: given signatures on a set of vectors it is possible to create signatures for any linear combination of these vectors. Designing such schemes is a difficult task, and the few existent constructions either rely on random oracles or are rather inefficient. In this paper we introduce two new network coding signature schemes. Both of our schemes are provably secure in the standard model, rely on standard assumptions, and are in the same efficiency class as previous solutions based on random oracles.",

        "abstract": "In the presented paper a new method of identification of canonical coherent scatterers in the quad-polarimetric SAR data are presented. The proposed method is based on the analysis of polarimetric signatures. The observed signatures are compared with the polarimetric signatures of four canonical objects: trihedral, dihedral and helix - right and left which represent basic scattering mechanisms: single bounce, double bounce and helix scattering. The polarimetric matrices are treated as vectors in a unitary space with a scalar product that generates the norm. A recognized object is classified to one of the four coherent classes by a Kohonen network. It is not trained in an iteration process but its weights are adjusted according to the given patterns. The network classification is supported by rules. The obtained maps of pixels that represent canonical objects are compared with a map of coherent scatterers which was obtained by using the polarimetric entropy approach. The developed method of canonical coherent scatterers identification based on the polarimetric signatures analysis allows us not only to identify precisely the canonical coherent scatterers but also to determine the type of scattering mechanism characteristic for each of them. Since the proposed method works on a single-look (non-averaged) SAR data, it does not cause any spatial nor spectral decrease of amount of information because averaging is not conducted. Moreover, the proposed method will enable us the identification of a type of scattering mechanism in the canonical coherent pixels. This is an improvement in comparison to the existing methods. The obtained results should be more precise because the full polarimetric information about the scatterers is used in the identification procedure. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

It is currently being validated using different bacterial groups, including Vibrio spp. In this study, the genomic analysis by Insignia was conducted on Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a halophilic gram-negative bacteria which constitutes a leading cause of seafood-borne disease. Insignia was used to identify 37 V. parahaemolyticus-specific signatures and to design PCR assays to validate the representative signature sequences by TaqMan essays. The 37 assays targeted loci distributed around the genome and detected genes coding for hypothetical proteins and for proteins involved in adhesion, starvation and virulence. A panel of V. parahaemolyticus environmental strains isolated from the North Adriatic Sea (Italy) and from the Black Sea (Georgia) was used to validate the selected signatures. The signature assays revealed both sensitive and specific and the method allowed a more accurate identification of the tested bacterial strains at the species level when compared to biochemical and PCR standard methods. Using Insignia, it was possible to distinguish two different groups among the strains previously identified as V. parahaemolyticus: most of the strains were included in a \"V. parahaemolyticus-like group\" showing nearly all of the signatures assayed while a small group of 10 strains contained only a few of the signatures tested. By sequencing the 16S rDNA of this latter group, it was confirmed that they were not V. parahaemolyticus but in fact belonged to other Vibrio species. No significant genome-wide differences were detected between the strains isolated in Italy and in Georgia though the very different geographical origin. ?? 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",

        "abstract": "3D computer graphics models and digitally-controlled manufacturing have come together to enable the design, visualization, simulation, and automated creation of complex 3D objects. In our work, we propose and implement a framework for designing computer graphics objects and digitally manufacturing them such that no adversary can make imitations or counterfeit copies of the physical object, even if the adversary has a large number of original copies of the object, knowledge of the original object design, and has manufacturing precision that is comparable to or superior to that of the legitimate creator of the object. Our approach is to design and embed a signature on the surface of the object which acts as a certificate of genuinity of the object. The signature is detectable by a signature-reading device, based on methods in computer graphics and computer vision, which contains some of the secret information that was used when marking the physical object. Further, the compromise of a signature-reading device by an adversary who is able to extract all its secrets, does not enable the adversary to create counterfeit objects that fool other readers, thereby still enabling reliable copy detection. We implemented a prototype of our scheme end-to-end, including the production of the physical object and the genuinity-testing device.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The integration of data from multiple genome-wide assays is essential for understanding dynamic spatio-temporal interactions within cells. Such integration, which leads to a more complete view of cellular processes, offers the opportunity to rationalize better the high amount of \"omics\" data freely available in several public databases.In particular, integration of microarray-derived transcriptome data with other high-throughput analyses (genomic and mutational analysis, promoter analysis) may allow us to unravel transcriptional regulatory networks under a variety of physio-pathological situations, such as the alteration in the cross-talk between signal transduction pathways in transformed cells. RESULTS: Here we sequentially apply web-based and statistical tools to a case study: the role of oncogenic activation of different signal transduction pathways in the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in the cAMP-PKA pathway. To this end, we first re-analyzed available genome-wide expression data for genes encoding proteins of the downstream branch of the PKA pathway in normal tissues and human tumor cell lines. Then, in order to identify mutation-dependent transcriptional signatures, we classified cancer cells as a function of their mutational state. The results of such procedure were used as a starting point to analyze the structure of PKA pathway-encoding genes promoters, leading to identification of specific combinations of transcription factor binding sites, which are neatly consistent with available experimental data and help to clarify the relation between gene expression, transcriptional factors and oncogenes in our case study. CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide, large-scale \"omics\" experimental technologies give different, complementary perspectives on the structure and regulatory properties of complex systems. Even the relatively simple, integrated workflow presented here offers opportunities not only for filtering data noise intrinsic in high throughput data, but also to progressively extract novel information that would have remained hidden otherwise. In fact we have been able to detect a strong transcriptional repression of genes encoding proteins of cAMP/PKA pathway in cancer cells of different genetic origins. The basic workflow presented herein may be easily extended by incorporating other tools and can be applied even by researchers with poor bioinformatics skills.",

Here we report that both cell types have greater intra- than inter-lineage transcriptional similarity. For CD8+ T-cells, genes with functional annotation relating to lymphocyte differentiation and function-including Granzyme B-are enriched among the genes that demonstrate greater intra-lineage expression level similarity. Analysis of gene expression covariance with matched measurements of time since division reveals cell type-specific transcriptional signatures that correspond with cell cycle progression. We believe that the ability to directly measure the effects of lineage and cell cycle-dependent transcriptional profiles of single cells will be broadly useful to fields where heterogeneous populations of cells display distinct clonal trajectories, including immunology, cancer, and developmental biology.",

In this paper, we present an automated mechanism for generating signa- tures for kernel data structures and show that these signatures are robust: attempts to evade the signature by modifying the structure contents will cause the OS to consider the object invalid. Using dynamic analysis, we profile the target data structure to determine commonly used fields, and we then fuzz those fields to determine which are essential to the correct operation of the OS. These fields form the basis of a signature for the data structure. In our exper- iments, our new signature matched the accuracy of existing scan- ners for traditional malware and found processes hidden with our prototype rootkit that all current signatures missed. Our techniques significantly increase the difficulty of hiding objects from signature scanning.",

Rank-ordering requires that the alternatives' subjective values are mentally represented at least on an ordinal scale. Because one alternative cannot be at the same time better and worse than another alternative, choices should satisfy transitivity (if alternative A is preferred over B, and B is preferred over C, A should be preferred over C). Yet, individuals often demonstrate striking violations of transitivity (preferring C over A). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the neural correlates of intransitive choices between gambles varying in magnitude and probability of financial gains. Behavioral intransitivities were common. They occurred because participants did not evaluate the gambles independently, but in comparison with the alternative gamble presented. Neural value signals in prefrontal and parietal cortex were not ordinal-scaled and transitive, but reflected fluctuations in the gambles' local, pairing-dependent preference-ranks. Detailed behavioral analysis of gamble preferences showed that, depending on the difference in the offered gambles' attributes, participants gave variable priority to magnitude or probability and thus shifted between preferring richer or safer gambles. The variable, context-dependent priority given to magnitude and probability was tracked by insula (magnitude) and posterior cingulate (probability). Their activation-balance may reflect the individual decision rules leading to intransitivities. Thus, the phenomenon of intransitivity is reflected in the organization of the neural systems involved in risky decision-making.",

The correlators show a strong signature of the singularity around horizon scales and decay at large boundary separation at different rates in different directions. More generally, the boundary evolution exhibits a process of particle creation similar to that in inflation. This leads us to conjecture that information on the quantum nature of cosmological singularities is encoded in long-wavelength features of the boundary wave function.",

This study intended to define a cytokine signature in atherosclerotic claudicants and to determine whether reduction in serum ferritin by phlebotomy influenced this pattern. Methods. Ninety-one subjects with peripheral vascular disease (PVD; mean age, 67 years) were recruited from the VA Cooperative Iron and Atherosclerosis Study (FeAST) testing the hypothesis that ferritin reduction to 25 ng/ml may ameliorate atherosclerosis. Cytokines TNF-a, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 were analyzed by enzyme amplified sensitivity assay (EASIA). Fasting iron and cholesterol panels, complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), uric acid, fibrinogen, glucose, and hemoglobin A1c levels were also quantified. Values were compared with \"healthy\" controls (n = 21; mean age, 56 years). After randomization of PVD to phlebotomy (intervention group [IG], n = 44) or control (nonintervention group [NG], n = 47), analyses were compared at 6 and 12 months using t test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, chi-square, and robust MM regression. Findings. Age, glucose, and hemoglobin A1c were higher in PVD compared with healthy controls (P < 0.01), whereas serum iron (P < 0.01) and percentage of transferrin saturation (P < 0.05) were lower. Tumor necrosis factor-?? (TNF-??; P < 0.05), IL-6 (P < 0.01), and CRP (P < 0.05) levels were higher in the PVD group, whereas IL-10 was lower (P < 0.01). At 6 months post phlebotomy, ferritin levels were reduced (P < 0.01), although ferritin levels were reduced less in smokers. IL-6 and fibrinogen, CRP and ferritin levels correlated positively. At 6 and 12 months, subjects with TNF-?? (n= 15) and IL-6 (n = 10) levels in the upper 25th percentile were reduced by phlebotomy. Interpretation. An inflammatory cytokine signature exists in atherosclerosis. Elevated levels of TNF-?? and IL-6, reportedly associated with recurrent and future myocardial infarction, were reduced by phlebotomy. The utility of the iron/inflammatory hypotheses will ultimately relate to clinical outcomes obtained prospectively by the FeAST trial. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The search for an effective screening test for the early detection of ovarian cancer has been intensive. Transvaginal ultrasound and the serum biomarker cancer antigen 125 (CA125) have been used clinically for decades in high-risk populations despite the lack of evidence demonstrating efficacy. More recently, new technologies have identified novel biomarker panels that attempt to improve on the performance of currently available modalities. Some of these tests report superior performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value) when compared with CA125 testing alone. Based on early encouraging studies, two commercial ovarian cancer screening products were recently marketed to the public and medical community. They were both withdrawn after concerns were raised by the US FDA and the scientific community regarding their validation and efficacy. There is no clear and established pipeline for the development and approval of these types of tests, and the FDA is working to fill in a large regulatory gap. In order to minimize the potential for public harm, an ovarian cancer screening test will need to be appropriately tested before being made available to the general population. In this review, we discuss the current state of biomarker development for the early detection of ovarian cancer and explore the continuing challenges to realizing this goal.",

        "abstract": "Conventional analyses distinguish between antimicrobial peptides by differences in amino acid sequence. Yet structural paradigms common to broader classes of these molecules have not been established. The current analyses examined the potential conservation of structural themes in antimicrobial peptides from evolutionarily diverse organisms. Using proteomics, an antimicrobial peptide signature was discovered to integrate stereospecific sequence patterns and a hallmark three-dimensional motif. This striking multidimensional signature is conserved among disulfide-containing antimicrobial peptides spanning biological kingdoms, and it transcends motifs previously limited to defined peptide subclasses. Experimental data validating this model enabled the identification of previously unrecognized antimicrobial activity in peptides of known identity. The multidimensional signature model provides a unifying structural theme in broad classes of antimicrobial peptides, will facilitate discovery of antimicrobial peptides as yet unknown, and offers insights into the evolution of molecular determinants in these and related host defense effector molecules.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, and its occurrence is associated with a number of environmental factors including ingestion of the dietary contaminant aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)). Research over the last 40 years has revealed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to be an excellent research model for study of AFB(1)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis; however, little is known about changes at the molecular level in trout tumors. We have developed a rainbow trout oligonucleotide array containing 1672 elements representing over 1400 genes of known or probable relevance to toxicology, comparative immunology, carcinogenesis, endocrinology, and stress physiology. In this study, we applied microarray technology to examine gene expression of AFB(1)-induced HCC in the rainbow trout tumor model. Carcinogenesis was initiated in trout embryos with 50 ppb AFB(1), and after 13 months control livers, tumors, and tumor-adjacent liver tissues were isolated from juvenile fish. Global gene expression was determined in histologically confirmed HCCs compared to noncancerous adjacent tissue and sham-initiated control liver. We observed distinct gene regulation patterns in HCC compared to noncancerous tissue including upregulation of genes important for cell cycle control, transcription, cytoskeletal formation, and the acute phase response and downregulation of genes involved in drug metabolism, lipid metabolism, and retinol metabolism. Interestingly, the expression profiles observed in trout HCC are similar to the transcriptional signatures found in human and rodent HCC, further supporting the validity of the model. Overall, these findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of AFB(1)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in trout and identify conserved genes important for carcinogenesis in species separated evolutionarily by more than 400 million years.",

In this paper we extend our previous work to address the problem of forensic printer identification, in which a document may or may not belong to a known set of printers. We propose to use a Euclidean distance based metric in a reduced feature space. The reduced feature space is obtained by using sequential feature selection and linear discriminant analysis.",

We study viable chameleon potentials consistent with a number of recent observational and experimental bounds. A novel chameleon field potential, motivated by f(R) gravity, is constructed where observable cosmological signatures are present both at the background evolution and in the growth-rate of the perturbations. We study the evolution of matter density perturbations on low redshifts for this potential and show that the growth index today gamma_0 can have significant dispersion on scales relevant for large scale structures. The values of gamma_0 can be even smaller than 0.2 with large variations of gamma on very low redshifts for the model parameters constrained by local gravity tests. This gives a possibility to clearly distinguish these chameleon models from the Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter model in future high-precision observations.",

Movement of the magnet in the from of a signature produces a temporal change in the magnetic field sensed by the embedded compass sensor, and can be used as a basis for authentication.

In this paper we present a solution that visually adds electronic signatures to documents. This is done in a way that allows for verifying the electronic signature from printouts.

We first compare two existing location distinction methods - one based on channel gains of multi-tonal probes, and another on channel impulse response. Next, we combine the benefits of these two methods to develop a new link measurement that we call the complex temporal signature. We use a 2.4 GHz link measurement data set, obtained from CRAWDAD [10], to evaluate the three location distinction methods. We find that the complex temporal signature method performs significantly better compared to the existing methods. We also perform new measurements to understand and model the temporal behavior of link signatures over time. We integrate our model in our location distinction mechanism and significantly reduce the probability of false alarms due to temporal variations of link signatures.",

We examine the phenomenology of such dimensions, compactified on a sphere $S^n$, $n \\geq 2$, and show that they possess distinct features and signatures. For example, unlike flat toroidal manifolds, spheres do not trivially allow fermion massless modes. Acceptable phenomenology then generically leads to \"non-universal\" extra dimensions with \"pole-localized\" 4-$d$ fermions; the bosonic fields can be in the bulk. Due to spherical symmetry, some Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of bulk gauge fields are either stable or extremely long-lived, depending on the graviton KK spectrum. Using precision electroweak data, we constrain the lightest gauge field KK modes to lie above $\\simeq 4$ TeV. We show that some of these KK resonances are within the reach of the LHC in several different production channels. The models we study can be uniquely identified by their collider signatures.",

Craters of all ages often have associated magnetic lows, showing that crustal fields were present even in pre-Nectarian times (greater than or similar to3.9 Ga). Magnetic lows extend to similar to2-4 crater radii, suggesting shock rather than thermal demagnetization. Younger craters are more likely to have clear and complete demagnetization signatures, suggesting that many older magnetic lows have been subsequently obscured. No size dependence is found for craters larger than 50 km in diameter, suggesting that demagnetization effects for all craters in this size range completely penetrate the magnetized layer. If shock demagnetization is responsible, this suggests an upper limit of similar to50 km for the depth of magnetization. Evidence of edge effects due to magnetization contrasts may show that strong far-side crustal fields are coherent at scales of similar to25 km.",

Several studies now demonstrate that gene expression patterns are associated with specific chromatin structures, and may therefore correlate with chromatin conformation signatures.

The expected expression differences in cytoskeletal, cell cycle, and adhesion genes confirmed the effective separation of the cell populations. Using DNA microarray chips, we comprehensively identify the differences in genes expressed in basal and differentiating layers of the epidermis, including the ECM components produced by the basal cells, the proteases in both the basal and suprabasal cells, and the lipid and steroid metabolism enzymes in suprabasal cells responsible for the permeability barrier. We identified the signaling pathways specific for the two populations and found two previously unknown paracrine and one juxtacrine signaling pathway operating between the basal and suprabasal cells. Furthermore, using specific expression signatures, we identified a new set of late differentiation markers and mapped their chromosomal loci, as well as a new set of melanocyte-specific markers.

        "abstract": "Gene expression patterns that distinguish clinically significant disease subclasses may not only play a prominent role in diagnosis, but also lead to the therapeutic strategies tailoring the treatment to the particular biology of each disease. Nevertheless, gene expression signatures derived through statistical feature-extraction procedures on population datasets have received rightful criticism, since they share few genes in common, even when derived from the same dataset. We focus on knowledge complementarities conveyed by two or more gene-expression signatures by means of embedded biological processes and pathways, which alternatively form a meta-knowledge platform of analysis towards a more global, robust and powerful solution. The main contribution of this work is the introduction and study of an approach for integrating different gene signatures based on the underlying biological knowledge, in an attempt to derive a unified global solution. It is further recognized that one group's signature does not perform well on another group's data, due to incompatibilities of microarray technologies and the experimental design. We assess this cross-platform aspect, showing that a unified solution derived on the basis of both statistical and biological validation may also help in overcoming such inconsistencies. Based on the proposed approach we derived a unified 69-gene signature, which outperforms significantly the performance of the initial signatures succeeding a 0.73 accuracy metric on 234 new patients with 81% sensitivity and 64% specificity. The same signature manages to reveal the two prognostic groups on an additional dataset of 286 new patients obtained through a different experimental protocol and microarray platform. Furthermore, it manages to derive two clusters in a dataset from a different platform, showing remarkable difference on both gene-expression and survival-prediction levels.

Genomewide analyses have also identified new chromosomal abnormalities associated with PC. The combination of both classes of data for the same sample cohort might provide better criteria for identifying relevant factors involved in neoplasia. Here we describe transcriptional signatures identifying distinct normal and tumoral prostate tissue compartments, and the inference and demonstration of a new, highly recurrent copy number gain on chromosome 17q25.3.\\n\\nMETHODS: We have applied transcriptional profiling to tumoral and non-tumoral prostate samples with relatively homogeneous epithelial representations as well as pure stromal tissue from peripheral prostate and cultured cell lines, followed by quantitative RT-PCR validations and immunohistochemical analysis. In addition, we have performed in silico colocalization analysis of co-regulated genes and validation by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).\\n\\nRESULTS: The transcriptomic analysis has allowed us to identify signatures corresponding to non-tumoral luminal and tumoral epithelium, basal epithelial cells, and prostate stromal tissue. In addition, in silico analysis of co-regulated expression of physically linked genes has allowed us to predict the occurrence of a copy number gain at chromosomal region 17q25.3. This computational inference was validated by fluorescent in situ hybridization, which showed gains in this region in over 65% of primary and metastatic tumoral samples.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our approach permits to directly link gene copy number variations with transcript co-regulation in association with neoplastic states. Therefore, transcriptomic studies of carefully selected samples can unveil new diagnostic markers and transcriptional signatures highly specific of PC, and lead to the discovery of novel genomic abnormalities that may provide additional insights into the causes and mechanisms of prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "We present a study of security in certificateless signatures.We divide potential adversaries according to their attack power, and for the first time, three new kinds of adversaries are introduced into certificateless signatures. They are Normal Adversary, Strong Adversary and Super Adversary (ordered by their attack power). Combined with the knownType IAdversary andType IIAdversary in certificateless cryptography, we then define the security of certificateless signatures in different attack scenarios. Our new security models, together with others in the literature, provide a clear definition of the security in certificateless signatures. Two concrete schemes with different security levels are also proposed in this paper. The first scheme, which is proven secure (in the random oracle model) against Normal Type I and Super Type II adversaries, has the shortest signature length among all known certificateless signature schemes. The second scheme is secure (in the random oracle model) against Super Type I and Type II adversaries. Compared with another scheme that has a similar security level, our second scheme requires less operational cost but a little longer signature length. Two server-aided verification protocols are also proposed to reduce the verification cost on the verifier.",

In this contribu- tion we will use a three dimensional electromagnetic model and a hydrological soil model to explore in more detail the relationships between GPR signatures, soil physical conditions and GPR detection performance. First, we will use the HYDRUS2D hydrological model to calculate a soil water content distribution around a land-mine. This model has been verified against measured soil water distributions in previous work. Next, we will use existing pedotransfer functions (e.g. Topp, Peplinski, Dobson, Ulaby) to convert the predicted soil water contents around the land-mines as well as known soil textures and bulk densities into soil parameters relevant to the electromagnetic behaviour of the soil medium. This will enable a mapping between the hydrological model and the electromagnetic GPR model. Using existing and new laboratory and field measurements from the land-mine test facilities at TNO-FEL we will make a first attempt to verify our modelling approach for the prediction of GPR signatures in field soils. Finally a detection algorithm is used to evaluate the GPR detection performance with respect to changing environmental soil conditions.",

Previous work on OFE considers the two parties as individuals and there is no formal study on the scenario where the two parties are two groups of users. In this paper, we formalize this new variant and call it a Group-oriented Optimistic Fair Exchange (GOFE). GOFE allows two users from two different groups to exchange signatures on behalf of their groups in a fair and anonymous manner. We formalize the notion by providing the first set of security models for GOFE, and show that it is closely related to Ambiguous OFE (AOFE) proposed by Huang et al. in Asiacrypt 2008. In particular, we propose a generic transformation which converts a GOFE to an AOFE. We also give an efficient and concrete GOFE construction and prove its security under the security models we defined. The security of the scheme relies on the decision linear assumption and strong Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Observations indicate that most massive galaxies contain a supermassive black hole, and theoretical studies suggest that when such galaxies have a major merger, the central black holes will form a binary and eventually coalesce. Here we discuss two spectral signatures of such binaries that may help distinguish them from ordinary active galactic nuclei. These signatures are expected when the mass ratio between the holes is not extreme and the system is fed by a circumbinary disk. One such signature is a notch in the thermal continuum that has been predicted by other authors; we point out that it should be accompanied by a spectral revival at shorter wavelengths and also discuss its dependence on binary properties such as mass, mass ratio, and separation. In particular, we note that the wavelength \u03bb n at which the notch occurs depends on these three parameters in such a way as to make the number of systems displaying these notches \\propto \\lambda _n^{16/3}; longer wavelength searches are therefore strongly favored. A second signature, first discussed here, is hard X-ray emission with a Wien-like spectrum at a characteristic temperature ~100 keV produced by Compton cooling of the shock generated when streams from the circumbinary disk hit the accretion disks around the individual black holes. We investigate the observability of both signatures. The hard X-ray signal may be particularly valuable as it can provide an indicator of black hole merger a few decades in advance of the event.",

With the server-aided verification protocol, some computational tasks for a signature verification are carried out by a server, which is generally untrusted; therefore, it is very useful for low-power computational devices. In this paper, we first define three security notions for server-aided verification signatures, i.e., existential unforgeability, security against collusion attacks and security against strong collusion attacks. The definition of existential unforgeability includes the existing security requirements in server-aided verification signatures. We then present, on the basis of existing signature schemes, two novel existentially unforgeable server-aided verification signature schemes. The existential unforgeability of our schemes can be formally proved both without the random oracle model and using the random oracle model. We also consider the security of server-aided verification signatures under collusion attacks and strong collusion attacks. For the first time, we formally define security models for capturing (strong) collusion attacks, and propose concrete server-aided verification signature schemes that are secure against such attacks. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Laser-based ultrasonic (LBU) measurement shows great promise for on-line monitoring of weld quality in tailor-welded blanks. Tailor-welded blanks are steel blanks made from plates of differing thickness and/or properties butt-welded together; they are used in automobile manufacturing to produce body, frame, and closure panels. LBU uses a pulsed laser to generate the ultrasound and a continuous wave (CW) laser interferometer to detect the ultrasound at the point of interrogation to perform ultrasonic inspection. LBU enables in-process measurements since there is no sensor contact or near-contact with the workpiece. The authors are using laser-generated plate (Lamb) waves to propagate from one plate into the weld nugget as a means of detecting defects. A persistent problem in the analysis of Lamb wave signatures in experimental data is the fact that several different modes appear simultaneously in the signal. The modes overlap in both frequency and time domains. Attempts to separate the overlapping Lamb wave signatures by conventional signal processing methods have been unsatisfactory. This paper reports an exciting alternative to conventional methods. Severely overlapping Lamb waves are found to be readily separable by Bayesian parameter estimation. The authors have used a linear-chirped Gaussian-windowed sinusoid as a model of the Lamb wave mode. For signatures captured in laser ultrasonic data in tailor-welded blanks, this has led to straightforward separation of multiple modes. Furthermore, the resulting parameter sets for the different modes reveal crucial characterizing features of the properties of the workpiece.",

Soon after this it became clear that such events are not exceptional, but a large portion of the earthward plasma flow in the inner part of the magnetospheric tail is organised in this bursty, intermittent mode. Since the Earth's magnetosphere is connected by highly conducting magnetic field lines with its ionosphere, the next logical step was the search for the ionospheric signatures of BBFs. We review the results obtained so far in this young field of Space Physics, in terms of the auroral and ground magnetic signatures caused by BBFs, the particle precipitation to the ionosphere, as well as of the ionospheric electrodynamics of the processes associated with the BBFs in the magnetosphere. Finally, we briefly review some models of ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling with respect to their ability to explain the ionospheric signatures observed.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacoresistance to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is a major clinical problem in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). Levetiracetam (LEV) represents a unique type of AED as its high-affinity binding site, the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, is a component of the presynaptic release machinery. LEV often leads to full seizure control even in previously refractory patients. However, approximately 30% of LEV-treated mTLE patients do not show a significant response to LEV from the beginning of the pharmacotherapy and are therefore classified as a priori non-responders. This unexpected phenomenon prompted genetic studies, which failed to characterize responsible SV2A sequence alterations.Here, we followed a different approach to study the mechanisms of LEV pharmacoresistance by screening for mRNA signatures specifically expressed in LEV a priori non-responders in epileptic brain tissue and subsequent promoter analyses of highly altered transcripts. To this end, we have used our unique access to analyze hippocampal tissue from pharmacoresistant TLE patients who underwent epilepsy surgery for seizure control (n. = 53) stratified according to a priori LEV responders versus patients with impaired LEV-response. Transcriptome (Illumina platform) and subsequent multimodal cluster analyses uncovered strikingly abundant synapse-associated molecule mRNA signatures in LEV a priori non-responders. Subsequent promoter characterization revealed accumulation of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9305614 G-allele in a priori non-responders to correlate to abundant mRNAs of phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (PIGP), i.e. a key component of the Wnt-signaling pathway. By luciferase assays, we observed significantly stronger activation by the LBP-1 transcription factor of the rs9305614 G-allele PIGP promoter. The present data suggest an abundance of transcripts encoding for key synaptic components in the hippocampi of LEV a priori non-responder mTLE patients, which for PIGP as proof of concept can be explained by a particular promoter variant. Our data argue for epigenetic factors predisposing for a priori LEV pharmacoresistance by transcriptional 'overexposure of targets'. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sequence signatures, as defined by the frequencies of k-tuples (or k-mers, k-grams), have been used extensively to compare genomic sequences of individual organisms, to identify cis-regulatory modules, and to study the evolution of regulatory sequences. Recently many next-generation sequencing (NGS) read data sets of metagenomic samples from a variety of different environments have been generated. The assembly of these reads can be difficult and analysis methods based on mapping reads to genes or pathways are also restricted by the availability and completeness of existing databases. Sequence-signature-based methods, however, do not need the complete genomes or existing databases and thus, can potentially be very useful for the comparison of metagenomic samples using NGS read data. Still, the applications of sequence signature methods for the comparison of metagenomic samples have not been well studied.\\n\\nRESULTS: We studied several dissimilarity measures, including d2, d2* and d2S recently developed from our group, a measure (hereinafter noted as Hao) used in CVTree developed from Hao's group (Qi et al., 2004), measures based on relative di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide frequencies as in Willner et al. (2009), as well as standard lp measures between the frequency vectors, for the comparison of metagenomic samples using sequence signatures. We compared their performance using a series of extensive simulations and three real next-generation sequencing (NGS) metagenomic datasets: 39 fecal samples from 33 mammalian host species, 56 marine samples across the world, and 13 fecal samples from human individuals. Results showed that the dissimilarity measure d2S can achieve superior performance when comparing metagenomic samples by clustering them into different groups as well as recovering environmental gradients affecting microbial samples. New insights into the environmental factors affecting microbial compositions in metagenomic samples are obtained through the analyses. Our results show that sequence signatures of the mammalian gut are closely associated with diet and gut physiology of the mammals, and that sequence signatures of marine communities are closely related to location and temperature.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Sequence signatures can successfully reveal major group and gradient relationships among metagenomic samples from NGS reads without alignment to reference databases. The d2S dissimilarity measure is a good choice in all application scenarios. The optimal choice of tuple size depends on sequencing depth, but it is quite robust within a range of choices for moderate sequencing depths.",

Using a plane-wave analysis, we estimate the effects of a neutron superfluid in the elastic crust region. We demonstrate that the superfluid imprint is likely to be more significant than the effects of the crustal magnetic field. We also consider the region immediately beneath the crust, where superfluid neutrons are thought to coexist with a type II proton superconductor. Since the magnetic field in the latter is carried by an array of fluxtubes, the dynamics of this region differ from standard magnetohydrodynamics. We show that the presence of the neutron superfluid (again) leaves a clear imprint on the oscillations of the system. Taken together, our estimates show that the superfluid components cannot be ignored in efforts to carry out `magnetar seismology'. This increases the level of complexity of the modelling problem, but also points to the possibility of using observations to probe the superfluid nature of supranuclear matter.",

While the effect of two coalescing eigenfunctions on cyclic parameter variation is well investigated, little attention has hitherto been paid to the effect of more than two coalescing eigenfunctions. Here a characterisation of behaviours of symmetric Hamiltonians with three coalescing eigenfunctions is presented, using perturbation theory for non- Hermitian operators.

        "abstract": "Recognizing classes of objects from their shape is an unsolved problem in machine vision that entails the ability of a computer system to represent and generalize complex geometrical information on the basis of a finite amount of prior data. A practical approach to this problem is particularly difficult to implement, not only because the shape variability of relevant object classes is generally large, but also because standard sensing devices used to capture the real world only provide a partial view of a scene, so there is partial information pertaining to the objects of interest. In this work, we develop an algorithmic framework for recognizing classes of deformable shapes from range data. The basic idea of our component-based approach is to generalize existing surface representations that have proven effective in recognizing specific 3D objects to the problem of object classes using our newly introduced symbolic-signature representation that is robust to deformations, as opposed to a numeric representation that is often tied to a specific shape. Based on this approach, we present a system that is capable of recognizing and classifying a variety of object shape classes from range data. We demonstrate our system in a series of large-scale experiments that were motivated by specific applications in scene analysis and medical diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Verbs and nouns are fundamental units of language, but their neural instantiation remains poorly understood. Neuropsychological research has shown that nouns and verbs can be damaged independently of each other, and neuroimaging research has found that several brain regions respond differentially to the two word classes. However, the semantic-lexical properties of verbs and nouns that drive these effects remain unknown. Here we show that the most likely candidate is predication: a core lexical feature involved in binding constituent arguments (boy, candies) into a unified syntactic-semantic structure expressing a proposition (the boy likes the candies). We used functional neuroimaging to test whether the intrinsic \"predication-building\" function of verbs is what drives the verb-noun distinction in the brain. We first identified verb-preferring regions with a localizer experiment including verbs and nouns. Then, we examined whether these regions are sensitive to transitivity--an index measuring its tendency to select for a direct object. Transitivity is a verb-specific property lying at the core of its predication function. Neural activity in the left posterior middle temporal and inferior frontal gyri correlates with transitivity, indicating sensitivity to predication. This represents the first evidence that grammatical class preference in the brain is driven by a word's function to build predication structures.",

This requires scattering off self-generated small length-scale magnetic fluctuations. The radiative signature of this first-order Fermi acceleration mechanism is important for models of both the prompt and afterglow emission in gamma-ray bursts and depends on the strength parameter \"a\" of the fluctuations. For electrons (and positrons), acceleration saturates when the radiative losses produced by the scattering cannot be compensated by the energy gained on crossing the shock. We show that this sets an upper limit on both the electron Lorentz factor and on the energy of the photons radiated during the scattering process. This rules out \"jitter\" radiation on self-excited fluctuations with a < 1 as a source of gamma-rays, although high-energy photons might still be produced when the jitter photons are upscattered in an analog of the synchrotron self-Compton process. In fluctuations with a > 1, radiation is generated by the standard synchrotron mechanism, and the maximum photon energy rises linearly with a, until saturating at approximately 70 MeV.",

We explore the potential of using the wavelet transform maximum modulus (WTMM) method to characterize the multiscale structure of the observed time series and of simulated data generated by the stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemic model. The singularity spectra of the observed time series suggest that each disease is characterized by a unique multifractal signature, which distinguishes that particular disease from the others. The wavelet scaling functions confirm that the time series of measles, rubella and whooping cough are clearly multifractal, while chicken pox has a more monofractal structure in time. The stochastic SEIR epidemic model is unable to reproduce the qualitative singularity structure of the reported incidence data: it is too smooth and does not appear to have a multifractal singularity structure. The precise reasons for the failure of the SEIR epidemic model to reproduce the correct multiscale structure of the reported incidence data remain unclear.",

        "abstract": "The realization that electron localization in disordered systems (Anderson localization) is ultimately a wave phenomenon has led to the suggestion that photons could be similarly localized by disorder. This conjecture attracted wide interest because the differences between photons and electrons--in their interactions, spin statistics, and methods of injection and detection--may open a new realm of optical and microwave phenomena, and allow a detailed study of the Anderson localization transition undisturbed by the Coulomb interaction. To date, claims of three-dimensional photon localization have been based on observations of the exponential decay of the electromagnetic wave as it propagates through the disordered medium. But these reports have come under close scrutiny because of the possibility that the decay observed may be due to residual absorption, and because absorption itself may suppress localization. Here we show that the extent of photon localization can be determined by a different approach--measurement of the relative size of fluctuations of certain transmission quantities. The variance of relative fluctuations accurately reflects the extent of localization, even in the presence of absorption. Using this approach, we demonstrate photon localization in both weakly and strongly scattering quasi-one-dimensional dielectric samples and in periodic metallic wire meshes containing metallic scatterers, while ruling it out in three-dimensional mixtures of aluminium spheres.",

The relative abundances of elements in the surviving primitive stars reflect the masses of the first stars, because the pathways of nucleosynthesis are quite sensitive to stellar masses. Several models have been suggested to explain the origin of the abundance pattern of the giant star HE0107-5240, which hitherto exhibited the highest deficiency of heavy elements known. Here we report the discovery of HE1327-2326, a subgiant or main-sequence star with an iron abundance about a factor of two lower than that of HE0107-5240. Both stars show extreme overabundances of carbon and nitrogen with respect to iron, suggesting a similar origin of the abundance patterns. The unexpectedly low Li and high Sr abundances of HE1327-2326, however, challenge existing theoretical understanding: no model predicts the high Sr abundance or provides a Li depletion mechanism consistent with data available for the most metal-poor stars.",

We propose as an alternative to abstract the geographic semantics of a document as a geographic signature, which is a list of maximally disambiguated geographic references found in a document. A signature can be used in multiple {GIR} applications, such as in building a geographic index for a document collection.

Signature vectors extracted from a graph are projected onto a low-dimensional scatterplot through the use of scaling. The resultant scatterplot, which reflects the similarities of the vectors, allows analysts to examine the graph structures and their corresponding real-life interpretations through repeated use of brushing and linking between the two visualizations. The interpretation of the graph structures is based on the outcomes of multiple participatory analysis sessions with intelligence analysts conducted by the authors at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The paper first uses three public domain data sets with either well-known or obvious features to explain the rationale of our design and illustrate its results. More advanced examples are then used in a customized usability study to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. The study results reveal not only the limitations and weaknesses of the traditional approach based solely on graph visualization, but also the advantages and strengths of our signature-guided approach presented in the paper.",

Our interest is in regions of parameter space that can realize electroweak baryogenesis. We do so in a simplified framework in which a single Higgs field couples to new scalar fields charged under SU(3)_c by way of the Higgs portal. Such new scalars can make the electroweak phase transition more strongly first-order, while contributing to the effective Higgs boson couplings to gluons and photons through loop effects. For Higgs boson masses in the range 115 GeV < m_h < 130 GeV, whenever the phase transition becomes strong enough for successful electroweak baryogenesis, we find that Higgs boson properties are modified by an amount observable by the LHC. We also discuss the baryogenesis window of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), which appears to be under tension. Furthermore, we argue that the discovery of a Higgs boson with standard model-like couplings to gluons and photons will rule out electroweak baryogenesis in the MSSM.",

Field observations of 56 detonation events included a set of aircraft delivered ordinance and a series of static ground detonations for a variety of bomb sizes, types and environmental conditions. The emission is well represented by a gray body with continuously decreasing temperature and characteristic decay times of 1-4 s, providing only limited variability with detonation conditions. However, the fireball size times the emissivity as a function of time can be determined from the spectra without imaging and provides a more sensitive signature. The degree of temporal overlap as a function of frequency for a pair of detonation events provides a very sensitive discriminator for explosion conditions. The temporal overlap decreases with increasing emission frequency for all the observed events, indicating more information content at higher frequencies. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We apply our Composition Theorem to produce a bipartite graph on 10 vertices that is 6-Pfaffian but not 4-Pfaffian.

We find that storm enhanced density (SED) and plumes of greatly-elevated TEC are associated with the erosion of the outer plasmasphere by strong sub-auroral polarization electric fields. The SED/TEC plumes identified at low altitude map closely onto the magnetospheric determination of the boundaries of the plasmapause and plasmaspheric tail determined by EUV imaging from the IMAGE spacecraft. Characteristics of the SED/TEC plumes/tails for the March 31, 2001 event are: TEC ~ 100 TECu; F-region sunward velocity ~1000 m/s; sunward flux ~5*1024 ions s-1 total transport to dayside magnetopause/merging region (3-hr event) ~5*1028 ions.",

The obvious application is where the signatures represent items of value, for example, an electronic check or airline ticket. The protocol can also be adapted to exchange encrypted data. It relies on a trusted third party, but is \"optimistic,\" in that the third party is only needed in cases where one player crashes or attempts to cheat. A key feature of our protocol is that a player can always force a timely and fair termination, without the cooperation of the other player, even in a completely asynchronous network. A specialization of our protocol can be used for contract signing; this specialization is not only more efficient, but also has the important property that the third party can be held accountable for its actions: if it ever cheats, this can be detected and proven.",

These show deviations from the conventional Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer form, resulting in characteristic signatures in the partial tunneling spectra. The total (measurable) tunneling spectra are calculated considering the k selection in the tunneling process. Due to the thermal smearing, the relevant spectral signatures may not be resolved in superconductor-insulator-normal-metal tunneling while they are clearly revealed in superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) geometry. As an example, the excitation spectrum of 2H-NbSe(2) is considered in the framework of the developed tunneling model. A remarkable agreement obtained with the experimental SIS data suggests the material to be a two-band superconductor rather than an anisotropic one.",

Under our framework, the feature matching is not only robust against affine distortion but also a considerable range of 3D viewpoint changes for non-planar surfaces. When compared to matching approaches based on existing local features, our method shows improved results with low-texture scenes. Moreover, extensive experiments validate that our method has advantages in matching structured non-planar scenes under large viewpoint changes and illumination variations.",

Mass maps were obtained from optical and near-infrared imaging, by comparing with a Monte Carlo library of stellar population synthesis models that allowed us to obtain the mass-to-light ratio in the J-band, (M/L)_J, as a function of (g-i) vs. (i-J) color. The selected spirals were analyzed with Fourier methods in search for other signatures of long-lived modes related to the gradients, such as the gradient divergence towards corotation, and the behavior of the phase angle of the two-armed spiral in different wavebands, as expected from theory. The results show additional signatures of long-lived spirals in at least 50% of the objects.",

This class of models is characterized by a visible sector (e.g. the MSSM or any extension) coupled by gauge interactions to more than one SUSY breaking sector. The spectrum consists of a light gravitino LSP, behaving as a goldstino, and a number of neutral fermions (the pseudo-goldstini) with a mass between that of the LSP and that of the lightest particle of the observable sector (LOSP). We consider a situation where the LOSP is the lightest neutralino and there is only one pseudo-goldstino of a mass of O(100) GeV. The coupling of the LOSP to the pseudo-goldstino can be enhanced with respect to those of the gravitino giving rise to characteristic signatures. We show that the decay modes of the LOSP into a photon or Z-boson and a pseudo-goldstino can be significant. We then proceed to analyze (pseudo)-goldstini production at future e+ e- linear colliders and at the LHC. Compared to standard gauge mediation the photon spectrum is softer and more structured.",

Under well-controlled experimental conditions, however, these fluctuations are not random but instead reflect the interplay between intra-cellular networks underlying bacterial growth and the growth environment. Therefore, these fluctuations could be considered quantitative phenotypes of the bacteria under a specific growth condition. Here, we present a method to identify \"phenotypic signatures\" by time-frequency analysis of unbalanced growth curves measured with high temporal resolution. The signatures are then applied to differentiate amongst different bacterial strains or the same strain under different growth conditions, and to identify the essential architecture of the gene network underlying the observed growth dynamics. Our method has implications for both basic understanding of bacterial physiology and for the classification of bacterial strains.",

However, modeling aging in differentiated human neurons has proved challenging. We generated neurons from human donors across a broad range of ages, either by iPSC-based reprogramming and differentiation or by direct conversion into induced neurons (iNs). While iPSCs and derived neurons did not retain aging-associated gene signatures, iNs displayed age-specific transcriptional profiles and revealed age-associated decreases in the nuclear transport receptor RanBP17. We detected an age-dependent loss of nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization (NCC) in donor fibroblasts and corresponding iNs and found that reduced RanBP17 impaired NCC in young cells, while iPSC rejuvenation restored NCC in aged cells. These results show that iNs retain important aging-related signatures, thus allowing modeling of the aging process in vitro, and they identify impaired NCC as an important factor in human aging.",

Here, we use the genomes of 12 Drosophila species for the de novo discovery of functional elements in the fly. Each type of functional element shows characteristic patterns of change, or 'evolutionary signatures', dictated by its precise selective constraints. Such signatures enable recognition of new protein-coding genes and exons, spurious and incorrect gene annotations, and numerous unusual gene structures, including abundant stop-codon readthrough. Similarly, we predict non-protein-coding RNA genes and structures, and new microRNA (miRNA) genes. We provide evidence of miRNA processing and functionality from both hairpin arms and both DNA strands. We identify several classes of pre- and post-transcriptional regulatory motifs, and predict individual motif instances with high confidence. We also study how discovery power scales with the divergence and number of species compared, and we provide general guidelines for comparative studies.",

        "abstract": "Aeromagnetic surveys are a useful tool in the detection and analysis of terrestrial impact structures. Although gravity anomalies provide clearer and simpler signatures of impact craters, large regional-scale aeromagnetic surveys are more widely available. A combination of many factors, such as the nature of the target rocks, the impact related magnetization, and effects of crater fill and post-impact cover results in a great variation of magnetic signatures in the terrestrial impact craters. In crystal line basement targets, the most common signature of a complex impact structure is a magnetic low with a central peak or ring uplift magnetic anomaly. Contributions to the magnetic signature include demagnetization, shock remagnetization, and thermal and chemical remanent magnetization effects. Impact craters in sedimentary targets usually are of small magnetic amplitude, depending on the lithology. The origin of the magnetic signatures in sedimentary targets is not well understood. Enhancement of magnetic signatures of terrestrial impact structures using filtering techniques is an important part of detection and analysis. Derivative and derivative-based (such as sunshading) techniques, along with separation filtering, are probably the most used methods. Here we present our new developments of algorithms for fractional order derivatives and circular shaded relief that have dramatically improved filter results. The fractional derivative order can be varied to optimize the separation of the impact magnetic signature. Given a chosen center location, the circular shaded relief algorithm treats all directions equally, thus preventing fade-out of features subparallel to the shading direction evident in conventional shaded relief. Unlike Hough transform based algorithms, the circular sunshading method is not sensitive to the radius of the circular feature being searched for, and no radius parameter is specified during the data processing. We illustrate the new fractional derivative and circular shaded relief algorithms using selected Australian and Canadian impact crater data sets involving both crystalline basement and sedimentary targets.",

        "abstract": "A person's behavior across situations can be characterized in terms of a mean level (disposition), a dispersion within the person around that mean level, and a stable organization to the pattern of dispersion (signature). The authors' goals were to examine the structure and stability of behavior, both at the level of behavioral dispositions and at the level of behavioral signatures. Participants completed event-contingent records of their social interactions over a 20-day period. Participants recorded their own social behavior (dominant, agreeable, submissive, quarrelsome) in 4 situations defined by the perceived social behavior of their primary interaction partners (agreeable\u2013 dominant, agreeable\u2013submissive, quarrelsome\u2013 submissive, quarrelsome\u2013 dominant). Findings suggest that (a) once the normative influences of situa-tions on behavior are removed, the remaining behavioral variation reflects both consistent cross-situational differences between individuals (dispositions) and consistent situational differences within individuals (signatures); (b) both dispositions and signatures display a 2-dimensional structure in adherence to the interpersonal circle; and (c) both dispositions and signatures constitute stable aspects of personality functioning. Two prominent theoretical approaches to the study of the indi-vidual are often perceived as competing and potentially irrecon-cilable. On one side, researchers have argued that individual dif-ferences in behavior comprise a small set of pervasive cross-situational consistencies. On the other side, researchers have argued that such behavioral consistencies conceal meaningful cross-situational patterns of variability. Historically, the field has sustained long periods during which each approach progressed in relative isolation, punctuated sporadically by volatile periods of debate, which led Mischel and Shoda (1998) to argue that re-searchers must decide either \" to carve an overarching framework that integrates the two disciplines to pursue both goals within one field, or to show that such an integration is impossible \" (p. 232). The present research represents preliminary steps toward demon-strating that an integration of these two approaches is possible. We propose that each person's behavior across situations can be con-ceptualized in terms of a stable mean level (disposition) and a stable organization around that mean level (signature).",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA levels. Their function in cancer has been studied by high-throughput methods generating valuable sources of public information. Thus, miRNA signatures predicting cancer clinical outcomes are emerging. An important step to propose miRNA-based biomarkers before clinical validation is their evaluation in independent cohorts. Although it can be carried out using public data, such task is time-consuming and requires a specialized analysis. Therefore, to aid and simplify the evaluation of prognostic miRNA signatures in cancer, we developed SurvMicro, a free and easy-to-use web tool that assesses miRNA signatures from publicly available miRNA profiles using multivariate survival analysis. SurvMicro is composed of a wide and updated database of >40 cohorts in different tissues and a web tool where survival analysis can be done in minutes. We presented evaluations to portray the straightforward functionality of SurvMicro in liver and lung cancer. To our knowledge, SurvMicro is the only bioinformatic tool that aids the evaluation of multivariate prognostic miRNA signatures in cancer.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SurvMicro and its tutorial are freely available at http://bioinformatica.mty.itesm.mx/SurvMicro.",

        "abstract": "Genomes have both deterministic and random aspects, with the underlying DNA sequences exhibiting features at numerous scales, from codons and cis-elements through genes and on to regions of conserved or divergent gene order. The DNA Words program aims to identify mathematical structures that characterize genomes at multiple scales. The focus of this work is the fine structure of genomic sequences, the manner in which short nucleotide sequences fit together to comprise the genome as an abstract sequence, within a graph-theoretic setting. A DNA word graph is a generalization of a de Bruijn graph that records the occurrence counts of node and edges in a genomic sequence. A DNA word graph can be derived from a genomic sequence generated by a finite Markov chain or a subsequence of a sequenced genome. Both theoretically and empirically, DNA word graphs give rise to genomic signatures. Several genomic signatures are derived from the structure of a DNA word graph, including an information-rich and visually appealing genomic bar code. Application of genomic signatures to several genomes demonstrate their practical value in identifying and distinguishing genomic sequences.",

        "abstract": "An experimental study has been conducted to determine signatures that will describe the onset of self-sustained downward smolder. The fuel used is polyurethane foam, mainly due to its common occurrence in households and thus its importance in fire scenarios linked with smoldering combustion. The polyurethane foam is subject to a constant heat flux imposed by a cone heater for different time periods. Temperature and mass loss rate measurements together with visual observations serve to determine specific events that can be considered signatures of the onset of a self-sustained smolder reaction. Three stages were identified in the ignition process: (i) the warm-up stage (ii) the unsteady smolder stage, both controlled by external heat flux, and (iii) the self-sustained smoldering stage controlled by the heat generation by the smolder reaction. Each stage is characterized by a change in the temperature and mass loss rate histories (signatures). It was observed that self-sustained smolder could only occur in an external heat flux window corresponding to 6.1 kW/m2<q???e<6.8 kW/m2. A minimum duration of exposure, weakly dependent on the external heat flux, was also found. These observations agree well with previously reported work. A minimum temperature (TC???575 K) was found necessary for sustained smoldering combustion.",

This n-tuple, which depends only on the structure of the system and not on the distribution of the component lifetimes, is a very useful tool in the theoretical analysis of coherent systems.It was shown in two independent recent papers how the structural signature of a system partitioned into two disjoint modules can be computed from the signatures of these modules. In this work we consider the general case of a system partitioned into an arbitrary number of disjoint modules organized in an arbitrary way and we provide a general formula for the signature of the system in terms of the signatures of the modules.The concept of signature was recently extended to the general case of semicoherent systems whose components may have dependent lifetimes. The same definition for the n-tuple gives rise to the probability signature, which may depend on both the structure of the system and the probability distribution of the component lifetimes. In this general setting, we show how under a natural condition on the distribution of the lifetimes, the probability signature of the system can be expressed in terms of the probability signatures of the modules. We finally discuss a few situations where this condition holds in the non-i.i.d. and nonexchangeable cases and provide some applications of the main results.",

        "abstract": "Digital representations are widely used for audiovisual content, enabling the creation of large online repositories of video, allowing access such as video on demand. However, the ease of copying and distribution of digital video makes piracy a growing concern for content owners. We investigate methods for identifying coderivative video content--that is, video clips that are derived from the same original source. By using dynamic programming to identify regions of similarity in video signatures, it is possible to efficiently and accurately identify coderivatives, even when these regions constitute only a small section of the clip being searched. We propose four new methods for producing compact video signatures, based on the way in which the video changes over time. The intuition is that such properties are likely to be preserved even when the video is badly degraded. We demonstrate that these signatures are insensitive to dramatic changes in video bitrate and resolution, two parameters that are often altered when reencoding. In the presence of mild degradations, our methods can accurately identify copies of clips that are as short as 5 s within a dataset 140 min long. These methods are much faster than previously proposed techniques; using a more compact signature, this query can be completed in a few milliseconds.",

Chromatin remodeling proteins have been shown to alter local chromatin structure and facilitate recruitment of essential factors required for transcription. Brahma-related gene-1 (BRG1), the central catalytic subunit of numerous chromatin-modifying enzymatic complexes, uses the energy derived from ATP-hydrolysis to disrupt the chromatin architecture of target promoters. In this review, we examine BRG1 as a major coregulator of transcription. BRG1 has been implicated in the activation and repression of gene expression through the modulation of chromatin in various tissues and physiological conditions. Outstanding examples are studies demonstrating that BRG1 is a necessary component for nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional activation. The remodeling protein is also associated with transcriptional corepressor complexes which recruit remodeling activity to target promoters for gene silencing. Taken together, BRG1 appears to be a critical modulator of transcriptional regulation in cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, replication, DNA repair and recombination.",

Methods and results: Herein, we studied the molecular etiology of cardiac defects in Nos3<sup>-/-</sup> mice via transcriptional analysis of stage-matched embryonic tissues and iPSC-derived cells. In vitro comparisons of differentiated cells were calibrated to in utero benchmarks of health and disease. Integrated systems biology analysis of WT and Nos3<sup>-/-</sup> transcriptional profiles revealed 50% concordant expression patterns between in utero embryonic tissues and ex vivo iPSC-derived cells. In particular, up-regulation of glucose metabolism (p-value=3.95??10<sup>-12</sup>) and down-regulation of fatty acid metabolism (p-value=6.71??10<sup>-12</sup>) highlight a bioenergetic signature of early Nos3 deficiency during cardiogenesis that can be recapitulated in iPSC-derived differentiated cells. Conclusions: The in vitro concordance of early Nos3<sup>-/-</sup> disease signatures supports the utility of iPSCs as a cellular model of developmental heart defects. Moreover, this study supports the use of iPSCs as a platform to pinpoint initial stages of congenital cardiac pathogenesis.",

To address this, we developed a statistical method, comparative metaprofiling, which identifies and assesses the intersection of multiple gene expression signatures from a diverse collection of microarray data sets. We collected and analyzed 40 published cancer microarray data sets, comprising 38 million gene expression measurements from >3,700 cancer samples. From this, we characterized a common transcriptional profile that is universally activated in most cancer types relative to the normal tissues from which they arose, likely reflecting essential transcriptional features of neoplastic transformation. In addition, we characterized a transcriptional profile that is commonly activated in various types of undifferentiated cancer, suggesting common molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells progress and avoid differentiation. Finally, we validated these transcriptional profiles on independent data sets. ",

In addition, small molecules that activate p53 through established mechanisms of action are proving invaluable tools for basic research. Here we analyze and compare the effects of nutlin-3, tenovin-6 and low doses of actinomycin-D on p53 and its main negative regulator, mdm2. We reveal striking differences in the speed at which these compounds increase p53 protein levels, with nutlin-3 having a substantial impact within minutes. We also show that nutlin-3 is very effective at increasing the synthesis of mdm2 mRNA, mdm2 being not only a modulator of p53 but also a transcriptional target. In addition, we show that nutlin-3 stabilizes mdm2's conformation and protects mdm2 from degradation. These strong effects of nutlin-3 on mdm2 correlate with a remarkable rate of recovery of p53 levels upon removal of the compound. We discuss the potential application of our results as molecular signatures to assess the on-target effects of small-molecule mdm2 inhibitors. To conclude, we discuss the implications of our observations for using small-molecule p53 activators to reduce the growth of tumors retaining wild-type p53 or to protect normal tissues against the undesired side effects of conventional chemotherapy.",

Traditional views of this process place most of their emphasis on the events that precede initiation of transcription. We imagine a promoter-bound transcriptional activator (or collection of activators) recruiting components of the basal transcriptional machinery to the DNA, eventually leading to the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and the onset of gene transcription. Although these events play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, they are only half the story. Correct regulation of transcription requires that polymerase not only initiates when and where it should, but that it stops initiating when no longer appropriate. But how are the signals from transcriptional activators, telling RNA polymerase to fire, terminated? Is this process governed by chance, with activators simply falling off the promoter at a certain frequency? Or is there some more direct mechanism, whereby activators are aggressively limited from uncontrolled promoter activation? A new article by suggests the latter may be true, and provides a mechanism for how a component of the basal transcription machinery can mark the activators it has encountered, sentencing them to an early death or banishing them from the nucleus. The ability of the basal transcriptional apparatus to mark activators provides an efficient way to limit activator function and ensures that continuing transcription initiation at a promoter is coupled to the continuing synthesis and activation of transcriptional activators.",

The determination of soil spectral signatures improves the prediction accuracy of calibration models for the determination of soil P concentration. This study aimed to obtain spectral signatures of soil samples and develop calibration models for sensing P concentrations in a soil sample. A total of 345 soil samples were collected from the drainage basin of the Lake Okeechobee to obtain a broad range of P concentrations from very low to very high (1-2709 mg/kg). Thirty-eight soil samples from different fields were sub-sampled and leached in order to remove their existing nutrient contents. The reflectance spectra of leached and unleached soil samples were measured using UV, VIS and NIR spectroscopy. Phosphorus concentrations of the samples were correlated with the absorbance of the same sample. Leached soil signatures were subtracted from those of unleached soil samples to obtain only constituent spectrum. Data analysis for P concentration determination was conducted with and without soil signature correction. For each set, two-thirds of the data was used for calibration while one-thirds of the data was for validation. Partial least squares analysis (PLS) was applied to the data set. Values for the coefficient of determination (R2) increased from 0\u00b787 to 0\u00b793 when original soil and constituent spectra were used, respectively. Also, using constituent spectra rather than original soil absorbance spectra reduced the root mean square errors (RMSEs) from 222 to 172 mg/kg. \u00a9 2005 Silsoe Research Institute.

Recent application of these technologies is improving our understanding of the specificity and subtleties associated with this response.

Interpulses at centimeter wavelengths are very different. Their dynamic spectrum contains regular, microsecond-long emission bands.

        "abstract": "An aggregate signature scheme is a digital signature that supports aggregation: Given n signatures on n distinct messages from n distinct users, it is possible to aggregate all these signatures into a single short signature. This single signature (and the n original messages) will convince the verifier that the n users did indeed sign the n original messages (i.e., user i signed message M i for i = 1,..., n). In this paper we introduce the concept of an aggregate signature, present security models for such signatures, and give several applications for aggregate signatures. We construct an efficient aggregate signature from a recent short signature scheme based on bilinear maps due to Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham. Aggregate signatures are useful for reducing the size of certificate chains (by aggregating all signatures in the chain) and for reducing message size in secure routing protocols such as SBGP. We also show that aggregate signatures give rise to verifiably encrypted signatures. Such signatures enable the verifier to test that a given ciphertext C is the encryption of a signature on a given message M. Verifiably encrypted signatures are used in contract-signing protocols. Finally, we show that similar ideas can be used to extend the short signature scheme to give simple ring signatures.",

Sixty subjects (3 equal groups of 3 signature styles) each provided 10 naturally written (genuine) signatures. Each of these subjects then provided 15 simulations of each of three model signatures. The genuine (N = 600) and simulated (N = 2700) signatures were collected using a digitizing tablet. MovAlyzeR((R)) software was used to estimate kinematic parameters for each pen stroke. Stroke duration, velocity, and pen pressure were found to discriminate between genuine and simulated signatures regardless of the simulator's own style of signature or the style of signature being simulated. However, there was a significant interaction between style and condition for size and jerk (a measure of smoothness). The results of this study, based on quantitative analysis and dynamic handwriting features, indicate that the style of the simulator's own signature and the style of signature being simulated can impact the characteristics of handwriting movements for simulations. Writer style characteristics might therefore need to be taken into consideration as potentially significant when evaluating signature features with a view to forming opinions regarding authenticity.",

A critical insight to transcriptional control mechanisms was provided by the discovery of coactivators, a diverse array of cellular factors that connect sequence-specific DNA binding activators to the general transcriptional machinery, or that help activators and the transcriptional apparatus to navigate through the constraints of chromatin. A number of coactivators have been isolated as large multifunctional complexes, and biochemical, genetic, molecular, and cellular strategies have all contributed to uncovering many of their components, activities, and modes of action. Coactivator functions can be broadly divided into two classes: (a) adaptors that direct activator recruitment of the transcriptional apparatus, (b) chromatin-remodeling or -modifying enzymes. Strikingly, several distinct coactivator complexes nonetheless share many subunits and ap...",

We also show that next generation direct detection experiments will be able to exclude the entire perturbative parameter region for top FDM. For regions of parameter space where the flavor partners of top FDM are not readily produced, the LHC signatures of top FDM are similar to those of other models previously studied in the literature. For the case when the flavor partners are produced at the LHC, we study their impact on a search based on transverse mass variables and find that they diminish the signal significance. However, when the DM flavor partners are split in mass by less than 120-130 GeV, the LHC phenomenology becomes very distinctive through the appearance of displaced vertices. We also propose a strategy by which all parameters of the underlying model can be experimentally determined when the flavor partners can be observed.",

Recent development of genomic technologies has enabled survey of molecular aberrations and deregulations directly from patient specimens in a comprehensive manner. This also has provided clues to therapeutic/preventive targets that could also serve as prognostic/predictive biomarkers. Structural alterations and chemical modifications of genomic DNA have been shown to be useful to guide molecular targeted therapies in some cancers. Gene expression signatures also hold promise as a way to probe functional biological status of the tumor specimen. However, accumulated studies have revealed roadblocks toward the goal to utilize the information in clinic.

        "abstract": "To determine a molecular basis for prognostic differences in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), we employed a combinatorial network analysis framework to exhaustively search for molecular patterns in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We identified a dysregulated molecular signature distinguishing short-term (survival<225 days) from long-term (survival>635 days) survivors of GBM using whole genome expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A 50-gene subnetwork signature achieved 80% prediction accuracy when tested against an independent gene expression dataset. Functional annotations for the subnetwork signature included \"protein kinase cascade,\" \"I\u03baB kinase/NF\u03baB cascade,\" and \"regulation of programmed cell death\" - all of which were not significant in signatures of existing subtypes. Finally, we used label-free proteomics to examine how our subnetwork signature predicted protein level expression differences in an independent GBM cohort of 16 patients. We found that the genes discovered using network biology had a higher probability of dysregulated protein expression than either genes exhibiting individual differential expression or genes derived from known GBM subtypes. In particular, the long-term survivor subtype was characterized by increased protein expression of DNM1 and MAPK1 and decreased expression of HSPA9, PSMD3, and CANX. Overall, we demonstrate that the combinatorial analysis of gene expression data constrained by PPIs outlines an approach for the discovery of robust and translatable molecular signatures in GBM.",

While Secure BGP (S-BGP) provides a comprehensive framework to secure BGP, its high computational cost and low incremental deployment benefits seriously impede its wide usage in practice. Using a lightweight symmetric signature scheme, SPV is much faster than S-BGP. However, the speed boost comes at the price of prohibitively large signatures. Aggregated path authentication reduces the overhead of securing BGP in terms of both time and space, but the speed improvement is still limited by public key computation. In this paper, we propose a keychain-based signature scheme called KC-x. It has low CPU and memory overheads and provides strong incentive for incremental deployment on the Internet. As a generic framework, KC-x has the flexibility of using different signature algorithms, which can even co-exist in a hybrid deployment. We investigate two implementations of KC-x: KC-RSA based on RSA and KC-MT based on Merkle hash tree. Using real BGP workloads, our experimental results show that KC-RSA is as efficient as SAS-V (the most efficient software approach for aggregated path authentication), and KC-MT is even three times faster than SPV with 40% smaller signatures. Through the hybrid deployment of KC-MT and KC-RSA, KC-x can achieve both small signature and high processing rate for BGP speakers.",

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Enzyme promiscuity, a property with practical applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology, has been related to the evolvability of enzymes. At the molecular level, several structural mechanisms have been linked to enzyme promiscuity in enzyme families. However, it is at present unclear to what extent these observations can be generalized. Here, we introduce for the first time a method for predicting catalytic and substrate promiscuity using a graph-based representation known as molecular signature. RESULTS: Our method, which has an accuracy of 85% for the non-redundant KEGG database, is also a powerful analytical tool for characterizing structural determinants of protein promiscuity. Namely, we found that signatures with higher contribution to the prediction of promiscuity are uniformly distributed in the protein structure of promiscuous enzymes. In contrast, those signatures that act as promiscuity determinants are significantly depleted around non-promiscuous catalytic sites. In addition, we present the study of the enolase and aminotransferase superfamilies as illustrative examples of characterization of promiscuous enzymes within a superfamily and achievement of enzyme promiscuity by protein reverse engineering. Recognizing the role of enzyme promiscuity in the process of natural evolution of enzymatic function can provide useful hints in the design of directed evolution experiments. We have developed a method with potential applications in the guided discovery and enhancement of latent catalytic capabilities surviving in modern enzymes.

The present sample consists of four massive young stars located in nascent clusters powering Galactic giant H II regions. Emission in the 2.3 micron 2-0 vibrational-rotational bandhead of CO is observed. A range of velocity broadened profiles seen in three of the objects is consistent with the emission arising from a circumstellar disk seen at various inclination angles. Br gamma spectra of the same spectral and spatial resolution are also presented which support an accretion disk or torus model for massive stars. In the fourth object, Br emission suggesting a rotating torus is observed, but the CO profile is narrow, indicating that there may be different CO emission mechanisms in massive stars and this is consistent with earlier observations of the BN object and MWC 349. To-date, only young massive stars of late O or early B types have been identified with clear accretion disk signatures in such embedded clusters. Often such stars are found in the presence of other more massive stars which are revealed by their photospheric spectra but which exhibit no disk signatures. This suggests the timescale for dissipating their disks is much faster than the less massive OB stars or that the most massive stars do not form with accretion disks.",

        "abstract": "Molecular orbital signatures of the methyl substituent in L-alanine have been identified with respect to those of glycine from information obtained in coordinate and momentum space, using dual space analysis. Electronic structural information in coordinate space is obtained using ab initio (MP2/TZVP) and density functional theory (B3LYP/TZVP) methods, from which the Dyson orbitals are simulated based on the plane wave impulse approximation into momentum space. In comparison to glycine, relaxation in geometry and valence orbitals in L-alanine is found as a result of the attachment of the methyl group. Five orbitals rather than four orbitals are identified as methyl signatures. That is, orbital 6a in the core shell, orbitals 11a and 12a in the inner valence shell, and orbitals 19a and 20a in the outer valence shell. In the inner valence shell, the attachment of methyl to glycine causes a splitting of its orbital 10a' into orbitals 11a and 12a of L-alanine, whereas in the outer valence shell the methyl group results in an insertion of an additional orbital pair of 19a and 20a. The frontier molecular orbitals, 24a and 23a, are found without any significant role in the methylation of glycine.",

        "abstract": "The ratio of genomic oligonucleotide frequencies relative to the mean genomic AT/GC content has been shown to be similar for closely related species and, therefore, said to reflect a \"genomic signature\". The genomic signature has been found to be more similar within genomes than between closely related genomes. Furthermore, genomic signatures of closely related organisms are, in turn, more similar than more distantly related organisms. Since the genomic signature is remarkably stable within a genome, it can be extracted from only a fraction of the genomic DNA sequence. Genomic signatures, therefore, have many applications. The most notable examples include recognition of pathogenicity islands in microbial genomes and identification of hosts from arbitrary DNA sequences, the latter being of great importance in metagenomics. What shapes the genomic signature in microbial DNA has been readily discussed, but difficult to pinpoint exactly. Most attempts so far have mainly focused on correlations from in silico data. This mini-review seeks to summarize possible influences shaping the genomic signature and to survey a set of applications.",

        "abstract": "We present new Mo isotope data from the Mexican continental margin that, in conjunction with previous data, allow us to propose a mechanistic description of the Mo isotope system in marine sediments. We hypothesize that there are unique environmentally dependent Mo isotope signatures recorded in marine sediments that reflect the mechanisms responsible for authigenic Mo accumulation. Open-ocean anoxic sites, defined as having dissolved oxygen and sulfide concentrations near zero in the overlying water, exhibit a \u03b498/95Mo isotope signature of +1.6\u2030. We believe this value reflects Mo sulfide formation via diagenetic processes within sediments. Quantitative formation of Mo sulfide within the sulfidic water column of euxinic environments results in sediment isotope values similar to the modern seawater value (+2.3\u2030), as typified by samples from the highly sulfidic Black Sea. In contrast to these reducing settings, manganese oxide\u2013rich sediments have measured Mo isotope values that are more negative (relative to seawater) than any other sediment samples analyzed to date, similar to Fe-Mn crusts (\u223c\u22120.7\u2030). Most measured Mo isotope compositions of marine sediments from open-ocean settings appear to reflect a mixture of lithogenic Mo (0.0\u2030) and the Mo signature of a specific authigenic Mo accumulation mechanism. We therefore suggest that Mo isotopes may record unique signatures that reflect the dominant chemical mechanism for Mo sequestration into sediments.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates the importance of the tumor microenvironment, in particular cancer-associated fibroblasts, in cancer development and progression. In our study, we developed a novel, visually based method to identify new immunohistochemical signatures of these fibroblasts. The method employed a protein list based on 759 protein products of genes identified by RNA profiling from our previous study, comparing fibroblasts with differential growth-modulating effect on human cancers cells, and their first neighbors in the human protein interactome. These 2,654 proteins were analyzed in the Human Protein Atlas online database by comparing their immunohistochemical expression patterns in normal versus tumor-associated fibroblasts. Twelve new proteins differentially expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts were identified (DLG1, BHLHE40, ROCK2, RAB31, AZI2, PKM2, ARHGAP31, ARHGAP26, ITCH, EGLN1, RNF19A and PLOD2), four of them can be connected to the Rho kinase signaling pathway. They were further analyzed in several additional tumor stromata and revealed that the majority showed congruence among the different tumors. Many of them were also positive in normal myofibroblast-like cells. The new signatures can be useful in immunohistochemical analysis of different tumor stromata and may also give us an insight into the pathways activated in them in their true in vivo context. The method itself could be used for other similar analysis to identify proteins expressed in other cell types in tumors and their surrounding microenvironment.",

        "abstract": "The BRCA1 gene product plays numerous roles in regulating genome integrity. Its role in assembling supermolecular complexes in response to DNA damage has been extensively studied; however, much less is understood about its role as a transcriptional coregulator. Loss or mutation is associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, whereas altered expression occurs frequently in sporadic forms of breast cancer, suggesting that the control of BRCA1 transcription might be important to tumorigenesis. Here, we provide evidence of a striking linkage between the roles for BRCA1 as a transcriptional coregulator with control of its expression via an autoregulatory transcriptional loop. BRCA1 assembles with complexes containing E2F-1 and RB to form a repressive multicomponent transcriptional complex that inhibits BRCA1 promoter transcription. This complex is disrupted by genotoxic stress, resulting in the displacement of BRCA1 protein from the BRCA1 promoter and subsequent upregulation of BRCA1 transcription. Cells depleted of BRCA1 respond by upregulating BRCA1 transcripts, whereas cells overexpressing BRCA1 respond by downregulating BRCA1 transcripts. Tandem chromatin immmunoprecipitation studies show that BRCA1 is regulated by a dynamic coregulatory complex containing BRCA1, E2F1, and Rb at the BRCA1 promoter that is disrupted by DNA-damaging agents to increase its transcription. These results define a novel transcriptional mechanism of autoregulated homeostasis of BRCA1 that selectively titrates its levels to maintain genome integrity in response to genotoxic insult.",

        "abstract": "Like most complex phenotypes, exceptional longevity is thought to reflect a combined influence of environmental (e.g., lifestyle choices, where we live) and genetic factors. To explore the genetic contribution, we undertook a genome-wide association study of exceptional longevity in 801 centenarians (median age at death 104 years) and 914 genetically matched healthy controls. Using these data, we built a genetic model that includes 281 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and discriminated between cases and controls of the discovery set with 89% sensitivity and specificity, and with 58% specificity and 60% sensitivity in an independent cohort of 341 controls and 253 genetically matched nonagenarians and centenarians (median age 100 years). Consistent with the hypothesis that the genetic contribution is largest with the oldest ages, the sensitivity of the model increased in the independent cohort with older and older ages (71% to classify subjects with an age at death>102 and 85% to classify subjects with an age at death>105). For further validation, we applied the model to an additional, unmatched 60 centenarians (median age 107 years) resulting in 78% sensitivity, and 2863 unmatched controls with 61% specificity. The 281 SNPs include the SNP rs2075650 in TOMM40/APOE that reached irrefutable genome wide significance (posterior probability of association\u200a=\u200a1) and replicated in the independent cohort. Removal of this SNP from the model reduced the accuracy by only 1%. Further in-silico analysis suggests that 90% of centenarians can be grouped into clusters characterized by different \u201cgenetic signatures\u201d of varying predictive values for exceptional longevity. The correlation between 3 signatures and 3 different life spans was replicated in the combined replication sets. The different signatures may help dissect this complex phenotype into sub-phenotypes of exceptional longevity.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Global gene expression analysis of tumor samples has been a valuable tool to subgroup tumors and has the potential to be of prognostic and predictive value. However, tumors are heterogeneous, and homogenates will consist of several different cell types. This study was designed to obtain more refined expression data representing different compartments of the tumor.\\n\\nMETHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded stroma-rich triple-negative breast cancer tumors were laser-microdissected, and RNA was extracted and processed to enable microarray hybridization. Genes enriched in stroma were identified and used to generate signatures by identifying correlating genes in publicly available data sets. The prognostic implications of the signature were analyzed.\\n\\nRESULTS: Comparison of the expression pattern from stromal and cancer cell compartments from three tumors revealed a number of genes that were essentially specifically expressed in the respective compartments. The stroma-specific genes indicated contribution from fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune/inflammatory cells. The gene set was expanded by identifying correlating mRNAs using breast cancer mRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. By iterative analyses, 16 gene signatures of highly correlating genes were characterized. Based on the gene composition, they seem to represent different cell types. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, two immune/inflammatory signatures had opposing hazard ratios for breast cancer recurrence also after adjusting for clinicopathological variables and molecular subgroup. The signature associated with poor prognosis consisted mainly of C1Q genes and the one associated with good prognosis contained HLA genes. This association with prognosis was seen for other cancers as well as in other breast cancer data sets.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the molecular composition of the immune response in a tumor may be a powerful predictor of cancer prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Genome-wide expression signatures detect specific perturbations in developmental programs and contribute to functional resolution of key regulatory networks. In maize (Zea mays) inflorescences, mutations in the RAMOSA (RA) genes affect the determinacy of axillary meristems and thus alter branching patterns, an important agronomic trait. In this work, we developed and tested a framework for analysis of tag-based, digital gene expression profiles using Illumina's high-throughput sequencing technology and the newly assembled B73 maize reference genome. We also used a mutation in the RA3 gene to identify putative expression signatures specific to stem cell fate in axillary meristem determinacy. The RA3 gene encodes a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase and may act at the interface between developmental and metabolic processes. Deep sequencing of digital gene expression libraries, representing three biological replicate ear samples from wild-type and ra3 plants, generated 27 million 20- to 21-nucleotide reads with frequencies spanning 4 orders of magnitude. Unique sequence tags were anchored to 3'-ends of individual transcripts by DpnII and NlaIII digests, which were multiplexed during sequencing. We mapped 86% of nonredundant signature tags to the maize genome, which associated with 37,117 gene models and unannotated regions of expression. In total, 66% of genes were detected by at least nine reads in immature maize ears. We used comparative genomics to leverage existing information from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) in functional analyses of differentially expressed maize genes. Results from this study provide a basis for the analysis of short-read expression data in maize and resolved specific expression signatures that will help define mechanisms of action for the RA3 gene.",

Our methods also identified evidence of some similarity between Ethiopian and Yemenite Jews, reflecting possible migration in the Red Sea region.

        "abstract": " Human motion is the composite consequence of multiple elements, including the action performed and a motion signature that captures the distinctive pattern of movement of a particular individual. We develop an algorithm that is capable of extracting these motion elements and recombining them in novel ways. The algorithm analyzes motion data spanning multiple subjects performing different actions. The analysis yields a generative motion model that can synthesize new motions in the distinctive styles of these individuals. Our algorithms can also recognize people and actions from new motions by comparing motion signatures and action parameters.",

        "abstract": "The inert Doublet Model is an extension of the Standard Model by one extra scalar, with identical gauge quantum numbers as the Standard Model Higgs doublet but charged under an unbroken discrete symmetry. The model offers a very rich phenomenology and could lead to signatures in electroweak precision observables or collider experiments. Furthermore, the lightest particle of the extended scalar sector is a dark matter candidate. In this talk we review the dark matter phenomenology of the model, concretely the dark matter thermal production, the direct detection signals and the indirect detection signals, with emphasis on the generation of sharp gamma-ray spectral features via internal bremsstrahlung and via one-loop effects.",

Here, we focus on how elongation can modulate the transcriptional outcome through the rate-liming step of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing near promoters and how the participating factors were identified. Among the factors we describe are the pausing factors--NELF (negative elongation factor) and DSIF (DRB sensitivity-inducing factor)--and P-TEFb (positive elongation factor b), which is the key player in pause release. We also describe the high-resolution view of Pol II pausing and propose nonexclusive models for how pausing is achieved. We then discuss Pol II elongation through the bodies of genes and the roles of FACT and SPT6, factors that allow Pol II to move through nucleosomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During the last years, several groups have identified prognostic gene expression signatures with apparently similar performances. However, signatures were never compared on an independent population of untreated breast cancer patients, where risk assessment was computed using the original algorithms and microarray platforms. RESULTS: We compared three gene expression signatures, the 70-gene, the 76-gene and the Gene expression Grade Index (GGI) signatures, in terms of predicting distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) for the individual patient. To this end, we used the previously published TRANSBIG independent validation series of node-negative untreated primary breast cancer patients. We observed agreement in prediction for 135 of 198 patients (68%) when considering the three signatures. When comparing the signatures two by two, the agreement in prediction was 71% for the 70- and 76-gene signatures, 76% for the 76-gene signature and the GGI, and 88% for the 70-gene signature and the GGI. The three signatures had similar capabilities of predicting DMFS and added significant prognostic information to that provided by the classical parameters. CONCLUSION: Despite the difference in development of these signatures and the limited overlap in gene identity, they showed similar prognostic performance, adding to the growing evidence that these prognostic signatures are of clinical relevance.",

The tool is based on a new method for the clustering of profiles based on a subject-specific, as opposed to disease-specific, signature. Our approach relies on construction of a reference map of transcriptional signatures, from both healthy and affected subjects, derived from their respective mRNA or miRNA profiles. A diagnosis for a new individual can then be performed by determining the position of the individual's transcriptional signature on the map. The diagnostic power of our method has been convincingly demonstrated in an open scientific competition (SBV Improver Diagnostic Signature Challenge), scoring second place overall and first place in one of the sub-challenges.",

How these may influence the system-level function of a given cytokine is unknown. Here we show that a single cytokine, interferon (IFN)-alpha, can generate multiple transcriptional signatures, including distinct functional modules of variable flexibility, when acting in four cytokine environments driving distinct T helper cell differentiation programs (Th0, Th1, Th2 and Th17). We provide experimental validation of a chemokine, cytokine and antiviral modules differentially induced by IFN-alpha in Th1, Th2 and Th17 environments. Functional impact is demonstrated for the antiviral response, with a lesser IFN-alpha-induced protection to HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection in a Th17 context. Our results reveal that a single cytokine can induce multiple transcriptional and functional programs in different microenvironments. This combinatorial flexibility creates a previously unrecognized diversity of responses, with potential impact on disease physiopathology and cytokine therapy.",

Here, we take a top-down systems approach to this question. Multigene transcriptional signatures from infected lungs suggested that elevated activation of inflammatory signaling networks distinguished lethal from sublethal infections. Flow cytometry and gene expression analysis involving isolated cell subpopulations from infected lungs showed that neutrophil influx largely accounted for the predictive transcriptional signature. Automated imaging analysis, together with these gene expression and flow data, identified a chemokine-driven feedforward circuit involving proinflammatory neutrophils potently driven by poorly contained lethal viruses. Consistent with these data, attenuation, but not ablation, of the neutrophil-driven response increased survival without changing viral spread. These findings establish the primacy of damaging innate inflammation in at least some forms of influenza-induced lethality and provide a roadmap for the systematic dissection of infection-associated pathology.",

We show that, to perform these activities in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, both proteins competitively heterodimerize with pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox-1 (Pbx1). Meis1 alone transforms Prep1-deficient fibroblasts, whereas Prep1 overexpression inhibits Meis1 tumorigenicity. Pbx1 can, therefore, alternatively act as an oncogene or tumor suppressor. Prep1 posttranslationally controls the level of Meis1, decreasing its stability by sequestering Pbx1. The different levels of Meis1 and the presence of Prep1 are followed at the transcriptional level by the induction of specific transcriptional signatures. The decrease of Meis1 prevents Meis1 interaction with Ddx3x and Ddx5, which are essential for Meis1 tumorigenesis, and modifies the growth-promoting DNA binding landscape of Meis1 to the growth-controlling landscape of Prep1. Hence, the key feature of Prep1 tumor-inhibiting activity is the control of Meis1 stability.",

Because carbon and nitrogen isotopes can be used to assess fungal trophic status and nitrogen sources, we accordingly carried out an extensive survey of isotopic patterns in archived specimens of Ramaria from Germany and other locations. Isotopic patterns in species generally corresponded to subgeneric affiliations and to the range of different potential substrates, with fungi fruiting on wood and litter (subgenera Asteroramaria and Lentoramaria) much lower in delta N-15 (a parts per thousand a'3aEuro degrees) than ectomycorrhizal taxa (a parts per thousand 12aEuro degrees) (subgenus Ramaria) or taxa fruiting on soil (a parts per thousand 13aEuro degrees) (subgenus Echinoramaria). Conversely, fungi fruiting on wood and litter were higher in delta C-13 (-23aEuro degrees) than those fruiting on soil (a parts per thousand a'27aEuro degrees), with ectomycorrhizal fungi intermediate (a parts per thousand a'24.5aEuro degrees). Fungi colonizing mineral soil horizons were about 3aEuro degrees enriched in N-15 relative to those colonizing both mineral and organic horizons. The high delta N-15 and low delta C-13 signatures of taxa fruiting on soil remains unexplained. The high degree of fidelity of isotopic signatures with subgeneric classifications and life history traits suggests that sporocarps are good integrators of patterns of carbon and nitrogen cycling for specific taxa. Archived specimens represent a useful trove of life history information that could be mined without requiring extensive supporting isotopic data from other ecosystem pools.",

        "abstract": "Today\u2019s processors provide a rich source of statistical information on application execution through hardware counters. In this paper, we explore the utilization of these statistics as request signatures in server applications for identifying requests and inferring high-level request properties (e.g., CPU and I/O resource needs). Our key finding is that effective request signatures may be constructed using a small amount of hardware statisticswhile the request is still in an early stage of its execution. Such on-the-fly request identification and property inference allow guided operating system adaptation at request granularity (e.g., resource-aware request scheduling and on-the-fly request classification). We address the challenges of selecting hardware counter metrics for signature construction and providing necessary operating system support for per-request statistics management. Our implementation in the Linux 2.6.10 kernel suggests that our approach requires low overhead suitable for runtime deployment. Our on-the-fly request resource consumption inference (averaging 7%, 3%, 20%, and 41% prediction errors for four server workloads, TPC-C, TPC-H, J2EE-based RUBiS, and a trace-driven index search, respectively) is much more accurate than the online running-average based prediction (73\u201382% errors). Its use for resource-aware request scheduling results in a 15\u201370% response time reduction for three CPU-bound applications. Its use for on-the-fly request classification and anomaly detection exhibits high accuracy for the TPC-H workload with synthetically generated anomalous requests following a typical SQL-injection attack pattern.",

        "abstract": "Obesity is a major public health problem worldwide. We used 24-hour urinary metabolic profiling by proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and ion exchange chromatography to characterize the metabolic signatures of adiposity in the U.S. (n = 1880) and UK (n = 444) cohorts of the INTERMAP (International Study of Macro- and Micronutrients and Blood Pressure) epidemiologic study. Metabolic profiling of urine samples collected over two 24-hour time periods 3 weeks apart showed reproducible patterns of metabolite excretion associated with adiposity. Exploratory analysis of the urinary metabolome using 1H NMR spectroscopy of the U.S. samples identified 29 molecular species, clustered in interconnecting metabolic pathways, that were significantly associated (P = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 2.0 \u00d7 10\u221236) with body mass index (BMI); 25 of these species were also found in the UK validation cohort. We found multiple associations between urinary metabolites and BMI including urinary glycoproteins and N-acetyl neuraminate (related to renal function), trimethylamine, dimethylamine, 4-cresyl sulfate, phenylacetylglutamine and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate (gut microbial co-metabolites), succinate and citrate (tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates), ketoleucine and the ketoleucine/leucine ratio (linked to skeletal muscle mitochondria and branched-chain amino acid metabolism), ethanolamine (skeletal muscle turnover), and 3-methylhistidine (skeletal muscle turnover and meat intake). We mapped the multiple BMI-metabolite relationships as part of an integrated systems network that describes the connectivities between the complex pathway and compartmental signatures of human adiposity.",

The semi-trusted proxy does not learn either party's signing key and cannot sign arbitrary messages on behalf of Alice or Bob. At CCS 2005, Ateniese and Hohenberger revisited the primitive by providing appropriate security definitions and efficient constructions in the random oracle model. Nonetheless, they left open the problem of designing a multi-use unidirectional scheme where the proxy is able to translate in only one direction and signatures can be re-translated several times. This paper solves this problem, suggested for the first time 10 years ago, and shows the first multi-hop unidirectional proxy re-signature schemes. We describe a random-oracle-using system that is secure in the Ateniese-Hohenberger model. The same technique also yields a similar construction in the standard model (i.e. without relying on random oracles). Both schemes are efficient and require newly defined - but falsifiable - Diffie-Hellman-like assumptions in bilinear groups.",

The radial evolution of the main proton moments (density, temperature, and drift velocities) and their empirical correlations with other plasma parameters are investigated in detail and compared with theoretical expectations. The stability of the plasma is studied against different ion kinetic instabilities driven by ion temperature anisotropies and differential velocities, focusing on the identification of possible signatures of relevant instabilities in the observed core-beam structure of proton distributions. The temperature anisotropy of the total proton distribution appears to be constrained by fire hose instabilities, in agreement with previous studies, while if considered separately, beam and core populations exhibit opposite anisotropies, with core protons characterized by perpendicular temperatures larger than the parallel ones, possibly (marginally) unstable for ion-cyclotron instability. The evolution with distance of the drift velocity between the secondary population and the main core is found to be nonadiabatic, leading to the identification of a marginal stability path of a magnetosonic ion-beam instability. As a conclusion, we find that a large fraction of the proton distributions observed by Ulysses display signatures of either a beam or a fire hose instability, suggesting that such kinetic processes play an important role in regulating the solar wind thermal energetics during the plasma expansion.",

Currently existing prognostic staging systems have substantially improved the clinical outcome of patients by guiding treatment decision and allocation of medical resources. However, there is still room to refine many aspects of the framework based on more precise clinical outcome prediction and understanding of HCC molecular pathogenesis. Recent development of genomic technologies has enabled survey of molecular aberrations and deregulations directly from patient specimens in a comprehensive manner. This also has provided clues to therapeutic/preventive targets that could also serve as prognostic/predictive biomarkers. Structural alterations and chemical modifications of genomic DNA have been shown to be useful to guide molecular targeted therapies in some cancers. Gene expression signatures also hold promise as a way to probe functional biological status of the tumor specimen. However, accumulated studies have revealed roadblocks toward the goal to utilize the information in clinic. In this review, we discuss the gene signature's potential application, its pros and cons as a clinical test, technical issues in assay development, and strategies for clinical deployment in the context of HCC management. Recent updates of HCC gene signatures as well as emerging alternative modalities are also overviewed.",

In this paper, we analyze and discuss several such signatures acquired from the airborne POLDER and HyMap instruments during the DAISEX'99 campaign over agricultural crops. The observed signatures are very similar to those acquired from space at a resolution of several tens of kilometers [J. Geophys. Res. 107 (2002)], which provides further evidence that the hot spot is a scale-free feature. The hot spots can be fitted by a two-parameter function (amplitude and width) of the phase angle derived from canopy radiative transfer modeling. The model predicts that the amplitude is directly related to the leaf reflectance, while the width is a function of the canopy structure. The retrieved leaf reflectance values over a wide spectral range are in very good agreement with noncoincident laboratory measurement. The retrieved half widths are on the order of 1\u00b0with no significant variability between the analyzed targets. There is an apparent spectral variability in the half width, a feature in contradiction with the modeling, although the variations are not larger than the uncertainties. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Semantic video signatures are those that are based on high-level content information rather than on low-level features of the video stream. The major advantage of such signatures is that they are highly invariant to nearly all types of distortion. A major semantic feature of a video is the appearance of specific persons in specific video frames. Because of the great amount of research that has been performed on the subject of face detection and recognition, the extraction of such information is generally tractable, or will be in the near future. We have developed a method that uses the pre-extracted output of face detection and recognition to perform fast semantic query-by-example retrieval of video segments. We also give the results of the experimental evaluation of our method on a database of real video. One advantage of our approach is that the evaluation of similarity is convolution-based, and is thus resistant to perturbations in the signature and independent of the exact boundaries of the query segment.",

        "abstract": "Long Term Evolution (LTE) Advanced is the next generation of the LTE standard, offering peak data rates of up to 1Gbps using up to 100MHz of spectrum. A key mechanism in achieving this is carrier aggregation (CA) whereby multiple LTE component carriers (CCs) are combined in a contiguous or non-contiguous fashion. With the introduction of CA comes the challenge of network rendezvous. In order to associate with an LTE Advanced basestation or eNodeB, a User Equipment (UE) device must be capable of detecting component carriers in use by that eNodeB and establishing communications links. Looking beyond LTE Advanced, the introduction of service and technology neutral approaches to spectrum management is likely to increase the importance of rendezvous, as more diverse spectrum bands become available for use. This paper presents cyclostationary signatures as a powerful tool for overcoming the challenge of network rendezvous in LTE Advanced networks and beyond. A signature detector design, based on the Autocoherence Function (AF), is presented and a number of mechanisms for embedding signatures in downlink LTE CC waveforms are described. The performance of our signature detector is examined in depth through simulation under conditions of doubly-selective fading. Simulation results highlight the performance advantages which can be achieved through use of the AF-based detector over the simpler time-smoothed cyclic cross periodogram (TS-CCP)-based detector. Over the air experiments using a software radio based transceiver are described and results are presented. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Chaotic behaviour is ubiquitous and plays an important part in most fields of science. In classical physics, chaos is characterized by hypersensitivity of the time evolution of a system to initial conditions. Quantum mechanics does not permit a similar definition owing in part to the uncertainty principle, and in part to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which preserves the overlap between quantum states. This fundamental disconnect poses a challenge to quantum\u2013classical correspondence, and has motivated a long-standing search for quantum signatures of classical chaos. Here we present the experimental realization of a common paradigm for quantum chaos\u2014the quantum kicked top\u2014 and the observation directly in quantum phase space of dynamics that have a chaotic classical counterpart. Our system is based on the combined electronic and nuclear spin of a single atom and is therefore deep in the quantum regime; nevertheless, we find good correspondence between the quantum dynamics and classical phase space structures. Because chaos is inherently a dynamical phenomenon, special significance attaches to dynamical signatures such as sensitivity to perturbation or the generation of entropy and entanglement, for which only indirect evidence has been available. We observe clear differences in the sensitivity to perturbation in chaotic versus regular, non-chaotic regimes, and present experimental evidence for dynamical entanglement as a signature of chaos.",

Although remarkable progress has been made in deciphering the mechanisms used by miRNAs to regulate translation, many contradictory findings have been published that stimulate active debate in this field. Here we contribute to this discussion in three ways. First, based on a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature, we hypothesize a model in which all proposed mechanisms of microRNA action coexist, and where the apparent mechanism that is detected in a given experiment is determined by the relative values of the intrinsic characteristics of the target mRNAs and associated biological processes. Among several coexisting miRNA mechanisms, the one that will effectively be measurable is that which acts on or changes the sensitive parameters of the translation process. Second, we have created a mathematical model that combines nine known mechanisms of miRNA action and estimated the model parameters from the literature. Third, based on the mathematical modeling, we have developed a computational tool for discriminating among different possible individual mechanisms of miRNA action based on translation kinetics data that can be experimentally measured (kinetic signatures). To confirm the discriminatory power of these kinetic signatures and to test our hypothesis, we have performed several computational experiments with the model in which we simulated the coexistence of several miRNA action mechanisms in the context of variable parameter values of the translation.",

Our work consists of a Bayesian supervised statistical learning approach to refine gene signatures with a regularization which penalizes for the correlation between the variables selected.\\n\\nRESULTS: Our simulation results show that we can most often recover the correct subset of genes that predict the class as compared to other methods, even when accuracy and subset size remain the same. On real microarray datasets, we show that our approach can refine gene signatures to obtain either the same or better predictive performance than other existing methods with a smaller number of genes.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our novel Bayesian approach includes a prior which penalizes highly correlated features in model selection and is able to extract key genes in the highly correlated context of microarray data. The methodology in the paper is described in the context of microarray data, but can be applied to any array data (such as micro RNA, for example) as a first step towards predictive modeling of cancer pathways.

In a certain class of these new physics models, the Z???-boson has flavor-dependent couplings with the fermions in the Standard Model (SM). Based on a simple model in which couplings of the SM fermions in the third generation with the Z???-boson are different from those of the corresponding fermions in the first two generations, we study the signatures of Z???-boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC). We show that at the LHC, the Z???-boson with mass around 1 TeV can be produced through the Drell-Yan processes and its dilepton decay modes provide us clean signatures not only for the resonant production of Z???-boson but also for flavor-dependences of the production cross sections. We also study fermion pair productions at the ILC involving the virtual Z???-boson exchange. Even though the center-of-energy of the ILC is much lower than a Z???-boson mass, the angular distributions and the forward-backward asymmetries of fermion pair productions show not only sizable deviations from the SM predictions but also significant flavor-dependences. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The signal is then given by the absolute square of a susceptibility which in turn is a sum over pathways of a single molecule. The molecular pathways of different molecules in the pair are uncorrelated in this case (each path of a given molecule can be accompanied by any path of the other).

At the final step, we compare the LMSs generated for a new gesture w.r.t. the learned codebook via the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and a novel voting strategy. Our main contribution is the handling of the N to N mapping between code-words and gesture labels with the proposed voting strategy.

Many proposals for this unconventional behavior have been advanced, yet a consensus remains elusive. Using realistic many-body calculations, we here reproduce the signatures of the metal-insulator cross-over in various observables: the spectral function, the optical conductivity, the spin susceptibility, and the Seebeck coefficient. Validated by quantitative agreement with experiment, we then address the underlying microscopic picture. We propose a new scenario in which FeSi is a band insulator at low temperatures and is metalized with increasing temperature through correlation induced incoherence. We explain that the emergent incoherence is linked to the unlocking of iron fluctuating moments, which are almost temperature independent at short timescales. Finally, we make explicit suggestions for improving the thermoelectric performance of FeSi based systems.",

Thus, specific neural signatures across these regions hold representations of different emotional states in multimodal fashion, independently of how the emotions are induced. Similarity of subjective experiences between emotions was associated with similarity of neural patterns for the same emotions, suggesting a direct link between activity in these brain regions and the subjective emotional experience.",

        "abstract": "Because of the paucity of available tissue, little information has previously been available regarding the gene expression profiles of primary melanomas. To understand the molecular basis of melanoma progression, we compared the gene expression profiles of a series of nevi, primary melanomas, and melanoma metastases. We found that metastatic melanomas exhibit two dichotomous patterns of gene expression, which unexpectedly reflect gene expression differences already apparent in comparing laser-capture microdissected radial and vertical phases of a large primary melanoma. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering accurately separated nevi and primary melanomas. Multiclass significance analysis of microarrays comparing normal skin, nevi, primary melanomas, and the two types of metastatic melanoma identified 2,602 transcripts that significantly correlated with sample class. These results suggest that melanoma pathogenesis can be understood as a series of distinct molecular events. The gene expression signatures identified here provide the basis for developing new diagnostics and targeting therapies for patients with malignant melanoma.",

        "abstract": "We review known and discuss new signatures of high-intensity Compton scattering assuming a scenario where a high-power laser is brought into collision with an electron beam. At high intensities one expects to see a substantial red-shift of the usual kinematic Compton edge of the photon spectrum caused by the large, intensity dependent, effective mass of the electrons within the laser beam. Emission rates acquire their global maximum at this edge while neighbouring smaller peaks signal higher harmonics. In addition, we find that the notion of the centre-of-mass frame for a given harmonic becomes intensity dependent. Tuning the intensity then effectively amounts to changing the frame of reference, going continuously from inverse to ordinary Compton scattering with the centre-of-mass kinematics defining the transition point between the two.",

        "abstract": "There is now a compelling body of evidences sustaining the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the development and progression of cancer. DNA methylation, post-translational histone and other protein modifications, microRNA expression, and nucleosome positioning, all act together to exert their cellular effects. The epigenome is responsible for controlling gene expression thus defining cell differentiation and tissue specificity. This review will focus on DNA methylation and histone modification because these epigenetic events are widely implicated in cancer development and progression. We will in particular address the translational aspects of breast cancer epigenomics including the development of biomarkers and the prospects for epigenetic based pharmacologic treatments. The analysis of DNA methylation has the advantage over other molecular methods (e.g. single gene mutation, microsatellite analysis) that it can be detected with a very high degree of specificity even in the presence of excess unmethylated DNA. Furthermore, the presence of specific CpG methylation signatures makes methylation-based markers attractive diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tools for better management of breast cancer patients.",

Service discovery at the present time is based primarily on keywords, or interfaces of Web services through the use of ontology. We argue that \"behavior signatures\" as operational level description should play an important role in the service discovery process. In this paper, we propose a new behavior model for Web services using automata and logic formalisms. Roughly, the model associates messages with activities and adopts the IOPR model in OWL-S to describe activities. A new query language is developed to express temporal and semantic properties on service behaviors. Query evaluation algorithms are developed; in particular, an optimization approach using RE-tree and heuristics is shown to improve the performance. Specifically, experimental results show that the use of RE-tree reduces query evaluation time by an order of magnitude and with heuristics it enhances the performance by two orders of magnitude. This is clearly an encouraging starting point.",

We find two distinct types of components in the ERP recorded during categorization of natural images. One is an early presentation-locked signal arising around 135 ms that is present when there are low-level feature differences between images. The other is a later, recognition-related component arising between 150-300 ms. Unlike the early component, the latency of the later component covaries with the subsequent reaction time. In contrast to previous studies suggesting that the early, presentation-locked component of neural activity is correlated to recognition, these results imply that the neural signatures of recognition have a substantially later and variable time of onset.",

The series under consideration consists of three-cycle PAHs. Anthracene and phenanthrene are taken as references for regular PAHs and dibenzocyclobutadiene (biphenylene), dibenzocyclopentadienyl (fluorenyl), dibenzocycloheptatrienyl (heptafluorenyl) as models for irregular PAHs. These irregular conjugated hydrocarbons consist of four-, five- and seven- (instead of six) membered rings respectively sandwiched between two benzene entities while the regular ones are built with only six-membered rings. The IR spectra of the neutral, singly and doubly ionized species are compared. It is found that the non-regular compounds present the same general behaviour as regular ones at each level of ionization. From an astrophysical point of view, none of the differences is found big enough to be relevant for selective observation, which implies that all sorts of PAHs including irregular structures may be present and contribute anonymously to the UIR bands. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

Because evolutionary pressures on primary and specialized metabolism differ, we investigated differences in the emergence and maintenance of these processes across 16 species encompassing major plant lineages from algae to angiosperms. We found that, relative to their primary metabolic counterparts, genes coding for specialized metabolic functions have proliferated to a much greater degree and by different mechanisms and display lineage-specific patterns of physical clustering within the genome and coexpression. These properties illustrate the differential evolution of specialized metabolism in plants, and collectively they provide unique signatures for the potential discovery of novel specialized metabolic processes.",

The three classical aging signatures observed in molecular glasses are studied and the results are compared with those typical of molecular glasses. For the intrinsic isotherms, unlike molecular glasses, the colloid shows huge changes in relaxation time at equilibrium while the times required to reach the equilibrium state are nearly constant.

In this paper, we strengthen the security notions of DGS by taking insider attack against anonymity into account, and present a concrete DGS construction with collective traceability. The idea behind collective traceability is that a sender can first choose (ad-hoc) a set of n members (including himself), and then sign a message by using the public keys of all the members, in such a way that his identity would be recovered, in case of disputes, if and only if all n members collectively cooperate.

This has been interpreted as evidence for 'temporal coding', whereby stimuli are represented by precise spike-timing patterns. Here, we suggest an alternative interpretation based on the older concept of the cell assembly. The dynamic evolution of assembly sequences, which are steered but not deterministically controlled by sensory input, is the proposed substrate of psychological processes beyond simple stimulus-response associations. Accordingly, spike trains show a temporal structure that is stimulus-dependent and more variable than would be predicted by strict sensory control. We propose four signatures of assembly organization that can be experimentally tested. We argue that many observations that have been interpreted as evidence for temporal coding might instead reflect an underlying assembly structure.",

The observation and control of incoherence in small Hilbert spaces is well known. Here we explore incoherence during an entangling operation, such as is relevant in quantum information processing. As expected, it is more difficult to separate incoherence and decoherence over such processes. However, by studying the fidelity decay under a cyclic entangling map we are able to identify distinctive experimental signatures of incoherence.

We then determined their transcription activation strength using fusions to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and a His3 reporter gene which contained a promoter with a Gal4-binding site. Among the 132 strongest activators 32 are known transcription factors while another 35 have no known function. Although zinc fingers, helix-loop-helix domains and several other domains are highly overrepresented among the activators, only few contain characterized ADs. We also found some striking correlations: the stronger the activation activity, the more acidic, glutamine-rich, proline-rich or asparagine-rich the activators were. About 29% of the activators have been found previously to specifically interact with the transcription machinery, while 10% are known to be components of transcription regulatory complexes. Based on their transcriptional activity, localization and interaction patterns, at least six previously uncharacterized proteins are suggested to be bona fide transcriptional regulators (namely YFL049W, YJR070C, YDR520C, YGL066W/Sgf73, YKR064W and YCR082W/Ahc2).",

ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. BRCA1, BRCA2 and RASSF1 methylation analysis, AURKA copy number variations, and BRCA1 and BRCA2 deletions, were studied by MLPA. We validated eight of the miR selected by the arrays in 77 BCs by qRT-PCR. The miR profiles associated with tumor features were studied applying the Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis. MiR discrimination capability to distinguish hereditary and non-hereditary BC was analyzed by the discriminant function. With 15 out of 1,733 hsa-miRs, it was possible to differentiate the four groups. BRCA1, BRCA2 and SBC were associated with clusters of hyper-expressed miRs, and BRCAX with hypo-expressed miRs. Hsa-miR-4417 and hsa-miR-423-3p expressions (included among the eight validated miRs) differentiated 70.1 % of hereditary and non-hereditary BCs. We found miR profiles associated with tumor features like node involvement, histological grade, ER, PR and HER2 expression. Regarding molecular parameters, we only found a weak association of miRs in BC harboring losses in AURKA. We conclude that array miR expression profiles can differentiate the four study groups using FFPE BC. However, miRs expression estimated by qRT-PCR differentiates only hereditary and non-inherited BCs. The miR expression array is a simple and rapid approach that could be useful to facilitate the identification of those SBC carrying genetic or epigenetic changes in BRCA genes responsible of BRCA-like phenotype. These patients could benefit from the treatment with PARP inhibitors.",

A numerical model simulates flow and transport in the wellbore during flowing FEC logging, and fracture properties are determined by optimizing the match between simulation results and observed FEC logs. This can be a laborious trial-and-error procedure, especially when both inflow and outflow points are present. Improved analyses methods are needed. One possible tactic would be to develop an automated inverse method, but this paper takes a more elementary approach and focuses on identifying the signatures that various inflow and outflow features create in flowing FEC logs. The physical insight obtained provides a basis for more efficient analysis of these logs, both for the present trial and error approach and for a potential future automated inverse approach. Inflow points produce distinctive signatures in the FEC logs themselves, enabling the determination of location, inflow rate, and ion concentration. Identifying outflow locations and flow rates typically requires a more complicated integral method, which is also presented in this paper. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dinoflagellates are one of the most important classes of marine and freshwater algae, notable both for their functional diversity and ecological significance. They occur naturally as free-living cells, as endosymbionts of marine invertebrates and are well known for their involvement in \"red tides\". Dinoflagellates are also notable for their unusual genome content and structure, which suggests that the organization and regulation of dinoflagellate genes may be very different from that of most eukaryotes. To investigate the content and regulation of the dinoflagellate genome, we performed a global analysis of the transcriptome of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense under nitrate- and phosphate-limited conditions using Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS). RESULTS: Data from the two MPSS libraries showed that the number of unique signatures found in A. fundyense cells is similar to that of humans and Arabidopsis thaliana, two eukaryotes that have been extensively analyzed using this method. The general distribution, abundance and expression patterns of the A. fundyense signatures were also quite similar to other eukaryotes, and at least 10% of the A. fundyense signatures were differentially expressed between the two conditions. RACE amplification and sequencing of a subset of signatures showed that multiple signatures arose from sequence variants of a single gene. Single signatures also mapped to different sequence variants of the same gene. CONCLUSION: The MPSS data presented here provide a quantitative view of the transcriptome and its regulation in these unusual single-celled eukaryotes. The observed signature abundance and distribution in Alexandrium is similar to that of other eukaryotes that have been analyzed using MPSS. Results of signature mapping via RACE indicate that many signatures result from sequence variants of individual genes. These data add to the growing body of evidence for widespread gene duplication in dinoflagellates, which would contribute to the transcriptional complexity of these organisms. The MPSS data also demonstrate that a significant number of dinoflagellate mRNAs are transcriptionally regulated, indicating that dinoflagellates commonly employ transcriptional gene regulation along with the post-transcriptional regulation that has been well documented in these organisms.",

These workflows often require multiple signatures to be added to the documents for authorization and/or integrity. We describe examples of digital workflows that illustrate problems with digital signatures: i.e. the use of digital signatures across entire documents results in signatures that can be unnecessarily invalidated by subsequent modification of the document. We propose the use of fragment signatures, which reduce unnecessary invalidation of signatures and enable greater concurrency in workflows. Our approach is document-centric and does not use a centralized database. We report on an implementation that allows fragment signatures over document fragments as well as the attachment (or embedding) of other documents. This allows collaborative or cooperative editing to occur on parts of a document without disturbing unrelated signatures. We describe the lessons learned from our deployments and offer further ways to embed such signatures into other document types. Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new type of digital signatures which is specifically designed for graph-based big data system. The properties of the proposed signatures are twofold. On one side it possesses the features of transitive signatures: One can sign a graph in such a way that, given two signatures on adjacent edges (i,j) and (j,k), anyone with public information can compute a signature on edge (i,k). The efficiency advancement (O(1) communication overhead) in transitive signatures is especially important in big data paradigm. On the other side, it is universal designated verifiable: It allows any signature holder to prove to a designated verifier that a message has been signed by the signer, but the verifier cannot convince (even sharing all secret information) any other third party of this fact. The new notion is called Universal Designated Verifier Transitive Signatures (UDVTS for short). As an integration of transitive signatures and universal designated verifier signatures, UDVTS can efficiently address privacy issues associated with dissemination of transitive signatures of graph-based big data. We further prove that our proposed design is secure in the random oracle model.",

However, blood transcriptional profiling is not yet ready to be applied in clinical practice. A number of methodological issues and hurdles need to be overcome, with issues of standardizing blood sample collection and processing of paramount importance.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In recent decades, Raman spectroscopy has entered the biological and medical fields. It enables nondestructive analysis of structural details at the molecular level and has been used to study viruses and their constituents. Here, we used Raman spectroscopy to study echovirus 1 (EV1), a small, nonenveloped human pathogen, in two different uncoating states induced by heat treatments. Raman signals of capsid proteins and RNA genome were observed from the intact virus, the uncoating intermediate, and disrupted virions. Transmission electron microscopy data revealed general structural changes between the studied particles. Compared to spectral characteristics of proteins in the intact virion, those of the proteins of the heat-treated particles indicated reduced \u03b1-helix content with respect to \u03b2-sheets and coil structures. Changes observed in tryptophan and tyrosine signals suggest an increasingly hydrophilic environment around these residues. RNA signals revealed a change in the environment of the genome and in its conformation. The ionized-carbonyl vibrations showed small changes between the intact virion and the uncoating intermediate, which points to cleavage of salt bridges in the protein structure during the uncoating process. In conclusion, our data reveal distinguishable Raman signatures of the intact, intermediate, and disrupted EV1 particles. These changes indicate structural, chemical, and solute-solvent alterations in the genome and in the capsid proteins and lay the essential groundwork for investigating the uncoating of EV1 and related viruses in real time.\\n\\nIMPORTANCE: In order to combat virus infection, we need to know the details of virus uncoating. We present here the novel Raman signatures for opened and intact echovirus 1. This gives hope that the signatures may be used in the near future to evaluate the ambient conditions in endosomes leading to virus uncoating using, e.g., coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) imaging. These studies will complement structural studies on virus uncoating. In addition, Raman/CARS imaging offers the possibility of making dynamic live measurements in vitro and in cells which are impossible to measure by, for example, cryo-electron tomography. Furthermore, as viral Raman spectra can be overwhelmed with various contaminants, our study is highly relevant in demonstrating the importance of sample preparation for Raman spectroscopy in the field of virology.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium headspace above several military-grade explosives was sampled using solid phase microextraction fibers and the sorbed analytes determined using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD). The major vapors detected were the various isomers of dinitrotoluene (DNTs), dinitrobenzene (DNBs), and trinitrotoluene (TNTs), with 2,4-DNT and 1,3-DNB often predominating. Although 2,4,6-TNT made up from 50 to 99% of the solid explosive, it was only a minor component of the equilibrium vapor. The flux of chemical signatures from intact land mines is thought to originate from surface contamination and evolution of vapors via cracks in the casing and permeation through polymeric materials. The levels of external contamination were determined on a series of four types of Yugoslavian land mines (PMA-1A, PMA2, TMA5 and TMM1). The flux into air as a function of temperature was determined by placing several of these mines in Tedlar bags and measuring the mass accumulation on the walls of the bags after equilibrating the mine at one of five temperatures. TNT was a major component of the surface contamination on these mines, yet it accounted for less than 10% of the flux for the three plastic-cased mines, and about 33% from the metal antitank mine (TMM1). Either 2,4-DNT or 1,3-DNB produced the largest vapor flux from these four types of land mines. The environmental stability of the most important land mine signature chemicals was determined as a function of temperature by fortifying soils with low aqueous concentrations of a suite of these compounds and analyzing the remaining concentrations after various exposure times. The kinetics of loss was not of first order in analyte concentration, indicating that half-life is concentration dependent. At 23\u00b0C, the half life of 2,4,6-TNT, with an initial concentration of about 0.5 mg kg-1, was found to be only about 1 day. Under identical conditions, the half-life of 2,4-DNT was about 25 days. A research minefield was established and a number of these same four mine types were buried. Soil samples were collected around several of these mines at several time periods after burial and the concentration of signature chemicals determined by acetonitrile extraction and GC-ECD analysis. Relatively high concentrations of 2,4,6-TNT and 2,4-DNT were found to have accumulated beneath a TMA5 antitank mine, with lower concentrations in the soil layers between the mine and the surface. Signatures were distributed very heterogeneously in surface soils, and concentrations were very low (low \u03bcg kg-1 range). Lower, but detectable, concentrations of signatures were detectable irregularly in soils near the PMA-1A mines in contrast to the TMA5 mines. Concentrations of signature chemicals were generally below detection limits (< 1 \u03bcg kg-1) near the TMM1 and PMA-2 mines, even 8 months after burial. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",

METHODS: We undertook a transcriptomic approach with Affymetrix human U133 GeneChips to determine responsive and resistant gene signatures in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)-resistant MCF-7(Res) cells, respectively. Principal component and hierarchical clustering analyses demonstrated that the patterns of responsiveness between the 2 cell types differed clearly and were used to generate heat maps. Differentially regulated gene targets were validated with Q-RT-PCR and the biological impact upon proliferation measured. RESULTS: In untreated MCF-7(Res) cells, 163 genes were up-regulated and 274 down-regulated (with a log(2) ratio of >0.5) compared to the MCF-7 controls. Using the same gene expression threshold, 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment (100 nM, 6 h) of MCF-7 cells up-regulated 91 genes and down-regulated 5, whereas in MCF-7(Res), despite their resistance to the anti-proliferative effects, 156 genes were modulated with 91 being down-regulated. Strikingly, CYP24 was the only induced gene that was common to the genetic profiles of the 2 sets of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)-treated cells. Heat map analyses defined 2 sub-clusters of genes: (1) basal expression patterns associated with insensitivity towards 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) and (2) regulated expression patterns associated with 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) sensitivity. This latter cluster contained BAX, GADD45alpha, IGFBP-3, EGFR, MAPK4 and TGF-beta(2). Time course studies confirmed the 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) regulation of TGF-beta(2) in MCF-7 and non-tumourigenic MCF-12A cells but not in MCF-7(Res) cells. Co-treatment of MCF-7(Res) cells with exogenous TGF-beta(2) plus 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) enhanced anti-proliferative and vitamin D receptor transcriptional effects. CONCLUSIONS: Basal and regulated gene patterns can be used to predict and monitor the cellular response towards vitamin D(3) compounds and may possibly be applied as a further diagnostic tool.",

CR induces multiple changes, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we first performed a meta-analysis of microarray CR studies in mammals and identified genes and processes robustly altered due to CR. Our results reveal a complex array of CR-induced changes and we re-identified several genes and processes previously associated with CR, such as growth hormone signalling, lipid metabolism and immune response. Moreover, our results highlight novel associations with CR, such as retinol metabolism and copper ion detoxification, as well as hint of a strong effect of CR on circadian rhythms that in turn may contribute to metabolic changes. Analyses of our signatures by integrating co-expression data, information on genetic mutants, and transcription factor binding site analysis revealed candidate regulators of transcriptional modules in CR. Our results hint at a transcriptional module involved in sterol metabolism regulated by Srebf1. A putative regulatory role of Ppara was also identified. Overall, our conserved molecular signatures of CR provide a comprehensive picture of CR-induced changes and help understand its regulatory mechanisms.",

The multiplexed assay, which uses xMAP technology, consists of unique fluorescent microspheres covalently bound to species-specific fungal oligonucleotide probes. In the presence of the complementary target sequence, the probe hybridizes to its biotinylated target. Quantification of the reaction is based on the fluorescence signal of the reporter molecule that binds to the biotin moieties of the target. The assay can be expanded to include other microorganisms and has the capability to simultaneously test 100 different fungal probes per tube/well. The speed, flexibility in design, and high-throughput capability makes this assay an attractive diagnostic tool for fungal infections and other related maladies.",

        "abstract": "Starspots, just as Sunspots, are among the most obvious tracers and signatures of stellar surface magnetic activity. Emphasized already several decades ago as the origin for the rotationally modulated brightness of cool late-type stars, it is just now that we start to trace individual surface features in great enough detail to understand their magnetic behavior and interaction. Starspots also became the most important \u201cnoise\u201d for detecting extra-solar planets and could possibly be decisive when it comes to detect another Earth. Since this is not a review, and because indirect imaging techniques are covered in other papers in this volume, I focus in this paper on some specific detections of starspots and introduce four new facilities particularly suited for starspot research in the near future.",

        "abstract": "A viable class of magnetogenesis models can be constructed by coupling the kinetic term of the hypercharge to a spectator field whose dynamics does not affect the inflationary evolution. The magnetic power spectrum is explicitly related to the power spectrum of (adiabatic) curvature inhomogeneities when the quasi-de Sitter stage of expansion is driven by a single scalar degree of freedom. Depending upon the value of the slow-roll parameters, the amplitude of smoothed magnetic fields over a (comoving) Mpc scale can be as large as 0.01-0.1 nG at the epoch of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy. The contributions of the magnetic fields to the Sachs-Wolfe plateau and to the temperature autocorrelations in the Doppler region compare favourably with the constraints imposed by galactic magnetogenesis. Stimulating lessons are drawn on the interplay between magnetogenesis models and their possible CMB signatures. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Past studies have already shown that stars in open clusters are chemically homogeneous (e.g. De Silva et al. 2006, 2007 and 2009). These results support the idea that stars born from the same giant molecular cloud should have the same chemical composition. In this context, the chemical tagging technique was proposed by Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn 2002. The principle is to recover disrupted stellar clusters by looking only to the stellar chemical composition. In order to evaluate the feasibility of this approach, it is necessary to test if we can distinguish between stars born from different molecular clouds. For this purpose, we studied the chemical composition of stars in 32 old and intermediate-age open clusters, and we applied machine learning algorithms to recover the original cluster by only considering the chemical signatures.",

        "abstract": "Since the stacking order sensitively affects various physical properties of layered materials, accurate determination of the stacking order is important for studying the basic properties of these materials as well as for device applications. Because 2H-molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is most common in nature, most studies so far have focused on 2H-MoS2. However, we found that the 2H, 3R, and mixed stacking sequences exist in few-layer MoS2 exfoliated from natural molybdenite crystals. The crystal structures are confirmed by HR-TEM measurements. The Raman signatures of different polytypes are investigated by using three different excitation energies that are nonresonant and resonant with A and C excitons, respectively. The low-frequency breathing and shear modes show distinct differences for each polytype, whereas the high-frequency intralayer modes show little difference. For resonant excitations at 1.96 and 2.81 eV, distinct features are observed that enable determination of the stacking order.",

We measured aerosol cross sections by conducting a hard-target calibration of a light detection and ranging system (LIDAR) based on the Frequency Agile Laser (FAL). The elastic backscatter cross sections are estimated at 19 long-wave infrared (LWIR) wavelengths spanning the range from 9.23 to 10.696\ufffd\u03bcm. The theoretical modeling of the elastic backscatter cross sections is based on the measured refractive index and size distribution of the aerosols, which are used as inputs into Mie calculations. Both model calculations and experimental measurements show good agreement and also indicate the presence of spectral features based on single particle absorption in the backscatter cross sections that can be used as a basis for discrimination for both standoff and point sensors.",

Mechanisms that could give rise to a GW burster can be found for instance in highly magnetized neutron stars (the magnetars which explain the phenomenon of soft gamma repeaters), in accreting neutron stars and in hybrid stars with a quark core. We point out that these sources have very distinctive experimental signatures. In particular, as already observed in the gamma-ray bursts from soft gamma repeaters, the energy spectrum of the events is a power-law, dN\\sim E^{-\\gamma}dE with \\gamma\\simeq 1.6, and they have a distribution of waiting times (the times between one outburst and the next) significantly different from the distribution of uncorrelated events.

The signature lengths are calculated prior to performance based on their novelty in a predetermined locality within the score. The score following model is event based, but it also uses an inertial mechanism to pace itself in the presence of contradictory information. Results are derived from the output of the score follower using a graphical display that depicts the associations between performed notes and the score.

When the transmitter changes location, or if an attacker at a different location assumes the identity of the transmitter, the proposed link distinction algorithm reliably detects the change in the physical channel. This detection can be performed at a single receiver or collaboratively by multiple receivers.

Here, we perform hardware-accelerated kinetically-rigorous equilibrium simulations of fundamental monosaccharides to produce the hypothesis that pyranoses have microsecond-timescale kinetic puckering signatures in water, classified as unstable (rare in the glycome), metastable (infrequently observed) and stable (prevalent). The predicted \u03bcs-metastability of \u03b2-d-glucose explained hitherto irreconcilable experimental measurements.

Anne Ubersfeld's general observation regarding the lack of critical tools available for semiotic analysis of time compared with space is also discussed.

        "abstract": "The term \"transcriptional network\" refers to the mechanism(s) that underlies coordinated expression of genes, typically involving transcription factors (TFs) binding to the promoters of multiple genes, and individual genes controlled by multiple TFs. A multitude of studies in the last two decades have aimed to map and characterize transcriptional networks in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We review the methodologies and accomplishments of these studies, as well as challenges we now face. For most yeast TFs, data have been collected on their sequence preferences, in vivo promoter occupancy, and gene expression profiles in deletion mutants. These systematic studies have led to the identification of new regulators of numerous cellular functions and shed light on the overall organization of yeast gene regulation. However, many yeast TFs appear to be inactive under standard laboratory growth conditions, and many of the available data were collected using techniques that have since been improved. Perhaps as a consequence, comprehensive and accurate mapping among TF sequence preferences, promoter binding, and gene expression remains an open challenge. We propose that the time is ripe for renewed systematic efforts toward a complete mapping of yeast transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.",

Illumination of the key function(s) of p53 protein in protecting cells from becoming cancerous is therefore a worthy goal. Arguably p53's most important function is to act as a transcription factor that directly regulates perhaps several hundred of the cell's RNA polymerase II (RNAP II)-transcribed genes, and indirectly regulates thousands of others. Indeed p53 is the most well studied mammalian transcription factor. The p53 tetramer binds to its response element where it can recruit diverse transcriptional coregulators such as histone modifying enzymes, chromatin remodeling factors, subunits of the mediator complex, and components of general transcription machinery and preinitiation complex (PIC) to modulate RNAPII activity at target loci (Laptenko and Prives 2006). The p53 transcriptional program is regulated in a stimulus-specific fashion (Murray-Zmijewski et al. 2008; Vousden and Prives 2009), whereby distinct subsets of p53 target genes are induced in response to different p53-activating agents, likely allowing cells to tailor their response to different types of stress. How p53 is able to discriminate between these different loci is the subject of intense research. Here, we describe key aspects of the fundamentals of p53-mediated transcriptional regulation and target gene promoter selectivity.",

Mining these datasets for underlying biological knowledge has, however, remained a challenge. Results: A total of 3108 sequence signatures were found, each of which was shared by a set of guest proteins interacting with one of 944 host proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Approximately 94% of these sequence signatures matched entries in InterPro member databases. We identified 84 distinct sequence signatures from the remaining 172 unknown signatures. The signature sharing information was then applied in predicting sub-cellular localization of yeast proteins and the novel signatures were used in identifying possible interacting sites. Conclusion: We reported a method of PPI data mining that facilitated the discovery of novel sequence signatures using a large PPI dataset from S. cerevisiae genome as input. The fact that 94% of discovered signatures were known validated the ability of the approach to identify large numbers of signatures from PPI data. The significance of these discovered signatures was demonstrated by their application in predicting sub-cellular localizations and identifying potential interaction binding sites of yeast proteins.",

        "abstract": "The two ends of each protein are known as the amino (N-) and carboxyl (C-) termini. Short signatures in a protein's termini often carry vital cellular function. No systematic research has been conducted to address the importance of short signatures (3 to 10 amino acids) in protein termini at the proteomic level. Specifically, it is unknown whether such signatures are evolutionarily conserved, and if so, whether this conservation confers shared biological functions. Current signature detection methods fail to detect such short signatures due to inadequate statistical scores. The findings presented in this study strongly support the notion that functional significance of protein sets may be captured by short signatures at their termini. A positional search method was applied to over one million proteins from the UniProt database. The result is a collection of about a thousand significant signature groups (SIGs) that include previously identified as well as many novel signatures in protein termini. These SIGs represent protein sets with minimal or no overall sequence similarity excepting the similarity at their termini. The most significant SIGs are assigned by their strong correspondence to functional annotations derived from external databases such as Gene Ontology. Each of the SIGs is associated with the statistical significance of its functional association. These SIGs provide a valuable source for testing previously overlooked signatures in protein termini and allow for the investigation of the role played by such signatures throughout evolution.

These signatures have far-reaching implications for understanding genome evolution and potential application in classification of metagenomic sequence fragments. However, little is known regarding the distribution of genome signatures in natural microbial communities or the extent to which environmental factors shape them.\\n\\nRESULTS: We analyzed metagenomic sequence data from two acidophilic biofilm communities, including composite genomes reconstructed for nine archaea, three bacteria, and numerous associated viruses, as well as thousands of unassigned fragments from strain variants and low-abundance organisms. Genome signatures, in the form of tetranucleotide frequencies analyzed by emergent self-organizing maps, segregated sequences from all known populations sharing < 50 to 60% average amino acid identity and revealed previously unknown genomic clusters corresponding to low-abundance organisms and a putative plasmid. Signatures were pervasive genome-wide. Clusters were resolved because intra-genome differences resulting from translational selection or protein adaptation to the intracellular (pH approximately 5) versus extracellular (pH approximately 1) environment were small relative to inter-genome differences. We found that these genome signatures stem from multiple influences but are primarily manifested through codon composition, which we propose is the result of genome-specific mutational biases.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: An important conclusion is that shared environmental pressures and interactions among coevolving organisms do not obscure genome signatures in acid mine drainage communities. Thus, genome signatures can be used to assign sequence fragments to populations, an essential prerequisite if metagenomics is to provide ecological and biochemical insights into the functioning of microbial communities.",

It has long been argued that regulation of alternative splicing relies on combinatorial interactions between multiple proteins, and that tissue-specific splicing decisions most likely result from differences in the concentration and/or activity of these proteins. However, large-scale data to systematically address this issue have just recently started to become available. Here we show that splicing factor gene expression signatures can be identified that reflect cell type and tissue-specific patterns of alternative splicing. We used a computational approach to analyze microarray-based gene expression profiles of splicing factors from mouse, chimpanzee and human tissues. Our results show that brain and testis, the two tissues with highest levels of alternative splicing events, have the largest number of splicing factor genes that are most highly differentially expressed. We further identified SR protein kinases and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) proteins among the splicing factor genes that are most highly differentially expressed in a particular tissue. These results indicate the power of generating signature-based predictions as an initial computational approach into a global view of tissue-specific alternative splicing regulation.",

Nonfluent/agrammatic PPA was associated with predominantly left-sided and anterior tract alterations including uncinate fasciculus (UF) and subcortical projections; semantic variant PPA with bilateral alterations in inferior longitudinal fasciculus and UF; and logopenic variant PPA with bilateral but predominantly left-sided alterations in inferior longitudinal fasciculus, UF, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and subcortical projections. Tract alterations were more extensive than gray matter alterations, and the extent of alteration across tracts and PPA syndromes varied between diffusivity metrics. These WM signatures of PPA syndromes illustrate the selective vulnerability of brain language networks in these diseases and might have some pathologic specificity. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

Such stars are also likely to generate powerful winds which may initiate shocks in the same interstellar gas. In this paper, we consider whether chemical signatures of the passage of a shock through a hot core can be identified. We find that if hydrogenation occurs on surfaces and freeze-out of heavy gas-phase atoms and molecules is complete before the hot core is established then no such chemical signature exists. However, if some residual material is present in the gas when the hot core is established then the following molecular abundance ratios are significantly affected by the presence of a shock: NS/CS, SO/CS, and HCO/H2CO. This result is more evident if injection of ices into the gas occurs over a finite period, rather than instantaneously. We conclude that these molecular abundance ratios may be useful tracers of the dynamical history of hot cores, and that follow-up observational studies are required.",

Besides reasonably small signatures with 5600 bits for a 128-bit level of security, Bliss enables extremely fast signing and signature verification in software. However, due to the complex sampling of Gaussian noise with high precision, it is not clear whether this scheme can be mapped efficiently to embedded devices. Even though the authors of Bliss also proposed a new sampling algorithm using Bernoulli variables this approach is more complex than previous methods using large precomputed tables. The clear disadvantage of using large tables for high performance is that they cannot be used on constrained computing environments, such as {FPGAs}, with limited memory. In this work we thus present techniques for an efficient Cumulative Distribution Table ({CDT}) based Gaussian sampler on reconfigurable hardware involving Peikert\u2019s convolution lemma and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Based on our enhanced sampler design, we provide a first Bliss architecture for Xilinx Spartan-6 {FPGAs} that integrates fast {FFT}/{NTT}-based polynomial multiplication, sparse multiplication, and a Keccak hash function. Additionally, we compare the {CDT} with the Bernoulli approach and show that for the particular Bliss-I parameter set the improved {CDT} approach is faster with lower area consumption. Our core uses 2,431 slices, 7.5 {BRAMs}, and 6 {DSPs} and performs a signing operation in 126 \u03bcs on average. Verification takes even less with 70 \u03bcs.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify overlapping and unique grey (GM) and white matter (WM) signatures within the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) continuum, and discriminate likely FTLD-TAU and FTLD-TDP patients using structural and diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: T1-weighted and DT MRI were collected from 121 subjects: 35 motor neuron disease (MND), 14 behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, 12 semantic and 11 nonfluent primary progressive aphasia, 21 progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome patients, and 28 healthy controls. Patterns of GM atrophy were established using voxel-based morphometry. Tract-based spatial statistics was used to perform a WM voxelwise analysis of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy. RESULTS: In all clinical FTLD phenotypes, the pattern of WM damage was more distributed than that of GM atrophy. All patient groups, with the exception of MND cases with a pure motor syndrome, shared a focal GM atrophy centered around the dorsolateral and medial frontal cortex and a largely overlapping pattern of WM damage involving the genu and body of the corpus callosum and ventral frontotemporal and dorsal frontoparietal WM pathways. Surrounding this common area, phenotype (symptom)-specific GM and WM regions of damage were found in each group. CONCLUSIONS: In the FTLD spectrum, WM disruption is more severe than GM damage. Frontal cortex and WM pathways represent the common target of neurodegeneration in these conditions. The topographic pattern of damage supports a \"prion-like\" protein propagation through WM connections as underlying mechanism of the stereotyped progression of FTLD.",

        "abstract": "Chronic pain can be understood not only as an altered functional state, but also as a consequence of neuronal plasticity. Here we use in vivo structural MRI to compare global, local, and architectural changes in gray matter properties in patients suffering from chronic back pain (CBP), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and knee osteoarthritis (OA), relative to healthy controls. We find that different chronic pain types exhibit unique anatomical 'brain signatures'. Only the CBP group showed altered whole-brain gray matter volume, while regional gray matter density was distinct for each group. Voxel-wise comparison of gray matter density showed that the impact on the extent of chronicity of pain was localized to a common set of regions across all conditions. When gray matter density was examined for large regions approximating Brodmann areas, it exhibited unique large-scale distributed networks for each group. We derived a barcode, summarized by a single index of within-subject co-variation of gray matter density, which enabled classification of individual brains to their conditions with high accuracy. This index also enabled calculating time constants and asymptotic amplitudes for an exponential increase in brain re-organization with pain chronicity, and showed that brain reorganization with pain chronicity was 6 times slower and twice as large in CBP in comparison to CRPS. The results show an exuberance of brain anatomical reorganization peculiar to each condition and as such reflecting the unique maladaptive physiology of different types of chronic pain.",

However, little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal activity in the network that gives rise to voluntary action in humans. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and source analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a015, 7 female subjects) to investigate the spectral signatures of human cortical networks engaged in active and intrinsically motivated viewing behavior. We compared neuronal activity of externally cued saccades with saccades to freely chosen targets. For planning and execution of both saccade types, we found an increase in gamma band (~64-128\u00a0Hz) activity and a concurrent decrease in beta band (~12-32\u00a0Hz) activity in saccadic control areas, including the intraparietal sulcus and the frontal eye fields. Guided compared to voluntary actions were accompanied by stronger transient increases in the gamma and low frequency (<16\u00a0Hz) range immediately following the instructional cue. In contrast, action selection between competing alternatives was reflected by stronger sustained fronto-parietal gamma increases that occurred later in time and persisted until movement execution. This sustained enhancement for free target selection was accompanied by a spatially widespread reduction of lower frequency power (~8-45\u00a0Hz) in parietal and extrastriate areas. Our results suggest that neuronal population activity in the gamma frequency band in a distributed network of fronto-parietal areas reflects the intrinsically driven process of selection among competing behavioral alternatives.",

        "abstract": "Recently there has been an interest in zero-knowledge protocols with stronger properties, such as concurrency, simulation soundness, non-malleability, and universal composability. In this paper we show a novel technique to convert a large class of existing honest-verifier zero-knowledge protocols into ones with these stronger properties in the common reference string model. More precisely, our technique utilizes a signature scheme existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen-message attacks, and transforms any \u03a3-protocol (which is honest-verifier zero-knowledge) into a simulation sound concurrent zero-knowledge protocol. We also introduce \u03a9-protocols, a variant of \u03a3-protocols for which our technique further achieves the properties of non-malleability and/or universal composability. In addition to its conceptual simplicity, a main advantage of this new technique over previous ones is that it avoids the Cook-Levin theorem, which tends to be rather inefficient. Indeed, our technique allows for very efficient instantiation based on the security of some efficient signature schemes and standard number-theoretic assumptions. For instance, one instantiation of our technique yields a universally composable zero-knowledge protocol under the Strong RSA assumption, incurring an overhead of a small constant number of exponentiations, plus the generation of two signatures.",

        "abstract": "We model the electromagnetic emission signatures of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with an associated gas component. The method comprises numerical simulations of relativistic binaries and gas coupled with calculations of the physical properties of the emitting gas. We calculate the accretion powered UV/X-ray and Halpha light curves and the Halpha emission line profiles. The simulations have been carried out with a modified version of the parallel tree SPH code Gadget. The heating, cooling, and radiative processes for the solar metallicity gas have been calculated with the photoionization code Cloudy. We investigate gravitationally bound, sub-parsec binaries which have not yet entered the gravitational radiation phase. The results from the first set of calculations, carried out for a coplanar binary and gas disk, suggest that the outbursts in the X-ray light curve are pronounced during pericentric passages and can serve as a fingerprint for this type of binaries if periodic outbursts are a long lived signature of the binary. The Halpha emission-line profiles also offer strong indications of a binary presence and may be used as a criterion for selection of MBHB candidates for further monitoring from existing archival data. The orbital period and mass ratio of a binary could be determined from the Halpha light curves and profiles of carefully monitored candidates. Although systems with the orbital periods studied here are not within the frequency band of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), their discovery is important for understanding of the merger rates of MBHBs and the evolution of such binaries through the last parsec and towards the detectable gravitational wave window.",

However, the consequences of such changes on the distribution of an ego's network ties are not well understood. Here we use a unique 18-mo dataset that combines mobile phone calls and survey data to track changes in the ego networks and communication patterns of students making the transition from school to university or work. Our analysis reveals that individuals display a distinctive and robust social signature, captured by how interactions are distributed across different alters. Notably, for a given ego, these social signatures tend to persist over time, despite considerable turnover in the identity of alters in the ego network. Thus, as new network members are added, some old network members either are replaced or receive fewer calls, preserving the overall distribution of calls across network members. This is likely to reflect the consequences of finite resources such as the time available for communication, the cognitive and emotional effort required to sustain close relationships, and the ability to make emotional investments.",

Spectrographic chirps are found in signals produced from many biological and physical phenomena. In radar and sonar engineering, signals with chirps are used to localize direction and range to the signal source. Although characteristic frequency changes during epileptic seizures have long been observed, the correlation with chirps and chirp technology seems never to have been made. Methods: We analyzed 19 404 s (1870 s of which were from 43 seizures) of intracranially (subdural and depth electrode) recorded digital EEG from 6 patients for the presence of spectral chirps. Matched filters were constructed from methods in routine use in non-medical signal processing applications. Results: We found that chirps are very sensitive detectors of seizures (83%), and highly specific as markers (no false positive detections). The feasibility of using spectral chirps as matched filters was demonstrated. Conclusions: Chirps are highly specific and sensitive spectrographic signatures of epileptic seizure activity. In addition, chirps may serve as templates for matched filter design to detect seizures, and as such, can demonstrate localization and propagation of seizures from an epileptic focus.

Unavoidably, these recordings consist of a complex mixture of bio-magnetic signals from both mother and fetus. The acquired data include biological signals that are related to maternal and fetal heart function as well as fetal gross body and breathing movements. Since fetal breathing generates a significant source of bio-magnetic interference during these recordings, the goal of this study was to identify and quantify the signatures pertaining to fetal breathing movements (FBM). The fMEG signals were captured using superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) The existence of FBM was verified and recorded concurrently by an ultrasound-based video technique. This simultaneous recording is challenging since SQUIDs are extremely sensitive to magnetic signals and highly susceptible to interference from electronic equipment. For each recording, an ultrasound-FBM (UFBM) signal was extracted by tracing the displacement of the boundary defined by the fetal thorax frame by frame. The start of each FBM was identified by using the peak points of the UFBM signal. The bio-magnetic signals associated with FBM were obtained by averaging the bio-magnetic signals time locked to the FBMs. The results showed the existence of a distinctive sinusoidal signal pattern of FBM in fMEG data.",

Although their unique emission signatures are ideal for multiplexing, the full potential of these probes has not been realized because conventional analysis methods are inadequate. We report a novel spectral fitting method that exploits the entire spectral signature to quantitatively extract individual probe signals from multiplex spectra. We evaluate the method in a series of multiplex assays using unconjugated and antibody-conjugated composite organic-inorganic nanoparticles (COINs). Results show sensitive multiplex detection of small signals (<2% of total signal) and similar detection limits in corresponding 4-plex and singlet plate binding assays. In a triplex assay on formalin-fixed human prostate tissue, two antibody-conjugated COINs and a conventional fluorophore are used to image expression of prostate-specific antigen, cytokeratin-18, and DNA. The spectral analysis method effectively removes tissue autofluorescence and other unknown background, allowing accurate and reproducible imaging (area under ROC curve 0.89 +/- 0.03) at subcellular spatial resolution. In all assay systems, the error attributable to spectral analysis constitutes <or=2% of total signal. The spectral fitting method provides (1) quantification of signals from multiplex spectra with overlapping peaks, (2) robust spot-by-spot removal of unknown background, (3) the opportunity to quantitatively assess the analysis error, (4) elimination of operator bias, and (5) simple automation appropriate for high-throughput analysis. The simple implementation and universal applicability of this approach significantly expands the potential of Raman probes for quantitative in vivo and ex vivo multiplex analysis.",

In colorectal cancer, the presence of cells involved with T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity predicts survival better than the current staging method. We used the expression of genes recently associated with host immune responses (T(H1)-mediated adaptive immunity, inflammation, and immune suppression) to perform hierarchical clustering of multiple large cohorts of cancer specimens to determine if immune-related gene expression resulted in clinical significant groupings of tumors. Microarray data from prostate cancer (n = 79), breast cancer (n = 132), lung cancer (n = 84), glioblastoma multiforme (n = 120), and lymphoma (n = 127) were analyzed. Among adenocarcinomas, the T(H1)-mediated adaptive immunity genes were consistently associated with better prognosis, while genes associated with inflammation and immune suppression were variably associated with outcome. Specifically, increased expression of the T(H1)-mediated adaptive immunity genes was associated with good prognosis in breast cancer patients under 45 years of age (p = .04, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.42) and in prostate cancer patients (p = .03, HR = 0.36) but not in lung cancer patients (p = 0.45, HR = 1.37). In lymphoma, patients with increased expression of inflammation and immune suppression genes had better prognosis than those expressing the T(H1)-mediated adaptive immunity genes (p = .01, HR = 0.43) and in glioblastoma multiforme, the expression of inflammation genes conferred improved prognosis than those expressing immune suppression genes (p = 0.05, HR = 0.62). In aggregate, the gene expression signatures implicating specific components of the immune response hold prognostic import across solid tumors.",

        "abstract": "We study models of gauge mediated SUSY breaking with more than one hidden sector. In these models the neutralino sector of the MSSM is supplemented with additional light neutral fermions, the nearly massless gravitino and the massive pseudo-goldstini. For the case where the Bino is the lightest ordinary SUSY particle, its preferred decay is to a photon and the heaviest pseudo-goldstino, which generically cascades down to lighter pseudo-goldstini, or to the gravitino, in association with photons. This gives rise to multiphoton plus missing energy signatures at the LHC. We investigate in detail simplified models where the SUSY spectrum consists of the right-handed sleptons, a Bino-like neutralino, the pseudo-goldstini and the gravitino. We compare against existing LHC searches and show that the sensitivity to our models could be significantly improved by relaxing the kinematic cuts and requiring additional final state particles. We propose inclusive searches in the final state with at least three photons plus missing energy and in the final state with at least two photons plus two leptons plus missing energy, the former being sensitive to any production mode and the latter being optimized for slepton pair production. We show that they could lead to an observation (or strong constraints) already with the data set from LHC Run I, and present prospects for LHC Run II.",

Little knowledge of the biological differences is available to predict EC outcomes besides their pathological distinctions. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a family of non-translated RNAs important in regulating oncogenic pathways. Mis-expression patterns of miRNAs in EC, as well as differences in miRNA expression patterns between the subtypes of EC, has not been previously evaluated. Our purpose was to identify miRNA profiles of EC subtypes, and to identify miRNAs associated with these subtypes to ultimately understand the different biological behavior between these subtypes. Methods: Ninety-five fresh/frozen and paraffin-embedded samples of endometrial type I and II cancer, carcinosarcomas and benign endometrial samples were collected. MiRNA expression profiles were evaluated by microarray analysis. Statistical analysis was performed. Results: Distinct miRNA signatures in tumor versus normal samples and in endometrioid vs. uterine papillary serous carcinomas exist. Additionally, carcinosarcomas have a unique miRNA signature from either the type I or II epithelial tumors. Conclusions: We hypothesize that further understanding the miRNAs that separate these subtypes of EC will lead to biological insights into the different behavior of these tumors. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

        "title": "Molecular signatures of thyroid follicular neoplasia",
        "abstract": "The molecular pathways leading to thyroid follicular neoplasia are incompletely understood, and the diagnosis of follicular tumors is a clinical challenge. To provide leads to the pathogenesis and diagnosis of the tumors, we examined the global transcriptome signatures of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FC) and normofollicular adenoma (FA) as well as fetal/microFA (fetal adenoma). Carcinomas were strongly enriched in transcripts encoding proteins involved in DNA replication and mitosis corresponding to increased number of proliferating cells and depleted number of transcripts encoding factors involved in growth arrest and apoptosis. In the latter group, the combined loss of transcripts encoding the nuclear orphan receptors NR4A1 and NR4A3, which were recently shown to play a causal role in hematopoetic neoplasia, was noteworthy. The analysis of differentially expressed transcripts provided a mechanism for cancer progression, which is why we exploited the results in order to generate a molecular classifier that could identify 95% of all carcinomas. Validation employing public domain and cross-platform data demonstrated that the signature was robust and could diagnose follicular nodules originating from different geographical locations and platforms with similar accuracy. We came to the conclusion that down-regulation of factors involved in growth arrest and apoptosis may represent a decisive step in the pathogenesis of FC. Moreover, the described molecular pathways provide an accurate and robust genetic signature for the diagnosis of FA and FC.",

        "abstract": "Cancer-induced cachexia is a complex and poorly understood life-threatening syndrome that is characterized by progressive weight loss due to metabolic alterations, depletion of lipid stores, and severe loss of skeletal muscle protein. Gaining the ability to noninvasively image the presence or onset of cachexia is important to better treat this condition, to improve the design and optimization of therapeutic strategies, and to detect the responses to such treatments. In this study, we employed noninvasive magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) to identify metabolic signatures typical of cachectic tumors, using this information to analyze the types and extents of metabolic changes induced by the onset of cachexia in normal tissues. Cachexia was confirmed by weight loss as well as analyses of muscle tissue and serum. In vivo, cachexia-inducing murine adenocarcinoma (MAC)16 tumors were characterized by higher total choline (tCho) and higher (18)FDG uptake than histologically similar noncachectic MAC13 tumors. A profound depletion of the lipid signal was observed in normal tissue of MAC16 tumor-bearing mice but not within the tumor tissue itself. High-resolution (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) confirmed the high tCho level observed in cachectic tumors that occurred because of an increase of free choline and phosphocholine. Higher succinate and lower creatine levels were also detected in cachectic tumors. Taken together, these findings enhance our understanding of the effect of cancer on host organs and tissues as well as promote the development of noninvasive biomarkers for the presence of cachexia and identification of new therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial DNA has been found in coronary plaques and it has therefore been concluded that bacteria may play a role as trigger factors in the chronic inflammatory process underlying coronary atherosclerosis. However, the microbial spectrum is complex and it is not known whether microorganisms other than bacteria are involved in coronary disease. Fungal 18S rDNA signatures were systematically investigated in atherosclerotic tissue obtained through catheter-based atherectomy of 38 patients and controls (unaffected coronary arteries) using clone libraries, denaturating gradient gel analysis (DGGE), in situ hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Fungal DNA was found in 35 of 38 (92.11%) coronary heart disease patients by either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with universal primers or in situ hybridization analysis (n = 5), but not in any control sample. In a clone library with more than 350 sequenced clones from pooled patient DNA, an overall richness of 19 different fungal phylotypes could be observed. Fungal profiles of coronary heart disease patients obtained by DGGE analysis showed a median richness of fungal species of 5 (range from 2 to 9) with a high interindividual variability (mean similarity 18.83%). For the first time, the presence of fungal components in atherosclerotic plaques has been demonstrated. Coronary atheromatous plaques harbour diverse and variable fungal communities suggesting a polymicrobial contribution to the chronic inflammatory aetiology.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Tumor gene expression signatures have been used to classify, prognosticate, and predict chemotherapy sensitivity in breast cancer, although almost all efforts have been focused on the unchallenged baseline tumor. Most cancer patients receive systemic therapy, and exposure to drug may modify the tumor's short-term and long-term outcomes. Drug-induced tumor gene signatures may thus be more predictive of treatment outcomes than the unperturbed tumor gene signatures.\\n\\nMETHODS: Using a set of 47 breast cancer patients, we obtained paired prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy tumor biopsies and developed gene panels of baseline tumor (T1), postchemotherapy tumor (T2), and chemotherapy-induced relative change signatures (TDelta) to predict pathological response and progression-free survival (PFS). The signatures were validated in two independent test sets with paired prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy tumor samples, comprising of 18-20 patients each.\\n\\nRESULTS: T2 and TDelta were superior to T1 signatures in predicting for PFS (area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic 0.770 and 0.660 vs. 0.530) and pathological response (area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic 0.631 and 0.462 vs. 0.446) in the validation sets. In multivariate analysis for PFS with other clinical predictors, T2, but not T1, signatures remained as significant independent predictors.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Postchemotherapy tumor gene signatures outperformed baseline signatures and clinical predictors in predicting for pathological response and PFS, independent of clinical and pathological response to chemotherapy. Drug-induced tumor gene signatures may be more informative than unchallenged signatures in predicting treatment outcomes. These findings challenge the current practice of relying only on the baseline tumor to predict outcome, which overlooks the contributions of therapeutic interventions.",

We describe an anatomically comprehensive atlas of the mid-gestational human brain, including de novo reference atlases, in situ hybridization, ultra-high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and microarray analysis on highly discrete laser-microdissected brain regions. In developing cerebral cortex, transcriptional differences are found between different proliferative and post-mitotic layers, wherein laminar signatures reflect cellular composition and developmental processes. Cytoarchitectural differences between human and mouse have molecular correlates, including species differences in gene expression in subplate, although surprisingly we find minimal differences between the inner and outer subventricular zones even though the outer zone is expanded in humans. Both germinal and post-mitotic cortical layers exhibit fronto-temporal gradients, with particular enrichment in the frontal lobe. Finally, many neurodevelopmental disorder and human-evolution-related genes show patterned expression, potentially underlying unique features of human cortical formation.

The signatures of regime shifts in gene expression dynamics are less systematically investigated. In this paper, we consider sudden regime shifts in the gene expression dynamics described by a fold-bifurcation model involving bistability and hysteresis. We consider two alternative models, models 1 and 2, of competence development in the bacterial population B. subtilis and determine some early signatures of the regime shifts between competence and noncompetence. We use both deterministic and stochastic formalisms for the purpose of our study. The early signatures studied include the critical slowing down as a transition point is approached, rising variance and the lag-1 autocorrelation function, skewness and a ratio of two mean first passage times. Some of the signatures could provide the experimental basis for distinguishing between bistability and excitability as the correct mechanism for the development of competence.",

Two different extensions were experimented: the weighted VBC (WVBC) scheme and the aggregate VBC (AVBC) scheme. For both, analytical bounds of the additional storage for the term frequencies were derived. The upper and lower bounds of WVBC signatures were better than the corresponding bounds for AVBC signatures. In general, these bounds are functions of the word size (in bits) of the term frequencies. Therefore, term frequencies were scaled to reduce the word size. Experiments showed that the additional storage cost is closer to the lower than the upper bound for both WVBC and AVBC signatures. In addition, WVBC signatures were better than AVBC signatures in terms of storage and retrieval speed. Logarithmic scaling was found to be significantly better than linear scaling, in measuring the agreement of document ranking against the case without scaling, using the Kendall rank-order correlation. If a 75% ranking performance is acceptable, then the additional storage of the term frequencies is only 3.4% of all the indexed documents.",

In this study, analyses of whole genome sequences of the HIV-1 subtype B, a retrovirus that caused global pandemic of AIDS, have been carried out to analyse the variation in genome signatures of the virus from 1983 to 2007.

        "abstract": "Several genome-wide transcriptome studies have shown that chronic inflammatory responses generally taking place in the inflamed tissue are also reflected at the level of peripheral blood leukocytes. Blood monocytes are highly sensitized cell type continuously activated under inflammatory conditions. For a better understanding of the transcriptional imprinting influenced by a multitude of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, we established a whole blood in vitro system to explore cell- and stimulus-specific gene expression signatures in peripheral monocytes. In an explorative study, whole blood from healthy donors was stimulated with tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 1.5 h. Subsequently, monocytes were isolated with a purity of >99% by high-speed fluorescence activated cell sorting. Transcriptional changes were explored by whole genome Affymetrix arrays using highly validated filtering algorithm to identify differentially expressed genes. In vitro stimulation of whole blood samples with TNF-\u03b1 and LPS resulted in 4,529 and 5,036 differentially expressed genes, respectively. Although both stimuli induced similar inflammatory profiles in monocytes, TNF-\u03b1- or LPS-specific gene signatures were characterized. Functional classification identified significant numbers of differentially expressed cytokines, cytokine receptors and apoptosis-associated genes. To our knowledge, this is the first study presenting cell- and stimulus-specific gene expression signatures that can be used to decipher complex disease specific profiles of acute and chronic inflammation. Once a library of signatures from the most important inflammatory mediators is defined, it can be helpful to identify those signatures, which are predominantly driving the disease pathogenesis and which are of potential interest for a therapeutical intervention.",

Ecologists interested in ecosystem engineering study environmental change caused by biota and the consequences for the engineer, other organisms, and ecological processes. The interface is geomorphological change, an interface both are aware of but study somewhat independently and differently. Interaction and integration among the two fields is the goal of this special issue. Here I take an ecological perspective of geomorphological change caused by ecosystem engineers in patches within landscapes that I hope can help facilitate this goal. I ask the following general questions: When will an ecosystem engineering species create a geomorphological signature in a landscape? What, in qualitative terms, is such a signature? How can the signature be estimated and how long will it last? What engineer attributes and ecological factors will determine signature change? What creates complications? How do the answers inform whether or not life leaves a geomorphological signature? To attempt answers, I develop a provisional, general theory of ecosystem engineering signatures that draws on and integrates a geomorphological foundation of balance between formation and decay; landscape patch dynamics; a general framework for ecosystem engineering; and empirical studies. I treat a landscape engineering signature as the balance of rates of formation (F) and rates of decay (D) across patches whose ratio value (F/D) can be transformed (> 1), intermediate (1) or untransformed (< 1). I suggest amenable systems for study. I describe how the signature can be estimated and evaluated for potential persistence, and how to identify when decay or engineer density and per capita engineering activity control the signature. I examine the influences on shifts from transformed to untransformed signatures, and vice versa, at constant and changing rates of decay. I show how the likelihood of signature shifts depends on: 1. engineer density in the landscape and per patch; 2. per capita engineering activity as structure per patch and patches per engineer, or its contribution for engineers occurring in groups; 3. the degree of patch maintenance, abandonment, and re-engineering of abandoned patches; and in some situations, 4. the direction of the signature shift that is considered. I use this to illustrate how different ecological factors affecting engineer species (e.g., abiotic resources and conditions, natural enemies) and engineer feedbacks can drive signature transitions. I address complications and how they might be dealt with for situations where an engineer species causes formation and decay; when multiple engineering species co-occur; and when patches are materially interconnected. I end by considering whether life leaves a geomorphological signature, using this to contrast my approach with biogeomorphology, and asking what a hypothetical analysis of signature patterns across many engineer species/landscape combinations might imply for the interface of ecology and biogeomorphology. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

A number of algorithms have been developed to predict common cis-regulatory elements for co-regulated genes with similar expression patterns. However, previous methods usually deal with disjoint gene groups partitioned or clustered by arbitrary cutoffs, which might cause information losses. To preclude the defining step of gene set, we adopted enrichment analysis and termed the method binding site enrichment analysis (BSEA). BSEA was first applied for publicly available ChIP-on-chip data of c-MYC, MAX and E2F transcription factors, identifying significant enrichment for signatures of corresponding factors and potential co-activators. Using time-scaled expression profiling of 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, we observed enrichment for signatures of known adipogenic factors such as C/EBPalpha, C/EBPbeta and PPARgamma, temporally coincident with previous reports. BSEA was also applied to tissue-specific expression profiles of human and mouse, identifying well-known tissue-specific transcription factors such as HNF-4 in liver and MEF-2 in heart along with other putative tissue-specific regulators. With extended versatility coping with various kinds of microarray dataset, BSEA can identify key regulators for global microarray data in which transcriptional regulation plays a major role. As a generalized method, BSEA would help to elucidate the transcriptional regulatory networks, the primary challenges in functional genomics.",

        "abstract": "Most cancer treatments benefit only a minority of patients. This has led to a widespread interest in the identification of gene-expression-based prognostic signatures. Well-developed and validated genomic signatures can lead to personalized treatment decisions resulting in improved patient management. However, the pace of acceptance of these signatures in clinical practice has been slow. This is because many of the signatures have been developed without clear focus on the intended clinical use, and proper independent validation studies establishing their medical utility have rarely been performed. The practicing physician and the patient are thus left in doubt about the reliability and medical utility of the signatures. We aim to provide guidance to physicians in critically evaluating published studies on prognostic gene-expression signatures so that they are better equipped to decide which signatures, if any, have sufficient merit for use, in conjunction with other factors in helping their patients to make good treatment decisions. A discussion of the lessons to be learned from the successful development of the Oncotype DX genetic test for breast cancer is presented and contrasted with a review of the current status of prognostic gene-expression signatures in non-small-cell lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "Elemental abundance studies of solar twin stars suggest that the solar chemical composition contains signatures of the formation of terrestrial planets in the solar system, namely small but significant depletions of the refractory elements. To test this hypothesis, we study stars which, compared to solar twins, have less massive convective envelopes (therefore increasing the amplitude of the predicted effect) or are, arguably, more likely to host planets (thus increasing the frequency of signature detections). We measure relative atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of a late-F type dwarf sample (52 stars) and a sample of metal-rich solar analogs (59 stars). We detect refractory-element depletions with amplitudes up to about 0.15 dex. The distribution of depletion amplitudes for stars known to host gas giant planets is not different from that of the rest of stars. The maximum amplitude of depletion increases with effective temperature from 5650 K to 5950 K, while it appears to be constant for warmer stars (up to 6300 K). The depletions observed in solar twin stars have a maximum amplitude that is very similar to that seen here for both of our samples. Gas giant planet formation alone cannot explain the observed distributions of refractory-element depletions, leaving the formation of rocky material as a more likely explanation of our observations. More rocky material is necessary to explain the data of solar twins than metal-rich stars, and less for warm stars. However, the sizes of the stars' convective envelopes at the time of planet formation could be regulating these amplitudes. Our results could be explained if disk lifetimes were shorter in more massive stars, as independent observations indeed seem to suggest.",

        "abstract": "To better understand dynamic disease processes, integrated multi-omic methods are needed, yet comparing different types of omic data remains difficult. Integrative solutions benefit experimenters by eliminating potential biases that come with single omic analysis. We have developed the methods needed to explore whether a relationship exists between co-expression network models built from transcriptomic and proteomic data types, and whether this relationship can be used to improve the disease signature discovery process. A naive, correlation based method is utilized for comparison. Using publicly available infectious disease time series data, we analyzed the related co-expression structure of the transcriptome and proteome in response to SARS-CoV infection in mice. Transcript and peptide expression data was filtered using quality scores and subset by taking the intersection on mapped Entrez IDs. Using this data set, independent co-expression networks were built. The networks were integrated by constructing a bipartite module graph based on module member overlap, module summary correlation, and correlation to phenotypes of interest. Compared to the module level results, the naive approach is hindered by a lack of correlation across data types, less significant enrichment results, and little functional overlap across data types. Our module graph approach avoids these problems, resulting in an integrated omic signature of disease progression, which allows prioritization across data types for down-stream experiment planning. Integrated modules exhibited related functional enrichments and could suggest novel interactions in response to infection. These disease and platform-independent methods can be used to realize the full potential of multi-omic network signatures. The data (experiment SM001) are publically available through the NIAID Systems Virology (https://www.systemsvirology.org) and PNNL (http://omics.pnl.gov) web portals.

        "abstract": "The majority of transformers currently in service worldwide were installed prior to 1980, and consequently most of them are approaching or have already exceeded their design lifetimes [1], [2]. This poses a significant risk for utilities and other power network stakeholders, since the impact of in-service transformer failure can be catastrophic. One of the most serious problems with an in-service transformer is movement of its windings due to electromagnetic forces generated during short-circuit faults. Reduction of clamping pressure due to insulation aging can also cause winding movement and may result in an explosion [3]\u2013[6]. There are many causes of mechanical faults, e.g., earthquake, explosion of combustible gas in the transformer oil, short-circuit currents, and careless transportation [7], [8]. While a transformer with minor winding deformation may continue to work satisfactorily, its capability to withstand further mechanical or electrical faults will gradually decrease [9]. Therefore it is essential to detect any minor winding deformation as soon as possible and to take appropriate remedial action. Winding deformation has various forms, e.g., spiral tightening, conductor tilting, radial/hoop buckling, shorted or open turns, loosened clamping structures, axial displacement, core movement, and collapse of the winding end supports. It is difficult to differentiate between these internal faults using conventional testing methods [10]. In this article data obtained using a high-frequency, distributed- parameter model to simulate a power transformer are presented. Mechanical faults such as axial displacement, radial buckling, disk space variation, loss of clamping, and bushing and leakage faults were simulated by modifying the relevant electrical parameters in the transformer model or by reconfiguring the affected disks in a 3-D transformer finite element model. It is suggested that the resulting data could be used in the formulation of standard codes for interpretation of the frequency response analysis signatures of power transformers.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) is a dose-limiting factor in curative radiation therapy (RT) for liver cancers, making early detection of radiation-associated liver injury absolutely essential for medical intervention. A metabolomic approach was used to determine metabolic signatures that could serve as biomarkers for early detection of RILD in mice.\\n\\nMETHODS: Anesthetized C57BL/6 mice received 0, 10 or 50 Gy Whole Liver Irradiation (WLI) and were contrasted to mice, which received 10 Gy whole body irradiation (WBI). Liver and plasma samples were collected at 24 hours after irradiation. The samples were processed using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry and Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry.\\n\\nRESULTS: Twenty four hours after WLI, 407 metabolites were detected in liver samples while 347 metabolites were detected in plasma. Plasma metabolites associated with 50 Gy WLI included several amino acids, purine and pyrimidine metabolites, microbial metabolites, and most prominently bradykinin and 3-indoxyl-sulfate. Liver metabolites associated with 50 Gy WLI included pentose phosphate, purine, and pyrimidine metabolites in liver. Plasma biomarkers in common between WLI and WBI were enriched in microbial metabolites such as 3 indoxyl sulfate, indole-3-lactic acid, phenyllactic acid, pipecolic acid, hippuric acid, and markers of DNA damage such as 2-deoxyuridine. Metabolites associated with tryptophan and indoles may reflect radiation-induced gut microbiome effects. Predominant liver biomarkers in common between WBI and WLI were amino acids, sugars, TCA metabolites (fumarate), fatty acids (lineolate, n-hexadecanoic acid) and DNA damage markers (uridine).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified a set of metabolomic markers that may prove useful as plasma biomarkers of RILD and WBI. Pathway analysis also suggested that the unique metabolic changes observed after liver irradiation was an integrative response of the intestine, liver and kidney.",

While the direct detection of individual Pop III stars will likely remain beyond reach for decades to come, we show their supernova remnants may soon be detectable in the radio. We calculate radio synchrotron signatures between 0.5 - 35 GHz from hydrodynamical computations of the supernova remnants of Pop III stars in minihaloes. We find that hypernovae yield the brightest systems, with observed radio fluxes as high as 1 - 10 muJy. Less energetic Type II supernovae yield remnants about a factor of 30 dimmer and pair-instability supernova remnants are dimmer by a factor of more than 10,000. Hypernovae radio remnants should be detectable by existing radio facilities like eVLA and eMERLIN while Type II supernova remnants will require the Square Kilometre Array. The number counts of hypernova remnants at z > 20 with fluxes above 1 muJy are expected to be one per fifty square degree field, increasing to a few per square degree if they form down to z = 10. The detection of a z > 20 Type II supernova remnant brighter than 1 nJy would require a 200 - 300 square degree field, although only a 1 - 2 square degree field for those forming down to z = 10. Hypernova and Type II supernova remnants are easily distinguishable from one another by their light curves, which will enable future surveys to use them to constrain the initial mass function of Pop III stars.",

        "abstract": "Emotions are accompanied by changes of autonomic nervous function such as palpitations or sweating. Similarly, it has been demonstrated for many psychiatric diseases that autonomic function is shifted to sympathetic or parasympathetic predominance. We will address questions regarding the specificity of autonomic changes in disorders including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental conditions. In particular, measures of autonomic function, notably heart rate variability, but also including electrodermal activity, cortisol measurements or cardiorespiratory function, will be presented in relation to specific psychological conditions. The strength of evidence for distinct autonomic endo-phenotypes is a theme within each presentation. Furthermore, we describe the present knowledge regarding central correlates of these differences and abnormalities and summarize the evidence for clinical consequences, since autonomic dysfunction is presumed to interfere with life expectancy and cardiac mortality. Within the symposium presentations, Critchley and Nagai will review associations between physiological states mediated autonomically and the brain mechanisms through which autonomic responses are controlled in health and psychiatric disorders, with particular reference to anxiety. Baer will give an account of physiological signatures and associations of psychosis (and those at risk for psychosis) highlighting the relatively overlooked role of respiratory control. For the spectrum of depressive psychopathology, Ottaviani and Shapiro) will examine specific autonomic regulation and dysregulation that they link empirically to rumination and mood control. Licht (de Geus and Penninx) will describe powerful longitudinal data from NESDA population study of depression and anxiety, which highlights the role of antidepressant medication on suppression of heart rate variability measured as respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Lastly, Harrison (Beacher, Gray, Nagai and Critchley) will revisit reported associations between neurodevelopmental conditions (autism, Tourette Syndrome and ADHD) and autonomic functions, in which constitutional factors arguably may dominate interactions between psychological symptoms and physiological responsivity. In conclusion, the symposium will provide a platform for consensus and debate with respect to the presence and meaning of autonomic abnormalities in psychiatric disorders and their relevance to therapeutic intervention",

        "abstract": "We explore the MSSM with nine free parameters (p9MSSM) that have been selected as a minimum set that allows an investigation of neutralino dark matter and collider signatures while maintaining consistency with several constraints. These include measurement of the dark matter relic density from PLANCK, main properties of the discovered Higgs boson, LHC direct supersymmetry searches, recent evidence for a Standard Model-like branchingratioBR(Bs\u2192\u03bc+\u03bc-), and the measurement of \u03b4(g-2)\u03bc, plus a number of other electroweak and flavor physics constraints. We perform a simulation of two LHC direct supersymmetry searches at s=8TeV: the CMS inclusive \u03b1T search for squarks and gluinos and the CMS electroweak production search with 3l+ETmiss in the final state. We use the latter to identify the regions of the parameter space, consistent at 2\u03c3 with \u03b4(g-2)\u03bc, that are not excluded by the direct limits from the electroweak production. We find that they correspond to a neutralino mass in the window 200GeV\u2272m\u03c7\u2272500GeV. We also implement the likelihood for the XENON100 exclusion bound, in which we consider for the first time the impact of a recent determination of the \u03a3\u03c0N term from CHAOS data, \u03a3\u03c0N=43\u00b112MeV. We show that in light of this measurement, the present statistical impact of the XENON100 bound is greatly reduced, although future sensitivities of the LUX and XENON1T experiments will have decisive impact on the mixed bino/Higgsino composition of the neutralino. We point out some tension between the constraints from \u03b4(g-2)\u03bc and XENON100. Finally, we present prospects for various indirect searches of dark matter, namely \u03b3-ray fluxes from dSphs and the Galactic Center at Fermi-LAT, and the positron flux at AMS02. We also show the five-year sensitivity on the spin-dependent neutralino-proton cross section due to neutrino fluxes from the Sun at IceCube.",

        "abstract": "Turbulence is ubiquitous in many astrophysical systems like galaxies, galaxy clusters and possibly even the IGM filaments. We study fluctuation dynamo action in turbulent systems focusing on one observational signature; the Faraday rotation measure (RM) from background radio sources seen through the magnetic field generated by such a dynamo. We simulate the fluctuation dynamo (FD) in periodic boxes up to resolutions of 512^3, with varying fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers, and measure the resulting random RMs. We show that, even though the magnetic field generated is intermittent, it still allows for contributions to the RM to be significant. When the dynamo saturates, it is of order 40%-50% of the value expected in a model where fields of strength B_rms uniformly fill cells of the largest turbulent eddy but are randomly oriented from one cell to another. This level of RM dispersion obtains across different values of magnetic Reynolds number and Prandtl number explored. We also use the random RMs to probe the structure of the generated fields to distinguish the contribution from intense and diffuse field regions. We find that the strong field regions (say with B > 2B_rms) contribute only of order 15%-20% to the RM. Thus rare structures do not dominate the RM; rather the general 'sea' of volume filling fluctuating fields are the dominant contributors. We also show that the magnetic integral scale, L_{int}, which is directly related to the RM dispersion, increases in all the runs, as Lorentz forces become important to saturate the dynamo. It appears that due to the ordering effect of the Lorentz forces, L_{int} of the saturated field tends to a modest fraction, 1/2-1/3 of the integral scale of the velocity field, for all our runs. These results are then applied to discuss the RM signatures of FD generated fields in young galaxies, galaxy clusters and intergalactic filaments.",

APPROACH AND RESULTS: A total of 35 genes were differentially expressed in cases with CHD versus controls at false discovery rate<0.5, including GZMB, TMEM56, and GUK1. Cluster analysis revealed 3 gene clusters associated with CHD, 2 linked to increased erythrocyte production and a third to reduced natural killer and T cell activity in cases with CHD. Exon-level results corroborated and extended the gene-level results. Alternative splicing analysis suggested that GUK1 and 38 other genes were differentially spliced in cases with CHD versus controls. Gene Ontology analysis linked ubiquitination and T-cell-related pathways with CHD. CONCLUSIONS: Two bioinformatically defined groups of genes show consistent associations with CHD. Our findings are consistent with the hypotheses that hematopoesis is upregulated in CHD, possibly reflecting a compensatory mechanism, and that innate immune activity is disrupted in CHD or altered by its treatment. Transcriptomic signatures may be useful in identifying pathways associated with CHD and point toward novel therapeutic targets for its treatment and prevention.",

We present a method to construct a bending invariant signature for such surfaces. This invariant representation is an embedding of the geometric structure of the surface in a small dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are approximated by Euclidean ones. The bending invariant representation is constructed by first measuring the intergeodesic distances between uniformly distributed points on the surface. Next, a multidimensional scaling technique is applied to extract coordinates in a finite dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are replaced by Euclidean ones. Applying this transform to various surfaces with similar geodesic structures (first fundamental form) maps them into similar signature surfaces. We thereby translate the problem of matching nonrigid objects in various postures into a simpler problem of matching rigid objects. As an example, we show a simple surface classification method that uses our bending invariant signatures.",

Otherwise, if the planet is experienced a shallow tangential collision, it flews safety away. At the same time, the planets loss some part of their gas envelopes during mutual collisions. Collisions of the giant planets must be accompanied also by the radiation of energy from the radio to optical bands. The optical and near UV flashes result from the collision heating of the planet surface layers. Additionally, the collision compression and collapse of the powerful magnetosphere of giant planets are possible, with a successive generation of the radio bursts.

Using similar approaches, it is possible to detect a tendency of sense and antisense siRNAs to overlap over 19 nucleotides. Thus, the so-called overlap signature which describes the tendency of small RNA to map in a specific way relative to each other has become the approach of choice to identify and characterize specific classes of small RNAs.

Mutations in a number of genes are associated with FTD, although until recently only two [progranulin (GRN) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT)] were known to be major causes of the disease. This review describes recent progress in identifying clinical and neuroanatomical phenotypes associated with autosomal-dominant FTD. Recent findings Around a third to a half of FTD patients have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Up to 10% of patients have a mutation in GRN and a similar proportion have a mutation in MAPT. Recently a group of patients have been shown to have a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the noncoding region of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72). A further group of patients have an autosomal dominant family history but no mutations in any of the known genes including a group of patients who have the same pathology as GRN mutations (type A TDP-43 pathology) but are negative for GRN mutations. Clinical phenotypes vary across the different mutations. Neuroimaging studies show that GRN and MAPT mutations have distinct patterns of atrophy - asymmetric fronto-temporo-parietal atrophy with GRN versus relatively symmetric medial temporal and orbitofrontal lobe atrophy with MAPT mutations. Neuroimaging of patients with an expansion in C9ORF72 has yet to be studied in detail. Summary Genetic FTD is heterogeneous but certain phenotypic signatures of the major causative genes can be identified.",

        "abstract": "Public-key cryptosystems without requiring digital certificates are very attractive in wireless communications due to limitations imposed by communication bandwidth and computational resource of the mobile wireless communication devices. To eliminate public-key digital certificate, Shamir introduced the concept of the identity-based (ID-based) cryptosystem. The main advantage of the ID-based cryptosystem is that instead of using a random integer as each user's public key as in the traditional public-key systems, the user's real identity, such as user's name or email address, becomes the user's public key. However, all identity-based signature (IBS) schemes have the inherent key escrow problem, that is private key generator (PKG) knows the private key of each user. As a result, the PKG is able to sign any message on the users' behalf. This nature violates the \"non-repudiation\" requirement of digital signatures. To solve the key escrow problem of the IBS while still taking advantage of the benefits of the IBS, certificateless digital signature (CDS) was introduced. In this paper, we propose a generalized approach to construct CDS schemes. In our proposed CDS scheme, the user's private key is known only to the user himself, therefore, it can eliminate the key escrow problem from the PKG. The proposed construction can be applied to all Discrete Logarithm (DL)-based signature schemes to convert a digital signature scheme into a CDS scheme. The proposed CDS scheme is secure against adaptive chosen-message attack in the random oracle model. In addition, it is also efficient in signature generation and verification. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc.",

        "title": "Optical Spectral Signatures of Dusty Starburst Galaxies",
        "abstract": "We analyze the optical spectral properties of the complete sample of Very Luminous Infrared Galaxies presented by Wu et al., and we find a high fraction (~50%) of spectra showing both a strong H\u03b4 line in absorption and relatively modest [O II] emission [e(a) spectra]. The e(a) signature has been proposed as an efficient method to identify dusty starburst galaxies, and we study the star formation activity and the nature of these galaxies, as well as the effects of dust on their observed properties. We examine their emission-line characteristics, in particular their [O II]/H\u03b1 ratio, and we find this to be greatly affected by reddening. A search for AGN spectral signatures reveals that the e(a) galaxies are typically H II/LINER galaxies. We compare the star formation rates derived from the FIR luminosities with the estimates based on the H\u03b1 line and find that the values obtained from the optical emission lines are a factor of 10-70 (H\u03b1) and 20-140 ([O II]) lower than the FIR estimates (50-300 M\u2609 yr-1). We then study the morphological properties of the e(a) galaxies, looking for a near companion or signs of a merger/interaction. In order to explore the evolution of the e(a) population, we present an overview of the available observations of e(a) galaxies in different environments both at low and high redshift. Finally, we discuss the role of dust in determining the e(a) spectral properties and we propose a scenario of selective obscuration in which the extinction decreases with the stellar age.",

        "abstract": "We examine observational signatures of dark matter annihilation in the Milky Way arising from electroweak bremsstrahlung contributions to the annihilation cross section. It has been known for some time that photon bremsstrahlung may significantly boost DM annihilation yields. Recently, we have shown that electroweak bremsstrahlung of W and Z gauge bosons can be the dominant annihilation channel in some popular models with helicity-suppressed 2 --> 2 annihilation. W/Z-bremsstrahlung is particularly interesting because the gauge bosons produced via annihilation subsequently decay to produce large correlated fluxes of electrons, positrons, neutrinos, hadrons (including antiprotons) and gamma rays, which are all of importance in indirect dark matter searches. Here we calculate the spectra of stable annihilation products produced via gamma/W/Z-bremsstrahlung. After modifying the fluxes to account for the propagation through the Galaxy, we set upper bounds on the annihilation cross section via a comparison with observational data. We show that stringent cosmic ray antiproton limits preclude a sizable dark matter contribution to observed cosmic ray positron fluxes in the class of models for which the bremsstrahlung processes dominate.",

        "title": "Spectroscopic signatures of quantum-coherent energy transfer.",
        "abstract": "One of the most surprising and significant advances in the study of the photosynthetic light-harvesting process is the discovery that the electronic energy transfer might involve long-lived electronic coherences, under physiologically relevant conditions. This means that the transfer of energy among different chromophores does not follow the expected classical incoherent hopping mechanism, but that quantum-mechanical laws can steer the migration of energy. The implications of such a quantum transport regime, although currently under debate, might have a tremendous impact on our way of thinking about natural and artificial light-harvesting. Central to these discoveries has been the development of new ultrafast spectroscopic techniques, in particular two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, which is now the primary tool to obtain clear and definitive experimental proof of such effects. This review aims to provide an overview of the experimental techniques developed with the purpose of attaining a more detailed picture of the coherent and incoherent quantum dynamics relevant to energy transfer processes, not limited to the two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. With the idea of summarizing the experimental and theoretical basic notions necessary to introduce the field, the connection between experimental observables and coherence dynamics will be analysed in detail for each technique, highlighting how electronic coherences could be manifested in different experimental signatures. Similarities and differences among coherent signals as well as advantages and disadvantages of each approach will be critically discussed. Current opinions and debated issues will be emphasised and some possible future directions to address still open questions will be suggested.",

        "abstract": "Using in vitro drug sensitivity data coupled with Affymetrix microarray data, we developed gene expression signatures that predict sensitivity to individual chemotherapeutic drugs. Each signature was validated with response data from an independent set of cell line studies. We further show that many of these signatures can accurately predict clinical response in individuals treated with these drugs. Notably, signatures developed to predict response to individual agents, when combined, could also predict response to multidrug regimens. Finally, we integrated the chemotherapy response signatures with signatures of oncogenic pathway deregulation to identify new therapeutic strategies that make use of all available drugs. The development of gene expression profiles that can predict response to commonly used cytotoxic agents provides opportunities to better use these drugs, including using them in combination with existing targeted therapies.",

This paper builds on previous analyses and presents new methods for quantifying Clovis biface production signatures, including serial flaking and the timing of last overshot flaking. The results show that the Hogeye cache bifaces technologically and morphologically differ from other regional Clovis biface reduction signatures. Additional data is needed to determine whether these differences reflect individual knapping preferences or regional cultural signatures. The methods used and developed here are not Clovis-specific and could be modified and combined with other analytical techniques to identify reduction signatures in biface assemblages from other times and places. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Absent or manifestly diminished proteolytic activity of ADAMTS13 results in the appearance and accumulation of ultralarge VWF multimers (ULVWFM) in plasma, characterised by the manifestation of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). Despite congenital defects, infections and the actions of drugs such as cyclosporine A, doxycycline and corticosteroids apparently are involved in its development. To examine the possibility of transcriptional regulation of ADAMTS13 activity, we analyzed RNA levels in various cell culture systems and the response to known and assumed modulators of gene expression. We demonstrate the expression of ADAMTS13 in liver homogenates and a parenchyma liver cell culture system Hep3B, supporting the hypothesis that liver is an important source of plasma ADAMTS13, whereas there was no alteration in gene expression after stimulation of liver cells with proinflammatory stimuli such as endotoxin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta as well as immuno-suppressive agents, such as cyclosporine A, a variety of steroids as well as doxycycline. Therefore, we analysed the ADAMTS13 gene for binding sites of transcription factors in silico and compared the data with those found in two sets of 24 genes considered either as differentially regulated by prototypic inflammatory regulation or as unvaried under various conditions. On the basis of these data, the promotor of ADAMTS13 features the characteristics of a gene, which remains unvaried under a variety of conditions. To our knowledge, the current data demonstrate for the first time, that an alteration in transcriptional activity is negligible in accounting for diminished proteolytic activity as observed under various experimental and, in particular, clinical conditions.",

        "title": "Autoinhibition with Transcriptional Delay",
        "abstract": "Background: The pattern of somites is traced out by a mechanism involving oscillating gene expression at the tail end of the embryo. In zebrafish, two linked oscillating genes, her1 and her7, coding for inhibitory gene regulatory proteins, are especially implicated in genesis of the oscillations, while Notch signaling appears necessary for synchronization of adjacent cells. Results: I show by mathematical simulation that direct autorepression of her1 and her7 by their own protein products provides a mechanism for the intracellular oscillator. This mechanism operates robustly even when one allows for the fact that gene regulation is an essentially noisy (stochastic) process. The predicted period is close to the observed period (30 min) and is dictated primarily by the transcriptional delay, the time taken to make an mRNA molecule. Through its coupling to her1/her7 expression, Notch signaling can keep the rapid oscillations in adjacent cells synchronized. When the coupling parameters are varied, however, the model system can switch to oscillations of a much longer period, resembling that of the mouse or chick somitogenesis oscillator and governed by the delays in the Notch pathway. Such Notch-mediated synchronous oscillations are predicted even in the absence of direct her1/her7 autoregulation, through operation of the standard Notch signaling pathway that is usually assumed simply to give lateral inhibition. Conclusions: Direct autorepression of a gene by its own product can generate oscillations, with a period determined by the transcriptional and translational delays. Simple as they are, such systems show surprising behaviors. To understand them, unaided intuition is not enough: we need mathematics.",

        "abstract": "Resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have poor prognosis, with 30-50% relapsing within 5 years. Current staging criteria do not fully capture the complexity of this disease. Survival could be improved by identification of those early-stage patients who are most likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy. Molecular classification by using mRNA expression profiles has led to multiple, poorly overlapping signatures. We hypothesized that differing statistical methodologies contribute to this lack of overlap. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed our previously published quantitative RT-PCR dataset with a semisupervised method. A 6-gene signature was identified and validated in 4 independent public microarray datasets that represent a range of tumor histologies and stages. This result demonstrated that at least 2 prognostic signatures can be derived from this single dataset. We next estimated the total number of prognostic signatures in this dataset with a 10-million-signature permutation study. Our 6-gene signature was among the top 0.02% of signatures with maximum verifiability, reaffirming its efficacy. Importantly, this analysis identified 1,789 unique signatures, implying that our dataset contains >500,000 verifiable prognostic signatures for NSCLC. This result appears to rationalize the observed lack of overlap among reported NSCLC prognostic signatures.",

        "abstract": "The transactional memory (TM) paradigm promises to increase programmer productivity by making it easier to write correct parallel programs. In fulfilling this goal, a TM system should maximize its performance with limited hardware resources. Conflict detection is an essential element for maintaining correctness among concurrent transactions in a TM system. Hardware signatures have been proposed as an area-efficient method for detecting conflicts. However, signatures can degrade TM performance by falsely declaring conflicts. Hence, improving the accuracy of signatures within a given hardware budget is a crucial issue for TM to be adopted as a mainstream programming model. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective signature design, the unified signature. Instead of using separate read- and write-signatures, we implement a single signature to track all read- and write-accesses. By merging read- and write-signatures, a unified signature can effectively enlarge the signature coverage without additional overhead. Within the constraints of a given hardware budget, a TM system with a unified signature outperforms a baseline system with the same-sized traditional signatures by reducing the number of falsely detected conflicts. Even though the unified signature scheme incurs read-read dependencies, we show that these false dependencies do not negate the benefit of unified signatures and can effectively be filtered out. A TM system with a 2-Kbit unified signature with a helper signature scheme achieves speedups of 15 percent over baseline TM with 33 percent less area and 49 percent less power.",

An extended concept - the convertible undeniable signatures - proposed by Boyar, Chaum, Damg??rd and Pedersen in 1991, allows the signer to convert undeniable signatures to ordinary digital signatures. In this article, we present a new efficient convertible undeniable signature scheme based on bilinear maps. Its unforgeability is tightly related, in the random oracle model, to the computational Diffie-Hellman problem and its anonymity to a non-standard decisional assumption. The advantages of our scheme are the short length of the signatures, the low computational cost of the signature and the receipt generation. Moreover, a variant of our scheme permits the signer to universally convert signatures pertaining only to a specific time period. We formalize this new notion as the time-selective conversion. We also improve our original scheme from CT-RSA'05 by reducing the length of the generated receipts: their size is now logarithmic in the number of time periods. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We summarize recent data that indicate a close relationship between GC density of promoter sequences, transcription factor binding and the antagonizing activities of distinct epigenetic regulators such as histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and histone demethylases (HDMs). Subsequently, we compare chromatin signatures associated with different types of transcriptional outcomes from stable repression to highly dynamic regulated genes, strongly suggesting that the interplay of different epigenetic pathways is essential in defining specific types of heritable chromatin and associated transcriptional states.",

Here we implement single-cell PCR gene-expression analysis to dissect the cellular composition of primary human normal colon and colon cancer epithelia. We show that human colon cancer tissues contain distinct cell populations whose transcriptional identities mirror those of the different cellular lineages of normal colon. By creating monoclonal tumor xenografts from injection of a single (n = 1) cell, we demonstrate that the transcriptional diversity of cancer tissues is largely explained by in vivo multilineage differentiation and not only by clonal genetic heterogeneity. Finally, we show that the different gene-expression programs linked to multilineage differentiation are strongly associated with patient survival. We develop two-gene classifier systems (KRT20 versus CA1, MS4A12, CD177, SLC26A3) that predict clinical outcomes with hazard ratios superior to those of pathological grade and comparable to those of microarray-derived multigene expression signatures.",

        "abstract": "Stellar activity signatures such as spots and plages can significantly limit the search for extrasolar planets. Current models of activity-induced radial velocity (RV) signals focus on the impact of temperature contrast in spots according to which they predict the signal to diminish toward longer wavelengths. The Zeeman effect on RV measurements counteracts this: the relative importance of the Zeeman effect on RV measurements should grow with wavelength because the Zeeman displacement itself grows with \u03bb, and because a magnetic and cool spot contributes more to the total flux at longer wavelengths. In this paper, we model the impact of active regions on stellar RV measurements including both temperature contrast in spots and line broadening by the Zeeman effect. We calculate stellar line profiles using polarized radiative transfer models including atomic and molecular Zeeman splitting over large wavelength regions from 0.5 to 2.3 \u03bcm. Our results show that the amplitude of the RV signal caused by the Zeeman effect alone can be comparable to that caused by temperature contrast; a spot magnetic field of ~1000 G can produce a similar RV amplitude as a spot temperature contrast of ~1000 K. Furthermore, the RV signal caused by cool and magnetic spots increases with wavelength, in contrast to the expectation from temperature contrast alone. We also calculate the RV signal caused by variations in average magnetic field strength from one observation to the next, for example due to a magnetic cycle, but find it unlikely that this can significantly influence the search for extrasolar planets. As an example, we derive the RV amplitude of the active M dwarf AD Leo as a function of wavelength using data from the HARPS spectrograph. Across this limited wavelength range, the RV signal does not diminish at longer wavelengths but shows evidence for the opposite behavior, consistent with a strong influence of the Zeeman effect. We conclude that the RV signal of active stars does not vanish at longer wavelength but sensitively depends on the combination of spot temperature and magnetic field; in active low-mass stars, it is even likely to grow with wavelength.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the observational signatures of a straightforward evolutionary scenario for protoplanetary disks, in which the disk mass of small (<~50 mum) particles decreases homologously with time, but the disk structure and stellar parameters do not change. Our goal is to identify optimal infrared spectral indicators of the existence of disks, their structure, and mass evolution that may be tested with the upcoming SIRTF mission. We present simulated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and colors over a wide range of masses, 10-8 Msolar<=Mdisk<=10-1 Msolar. Our Monte Carlo radiative equilibrium techniques enable us to explore the wide range of optical depths of these disks and incorporate multiple, anisotropic dust scattering. The SED is most sensitive to disk mass in the far-IR and longer wavelengths, as is already known from millimeter and radio observations. As the disk mass decreases, the excess emission of the disk over the stellar photosphere diminishes more rapidly at the longest than at short wavelengths. At near-infrared wavelengths, the disk remains optically thick to stellar radiation over a wide range of disk masses, resulting in a slower decline in the SED in this spectral regime. Therefore, near-IR excesses (K-L) provide a robust means of detecting disks in star clusters down to Mdisk~10-7 Msolar, while the far-IR excess probes the disk mass, the caveat being that large inner-disk holes can decrease the near-IR disk emission. Various other disk parameters (outer radius, flaring, and dust size distribution) alter the SED quantitatively, but do not change our general conclusions on the evolution of SEDs and colors with the mass of small particles in the disk. Reducing the disk mass results in a clear progression in color-color diagrams, with low-mass disks displaying the bluest colors. We interpret color-color diagrams for Taurus-Auriga sources in the context of decreasing disk mass. Different viewing angles yield degeneracies in the color-mass relationship, but highly inclined disks are very faint and red and are readily identified in color-magnitude diagrams.",

In addition, conventional DNA-based molecular beacons were designed and applied in the detection of DNA of selected organisms. Micro-Raman (&#x03BC;Raman) measurements of DNA in water have proven to be a major challenge because of: 1) weak DNA signatures in solution; 2) changes in structural conformations of the DNA; and 3) environmental effects, such as temperature and pH of the solution in which DNA is suspended. We have studied optoelectronic properties of nanostructure&#x2013;DNA complexes immobilized on silver nanosphere substrates as well as on Ag-coated micro- and nanostructures.

This approach has been applied to elucidate transcription factor dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-cycle regulation, detect cross-talks in Escherichia coli two-component signalling pathways, and characterize E. coli carbon source transition. An ultimate test of system-wide understanding is the ability to design and construct novel gene-metabolic circuits.

        "abstract": "Smad6 and Smad7, a subgroup of Smad proteins, antagonize the signals elicited by transforming growth factor-beta. These two Smads, induced by transforming growth factor-beta or bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) stimulation, form stable associations with their activated type I receptors, blocking phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smads in the cytoplasm. Here we show that Smad6 interacts with homeobox (Hox) c-8 as a transcriptional corepressor, inhibiting BMP signaling in the nucleus. The interaction between Smad6 and Hoxc-8 was identified by a yeast two-hybrid approach and further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays in cells. Gel shift assays show that Smad6, but not Smad7, interacts with both Hoxc-8 and Hoxa-9 as a heterodimer when binding to DNA. More importantly, the Smad6-Hoxc-8 complex inhibits interaction of Smad1 with Hoxc-8- and Smad1-induced transcription activity. These data indicate that Smad6 interacts with Hox transcription factors as part of the negative feedback circuit in the BMP signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "To understand the coordination of gene expression in the Salmonella typhimurium ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster, we had previously identified a 72-bp AT-rich (78% A+T) DNA sequence element, AT4, which was capable of silencing transcription in a promoter nonspecific manner. LeuO protein provided in trans relieved (derepressed) AT4-mediated gene silencing (transcriptional repression), but underlying mechanisms remained unclear. In the present communication, the 72-bp DNA sequence element is further dissected into two functional elements, AT7 and AT8. LeuO binds to the 25-bp AT7, which lies closest to the leuO promoter in the AT4 DNA. After deletion of the AT7 DNA sequence responsible for LeuO binding from AT4, the remaining 47-bp AT-rich (85% A+T) DNA sequence, termed AT8, retains the full bi-directional gene-silencing activity, which is no longer relieved by LeuO. LeuO-mediated transcriptional derepression is restored when the LeuO binding site, AT7, is placed within close proximity to the gene silencer AT8. As a pair of functionally coupled transcription elements, the presence of an equal copy number of AT7 and AT8 within proximity is important for the transcription control. The characterization provides clues for future elucidation of the molecular details whereby LeuO negates the gene-silencing activity.",

A vulnerability signature is based on a program vulnerability, and is not specific to any particular exploit. The advantage of vulnerability signatures is that their quality can be guaranteed. In particular, we create vulnerability signatures which are guaranteed to have zero false positives. We show how to automate signature creation for any vulnerability that can be detected by a runtime monitor. We provide a formal definition of a vulnerability signature, and investigate the computational complexity of creating and matching vulnerability signatures. We systematically explore the design space of vulnerability signatures. We also provide specific techniques for creating vulnerability signatures in a variety of language classes. In order to demonstrate our techniques, we have built a prototype system. Our experiments show that we can, using a single exploit, automatically generate a vulnerability signature as a regular expression, as a small program, or as a system of constraints. We demonstrate techniques for creating signatures of vulnerabilities which can be exploited via multiple program paths. Our results indicate that our approach is a viable option for signature generation, especially when guarantees are desired.",

Of 47 signatures that separate avian viruses from human viruses by their nonglycoproteins, 8 were human-like in the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. Close examination of their amino acid residues in the recent ancestral swine viruses of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus showed that 7 had already transitioned to human-like residues and only PA 356 retained an avianlike K; in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, this residue changed into a human-like R.

We first review signatures that have already been proposed to be indicative of \u03b2-sheets. From these signatures, we find that only the couplet in the amide I region can be regarded as a truly reliable signature. In addition, we propose a strong negative peak at \u223c1350 cm(-1) to be another good signature for parallel as well as antiparallel \u03b2-sheets. We study the robustness of these signatures with respect to perturbations induced by the amino acid side chains, the overall conformation of the sheet structure, and microsolvation. It is found that the latter effects can be very well understood and separated employing the concept of localized modes. Finally, we investigate whether Raman optical activity is capable of discriminating between parallel and antiparallel \u03b2-sheets. The amide III region turns out to be most promising for this purpose.",

None of the subjects had recently received relevant treatments or antibiotics. We found that molecular signatures for the diagnosis of psoriasis result in significant accuracy ranging from 0.75 to 0.89 AUC, depending on the classification task.

        "abstract": "The small GTP-binding proteins HRAS, KRAS and NRAS belong to a family of oncoproteins associated with many types of human cancer. Signal transduction processes initiated at receptor tyrosine kinases converge on RAS proteins which serve as molecular switches linking upstream signals with the transcriptional machinery. RAS proteins interact with a number of effector proteins that in turn activate the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, the PI3K/PKB/Akt pathway, the RalGDS/Ral pathway and other downstream pathways. Mutations in RAS lock the protein in its active form. Chronic activation of the KRAS isoform is the basis for resistance toward antibody therapies targeting receptor tyrosine kinases, as an upstream stimulus through growth factor receptor-mediated activation is no longer required. However, the complexity of the RAS signaling system necessitates the search for additional activating mechanisms as well as biomarkers associated with pathway activation. During recent years, several RAS pathway-related gene signatures were identified, mostly by microarray-based gene expression profiling of normal versus RAS-transformed cells. The signatures can serve as a source of common biomarkers indicating functionally relevant downstream effects of the RAS signaling system. In searching for new markers, we compared the gene expression signatures compiled in 24 independent studies. We analyzed differentially regulated genes recovered in microarray studies on human specimens to discriminate paired normal and tumor tissues. Although the overlap between individual studies was low, this meta-analysis revealed Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), the CD44 antigen and members of the epidermal growth factor (EGR)-family as common downstream effectors of RAS.",

These unbiased large-scale scans provide important insights into the detection of cancer-related signatures. In addition to single-layer signatures, such as gene expression and somatic mutations, integrating data from multiple heterogeneous platforms using a systematic approach has been proven to be particularly effective for the identification of classification markers. This approach not only helps to uncover essential driver genes and pathways in the cancer network that are responsible for the mechanisms of cancer development, but will also lead us closer to the ultimate goal of personalized cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "The results of recognition of cosmic ray (CR) signatures on single images made during the Deep Impact mission were analyzed for several codes written by several authors. For automatic removal of CR signatures on many images, we suggest using the code imgclean (http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/volume/didoc_0001/document/calibration_software/dical_v5/) written by E. Deutsch as other codes considered do not work properly automatically with a large number of images and do not run to completion for some images; however, other codes can be better for analysis of certain specific images. Sometimes imgclean detects false CR signatures near the edge of a comet nucleus, and it often does not recognize all pixels of long CR signatures. Our code rmcr is the only code among those considered that allows one to work with raw images. For most visual images made during low solar activity at exposure time t > 4 s, the number of clusters of bright pixels on an image per second per sq. cm of CCD was about 2-4, both for dark and normal sky images. At high solar activity, it sometimes exceeded 10. The ratio of the number of CR signatures consisting of n pixels obtained at high solar activity to that at low solar activity was greater for greater n. The number of clusters detected as CR signatures on a single infrared image is by at least a factor of several greater than the actual number of CR signatures; the number of clusters based on analysis of two successive dark infrared frames is in agreement with an expected number of CR signatures. Some glitches of false CR signatures include bright pixels repeatedly present on different infrared images. Our interactive code imr allows a user to choose the regions on a considered image where glitches detected by imgclean as CR signatures are ignored. In other regions chosen by the user, the brightness of some pixels is replaced by the local median brightness if the brightness of these pixels is greater by some factor than the median brightness. The interactive code allows one to delete long CR signatures and prevents removal of false CR signatures near the edge of the nucleus of the comet. The interactive code can be applied to editing any digital images. Results obtained can be used for other missions to comets. ?? 2007 COSPAR.",

Repressive modifications are thought to stabilize cell type specific gene expression patterns, reducing the likelihood of reactivation of lineage-unrelated genes. In this report, we review the recent literature to deduce mechanisms underlying Polycomb and H3K9 methylation mediated repression, and describe the functional interplay with activating H3K4 methylation. We summarize recent data that indicate a close relationship between GC density of promoter sequences, transcription factor binding and the antagonizing activities of distinct epigenetic regulators such as histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and histone demethylases (HDMs). Subsequently, we compare chromatin signatures associated with different types of transcriptional outcomes from stable repression to highly dynamic regulated genes, strongly suggesting that the interplay of different epigenetic pathways is essential in defining specific types of heritable chromatin and associated transcriptional states.",

Misuse detection searches for attack traces in the recorded audit data using predefined patterns. The matching rules are called signatures. The definition of signatures is up to now an empirical process based on expert knowledge and experience. The analysis success and accordingly the acceptance of intrusion detection systems in general depend essentially on the topicality of the deployed signatures. Methods for a systematic development of signatures have scarcely been reported yet, so the modeling of a new signature is a time-consuming, cumbersome, and error-prone process. The modeled signatures have to be validated and corrected to improve their quality. So far only signature testing is applied for this. Signature testing is still a rather empirical and time-consuming process to detect modeling errors. In this paper, we present the first approach for verifying signature specifications using the Spin model checker. The signatures are modeled in the specification language EDL, which leans on colored Petri nets. We show how the signature specification is transformed into a Promela model and how characteristic specification errors can be found by Spin. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2010.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an increasing threat from kernel rootkits. A common feature of such attack is hiding malicious objects to conceal their presence, including processes, sockets, and kernel modules. Scanning memory with object signatures to detect the stealthy rootkit has been proven to be a powerful approach only when it is hard for adversaries to evade. However, it is difficult, if not impossible, to select fields from a single data structure as robust signatures with traditional techniques. In this paper, we propose the concepts of inter-structure signature and imported signature, and present techniques to detect stealthy malware based on these concepts. The key idea is to use cross-reference relationships of multiple data structures as signatures to detect stealthy malware, and to import some extra information into regions attached to target data structures as signatures. We have inferred four invariants as signatures to detect hidden processes, sockets, and kernel modules in Linux respectively and implemented a prototype detection system called DeepScanner. Meanwhile, we have also developed a hypervisor-based monitor to protect imported signatures. Our experimental result shows that our DeepScanner can effectively and efficiently detect stealthy objects hidden by seven real-world rootkits without any false positives and false negatives, and an adversary can hardly evade DeepScanner if he/she does not break the normal functions of target objects and the system.

        "title": "Shape signatures: New descriptors for predicting cardiotoxicity in silico",
        "abstract": "Shape Signatures is a new computational tool that is being evaluated for applications in computational toxicology and drug discovery. The method employs a customized ray-tracing algorithm to explore the volume enclosed by the surface of a molecule and then uses the output to construct compact histograms (i.e., signatures) that encode for molecular shape and polarity. In the present study, we extend the application of the Shape Signatures methodology to the domain of computational models for cardiotoxicity. The Shape Signatures method is used to generate molecular descriptors that are then utilized with widely used classification techniques such as k nearest neighbors ( k-NN), support vector machines (SVM), and Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOM). The performances of these approaches were assessed by applying them to a data set of compounds with varying affinity toward the 5-HT(2B) receptor as well as a set of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel inhibitors. Our classification models for 5-HT(2B) represented the first attempt at global computational models for this receptor and exhibited average accuracies in the range of 73-83%. This level of performance is comparable to using commercially available molecular descriptors. The overall accuracy of the hERG Shape Signatures-SVM models was 69-73%, in line with other computational models published to date. Our data indicate that Shape Signatures descriptors can be used with SVM and Kohonen SOM and perform better in classification problems related to the analysis of highly clustered and heterogeneous property spaces. Such models may have utility for predicting the potential for cardiotoxicity in drug discovery mediated by the 5-HT(2B) receptor and hERG.",

        "abstract": "There are constraints on a protein sequence/structure for it to adopt a particular fold. These constraints could be either a local signature involving particular sequences or arrangements of secondary structure or a global signature involving features along the entire chain. To search systematically for protein fold signatures, we have explored the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). ILP is a machine learning technique which derives rules from observation and encoded principles. The derived rules are readily interpreted in terms of concepts used by experts. For 20 populated folds in SCOP, 59 rules were found automatically. The accuracy of these rules, which is defined as the number of true positive plus true negative over the total number of examples, is 74% (cross-validated value). Further analysis was carried out for 23 signatures covering 30% or more positive examples of a particular fold. The work showed that signatures of protein folds exist, about half of rules discovered automatically coincide with the level of fold in the SCOP classification. Other signatures correspond to homologous family and may be the consequence of a functional requirement. Examination of the rules shows that many correspond to established principles published in specific literature. However, in general, the list of signatures is not part of standard biological databases of protein patterns. We find that the length of the loops makes an important contribution to the signatures, suggesting that this is an important determinant of the identity of protein folds. With the expansion in the number of determined protein structures, stimulated by structural genomics initiatives, there will be an increased need for automated methods to extract principles of protein folding from coordinates.",

We examined the functions of nTreg and iTreg cells by adoptive transfer immunotherapy of newborn Foxp3-deficient mice. As monotherapy, only nTreg cells prevented disease lethality, but did not suppress chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. Provision of Foxp3-sufficient conventional T cells with nTreg cells reconstituted the iTreg pool and established tolerance. In turn, acute depletion of iTreg cells in rescued mice resulted in weight loss and inflammation. Whereas the transcriptional signatures of nTreg and in vivo-derived iTreg cells were closely matched, there was minimal overlap in their T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. Thus, iTreg cells are an essential nonredundant regulatory subset that supplements nTreg cells, in part by expanding TCR diversity within regulatory responses. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

We identify differentially regulated microRNAs important for this switch and putative transcription factor binding sites in their promoters. STAT3, a transcription factor activated by IL-6, directly activates miR-21 and miR-181b-1. Remarkably, transient expression of either microRNA induces the epigenetic switch. MiR-21 and miR-181b-1, respectively, inhibit PTEN and CYLD tumor suppressors, leading to increased NF-??B activity required to maintain the transformed state. These STAT3-mediated regulatory circuits are required for the transformed state in diverse cell lines and tumor growth in xenografts, and their transcriptional signatures are observed in colon adenocarcinomas. Thus, STAT3 is not only a downstream target of IL-6 but, with miR-21, miR-181b-1, PTEN, and CYLD, is part of the positive feedback loop that underlies the epigenetic switch that links inflammation to cancer. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

Imaging and RNA sequencing were used to analyze these interactions, and clear changes in transcriptional signatures were detected, including altered patterns of cytokine expression after the exposure of iHOs to bacteria. S. Typhimurium microinjected into the lumen of iHOs was able to invade the epithelial barrier, with many bacteria residing within Salmonella-containing vacuoles. An S.

MERTK is expressed in up to 50% of melanoma cells and shRNA-mediated knockdown of MERTK reduces colony formation and cell migration in a CDC42-dependent fashion. Targeting MERTK also decreases cell survival and proliferation in an AKT-dependent manner. Finally, we identify a novel mutation in the kinase domain of MERTK, MERTK(P) (802S) , that increases the motility of melanoma cells relative to wild-type MERTK. Together, these data demonstrate that MERTK is a possible therapeutic target in melanoma, that AXL and MERTK are associated with differential cell behaviors, and that mutations in MERTK may contribute to melanoma pathogenesis.",

Their proportion correlates with the degree of inflammation, reflecting lymphoid cell turnover/reconstitution during chronic inflammation. These findings provide insight on intermediate stages of NK-cell development, a view of emergency recruitment of cell precursors, and upgrade our understanding and monitoring of chronic inflammatory conditions.",

Plant organ boundaries separate lateral organs from the apical meristem and harbor axillary meristems (AMs). AMs, as stem cell niches, make the shoot a ramifying system. Although AMs have important functions in plant development, our knowledge of organ boundary and AM formation remains rudimentary. Here, we generated a cellular-resolution genomewide gene expression map for low-abundance Arabidopsis thaliana organ boundary cells and constructed a genomewide protein-DNA interaction map focusing on genes affecting boundary and AM formation. The resulting GRN uncovers transcriptional signatures, predicts cellular functions, and identifies promoter hub regions that are bound by many TFs. Importantly, further experimental studies determined the regulatory effects of many TFs on their targets, identifying regulators and regulatory relationships in AM initiation. This systems biology approach thus enhances our understanding of a key developmental process.",

        "abstract": "During colonization of germfree mice with the total fecal microbial community of their conventionally born and raised siblings (conventionalization), the intestinal mucosal immune system initiates and maintains a balanced immune response. However, the genetic regulation of these balanced, appropriate responses to the microbiota is obscure. Here, combined analysis of germfree and conventionalized mice revealed that the major molecular responses could be detected initiating at day 4 post conventionalization, with a strong induction of innate immune functions followed by stimulation of adaptive immune responses and development and expansion of adaptive immune cells at later stages of conventionalization. This study provides a comprehensive overview of mouse developmental and immune-related cellular pathways and processes that were co-mediated by the commensal microbiota and suggests which mechanisms were involved in this reprogramming. The dynamic, region-dependent mucosal responses to the colonizing microbiota revealed potential transcriptional signatures for the control of intestinal homeostasis in healthy mice, which may help to decipher the genetic basis of pathway dysregulation in human intestinal inflammatory diseases.",

Here we found that transcriptional signatures of the cDC1 and cDC2 lineages became evident at the single-cell level from the CDP stage. We also identified Siglec-H and Ly6C as lineage markers that distinguished pre-DC subpopulations committed to the cDC1 lineage (Siglec-H-Ly6C- pre-DCs) or cDC2 lineage (Siglec-H-Ly6C+ pre-DCs).

We find unique transcriptional signatures in each germinal compartment, where thousands of genes are differentially expressed between regions, including ~80% of genes mutated in human cortical malformations. These regional differences emerge from the existence of discrete domains of gene expression, which occur at multiple locations across the developing cortex of ferret and human, but not the lissencephalic mouse. Complex expression patterns emerge late during development and map the eventual location of folds or fissures. Protomaps of gene expression within germinal layers may contribute to define cortical folds or functional areas, but our findings demonstrate that they distinguish the development of gyrencephalic cortices.",

Typhimurium) with iHOs. Imaging and RNA-Seq were used to analyze these interactions and clear changes in transcriptional signatures were detected, including altered patterns of cytokine expression after exposure of iHOs to bacteria. S. Typhimurium microinjected into the lumen of iHOs were able to invade the epithelial barrier, many residing within Salmonella associated vacuoles. An S. Typhimurium invA mutant defective in the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 invasion apparatus was less capable of invading the iHO epithelia.

Here, to address this problem, we describe a chemical genomics strategy that uses a direct comparison between microarray transcriptional signatures elicited by an inhibitor of unknown specificity and those elicited by highly specific pharmacological inhibition of engineered candidate kinase targets. By using this approach, we have identified two cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdk1 and Pho85, as the targets of the inhibitor GW400426 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of Cdk1 and Pho85, and not inhibition of either kinase alone, by GW400426 controls the expression of specific transcripts involved in polarized cell growth, thus revealing a cellular process that is uniquely sensitive to the multiplex inhibition of these two kinases. Our results suggest that the cellular responses induced by multiplex protein kinase inhibitors may be an emergent property that cannot be understood fully by considering only the sum of individual inhibitor-kinase interactions.",

These mutations, termed NPM1c, result in cytoplasmic dislocation of nucleophosmin and are associated with distinctive transcriptional signatures, yet their role in leukemogenesis remains obscure. Here we report that activation of a humanized Npm1c knock-in allele in mouse hemopoietic stem cells causes Hox gene overexpression, enhanced self renewal and expanded myelopoiesis. One third of mice developed delayed-onset AML, suggesting a requirement for cooperating mutations. We identified such mutations using a Sleeping Beauty transposon, which caused rapid-onset AML in 80% of mice with Npm1c, associated with mutually exclusive integrations in Csf2, Flt3 or Rasgrp1 in 55 of 70 leukemias. We also identified recurrent integrations in known and newly discovered leukemia genes including Nf1, Bach2, Dleu2 and Nup98.

        "abstract": "Gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has revealed a crucial role for type I interferon (IFN) in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, it is unclear how particular leucocyte subsets contribute to the overall type I IFN signature of PBMCs and whole blood samples.Furthermore, a detailed analysis describing the differences in the IFN signature in autoimmune diseases from that observed after viral infection has not been performed to date. Therefore, in this study, the transcriptional responses in peripheral T helper cells (CD4(+)) and monocyte subsets (CD16(-) inflammatory and CD16(+) resident monocytes) isolated from patients with SLE, healthy donors (ND) immunised with the yellow fever vaccine YFV-17Dand untreated controls were compared by global gene expression profiling.It was striking that all of the transcripts that were regulated in response to viral exposure were also found to be differentially regulated in SLE, albeit with markedly lower fold-change values. In addition to this common IFN signature, a pathogenic IFN-associated gene signature was detected in the CD4(+) T cells and monocytes from the lupus patients. IL-10, IL-9 and IL-15-mediated JAK/STAT signalling was shown to be involved in the pathological amplification of IFN responses observed in SLE. Type I IFN signatures identified were successfully applied for the monitoring of interferon responses in PBMCs of an independent cohort of SLE patients and virus-infected individuals. Moreover, these cell-type specific gene signatures allowed a correct classification of PBMCs independent from their heterogenic cellular composition. In conclusion, our data show for the first time that monocytes and CD4 cells are sensitive biosensors to monitor type I interferon response signatures in autoimmunity and viral infection and how these transriptional responses are modulated in a cell- and disease-specific manner.",

Much emphasis has usually been placed on the components of this noise that are due to randomness in transcription and translation. Here we focus on the role of noise associated with the inputs to transcriptional regulation; in particular, we analyze the effects of random arrival times and binding of transcription factors to their target sites along the genome. This contribution to the total noise sets a fundamental physical limit to the reliability of genetic control, and has clear signatures, but we show that these are easily obscured by experimental limitations and even by conventional methods for plotting the variance vs. mean expression level. We argue that simple, universal models of noise dominated by transcription and translation are inconsistent with the embedding of gene expression in a network of regulatory interactions. Analysis of recent experiments on transcriptional control in the early Drosophila embryo shows that these results are quantitatively consistent with the predicted signatures of input noise, and we discuss the experiments needed to test the importance of input noise more generally.",

Obtaining a systematic understanding of the mechanisms that control the 'stemness' - self-renewal and pluripotency - of ES cells relies on high-throughput tools to define gene expression and regulatory networks at the genome level. Such recently developed systems biology approaches have revealed highly interconnected networks in which multiple regulatory factors act in combination. Interestingly, stem cells and cancer cells share some properties, notably self-renewal and a block in differentiation. Recently, several groups reported that expression signatures that are specific to ES cells are also found in many human cancers and in mouse cancer models, suggesting that these shared features might inform new approaches for cancer therapy. Here, we briefly summarize the key transcriptional regulators that contribute to the pluripotency of ES cells, the factors that account for the common gene expression patterns of ES and cancer cells, and the implications of these observations for future clinical applications.",

Recent reports on the time-resolved immune and metabolic interactions between the host and microbiota, as well as the molecular signatures that mark this communication during the process of establishing a host-microbial relationship, are addressed here.\\n\\nRECENT FINDINGS: During microbial colonization, the progressive impact of de-novo introduction of the gut microbiota on the host's physiology is tightly controlled by highly intertwined regulatory networks and achieves an efficient and balanced interplay between the host and its developing microbial community. Recent findings from germ-free mouse models have unravelled core transcriptional, metabolic and microbial signatures, which are proposed to orchestrate the molecular responses during the establishment of the multifaceted state of intestinal host-microbe homeostasis.\\n\\nSUMMARY: Exploring the time-resolved dynamics of the host responses to the newly colonizing gut microbiota provides mechanistically critical understanding of the sequential host-microbe response cascades that lead to a homeostatic relationship. Thereby, these approaches can provide novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets, or either of the two, in humans for specific disorders associated with intestinal dysbiosis and loss of homeostasis.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, and have already been associated with 160+ diseases. With the small sizes of miRNAs (19-25 nt) and the increasing number of human miRNAs (>2000) being reported, the accurate detection of a specific miRNA has continued to be a challenging issue. In this report, a new concept for improving the accuracy of direct mass spectrometric (MS) measurements of miRNAs is introduced. The concept aims at creating a unique signature in the mass spectrum of miRNA. To achieve this goal, one way is to capture a specific miRNA by using a complementary DNA probe. The miRNA is then eluted and digested with a specific endonuclease. The digested miRNA fragments are directly measured by using MS. The multiple peaks that correspond to the digested miRNA fragments are collectively defined as a mass signature of the miRNA being analyzed. Since the peak pattern is dependent on the intrinsic property, i.e. RNA sequence, of a specific miRNA, it is referred to as an intrinsic mass signature. Alternatively, a unique mass signature can be created by incorporating one or more extra nucleotides into the 30 end of miRNA and the extended miRNA is measured by using MS. The molecular mass of the extended miRNA, which is defined as an extended mass signature, is expected to be different from the other miRNAs within the same sample. In comparison to matching the measured molecular mass of an undigested or unextended miRNA molecule to the expected molecular mass, the two different approaches to create a unique mass signature can improve the accuracy on qualitative MS detection of a specific miRNA.",

However, until now there have been no theoretical models describing the signatures of mutational processes operative in cancer genomes and no systematic computational approaches are available to decipher these mutational signatures. Here, by modeling mutational processes as a blind source separation problem, we introduce a computational framework that effectively addresses these questions.

The simulation model utilized is based on an approximate scattering approach combined with a 12-cylinder description of the human body. A comparison with single polarization co-pol measurements is used to show that the model provides reasonable first-order predictions of human signatures. Further simulations for polarimetric signatures illustrate the differing contributions of individual body parts to micro-Doppler returns and suggest that multi-polarization measurements can be useful in future micro-Doppler radar systems for human observation.",

        "abstract": "We present the possible signatures appearing in general realizations of the MSSM based on 14 unrelated mass parameters at the SUSY scale. The parameters of the general MSSM are reduced by assuming a degeneracy of the sfermions of the first two generations with the same quantum numbers. We also assume no mass-splitting between neutral and charged Higgsinos. We do allow for separate soft breaking terms for the third generation sfermons. We consider all possible resulting $14! \\approx 9 \\cdot10^{10}$ relevant mass orderings and check for the dominant decay cascades and the corresponding collider signatures. In determining the dominant decay modes we assume that mixing between sparticles is sub-dominant. As preferred signatures, we consider charged leptons, missing transverse momentum, jets, and $W, Z$ or Higgs bosons. We include also the cases of bi- and trilinear R-parity violation and show that specific signatures can be used to distinguish the different scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Recent experiments have revealed the existence of neural signatures in the activity of individual cells of the pyloric central pattern generator (CPG) of crustacean. The neural signatures consist of cell-specific spike timings in the bursting activity of the neurons. The role of these intraburst neural fingerprints is still unclear. It has been reported previously that some muscles can reflect small changes in the spike timings of the neurons that innervate them. However, it is unclear to what extent neural signatures contribute to the command message that the muscles receive from the motoneurons. It is also unknown whether the signatures have any functional meaning for the neurons that belong to the same CPG or to other interconnected CPGs. In this paper, we use realistic neural models to study the ability of single cells and small circuits to recognize individual neural signatures. We show that model cells and circuits can respond distinctly to the incoming neural fingerprints in addition to the properties of the slow depolarizing waves. Our results suggest that neural signatures can be a general mechanism of spiking-bursting cells to implement multicoding.",

        "abstract": "An aggregate signature scheme is a digital signature scheme where anyone given n signatures on n messages from n users can aggregate all these signatures into a single short signature. Unfortunately, no ``fully non-interactive'' aggregate signature schemes are known outside of the random oracle heuristic; that is, signers must pass messages between themselves, sequentially or otherwise, to generate the signature. Interaction is too costly for some interesting applications. In this work, we consider the task of realizing aggregate signatures in the model of Gentry and Ramzan (PKC 2006) when all signers share a synchronized clock, but do not need to be aware of or interactive with one another. Each signer may issue at most one signature per time period and signatures aggregate only if they were created during the same time period. We call this synchronized aggregation. We present a practical synchronized aggregate signature scheme secure under the Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption in the standard model. Our construction is based on the stateful signatures of Hohenberger and Waters (Eurocrypt 2009). Those signatures do not aggregate since each signature includes unique randomness for a chameleon hash and those random values do not compress. To overcome this challenge, we remove the chameleon hash from their scheme and find an alternative method for moving from weak to full security that enables aggregation. We conclude by discussing applications of this construction to sensor networks and software authentication.",

        "abstract": "Manual indexing of large databases of geometric information is both costly and difficult. Because of this, research into automated retrieval and indexing schemes has focused on the development of methods for characterising 3D shapes with a relatively small number of parameters (e.g.\u00a0histograms) that allow ill-defined properties such as \"geometric similarity\" to be computed. However although many methods of generating these so called shape signatures have been proposed, little work on assessing how closely these measures match human perceptions of geometric similarity has been reported. This paper details the results of a trial that compared the part families identified by both human subjects and three published shape signatures. To do this a similarity matrix for the Drexel benchmark datasets was created by averaging the results of twelve manual inspections. Three different shape signatures (D2 shape distribution, spherical harmonics and surface portioning spectrum) were computed for each component in the dataset, and then used as input to a competitive neural network that sorted the objects into numbers of \"similar\" clusters. Comparison of human and machine generated clusters (i.e.\u00a0families) of similar components allows the effectiveness of the signatures at duplicating human perceptions of shapes to be quantified. The work reported makes two contributions. Firstly the results of the human perception test suggest that the Drexel dataset contains objects whose perceived similarity levels ranged across the recorded spectrum (i.e.\u00a00.1 to 0.9); Secondly the results obtained from benchmarking the three shape signatures against human perception demonstrate a low rate of false positives for all three signatures and a false negative rate that varied almost linearly with the amount of perceived similarity. In other words the shape signatures studied were reasonably effective at matching human perception in that they returned few wrong results and excluded parts in direct proportion to the level of similarity demanded by the user. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To better understand their genomic landscape, here we perform whole-genome sequencing on a cohort of patients enriched with these cytogenetic characteristics. Mutations in known CLL drivers are seen in only 33% of this cohort, and associated with normal cytogenetics and unmutated IGHV. The most commonly mutated gene in our cohort, IGLL5, shows a mutational pattern suggestive of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) activity. Unsupervised analysis of mutational signatures demonstrates the activities of canonical AID (c-AID), leading to clustered mutations near active transcriptional start sites; non-canonical AID (nc-AID), leading to genome-wide non-clustered mutations, and an ageing signature responsible for most mutations. Using mutation clonality to infer time of onset, we find that while ageing and c-AID activities are ongoing, nc-AID-associated mutations likely occur earlier in tumour evolution.",

We provide evidence that the new profile is more specific than any of the existing signatures for this family of regulators. More than 500 representatives of this family were identified with this profile. A database on bacterial regulators (http://www.bactregulators.org) was built to compile and regroup the sequences with the aid of the new profile.",

We found major age-specific signatures at all levels including age-specific hypermethylation in polycomb group protein target genes and the upregulation of angiogenesis-related genes in older GBMs. These age-specific differences in GBM, which are independent of molecular subtypes, may in part explain the preferential effects of anti-angiogenic agents in older GBM and pave the way to a better understanding of the unique biology and clinical behavior of older versus younger GBMs.",

Given the important influence of chromatin states on gene regulation and the rapid accumulation of genome-wide chromatin modification data, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze these data in order to identify functional DNA elements. However, existing computational tools do not exploit data transformation and feature extraction as a means to achieve a more accurate prediction.\\n\\nRESULTS: We introduce a new computational framework for identifying functional DNA elements using chromatin signatures. The framework consists of a data transformation and a feature extraction step followed by a classification step using time-delay neural network. We implemented our framework in a software tool CSI-ANN (chromatin signature identification by artificial neural network). When applied to predict transcriptional enhancers in the ENCODE region, CSI-ANN achieved a 65.5% sensitivity and 66.3% positive predictive value, a 5.9% and 11.6% improvement, respectively, over the previously best approach.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CSI-ANN is implemented in Matlab.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The global gene expression profiles of adult and fetal murine prostate stem cells were determined to define common and unique regulators whose misexpression might play a role in the development of prostate cancer. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A distinctive core of transcriptional regulators common to both fetal and adult primitive prostate cells was identified as well as molecules that are exclusive to each population. Elements common to fetal and adult prostate stem cells include expression profiles of Wnt, Shh and other pathways identified in stem cells of other organs, signatures of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor, and up-regulation of components of the aldehyde dehydrogenase/retinoic acid receptor axis. There is also a significant lipid metabolism signature, marked by overexpression of lipid metabolizing enzymes and the presence of the binding motif for Srebp1. The fetal stem cell population, characterized by more rapid proliferation and self-renewal, expresses regulators of the cell cycle, such as E2f, Nfy, Tead2 and Ap2, at elevated levels, while adult stem cells show a signature in which TGF-beta has a prominent role. Finally, comparison of the signatures of primitive prostate cells with previously described profiles of human prostate tumors identified stem cell molecules and pathways with deregulated expression in prostate tumors including chromatin modifiers and the oncogene, Erg. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that adult prostate stem or progenitor cells may acquire characteristics of self-renewing primitive fetal prostate cells during oncogenesis and suggest that aberrant activation of components of prostate stem cell pathways may contribute to the development of prostate tumors.",

The dramatic cellular differentiation process from germline stem cell (GSC) to mature sperm is accompanied by dynamic changes in gene expression, which are regulated at transcriptional, post-transcriptional (including translational) and post-translational levels. Post-transcriptional regulation has been proposed as a unique feature of germ cells. However, recent studies have provided new insights into transcriptional regulation during Drosophila spermatogenesis. Both signaling pathways and epigenetic mechanisms act to orchestrate the transcriptional regulation of distinct genes at different germ cell differentiation stages. Many of the regulatory pathways that control male gamete differentiation in Drosophila are conserved in mammals. Therefore, studies using Drosophila spermatogenesis will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate mammalian germ cell differentiation pathways.",

The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 interacting with the CYP2A5 mRNA has been shown to be a key post-transcriptional regulator of the Cyp2a5 gene. The aim of this study was to investigate if the transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps of Cyp2a5 expression are linked. This was done by modifying the transcription rate with transcriptional inducers (phenobarbital and cyclic AMP) and inhibitors (actinomycin D and 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) and analyzing the effects upon post-transcriptional events. We found that inhibition of transcription led to relocalization of hnRNP A1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, to its strongly increased binding to the cytoplasmic CYP2A5 mRNA and to CYP2A5 mRNA stabilization. In contrast, stimulated transcription resulted in increased binding of nuclear hnRNP A1 to the Cyp2a5 promoter, and overexpression of hnRNP A1 led to stimulated transcription of a Cyp2a5 promoter-driven luciferase recombinant. This strongly suggests that the transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages of Cyp2a5 expression are interrelated and that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling hnRNP A1 may coordinate these different steps. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

        "abstract": "Abstract: Social roles in online discussion forums can be described by patterned characteristics of communication between network members which we conceive of as \u2018structural signatures.' This paper uses visualization methods to reveal these structural signatures and regression analysis to confirm the relationship between these signatures and their associated roles in Usenet newsgroups. Our analysis focuses on distinguishing the signatures of one role from others, the role of \u201canswer people.\" Answer people are individuals whose dominant behavior is to respond to questions posed by other users. We found that answer people predominantly contribute one or a few messages to discussions initiated by others, are disproportionately tied to relative isolates, have few intense ties and have few triangles in their local networks. OLS regression shows that these signatures are strongly correlated with role behavior and, in combination, provide a strongly predictive model for identifying role behavior (R=.72). To conclude, we consider strategies for further improving the identification of role behavior in online discussion settings and consider how the development of a taxonomy of author types could be extended to a taxonomy of newsgroups in particular and discussion systems in general.",

        "abstract": "The palmprint is one of the most reliable physiological characteristics that can be used to distinguish between individuals. Current palmprint-based systems are more user friendly, more cost effective, and require fewer data signatures than traditional fingerprint-based identification systems. The principal lines and wrinkles captured in a low-resolution palmprint image provide more than enough information to uniquely identify an individual. This paper presents a palmprint identification scheme that characterizes a palmprint using a set of statistical signatures. The palmprint is first transformed into the wavelet domain, and the directional context of each wavelet subband is defined and computed in order to collect the predominant coefficients of its principal lines and wrinkles. A set of statistical signatures, which includes gravity center, density, spatial dispersivity and energy, is then defined to characterize the palmprint with the selected directional context values. A classification and identification scheme based on these signatures is subsequently developed. This scheme exploits the features of principal lines and prominent wrinkles sufficiently and achieves satisfactory results. Compared with the line-segments-matching or interesting-points-matching based palmprint verification schemes, the proposed scheme uses a much smaller amount of data signatures. It also provides a convenient classification strategy and more accurate identification.",

The elucidation of these signatures of selection is of interest from the perspective of evolutionary biology and for identifying selected genes that ultimately may help to further genetically improve these economically important species. Genome-wide screenings based on population techniques provide analytical tools to detect these signatures in relation to the act of selection. This review outlines a nonmathematical treatment of the theories and approaches available to scan the genome for evidence of positive selection and is intended for readers who are little or not familiar with population genetics theory. We discuss the genetics underlying phenotypic variation and adaptation and highlight molecular pattern that positive selection leaves behind along with the statistical approaches that are developed to detect such signatures. We describe some of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different strategies and also the challenges with identifying signatures of selection. Ascertainment bias with widely used SNP arrays is also a topic of interest. Finally we review approaches to assess the statistical significance of a signal at a particular locus or window and discuss factors affecting the statistical power to detect selective sweeps. ?? 2014.",

        "abstract": "The invasion of hydrilla in many waterways has caused significant problems resulting in high maintenance costs for eradicating this invasive aquatic weed. Present identification methods employed for detecting hydrilla invasions such as aerial photography and videos are difficult, costly, and time consuming. Remote sensing has been used for assessing wetlands and other aquatic vegetation, but very little information is available for detecting hydrilla invasions in coastal estuaries and other water bodies. The objective of this study is to construct a library of spectral signatures for identifying and classifying hydrilla invasions. Spectral signatures of hydrilla were collected from an experimental tank and field locations in a coastal estuary in the upper Chesapeake Bay. These measurements collected from the experimental tank, resulted in spectral signatures with an average peak surface reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) region of 16% at a wavelength of 818 nm. However, the spectral measurements, collected in the estuary, resulted in a very different spectral signature with two surface reflectance peaks of 6% at wavelengths of 725 nm and 818 nm. The difference in spectral signatures between sites are a result of the components in the water column in the estuary because of increased turbidity (e.g., nutrients, dissolved matter and suspended matter), and canopy being lower (submerged) in the water column. Spectral signatures of hydrilla observed in the tank and the field had similar characteristics with low reflectance in visible region of the spectrum from 400 to 700 nm, but high in the NIR region from 700 to 900 nm.",

Blood gene expression signatures associated with heart failure may be applied to predict prognosis, monitor disease progression, and optimize treatment. Blood gene expression profiles were generated for 71 subjects with heart failure and 15 controls without heart failure, using the Affymetrix GeneChip U133Plus2.0. Survival analysis identified 197 \"mortality genes\" that were significantly associated with patient outcome. Functional categorization showed that genes associated with T cell receptor signaling were most significantly overpresented. Cluster analysis of these T cell receptor signaling genes significantly categorized heart failure patients into three risk groups (P = 0.031) that were distinct from the three risk groups categorized by New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification (P = 0.0002). By combining the analysis of clinical assessment (NYHA class) with T cell receptor signaling gene expression, we proposed a model that demonstrated an even greater differentiation of patients at risk (P = 0.0001). In this discovery study, we identified blood expression signatures associated with heart failure patient outcomes. Characterization of these mortality genes helped identify a set of T cell receptor signaling genes that may be of utility in predicting survival of heart failure patients. These data raise the possibility of prospectively risk stratifying patients with heart failure by integrating blood gene expression signatures with current clinical assessment.",

J.} {\\bf 697}, 913, 2009), have interpreted photospheric observations of changing widths of the polarities and reversal of the horizontal magnetic field component as signatures of the emergence of a twisted flux tube within the active region and along its internal polarity inversion line (PIL). A filament is observed along the PIL and the active region is assumed to have an arcade structure. To investigate this scenario, MacTaggart and Hood ({\\it Astrophys. J. Lett.} {\\bf 716}, 219, 2010) constructed a dynamic flux emergence model of a twisted cylinder emerging into an overlying arcade. The photospheric signatures observed by Okamoto {\\it et al.} (2008, 2009) are present in the model although their underlying physical mechanisms differ. The model also produces two additional signatures that can be verified by the observations. The first is an increase in the unsigned magnetic flux in the photosphere at either side of the PIL. The second is the behaviour of characteristic photospheric flow profiles associated with twisted flux tube emergence. We look for these two signatures in AR 10953 and find negative results for the emergence of a twisted flux tube along the PIL. Instead, we interpret the photospheric behaviour along the PIL to be indicative of photospheric magnetic cancellation driven by flows from the dominant sunspot. Although we argue against flux emergence within this particular region, the work demonstrates the important relationship between theory and observations for the successful discovery and interpretation of signatures of flux emergence.",

        "title": "Gene expression signatures in childhood acute leukemias are largely unique and distinct from those of normal tissues and other malignancies.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Childhood leukemia is characterized by the presence of balanced chromosomal translocations or by other structural or numerical chromosomal changes. It is well know that leukemias with specific molecular abnormalities display profoundly different global gene expression profiles. However, it is largely unknown whether such subtype-specific leukemic signatures are unique or if they are active also in non-hematopoietic normal tissues or in other human cancer types. METHODS: Using gene set enrichment analysis, we systematically explored whether the transcriptional programs in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and myeloid leukemia (AML) were significantly similar to those in different flow-sorted subpopulations of normal hematopoietic cells (n = 8), normal non-hematopoietic tissues (n = 22) or human cancer tissues (n = 13). RESULTS: This study revealed that e.g., the t(12;21) [ETV6-RUNX1] subtype of ALL and the t(15;17) [PML-RARA] subtype of AML had transcriptional programs similar to those in normal Pro-B cells and promyelocytes, respectively. Moreover, the 11q23/MLL subtype of ALL showed similarities with non-hematopoietic tissues. Strikingly however, most of the transcriptional programs in the other leukemic subtypes lacked significant similarity to approximately 100 gene sets derived from normal and malignant tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the expression profiles of childhood leukemia are largely unique, with limited similarities to transcriptional programs active in normal hematopoietic cells, non-hematopoietic normal tissues or the most common forms of human cancer. In addition to providing important pathogenetic insights, these findings should facilitate the identification of candidate genes or transcriptional programs that can be used as unique targets in leukemia.",

Our methodology is based on two formal languages that describe different properties of a given attack. The first language, called a session signature, describes temporal relations between the attack events. The second, called an attack invariant, describes semantic properties that hold in any instance of the attack. For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant. We developed GARD, a tool for session-signature construction, and used it to construct session signatures for multi-step attacks. We show that a session signature is more accurate than existing signatures.",

Morphologically, this appears an unlikely assemblage, which challenges-by including golden moles and tenrecs-the monophyly of the order Lipotyphla (Insectivora). We here identify in three proteins unique combinations of apomorphous amino acid replacements that support this clade. The statistical support for such \"sequence signatures\" as unambiguous synapomorphic evidence for the naturalness of the Afrotherian clade is reported. Using likelihood, combinatorial, and Bayesian methods we show that the posterior probability of the mammalian tree containing the Afrotherian clade is effectively 1.0, based on conservative assumptions. Presenting sequence data for another African insectivore, the otter shrew Micropotamogale lamottei, we demonstrate that such signatures are diagnostic for including newly investigated species in the Afrotheria. Sequence signatures provide \"protein-morphological\" synapomorphies that may aid in visualizing monophyletic groupings.",

In this article, we adopted a newly developed data-driven strategy to build a large set of cortical landmarks that are consistent and corresponding across PCE adolescents and their matched controls. Based on these landmarks, we constructed large-scale functional connectomes and applied the well-established approaches of deriving genomics signatures in genome-wide gene expression studies to discover functional connectomics signatures for the characterization of PCE adolescent brains. Results derived from experimental data demonstrated that 10 structurally disrupted landmarks were identified in PCE, and more importantly, the discovered informative functional connectomics signatures among consistent landmarks distinctively differentiate PCE brains from their matched controls.",

        "abstract": "Coordinate time series are often derived from continuous GPS data processed as discrete 24 hour solutions. Under this regimen, residual semi-diurnal and diurnal crustal tide signatures are under-sampled, resulting in aliased periodic signals in the coordinate time series. A secondary aliasing effect, well known from satellite altimetry studies but generally ignored in GPS analysis, arises from the repeat period of the satellite orbits being longer than the Nyquist period of the semi-diurnal and diurnal tidal signatures. This paper derives the theoretical periods for these two aliasing effects for the principal semi-diurnal and diurnal tidal constituents. The presence of both types of aliased signals in GPS time series is then demonstrated using simulated GPS data and also considered for time series derived from real GPS data. It is shown that the beating of the two aliased signals invariably results in spurious signatures in the time series with semi-annual and annual periods.",

Moving windows of 44 years show that, below 20 km, the 11-year modulation of the EAO is phase locked to the solar cycle (SC). The spectral features from the 48-year data record reveal modulation signatures of 9.6 and 12 years, which produce EAO variations that mimic in limited altitude regimes the varying maxima and minima of the 10.7 cm flux solar index. Above 20 km, the spectra also contain modulation signatures with periods around 11 years, but the filtered variations are too irregular to suggest that systematic SC forcing is the principal agent.",

        "abstract": "Chameleon signatures simultaneously provide the properties of non-repudiation and non-transferability for the signed message. However, the initial constructions of chameleon signatures suffer from the key exposure problem of chameleon hashing. This creates a strong disincentive for the recipient to compute hash collisions, partially undermining the concept of non-transferability. Recently, some constructions of discrete logarithm based chameleon hashing and signatures without key exposure are presented, while in the setting of gap Diffie-Hellman groups with pairings. In this paper, we propose the first key-exposure free chameleon hash and signature scheme based on discrete logarithm systems, without using the gap Diffie-Hellman groups. This provides more flexible constructions of efficient key-exposure free chameleon hash and signature schemes. Moreover, one distinguishing advantage of the resulting chameleon signature scheme is that the property of \"message hiding\" or \"message recovery\" can be achieved freely by the signer, i.e., the signer can efficiently prove which message was the original one if he desires. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the first paradigm, based on a weakly-secure signature scheme, the construction of a fully-secure signature scheme requires one-time signature additionally. However, the other two are built only on weakly-secure signatures. To the best of our knowledge, it is observed for the first time in this paper that two weakly-secure signature schemes are sufficient to construct a fully-secure signature scheme. Based on the new proposed paradigms, several efficient instantiations without random oracles are also presented. We also show that these fully-secure signature schemes have many special interesting properties in application. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Infectious agents are the third highest human cancer risk factor and may have a greater role in the origin and/or progression of cancers, and related pathogenesis. Thus, knowing the specific viruses and microbial agents associated with a cancer type may provide insights into cause, diagnosis and treatment. We utilized a pan-pathogen array technology to identify the microbial signatures associated with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This technology detects low copy number and fragmented genomes extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded archival tissues. The results, validated by PCR and sequencing, define a microbial signature present in TNBC tissue which was underrepresented in normal tissue. Hierarchical clustering analysis displayed two broad microbial signatures, one prevalent in bacteria and parasites and one prevalent in viruses. These signatures demonstrate a new paradigm in our understanding of the link between microorganisms and cancer, as causative or commensal in the tumor microenvironment and provide new diagnostic potential.",

        "abstract": "Gene signatures have been developed for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer to complement pathological factors in providing prognostic information. The 70-gene and the 21-gene signatures identify patients who may not require adjuvant chemotherapy. Gene signatures in triple-negative disease and HER2-positive disease have not been fully developed yet, although studies demonstrate heterogeneity within these subgroups. Further research is needed before genotyping will help in making clinical decisions in triple-negative and HER2-positive disease. Molecular subtyping of breast cancer led to define luminal, basal, and HER2-enriched subtypes, which have specific clinical behavior. This approach may lead to identify new subgroups requiring specific therapies. Standardization of techniques will be required to translate investigations to the clinic.",

        "abstract": "[1] Using radiative reflectance as the discriminatory functional trait, we find scale-free signatures of local functional diversity density of vegetation in river basins, implying a high likelihood of locations with very high diversity relative to the overall diversity of the riparian systems (i. e., riparian diversity hot spots). The spatial series of average local functional diversity exhibits correlation structures that indicate long-range communication of diversity information along river networks. The riparian area of a randomly selected streamlink is found to be exponentially distributed. Our findings suggest that landscape structure and dispersal directionality play crucial roles in determining biodiversity patterns, and thus should be addressed in comprehensive biodiversity theories and fieldwork and conservation campaigns. Finally, the connection between the spectral-group-based functional diversity signatures and those associated with the actual species richness is yet to be verified and quantified; such connection will significantly enhance the importance of the already meaningful signatures reported here.",

        "abstract": "Effects of three-body scattering on reflectivity signatures at S and C bands can be seen on the back side of large reflectivity storm cores that contain hail. The fingerlike protrusions of elevated reflectivity have been termed flare echoes or 'hail spikes.' Three-body scattering occurs when radiation from the radar scattered toward the ground is scattered back to hydrometeors, which then scatter some of the radiation back to the radar. Three-body scatter typically causes differential reflectivity to be very high at high elevations and to be negative at lower elevations at the rear of the storm core. This paper describes a model that can simulate the essential features of the three-body scattering that has been observed in hailstorms. The model also shows that three-body scatter can significantly affect the polarimetric Z(DR) (differential reflectivity) radar signatures in hailshafts at very low elevation and thus is a possible explanation of the frequently reported negative Z(DR) signatures in hailshafts near ground.",

Despite the development of molecular classifications, and prognostic and predictive gene-expression signatures, microarray-based studies have not yielded definitive answers to many of the questions that remain germane for the successful implementation of personalized medicine. There are a lack of robust signatures to predict benefit from specific therapeutic agents and it is still not possible to predict prognosis or chemotherapy treatment response in specific disease subsets accurately, such as triple-negative breast cancer. We discuss the hurdles in the development and validation of molecular classification systems, and prognostic and predictive signatures based on microarray gene-expression profiling. We suggest that similar challenges are likely to be encountered in translating next-generation sequencing data into clinically useful information. Finally we highlight strategies for the development of clinically useful molecular predictors in the future.",

The possible optical signatures in the spectra are also discussed in detail. We begin with systematical analyses of the optical conductivities of the TIs by using Kubo's formula. Then, based on the features of the optical conductivities, we study the possible optical signatures due to the warping term. We explore the reflection spectra from a TI thin film growing on a metamaterial. We find that by properly tuning the refraction index of the metamaterial, all features of the warping effect on the conductivities can be detected and identified from the reflection spectra at an experimentally accessible level. Finally, we discuss the possibility of using the Goos-H\u00e4nchen effect and the Brewster angle measurement to determine the possible optical signatures of the warping term on the imperfectly quantized optical Hall conductivity.",

Stage II colon cancers represent a unique treatment challenge for medical oncologists because they contain a very heterogeneous group of tumors with a wide range of recurrence risks after resection. Defining these differences in biology can help to explain differences in behavior. To this end, gene signatures have been developed to define various prognostic groups beyond the clinicopathologic features alone. Adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancers as a group has not shown survival advantage in clinical trials. Future research to develop gene signatures to predict a group that will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy will be helpful in the clinical decision-making process.

In particular, DNA methylation of transcription units ('gene bodies') is highly conserved across diverse taxa. However, the functional role of gene body methylation is not yet fully understood. A long-standing hypothesis posits that gene body methylation reduces transcriptional noise associated with spurious transcription of genes. Despite the plausibility of this hypothesis, an explicit test of this hypothesis has not been performed until now.\\n\\nRESULTS: Using nucleotide-resolution data on genomic DNA methylation and abundant microarray data, here we investigate the relationship between DNA methylation and transcriptional noise. Transcriptional noise measured from microarrays scales down with expression abundance, confirming findings from single-cell studies. We show that gene body methylation is significantly negatively associated with transcriptional noise when examined in the context of other biological factors.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This finding supports the hypothesis that gene body methylation suppresses transcriptional noise. Heavy methylation of vertebrate genomes may have evolved as a global regulatory mechanism to control for transcriptional noise. In contrast, promoter methylation exhibits positive correlations with the level of transcriptional noise. We hypothesize that methylated promoters tend to undergo more frequent transcriptional bursts than those that avoid DNA methylation.",

A new porcine Affymetrix expression array was designed in order to provide comprehensive coverage of the known pig transcriptome. The new array was used to generate a genome-wide expression atlas of pig tissues derived from 62 tissue/cell types. These data were subjected to network correlation analysis and clustering.\\n\\nRESULTS: The analysis presented here provides a detailed functional clustering of the pig transcriptome where transcripts are grouped according to their expression pattern, so one can infer the function of an uncharacterized gene from the company it keeps and the locations in which it is expressed. We describe the overall transcriptional signatures present in the tissue atlas, where possible assigning those signatures to specific cell populations or pathways. In particular, we discuss the expression signatures associated with the gastrointestinal tract, an organ that was sampled at 15 sites along its length and whose biology in the pig is similar to human. We identify sets of genes that define specialized cellular compartments and region-specific digestive functions. Finally, we performed a network analysis of the transcription factors expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and demonstrate how they sub-divide into functional groups that may control cellular gastrointestinal development.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: As an important livestock animal with a physiology that is more similar than mouse to man, we provide a major new resource for understanding gene expression with respect to the known physiology of mammalian tissues and cells.

Development of \"omic\" technologies has enhanced biomarker discovery at the molecular level, providing signatures unique to toxicant mode-of-action (MOA). However, these signatures often lack relevance to organismal responses, such as growth or reproduction, limiting their value for environmental monitoring. Our primary objective was to discover metabolic signatures in chemically exposed organisms that can predict physiological toxicity. Marine mussels (Mytilus edulis) were exposed for 7 days to 12 and 50 microg/l copper and 50 and 350 microg/l pentachlorophenol (PCP), toxicants with unique MOAs. Physiological responses comprised an established measure of organism energetic fitness, scope for growth (SFG). Metabolic fingerprints were measured in the same individuals using nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics. Metabolic signatures predictive of SFG were sought using optimal variable selection strategies and multivariate regression and then tested upon independently field-sampled mussels from rural and industrialized sites. Copper and PCP induced rational metabolic and physiological changes. Measured and predicted SFG were highly correlated for copper (r(2) = 0.55, P = 2.82 x 10(-7)) and PCP (r(2) = 0.66, P = 3.20 x 10(-6)). Predictive metabolites included methionine and arginine/phosphoarginine for copper and allantoin, valine, and methionine for PCP. When tested on field-sampled animals, metabolic signatures predicted considerably reduced fitness of mussels from the contaminated (SFG = 6.0 J/h/g) versus rural (SFG = 15.2 J/h/g) site. We report the first successful discovery of metabolic signatures in chemically exposed environmental organisms that inform on molecular MOA and that can predict physiological toxicity. This could have far-reaching implications for monitoring impacts on environmental health.",

This reprogramming of transcriptional programs can be achieved by transplantation of mammalian somatic nuclei to the giant Xenopus laevis oocyte nucleus, referred to as the germinal vesicle (GV). Factors and mechanisms responsible for this transcriptional reprogramming have not been elucidated. Recently, we have found that a polymerized form of actin is abundantly present in nuclei transplanted into the Xenopus oocyte nucleus and plays an important role in transcriptional reactivation of Oct4. This study emphasizes a significant contribution of nuclear actin in transcriptional activation.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcriptional regulation is an important part of regulatory control in eukaryotes. Even if binding motifs for transcription factors are known, the task of finding binding sites by scanning sequences is plagued by false positives. One way to improve the detection of binding sites from motifs is by taking cooperativity of transcription factor binding into account. We propose a non-parametric probabilistic model, similar to a document topic model, for detecting transcriptional programs, groups of cooperative transcription factors and co-regulated genes. The analysis results in transcriptional programs which generalise both transcriptional modules and TF-target gene incidence matrices and provide a higher-level summary of these structures. The method is independent of prior specification of training sets of genes, for example, via gene expression data. The analysis is based on known binding motifs. RESULTS: We applied our method to putative regulatory regions of 18,445 Mus musculus genes. We discovered just 68 transcriptional programs that effectively summarised the action of 149 transcription factors on these genes. Several of these programs were significantly enriched for known biological processes and signalling pathways. One transcriptional program has a significant overlap with a reference set of cell cycle specific transcription factors. CONCLUSION: Our method is able to pick out higher order structure from noisy sequence analyses. The transcriptional programs it identifies potentially represent common mechanisms of regulatory control across the genome. It simultaneously predicts which genes are co-regulated and which sets of transcription factors cooperate to achieve this co-regulation. The programs we discovered enable biologists to choose new genes and transcription factors to study in specific transcriptional regulatory systems.",

        "abstract": "Alga-derived lipids represent an attractive potential source of biofuels. However, lipid accumulation in algae is a stress response tightly coupled to growth arrest, thereby imposing a major limitation on productivity. To identify transcriptional regulators of lipid accumulation, we performed an integrative chromatin signature and transcriptomic analysis to decipher the regulation of lipid biosynthesis in the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Genome-wide histone modification profiling revealed remarkable differences in functional chromatin states between the algae and higher eukaryotes and uncovered regulatory components at the core of lipid accumulation pathways. We identified the transcription factor, PSR1, as a pivotal switch that triggers cytosolic lipid accumulation. Dissection of the PSR1-induced lipid profiles corroborates its role in coordinating multiple lipid-inducing stress responses. The comprehensive maps of functional chromatin signatures in a major clade of eukaryotic life and the discovery of a transcriptional regulator of algal lipid metabolism will facilitate targeted engineering strategies to mediate high lipid production in microalgae. A lgae naturally accumulate energy-dense oils that can be con-verted into transportation fuels, potentially rendering them an attractive system for large-scale biofuel production 1 . Algae-derived biofuels offer the promise of high areal productivity, minimal competition with food crops, utilization of a wide variety of water sources and CO 2 capture from stationary emission sources 2,3 . However, high-yield lipid accumulation in algae is a stress response inducible through conditions like nutrient deprivation, which limits overall yield and thus commercial viability 2,4",

        "title": "The Baltoscandian margin detrital zircon signatures of the central Scandes",
        "abstract": "In central parts of the Scandinavian Caledonides, detrital zircon signatures provide evidence of the change in character of the Baltoscandian crystalline basement, from the characteristic Late Palaeoproterozoic granites of the Transscandinavian Igneous Belt (TIB, c. 1650-1850 Ma) in the foreland Autochthon to the typical, mainly Mesoproterozoic-age profile (c. 950-1700 Ma) of the Sveconorwegian Orogen of southwestern Scandinavia in the hinterland. Late Ediacaran to Early Cambrian shallow-marine Vemdal quartzites of the Jamtlandian Nappes (Lower Allochthon) provide strong bimodal signatures with TIB (1700-1800 Ma) and Sveconorwegian, sensu stricto (900-1150 Ma) ages dominant. Mid-Ordovician turbidites (Norraker Formation) of the Lower Allochthon in Sweden, sourced from the west, have unimodal signatures dominated by Sveconorwegian ages with peaks at 1000-1100 Ma, but with subordinate components of older Mesoproterozoic zircons (1200-1650 Ma). Latest Ordovician shallow-marine quartzites also yield bimodal signatures, but are more dispersed than in the Vemdal quartzites. In the greenschist facies lower parts of the Middle Allochthon, the Fuda (Offerdal Nappe) and Sarv Nappe signatures are either unimodal or bimodal (950-1100 and/or 1700-1850 Ma), with variable dominance of the younger or older group, and subordinate other Mesoproterozoic components. In the overlying, amphibolite to eclogite facies lower part of the Seve Nappe Complex, where the metasediments are dominated by feldspathic quartzites, calcsilicate-rich psammites and marbles, most units have bimodal signatures similar to the Sarv Nappes, but more dispersed; one has a unimodal signature very similar to the Ordovician turbidites of the Jamtlandian Nappes. In the overlying Upper Allochthon, Lower Koli (Baltica-proximal, Virisen Terrane), Late Ordovician quartzites provide unimodal signatures dominated by Sveconorwegian ages (sensu stricto). Further north in the Scandes, previously published zircon signatures in quartzites of the Lower Allochthon are similar to the Vemdal quartzites in Jamtland. Data from the Kalak Nappes at 70{degrees}N are in no way exotic to the Sveconorwegian Baltoscandian margin. They do show a Timanian influence (ages of c. 560-610 Ma), as would be expected from the palinspastic reconstructions of the nappes. Thus the detrital zircon signatures reported here and published elsewhere provide supporting evidence for a continuation northwards of the Sveconorwegian Orogen in the Neoproterozoic, from type areas in the south, along the Baltoscandian margin of Baltica into the high Arctic.

        "abstract": "Modern genomics technologies generate huge data sets creating a demand for systems level, experimentally verified, analysis techniques. We examined the transcriptional response to DNA damage in a human Tcell line (MOLT4) using microarrays. By measuring both mRNA accumulation and degradation over a short time course, we were able to construct a mechanistic model of the transcriptional response. The model predicted three dominant transcriptional activity profiles-an early response controlled by NF kappa B and c-Jun, a delayed response controlled by p53, and a late response related to cell cycle re-entry. The method also identified, with defined confidence limits, the transcriptional targets associated with each activity. Experimental inhibition of NF kappa B, c-Jun and p53 confirmed that target predictions were accurate. Model predictions directly explained 70% of the 200 most significantly upregulated genes in the DNA-damage response. Genome-wide transcriptional modelling (GWTM) requires no prior knowledge of either transcription factors or their targets. GWTM is an economical and effective method for identifying the main transcriptional activators in a complex response and confidently predicting their targets.

        "abstract": "As protein-protein interaction is intrinsic to most cellular processes, the ability to predict which proteins in the cell interact can aid significantly in identifying the function of newly discovered proteins, and in understanding the molecular networks they participate in. Here we demonstrate that characteristic pairs of sequence-signatures can be learned from a database of experimentally determined interacting proteins, where one protein contains the one sequence-signature and its interacting partner contains the other sequence-signature. The sequence-signatures that recur in concert in various pairs of interacting proteins are termed correlated sequence-signatures, and it is proposed that they can be used for predicting putative pairs of interacting partners in the cell. We demonstrate the potential of this approach on a comprehensive database of experimentally determined pairs of interacting proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The proteins in this database have been characterized by their sequence-signatures, as defined by the InterPro classification. A statistical analysis performed on all possible combinations of sequence-signature pairs has identified those pairs that are over-represented in the database of yeast interacting proteins. It is demonstrated how the use of the correlated sequence-signatures as identifiers of interacting proteins can reduce significantly the search space, and enable directed experimental interaction screens.",

        "title": "Integrating RAS status into prognostic signatures for adenocarcinomas of the lung",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: While the dysregulation of specific pathways in cancer influences both treatment response and outcome, few current prognostic markers explicitly consider differential pathway activation. Here we explore this concept, focusing on K-Ras mutations in lung adenocarcinoma (present in 25%-35% of patients).\\n\\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effect of K-Ras mutation status on prognostic accuracy of existing signatures was evaluated in 404 patients. Genes associated with K-Ras mutation status were identified and used to create a RAS pathway activation classifier to provide a more accurate measure of RAS pathway status. Next, 8 million random signatures were evaluated to assess differences in prognosing patients with or without RAS activation. Finally, a prognostic signature was created to target patients with RAS pathway activation.\\n\\nRESULTS: We first show that K-Ras status influences the accuracy of existing prognostic signatures, which are effective in K-Ras-wild-type patients but fail in patients with K-Ras mutations. Next, we show that it is fundamentally more difficult to predict the outcome of patients with RAS activation (RAS(mt)) than that of those without (RAS(wt)). More importantly, we demonstrate that different signatures are prognostic in RAS(wt) and RAS(mt). Finally, to exploit this discovery, we create separate prognostic signatures for RAS(wt) and RAS(mt) patients and show that combining them significantly improves predictions of patient outcome.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We present a nested model for integrated genomic and transcriptomic data. This model is general and is not limited to lung adenocarcinomas but can be expanded to other tumor types and oncogenes.",

        "abstract": "Intra-specific changes in trophic interactions due to ontogenetic transformations in macro-invertebrates can add to complexity of freshwater food webs. The objectives of this study are therefore to examine isotopic signatures and crop contents of different Chaoborus species and life stages, and to determine whether ontogenetic changes in diet are reflected in their isotopic signatures. Different Chaoborus species and life stages were collected from 15 Precambrian Shield lakes for stable isotope and crop contents analyses. In general, early instar Chaoborus \u03b413C and \u03b413CLC (lipid corrected \u03b413C) signatures were enriched in 13C, while their \u03b415NDC (Daphnia corrected \u03b415N) signatures were lower compared to those of late instars and pupae. Larval Chaoborus size was significantly related to their \u03b413C, \u03b413CLC&DC (lipid and Daphnia corrected \u03b413C), and \u03b415NDC isotopic signatures. Chaoborus crop contents varied among species and larval instars. Generally, rotifers were numerically predominant in crops, with declining abundance in late instars. Larger quantities of copepods, nauplii and cladocerans were found in crops of late instars compared with early instars. Overall, early instars consumed more rotifers and phytoplankton and had lower \u03b415NDC, whereas late instars consumed comparatively larger quantities of copepods, nauplii, cladocerans and early instars, and had higher \u03b415NDC. Together, our results show that there are differences among larval Chaoborus life stages. Hence, different instars of these important aquatic predators cannot be grouped together, but should be separated by species and life stage when examining trophic interactions in freshwater food webs.

        "abstract": "Context Program execution profiles have been extensively and successfully used in several dynamic analysis fields such as software testing and fault localization. Objective This paper presents a pattern-matching approach implemented as an application-based intrusion (and failure) detection system that operates on signatures generated from execution profiles. Such signatures are not descriptions of exploits, i.e. they do not depend on the syntax or semantics of the exploits, but instead are descriptions of program events that correlate with the exploitation of program vulnerabilities. Method A vulnerability exploit is generally correlated with the execution of a combination of program elements, such as statements, branches, and definition-use pairs. In this work we first analyze the execution profiles of a vulnerable application in order to identify such suspicious combinations, define signatures that describe them, and consequently deploy these signatures within an intrusion detection system that performs online signature matching. Results To evaluate our approach, which is also applicable to online failure detection, we implemented it for the Java platform and applied it onto seven open-source applications containing 30 vulnerabilities/defects for the purpose of the online detection of attacks/ failures. Our results showed that our approach worked very well for 26 vulnerabilities/defects (86.67%) and the overhead imposed by the system is somewhat acceptable as it varied from 46% to 102%. The exhibited average rates of false negatives and false positives were 0.43% and 1.03%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Determining whether the diet of predators has changed is an important ecological problem and appropriate methodology is needed in order to test for differences or changes in diet. It is known that the fatty acid (FA) signature in a predator\u2019s adipose tissue predictably reflects the prey consumed and that, consequently, a change in the FA signatures can be largely attributed to changes in the predator\u2019s diet composition. The use of FA signatures as a means of detecting change in diet presents some statistical challenges however, since the FA signatures are compositional and sample sizes relative to the dimension of a signature are often small due to biological constraints. Furthermore, the FA signatures often contain zeros precluding the direct use of traditional compositional data analysis methods. In this paper, we provide the methodology to carry out valid statistical tests for detecting changes in FA signatures and we illustrate both independent and paired cases using simulation studies and real life seabird and seal data. We conclude that the statistical challenges using FA data are overcome through the use of nonparametric tests applied to the multivariate setting with suitable test statistics capable of handling the zeros that are present in the data.",

        "abstract": "The effects of formalin and ethanol preservation on the delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotope signatures of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus muscle tissue were examined. The lipid content of the tissue samples studied ranged from 3.6 to 6.1% and was not correlated with the magnitude of observed isotopic shifts in preserved samples. Ethanol and formalin significantly depleted and enriched, respectively, the delta C-13 isotope signatures of preserved tissues when compared to control samples. Ethanol did not significantly enrich delta N-15 signatures in comparison to controls, whereas formalin did. A meta-analysis of multiple species effects further demonstrated significant preservation effects in fish tissue. Statistical analysis of data obtained by correcting preserved tissue isotope signatures with literature, bootstrapped or meta-analysis derived correction factors demonstrated significant differences between corrected and control sample isotope signatures or failure to produce a unity slope when the data sets were regressed against one another. Species-specific, bootstrapped linear correction models resulted in no such errors. Results suggest that species-specific correction methods should be used for fishes because of the known wide variation in fish tissue lipid content and composition. Accordingly, the use of pilot studies will be required to develop correction factors that properly adjust for preservation effects when interpreting temporal patterns in historic analyses of food webs.

        "abstract": "RATIONALE: Many of the interstitial lung diseases represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge because their clinical and even histologic features are often nonspecific. Likewise, the transcriptional signatures of most of them are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the gene expression patterns from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) using custom oligonucleotide microarrays. METHODS: We profiled lung biopsies from 15 patients with IPF, 12 with HP, and eight with NSIP. Labeled complementary ribonucleic acid was hybridized to a custom Affymetrix oligonucleotide DNA microarray using standard Affymetrix protocols. The custom array, Hu03, contained 59,619 probe sets representing an estimated 46,000 gene clusters. RESULTS: We identified statistically significant gene expression signatures that characterize HP and IPF. The HP gene expression signature was enriched for genes that are functionally associated with inflammation, T-cell activation, and immune responses, whereas the IPF signature was characterized by the expression of tissue remodeling, epithelial, and myofibroblast genes. We then compared these gene expression signatures to classify NSIP, a histologic pattern that is often difficult to differentiate consistently from HP and IPF. Two cases exhibited an IPF-like gene expression, another one could be more properly classified as HP, whereas others did not resemble HP or IPF, suggesting that they may represent idiopathic NSIP. CONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore the value of gene expression signatures to classify the interstitial lung diseases and to understand pathogenic mechanisms, and suggest new ways to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with these diseases.",

Previously, we reported disease-associated, partially IL-1 dependent, transcriptional signatures in both T1D patients and the BioBreeding (BB) rat model. Here, we examine temporal signatures in congenic BBDR.lyp/lyp rats that develop spontaneous T1D, and BBDR rats where T1D progresses only after immunological perturbation in young animals. After weaning, the BBDR temporal signature showed early coincident induction of transcription related to innate inflammation as well as IL-10- and TGF-beta-mediated regulation. BBDR plasma cytokine levels mirrored the signatures showing early inflammation, followed by induction of a regulated state that correlated with failure of virus to induce T1D in older rats. In contrast, the BBDR.lyp/lyp temporal signature exhibited asynchronous dynamics, with delayed induction of inflammatory transcription and later, weaker induction of regulatory transcription, consistent with their deficiency in regulatory T cells. Through longitudinal analyses of plasma-induced signatures in BB rats and a human T1D progressor, we have identified changes in immunoregulatory processes that attenuate a preexisting innate inflammatory state in BBDR rats, suggesting a mechanism underlying the decline in T1D susceptibility with age.",

A critical assumption in these applications is that the effect of siRNA on cells is specific, i.e., limited to the specific knockdown of the target gene. In this article, we characterize the specificity of siRNA by applying gene expression profiling. Several siRNAs were designed against different regions of the same target gene for three different targets. Their effects on cells were compared by using DNA microarrays to generate gene expression signatures. When the siRNA design and transfection conditions were optimized, the signatures for different siRNAs against the same target were shown to correlate very closely, whereas the signatures for different genes revealed no correlation. These results indicate that siRNA is a highly specific tool for targeted gene knockdown, establishing siRNA-mediated gene silencing as a reliable approach for large-scale screening of gene function and drug target validation.",

In this framework neutrinos have Dirac masses and the mixed sneutrinos are the lightest supersymmetric particles and hence the dark matter candidates. We analyze the model parameter space in which the sneutrino is a good dark matter particle and has a direct detection cross-section compatible with the LUX bound. Studying the supersymmetric mass spectrum of this region, we find several signatures relevant for LHC, which are distinct from the predictions of the MSSM with neutralino dark matter. For instance two opposite sign and different flavor leptons, three uncorrelated leptons and long-lived staus are the most representative. Simulating both the signal and expected background, we find that the multi-lepton signatures and the long-lived stau are in the reach of the future run of LHC with a luminosity of 100/fb.

        "abstract": "In settings where hard-copy materials which are not allowed to be reproduced by any means but are massively delivered to users security specialists distinguish a real threat which is duplication. Such materials may be banknotes, legal documents like diplomas, CDs or even electronic materials distributed over the internet. One of the ways to fight duplication, software piracy and not only, is the usage of digital signatures. For this reason algorithms and advanced techniques of digital signatures are used nowadays which proved or at least pretended to be secure. Their security is fragile if the secrecy of the key is compromised. Even though the compromise happened unpremeditatedly or as a result of an attack, this causes the production of digital signatures even by \u2018differently interested\u2019 people. In our paper we are going to introduce a digital signature scheme which is based on Rabin scheme. According to this idea we have built an ID generation scheme which can be used in many situations where is needed such a level of security. We will apply this technique in software copy protection.",

A critical assumption in these applications is that the effect of siRNA on cells is specific, i.e., limited to the specific knockdown of the target gene. In this article, we characterize the specificity of siRNA by applying gene expression profiling. Several siRNAs were designed against different regions of the same target gene for three different targets. Their effects on cells were compared by using DNA microarrays to generate gene expression signatures. When the siRNA design and transfection conditions were optimized, the signatures for different siRNAs against the same target were shown to correlate very closely, whereas the signatures for different genes revealed no correlation. These results indicate that siRNA is a highly specific tool for targeted gene knockdown, establishing siRNA-mediated gene silencing as a reliable approach for large-scale screening of gene function and drug target validation.",

Seven of the signatures covered previously investigated residues, whereas the functional importance of the other motifs is unknown. This provides directions for future investigations of alternative activities of TPP II. The obtained signatures provide an efficient bioinformatic tool for the identification of TPP II homologues. Hence, a TPP II sequence homologue from fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, was identified and demonstrated to encode the TPP II-like protein previously reported as multicorn. Furthermore, an homologous protein was found in the prokaryote Blastopirellula marina, albeit the TPP II function was apparently not conserved.

Simultaneous SuperDARN HF radar measurements permitted the study of the associated ionospheric velocity pattern. A good general agreement is observed between the location and movement of velocity enhancements (flow channels) and the PMAFs. Clear signatures of equatorward flow were detected in the vicinity of PMAFs. This flow is believed to be the signature of a return flow outside the reconnected flux tube, as predicted by the Southwood model. The simulated signatures of this model reproduce globally the measured signatures, and differences with the experimental data can be explained by the simplifications of the model. Proposed schemes of the flow modification due to the presence of several flow channels and the modification of cusp and region 1 field-aligned currents at the time of sporadic reconnection events are shown to fit well with the observations.

Certificateless public key cryptography enables a similar functionality of public key infrastructure (PKI) and identity (ID) based cryptography without suffering from complicated certificate management in PKI or secret key escrow problem in ID-based cryptography. In this paper, we present a new efficient certificateless aggregate signature scheme which has the advantages of both aggregate signatures and certificateless cryptography. The scheme is proven existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen-message attacks under the standard computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. Our scheme is also very efficient in both communication and computation and the proposal is practical for many-to-one authentication. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

The particular result of the planet-disk interaction depends on the evolutionary stage of the disk. Primary signatures of planets embedded in disks are gaps in the case of young disks and characteristic asymmetric density patterns in debris disks. We present simulations which demonstrate that high spatial resolution observations performed with instruments/telescopes that will become available in the near future will be able to trace the location and other properties of young and evolved planets.

This allows extraction of signatures of spatial organization and geometrical origins of the points in 3-D space. To test the geometrical tool, we analyze 13550 crystal structures of naturally occurring folded proteins. We report extraction of signatures of a universal spatial organization of backbones of folded proteins.

Researchers study written signatures for psychiatric, penal, health and automatic verification purposes. As a potentially useful, multi-purpose study, this paper is focused on the lexical morphology of handwritten signatures. This we understand to mean the identification, analysis, and description of the signature structures of a given signer. In this work we analyze different public datasets involving 1533 signers from different Western geographical areas. Some relevant characteristics of signature lexical morphology have been selected, examined in terms of their probability distribution functions and modeled through a General Extreme Value distribution.

Significant differences are observed from the angular dependence of the electron energy distribution patterns for the two different approaches, because photon emission is no longer well approximated by a continuous process in the quantum radiation-dominated regime. The stochastic nature of photon emission results in strong signatures of quantum radiation-reaction effects under certain conditions. We show that the laser spot size and duration greatly influence these signatures due to the competition of QED effects and the ponderomotive force, which is well described in the classical approximation. The clearest signatures of quantum radiation reaction are found in the limit of large laser spots and few cycle pulse durations.",

Claims to detect the phenomenon are evaluated by comparing such simulated signatures with actual data. Here I provide a justification for this practice by showing how computer simulations establish the reliability of detection procedures. I argue that this use of computer simulation undermines two fundamental tenets of the Bogen\u2013Woodward account of evidential reasoning. Contrary to Bogen and Woodward\u2019s view, computer-simulated signatures rely on \u2018downward\u2019 inferences from phenomena to data. Furthermore, these simulations establish the reliability of experimental setups without physically interacting with the apparatus.

Consequently no customers seek to obtain signature products.

We show that their attributes related to the rate of adoption are far from optimal. We then take a look at efforts being undertaken to increase the adoption of qualified electronic signatures.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: DNA word frequencies, normalized for genomic AT content, are remarkably stable within prokaryotic genomes and are therefore said to reflect a \"genomic signature.\" The genomic signatures can be used to phylogenetically classify organisms from arbitrary sampled DNA. Genomic signatures can also be used to search for horizontally transferred DNA or DNA regions subjected to special selection forces. Thus, the stability of the genomic signature can be used as a measure of genomic homogeneity. The factors associated with the stability of the genomic signatures are not known, and this motivated us to investigate further. We analyzed the intra-genomic variance of genomic signatures based on AT content normalization (0(th) order Markov model) as well as genomic signatures normalized by smaller DNA words (1(st) and 2(nd) order Markov models) for 636 sequenced prokaryotic genomes. Regression models were fitted, with intra-genomic signature variance as the response variable, to a set of factors representing genomic properties such as genomic AT content, genome size, habitat, phylum, oxygen requirement, optimal growth temperature and oligonucleotide usage variance (OUV, a measure of oligonucleotide usage bias), measured as the variance between genomic tetranucleotide frequencies and Markov chain approximated tetranucleotide frequencies, as predictors.\\n\\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Regression analysis revealed that OUV was the most important factor (p<0.001) determining intra-genomic homogeneity as measured using genomic signatures. This means that the less random the oligonucleotide usage is in the sense of higher OUV, the more homogeneous the genome is in terms of the genomic signature. The other factors influencing variance in the genomic signature (p<0.001) were genomic AT content, phylum and oxygen requirement.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Genomic homogeneity in prokaryotes is intimately linked to genomic GC content, oligonucleotide usage bias (OUV) and aerobiosis, while oligonucleotide usage bias (OUV) is associated with genomic GC content, aerobiosis and habitat.",

        "abstract": "Microglial cells become rapidly activated through interactions with pathogens, and the persistent activation of these cells is associated with various neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have investigated the transcriptomic signatures in microglia or macrophages using microarray technologies. However, this method has numerous restrictions, such as spatial biases, uneven probe properties, low sensitivity, and dependency on the probes spotted. To overcome this limitation and identify novel transcribed genes in response to {LPS,} we used {RNA} Sequencing {(RNA-Seq)} to determine the novel transcriptomic signatures in {BV-2} microglial cells. Sequencing assessment and quality evaluation showed that approximately 263 and 319 genes (&#x2265; 1.5 log2-fold), such as cytokines and chemokines, were strongly induced after 2 and 4 h, respectively, and the induction of several genes with unknown immunological functions was also observed. Importantly, we observed that previously unidentified transcription factors {(TFs)} (irf1, irf7, and irf9), histone demethylases (kdm4a) and {DNA} methyltransferases (dnmt3l) were significantly and selectively expressed in {BV-2} microglial cells. The gene expression levels, transcription start sites {(TSS),} isoforms, and differential promoter usage revealed a complex pattern of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation upon infection with {LPS.} In addition, gene ontology, molecular networks and pathway analyses identified the top significantly regulated functional classification, canonical pathways and network functions at each activation status. Moreover, we further analyzed differentially expressed genes to identify transcription factor {(TF)} motifs (-950 to +50 bp of the 5' upstream promoters) and epigenetic mechanisms. Furthermore, we confirmed that the expressions of key inflammatory genes as well as pro-inflammatory mediators in the supernatants were significantly induced in {LPS} treated primary microglial cells. This transcriptomic analysis is the first to show a comparison of the family-wide differential expression of most known immune genes and also reveal transcription evidence of multiple gene families in {BV-2} microglial cells. Collectively, these findings reveal unique transcriptomic signatures in {BV-2} microglial cells required for homeostasis and effective immune responses.",

PTMs, however, may interact or interfere with one another when regulating protein function. Yet, characterization of the structural and functional signatures of their crosstalk has been hindered by the scarcity of data. To this end, we developed a unified sequence-based predictor of 23 types of PTM sites that, we believe, is a useful tool in guiding biological experiments and data interpretation. We then used experimentally determined and predicted PTM sites to investigate two particular cases of potential PTM crosstalk in eukaryotes. First, we identified proteins statistically enriched in multiple types of PTM sites and found that they show preferences toward intrinsically disordered regions as well as functional roles in transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and developmental processes. Second, we observed that target sites modified by more than one type of PTM, referred to as shared PTM sites, show even stronger preferences toward disordered regions than their single-PTM counterparts; we explain this by the need for these regions to accommodate multiple partners. Finally, we investigated the influence of single and shared PTMs on differential regulation of protein-protein interactions. We provide evidence that molecular recognition features (MoRFs) show significant preferences for PTM sites, particularly shared PTM sites, implicating PTMs in the modulation of this specific type of macromolecular recognition. We conclude that intrinsic disorder is a strong structural prerequisite for complex PTM-based regulation, particularly in context-dependent protein-protein interactions related to transcriptional and developmental processes.

        "abstract": "The extent and pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between closely spaced markers contain information about population history, including past population size and selection history. Selection signatures can be identified by comparing the LD surrounding a putative selected allele at a locus to the putative non-selected allele. In livestock populations, locations of selection signatures identified in this way should be correlated with QTL affecting production traits, as the populations have been under strong artificial selection for these traits. We used a dense SNP map of bovine chromosome 6 to characterize the pattern of LD on this chromosome in Norwegian Red cattle, a breed which has been strongly selected for milk production. The pattern of LD was generally consistent with strong selection in regions containing QTL affecting milk production traits, including a strong selection signature in a region containing a mutation known to affect milk production. The results demonstrate that in livestock populations, the origin of selection signatures will often be QTL for livestock production traits, and illustrate the value of selection signatures in uncovering new mutations with potential effects on quantitative traits.",

        "abstract": "Image re-ranking, as an effective way to improve the results of web-based image search, has been adopted by current commercial search engines such as Bing and Google. Given a query keyword, a pool of images are first retrieved based on textual information. By asking the user to select a query image from the pool, the remaining images are re-ranked based on their visual similarities with the query image. A major challenge is that the similarities of visual features do not well correlate with images' semantic meanings which interpret users' search intention. Recently people proposed to match images in a semantic space which used attributes or reference classes closely related to the semantic meanings of images as basis. However, learning a universal visual semantic space to characterize highly diverse images from the web is difficult and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel image re-ranking framework, which automatically offline learns different semantic spaces for different query keywords. The visual features of images are projected into their related semantic spaces to get semantic signatures. At the online stage, images are re-ranked by comparing their semantic signatures obtained from the semantic space specified by the query keyword. The proposed query-specific semantic signatures significantly improve both the accuracy and efficiency of image re-ranking. The original visual features of thousands of dimensions can be projected to the semantic signatures as short as 25 dimensions. Experimental results show that 25-40 percent relative improvement has been achieved on re-ranking precisions compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Following domestication, livestock breeds have experienced intense selection pressures for the development of desirable traits. This has resulted in a large diversity of breeds that display variation in many phenotypic traits, such as coat colour, muscle composition, early maturity, growth rate, body size, reproduction, and behaviour. To better understand the relationship between genomic composition and phenotypic diversity arising from breed development, the genomes of 13 traditional and commercial European pig breeds were scanned for signatures of diversifying selection using the Porcine60K SNP chip, applying a between-population (differentiation) approach. Signatures of diversifying selection between breeds were found in genomic regions associated with traits related to breed standard criteria, such as coat colour and ear morphology. Amino acid differences in the EDNRB gene appear to be associated with one of these signatures, and variation in the KITLG gene may be associated with another. Other selection signals were found in genomic regions including QTLs and genes associated with production traits such as reproduction, growth, and fat deposition. Some selection signatures were associated with regions showing evidence of introgression from Asian breeds. When the European breeds were compared with wild boar, genomic regions with high levels of differentiation harboured genes related to bone formation, growth, and fat deposition.",

        "abstract": "During the tropical cyclone season of 2004, there were four tropical cyclones that spawned tornadoes in central North Carolina: Frances, Gaston, Ivan, and Jeanne. This study examines the environmental characteristics and radar signatures from these events. The tornado warning decision-making process is a difficult one during any severe weather event, but it is even more difficult in a tropical cyclone environment because of the subtlety of features and rapid tornadogenesis that can occur. Previous studies that have examined the characteristics of a tropical cyclone environment found that high low-level moisture content, high shear, and a midlevel intrusion of dry air are favorable for tornadoes. The tropical cyclones that are examined in the current study all exhibited these characteristics. Radar signatures associated with these tornadoes were more subtle and weaker when compared with nontropical cyclone tornadoes, but were still discernable. This study analyzed the radar signatures from tornadic and nontornadic storms in a tropical cyclone environment with the purpose of determining the best indicators of tornadogenesis. Three precursors were found to give good lead time for tornado touchdowns: 1) a near gate-to-gate mesocyclone rotational velocity of 20 kt ( 10.3 m s(-1)) or greater, 2) a hook or appendage signature in the reflectivity data, and 3) the presence of a velocity enhancement signature of 30 kt ( 15.4 m s(-1)) or greater between 7000 ft ( 2.1 km) and 14 000 ft ( 4.2 km) AGL. Using these signatures together in the tornado warning decision-making process can increase lead time and accuracy in the tropical cyclone environment.",

Molecular information about patients is usually generated from high throughput technologies such as microarray and mass spectrometry. Statistically, we are challenged by the large number of candidates but only a small number of patients in the study, and the right-censored clinical data further complicate the analysis. Results: We present a two-stage procedure to profile molecular signatures for survival outcomes. Firstly, we group closely-related molecular features into linkage clusters, each portraying either similar or opposite functions and playing similar roles in prognosis; secondly, a Bayesian approach is developed to rank the centroids of these linkage clusters and provide a list of the main molecular features closely related to the outcome of interest. A simulation study showed the superior performance of our approach. When it was applied to data on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we were able to identify some new candidate signatures for disease prognosis. Conclusion: This multivariate approach provides researchers with a more reliable list of molecular features profiled in terms of their prognostic relationship to the event times, and generates dependable information for subsequent identification of prognostic molecular signatures through either biological procedures or further data analysis.",

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data in the 0.4 \u2013 2.5 micrometer spectral range allow direct identification of materials using their fully resolved spectral signatures, however, spatial coverage is limited. Multispectral Imaging data (MSI) are spectrally undersampled and may not allow unique identification, but they do provide synoptic spatial coverage. This paper summarizes an approach that uses coincident HSI/MSI data to extend HSI results to cover larger areas. Airborne Visible/Infrared (AVIRIS)/Hyperion and multispectral ASTER/MASTER data supported by field spectral measurements are used to allow modeling and extension of hyperspectral signatures to multispectral data. Full-scene mapping using the modeled signatures allows subsequent mapping of extended areas using the multispectral data. Both the hyperspectral and multispectral data are atmospherically corrected using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) atmospheric correction software. Hyperspectral data are then analyzed to determine spectral endmembers and their spatial distributions, and validated using the field spectral measurements. Spectral modeling is used to convert the hyperspectral spectral signatures to the multispectral data response. Reflectance calibrated multispectral data are then used to extend the hyperspectral mapping to the larger spatial coverage of the multispectral data. Field verification of mapping results is conducted and accuracy assessment performed. Additional sites are assessed with multispectral data using the modeling methodology based on scene-external HSI and/or field spectra (but without scene-specific a priori hyperspectral analysis or knowledge). These results are further compared to field measurements and subsequent hyperspectral analysis and mapping to validate the spectral modeling approach.",

Plausible global poses are found out by matching signatures of observed features with signatures of global map features. The concept of matching signatures is so developed that the proposed method provides a very efficient solution for global localization. Worst-case complexity of the method for estimating and verifying global poses is linear with the size of global reference map. It will also be shown that with the approach of random sampling the proposed algorithm becomes linear with both the size of global map and number of observed features. In order to avoid pose ambiguity, simultaneous tracking of multiple pose hypotheses staying within the same framework of the proposed method is also addressed.

        "abstract": "Segmentation of satellite images is an important step for the success of the object detection and recognition in image processing. Segmentation is the process of dividing the image into disjoint homogeneous regions. There are many segmentation methods and approaches, the most popular are clustering methods and approaches such as Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and K-means. The success of clustering methods depends strongly on the selection of the initial spectral signatures. Normally, this is done either manually or randomly, in either case the outcome is unpredictable. In this paper an unsupervised method based on Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) for the selection of spectral signature from satellite images is described. The new method works by maximizing the number of the selected pixels (minimize over-segmentation) and by minimizing the difference between these pixels and their spectral signature (maximize homogeneity). Experimental results are conducted using a high resolution SPOT V satellite image, the collected spectral signatures, and the K-means clustering algorithm. The verification of the segmentation results is based on a very high resolution satellite image of type QuickBird. The spectral signatures provided to K-means by MOGA increased the speed of clustering to approximately 4 times the speed of the random based selection of signatures. At the same time MOGA improved the accuracy of the results of clustering using K-means to more than 10 %.",

        "abstract": "Adopting publicly accessible platforms such as cloud computing model to host IT systems has become a leading trend. Although this helps to minimize cost and increase availability and reachability of applications, it has serious implications on applications\u2019 security. Hackers can easily exploit vulnerabilities in such publically accessible services. In addition to, 75% of the total reported application vulnerabilities are web application specific. Identifying such known vulnerabilities as well as newly discovered vulnerabilities is a key challenging security requirement. However, existing vulnerability analysis tools cover no more than 47% of the known vulnerabilities. We introduce a new solution that supports automated vulnerability analysis using formalized vulnerability signatures. Instead of depending on formal methods to locate vulnerability instances where analyzers have to be developed to locate specific vulnerabilities, our approach incorporates a formal vulnerability signature described using OCL. Using this formal signature, we perform program analysis of the target system to locate signature matches (i.e. signs of possible vulnerabilities). A newly\u2013discovered vulnerability can be easily identified in a target program provided that a formal signature for it exists. We have developed a prototype static vulnerability analysis tool based on our formalized vulnerability signatures specification approach. We have validated our approach in capturing signatures of the OWSAP Top10 vulnerabilities and applied these signatures in analyzing a set of seven benchmark applications.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Selection signatures are genomic regions harboring DNA sequences functionally involved in the genetic variation of traits subject to selection. Selection signatures have been intensively studied in recent years because of their relevance to evolutionary biology and their potential association with genes that control phenotypes of interest in wild and domestic populations. Selection signature research in fish has been confined to a smaller scale, due in part to the relatively recent domestication of fish species and limited genomic resources such as molecular markers, genetic mapping, DNA sequences, and reference genomes. However, recent genomic technology advances are paving the way for more studies that may contribute to the knowledge of genomic regions underlying phenotypes of biological and productive interest in fish.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microarray gene expression (MAGE) signatures allow insights into the transcriptional processes of leukemias and may evolve as a molecular diagnostic test. Introduction of MAGE into clinical practice of leukemia diagnosis will require comprehensive assessment of variation due to the methodologies. Here we systematically assessed the impact of three different total RNA isolation procedures on variation in expression data: method A: lysis of mononuclear cells, followed by lysate homogenization and RNA extraction; method B: organic solvent based RNA isolation, and method C: organic solvent based RNA isolation followed by purification. RESULTS: We analyzed 27 pediatric acute leukemias representing nine distinct subtypes and show that method A yields better RNA quality, was associated with more differentially expressed genes between leukemia subtypes, demonstrated the lowest degree of variation between experiments, was more reproducible, and was characterized with a higher precision in technical replicates. Unsupervised and supervised analyses grouped leukemias according to lineage and clinical features in all three methods, thus underlining the robustness of MAGE to identify leukemia specific signatures. CONCLUSION: The signatures in the different subtypes of leukemias, regardless of the different extraction methods used, account for the biggest source of variation in the data. Lysis of mononuclear cells, followed by lysate homogenization and RNA extraction represents the optimum method for robust gene expression data and is thus recommended for obtaining robust classification results in microarray studies in acute leukemias.",

Gene-expression signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from over one hundred patients with conditions presenting a strong immunological component (patient with autoimmune, graft versus host and infectious diseases, as well as immunosuppressed transplant recipients) were generated. This dataset provides the opportunity to carry out comparative analyses and define disease signatures in a broader context. Transcriptional changes of 22,283 probe sets were evaluated through statistical group comparison performed systematically for seven diseases versus their respective healthy control group. Patterns of significance were generated by hierarchical clustering of P-values. This approach led to the identification of a SLE-specific \"diagnostic signature,\" formed by genes that did not change compared to healthy subjects in the other six diseases. Conversely, a \"sentinel signature\" that was common to all seven diseases was characterized. These findings bring new perspectives for the application of blood leukocyte expression signatures for diagnosis and early disease detection.",

Although many of the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation are shared between plants and animals, plants are distinctly different in that they rely more heavily on subtle environmental cues than animals do because they are sessile, and they continue to develop new organs post-embryonically. These unusual features require constant refinement at the transcriptional level to implement large-scale gene expression changes. Many signalling pathways converge at the level of transcription in plants, including hormone-response pathways and light-response pathways, forming complex gene regulatory networks and intricate feed-back loops to control the growth and development of plants. Additionally, alterations to the chromatin such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation and histone modifications can also affect transcriptional regulation and even lead to the formation of epialleles and genomic imprinting.",

We show that a simple, compact enhancer is capable of representing both repressed and activated states at the same time and in the same nucleus. This finding suggests that closely apposed factor binding sites, situated within compact cis-elements, can be independently interpreted by the transcriptional machinery, possibly through successive enhancer-promoter interactions. These results provide clear evidence that the computational functions usually ascribed to the enhancer itself are actually shared with the basal machinery. In contrast to the autonomous computer model of enhancer function, an information-display or 'billboard' model of enhancer activity may better describe many developmentally regulated transcriptional enhancers.",

A central problem to be addressed is how transcriptional programs are set up and then modified throughout the successive steps of embryonic development. The book Transcriptional Switches during Development provides a broad range of insights into the molecular determinants of such transcriptional switches during development. It summarizes efforts to tackle this question in various model systems, each with their advantages and limitations. These contributions also show that different scales of analysis are required together to solve the problem of gene expression control during development. It is believed that the combination of both genome-wide approaches (experimental or predictive) and functional analyses scrutinizing the intimate details of each element is the most promising way to unravel the control of terminal differentiation and its evolutionary diversification.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Signaling via B cell receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) results in activation of B cells with distinct physiological outcomes, but transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that drive activation and distinguish these pathways remain unknown.\\n\\nRESULTS: Two hours after ligand exposure RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and computational methods reveal that BCR- or TLR-mediated activation of primary resting B cells proceeds via a large set of shared and a smaller subset of distinct signal-selective transcriptional responses. BCR stimulation resulted in increased global recruitment of RNA Pol II to promoters that appear to transit slowly to downstream regions. Conversely, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation involved an enhanced RNA Pol II transition from initiating to elongating mode accompanied by greater H3K4me3 activation markings compared to BCR stimulation. These rapidly diverging transcriptomic landscapes also show distinct repressing (H3K27me3) histone signatures, mutually exclusive transcription factor binding in promoters, and unique miRNA profiles.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Upon examination of genome-wide transcription and regulatory elements, we conclude that the B cell commitment to different activation states occurs much earlier than previously thought and involves a multi-faceted receptor-specific transcriptional landscape.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated extensive transcriptional activity across the human genome, a substantial fraction of which is not associated with any functional annotation. However, very little is known regarding the post-transcriptional processes that operate within the different classes of RNA molecules. To characterize the post-transcriptional properties of expressed sequences from human chromosome 21 (HSA21), we separated RNA molecules from three cell lines (GM06990, HeLa S3, and SK-N-AS) according to their ribosome content by sucrose gradient fractionation. Polyribosomal-associated RNA and total RNA were subsequently hybridized to genomic tiling arrays. We found that approximately 50% of the transcriptional signals were located outside of annotated exons and were considered as TARs (transcriptionally active regions). Although TARs were observed among polysome-associated RNAs, RT-PCR and RACE experiments revealed that approximately 40% were likely to represent nonspecific cross-hybridization artifacts. Bioinformatics discrimination of TARs according to conservation and sequence complexity allowed us to identify a set of high-confidence TARs. This set of TARs was significantly depleted in the polysomes, suggesting that it was not likely to be involved in translation. Analysis of polysome representation of RefSeq exons showed that at least 15% of RefSeq transcripts undergo significant post-transcriptional regulation in at least two of the three cell lines tested. Among the regulated transcripts, enrichment analysis revealed an over-representation of genes involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including APP and the BACE1 protease that cleaves APP to produce the pathogenic beta 42 peptide. We demonstrate that the combination of RNA fractionation and tiling arrays is a powerful method to assess the transcriptional and post-transcriptional properties of genomic regions.",

To get an integrated view of these processes, both whole thymi from genetically engineered mice together with purified thymocytes were analyzed. Using mice exhibiting various transcriptional perturbations and developmental blockades, we performed a transcriptional microdissection of the organ. Multiple signatures covering both cortical and medullary stroma as well as various thymocyte maturation intermediates were clearly defined. Beyond the definition of histological and functional signatures (proliferation, rearrangement), we provide the first evidence that such an approach may also highlight the complex cross-talk events that occur between maturing T cells and stroma. Our data constitute a useful integrated resource describing the main gene networks set up during thymocyte development and a first step toward a more systematic transcriptional analysis of genetically modified mice.",

Such signatures have been demonstrated to classify subtypes of breast cancers. Because DNA methylation is critical in programming gene expression, a change in methylation from a normal to diseased state should be similarly reflected in a signature of DNA methylation that involves multiple gene pathways. Whole-genome approaches have recently been used with different levels of success to delineate breast-cancer-specific DNA methylation signatures, and to test whether they can classify breast cancer and whether they could be associated with specific clinical outcomes. Recent work suggests that DNA methylation signatures will extend our ability to classify breast cancer and predict outcome beyond what is currently possible. DNA methylation is a robust biomarker, vastly more stable than RNA or proteins, and is therefore a promising target for the development of new approaches for diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer and other diseases. Here, I review the scientific basis for using DNA methylation signatures in breast cancer classification and prognosis. I discuss the role of DNA methylation in normal gene regulation, the aberrations in DNA methylation in cancer, and candidate-gene and whole-genome approaches to classify breast cancer subtypes using DNA methylation markers.",

While being highly efficient, they tend to suffer from a high false-positive rate. We develop the concept of contextual signatures as an improvement of string-based signature-matching. Rather than matching fixed strings in isolation, we augment the matching process with additional context. When designing an efficient signature engine for the NIDS bro, we provide low-level context by using regular expressions for matching, and high-level context by taking advantage of the semantic information made available by bro's protocol analysis and scripting language. Therewith, we greatly enhance the signature's expressiveness and hence the ability to reduce false positives. We present several examples such as matching requests with replies, using knowledge of the environment, defining dependencies between signatures to model step-wise attacks, and recognizing exploit scans.To leverage existing efforts, we convert the comprehensive signature set of the popular freeware NIDS snort into bro's language. While this does not provide us with improved signatures by itself, we reap an established base to build upon. Consequently, we evaluate our work by comparing to snort, discussing in the process several general problems of comparing different NIDSs.",

Our statistical analysis led to the identification of a number of gene combinations whose expression patterns serve well as signatures of different grades and different stages of gastric cancer. A 19-gene signature was found to have discerning power between high- and low-grade gastric cancers in general, with overall classification accuracy at 79.6%. An expanded 198-gene panel allows the stratification of cancers into four grades and control, giving rise to an overall classification agreement of 74.2% between each grade designated by the pathologists and our prediction. Two signatures for cancer staging, consisting of 10 genes and 9 genes, respectively, provide high classification accuracies at 90.0% and 84.0%, among early-, advanced-stage cancer and control. Functional and pathway analyses on these signature genes reveal the significant relevance of the derived signatures to cancer grades and progression. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first study on identification of genes whose expression patterns can serve as markers for cancer grades and stages.",

We used geochemical signatures in the otoliths of American shad Alosa sapidissima to determine natal origins and estimate rates of straying among river-specific populations along the U.S. Atlantic coast. Stable isotope (d13C, d18O and 87Sr:86Sr) and elemental (Mg:Ca, Mn:Ca, Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca) signatures in otoliths of juvenile American shad from rivers from Georgia to New Hampshire varied significantly, allowing for an average of 91% cross-validated accuracy when classifying individual fish to their natal rivers. We also found significant interannual variability in the geochemical signatures from several rivers, due largely to differences in d18O values among years. We then used the ground-truthed geochemical signatures in the otoliths of juvenile American shad to identify the natal origins of spawning adults in the York River system in Virginia. Approximately 6% of the spawning adults collected in the York River were strays from other rivers. Of the remaining fish, 79% were spawned in the Mattaponi River and 21% in the Pamunkey River. The combined results of this and other recent studies suggest that although most American shad spawning in the York River were homing to their natal river, there was much less fidelity to individual tributaries. Small-scale straying could allow fish spawned in the Mattaponi River to subsidize spawning in the Pamunkey River, which has experienced persistent recruitment failure.",

        "abstract": "We present a new method for automatic target/object classification by using the optimum polarimetric radar signatures of the targets/objects of interest. The state-of-the-art in radar target recognition is based mostly either on the use of single polarimetric pairs or on the four preset pairs of orthogonal polarimetric signatures. Due to these limitations, polarimetric radar processing has been fruitful only in the area of noise suppression and target detection. The use of target separability criteria for the optimal selection of radar signal state of polarizations is addressed here. The polarization scattering matrix is used for the derivation of target signatures at arbitrary transmit and receive polarization states (arbitrary polarization inclination angles and ellipticity angles). Then, an optimization criterion that minimizes the within-class distance and maximizes the between-class metrics is used for the derivation of optimum sets of polarimetric states. The results of the application of this approach on real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of military vehicles are obtained. The results show that noticeable improvements in target separability and consequently target classification can be achieved by the use of the optimum over nonoptimum signatures",

        "abstract": "Coincident detections of electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) signatures from coalescence events of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are the next observational grand challenge. Such detections will provide the means to study cosmological evolution and accretion processes associated with these gargantuan compact objects. More generally, the observations will enable testing general relativity in the strong, nonlinear regime and will provide independent cosmological measurements to high precision. Understanding the conditions under which coincidences of EM and GW signatures arise during SMBH mergers is therefore of paramount importance. As an essential step toward this goal, we present results from the first fully general relativistic, hydrodynamical study of the late inspiral and merger of equal-mass, spinning SMBH binaries in a gas cloud. We find that variable EM signatures correlated with GWs can arise in merging systems as a consequence of shocks and accretion combined with the effect of relativistic beaming. The most striking EM variability is observed for systems where spins are aligned with the orbital axis and where orbiting black holes form a stable set of density wakes, but all systems exhibit some characteristic signatures that can be utilized in searches for EM counterparts. In the case of the most massive binaries observable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, calculated luminosities imply that they may be identified by EM searches to z  1, while lower mass systems and binaries immersed in low density ambient gas can only be detected in the local universe.",

        "abstract": "Natural selection and selective breeding for genetic improvement have left detectable signatures within the genome of a species. Identification of selection signatures is important in evolutionary biology and for detecting genes that facilitate to accelerate genetic improvement. However, selection signatures, including artificial selection and natural selection, have only been identified at the whole genome level in several genetically improved fish species. Tilapia is one of the most important genetically improved fish species in the world. Using next-generation sequencing, we sequenced the genomes of 47 tilapia individuals. We identified a total of 1.43 million high-quality SNPs and found that the LD block sizes ranged from 10\u2013100 kb in tilapia. We detected over a hundred putative selective sweep regions in each line of tilapia. Most selection signatures were located in non-coding regions of the tilapia genome. The Wnt signaling, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor and integrin signaling pathways were under positive selection in all improved tilapia lines. Our study provides a genome-wide map of genetic variation and selection footprints in tilapia, which could be important for genetic studies and accelerating genetic improvement of tilapia.",

        "abstract": "Despite their simplifying assumptions, simple SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed)-type models for a homogeneously mixing fully susceptible population continue to provide useful insight and predictive capability. However, non-homogeneous mixing models such as those for outbreaks in social networks are often believed to provide better predictions of the benefits of various mitigation strategies such as isolation or vaccination. In practice, it is rarely known to what extent a SEIR-type model will adequately describe a given population. Therefore, our goal here is to evaluate possible retrospective signatures of non-homogeneous mixing or non-SEIR-type behavior. Each signature evaluated here is a measure of the goodness of fit of a SEIR-type model curve to the actual epidemic curve. For example, the extents of agreement between the final outbreak size and predictions of the final outbreak size based on reproduction number estimates arising from fitting various portions of the epidemic curve are possible signatures. On the basis of simulated outbreaks, we conclude that such signatures can detect non-SEIR-type behavior in some but not all of the social structures considered. The simulation study confirms that these signatures indicate non-SEIR-type behavior in a real 1918 influenza outbreak in Geneva. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The reflectance directional signatures are quantified by the three parameters of a modified version of the Ross-Li reflectance model. The variability of the estimated parameters with respect to the seven MODIS biome classes was found to be higher within the classes than between classes, with the exception of the desert targets that show more isotropic reflectances. A limited number of standard BRDFs (typically 5 in the red and near infrared) capture most of the variability of the directional reflectance measurements, supporting the idea that different land surfaces have similar directional signatures. Over vegetation targets, they are characterized by a strong increase toward backscattering and much smaller variations in forward directions. The results express the diversity in structural situations within a given biome class and indicate that, at the resolution of the POLDER sensor, i.e. a few kilometers, the BRDF contains little information on the dominant vegetation type. We show that standard directional signatures may be used to correct the reflectance measurements for directional effects with an RMS error on the order of 0.011 in the red and 0.015 in the near infrared. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Three characteristic surface signatures and the corresponding flow processes are identified: the carrier gravity wave, the parasitic capillary wavelets, and the elongated streaks. The elongated streaks are induced by both the coherent streamwise vortices formed within the turbulent shear layer and the Langmuir circulations arising from nonlinear interaction between the carrier gravity wave and the drift current. All three surface signatures can be observed in the distributions of various quantities, although some are more apparent than the others. Image-processing techniques, employing empirical mode decomposition and phase averaging, are developed to decompose the distinct signatures thus to quantify the contributions by the responsible flow processes. It is found that elongated streaks prevail the distribution of surface temperature and gas flux, indicating that Langmuir cells and the coherent eddies contribute to the major interfacial heat and gas transport. These eddies also induced strong cross-stream velocity divergence at the water surface, which exhibits resemblant elongated distribution as that of gas flux (correlation coefficient approximate to 0.6). High correlation between the surface distributions of temperature and gas flux is observed (correlation coefficient approximate to 0.8 to 0.9), suggesting that the spatial and temporal distribution of surface temperature is a good proxy tracer of interfacial gas transfer.",

        "abstract": "The different types of asymmetry observed in the energy distributions of electrons and heavy-ions (M/Q=16-44) during signatures of electron precipitation in the Martian ionosphere have been classified. This has been achieved using the space plasma instrumentation of MEX ASPERA-3 from peri-centre altitude to 2200 km. ASPERA-3 ELS observes signatures of electron precipitation on 43.0% of MEX orbits. Unaccelerated electrons in the form of sudden electron flux enhancements are the most common type of electron precipitation signature at Mars and account for \u223c70% of the events observed in this study. Electrons that form unaccelerated electron precipitation signatures are either local ionospheric electrons with enhanced density, or electrons transported from another region of ionosphere, solar wind or tail, or a combination of local and transported electrons. The heating of electrons has a strong influence on the shape of most electron energy spectra from accelerated precipitation signatures. On most occasions the general flow of heavy-ions away from Mars is unchanged during the precipitation of electrons, which is thought to be the result of the finite gyroradius effect of the heavy-ions on crustal magnetic field lines. Only \u223c17% of events show some form of heavy-ion acceleration that is either concurrent or at the periphery of an electron precipitation signature. The most common combination of electron and heavy-ion energy distributions for signatures of electron precipitation involves electrons that visually have very little asymmetry or are isotropic and heavy-ions that have a upward net flux, and suggest the upward current associated with aurora. Due to a lack of reliable measurements of electrons travelling towards Mars, it is likely we miss further evidence of upward currents. The second most common combination of electron and heavy-ion energy distributions for signatures of electron precipitation, are those distributions of electrons that are asymmetric and have an net upward flux, with distributions of heavy-ions that also have a net upward flux. Energy distributions of heavy-ions with a net flux towards Mars occur half as often as heavy-ions with an upward net flux. There is also evidence to suggest we observe downward currents during electron precipitation signatures when we find energy distributions of electrons that are asymmetric and have an upward net flux, combined with energy distributions of heavy-ions that have a downward net flux. Wave particle interactions and downward parallel electric fields may be responsible for electrons that display a large amount of asymmetry in the upward direction of the energy distribution and have a upward net flux. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the context of an inflamed tissue, extensive changes in gene expression occur in both parenchymal cells and infiltrating cells of the immune system. Recently, basic transcriptional mechanisms that control inflammation have been clarified at a genome scale, particularly in macrophages and conventional dendritic cells. The regulatory logic of distinct groups of inflammatory genes can be explained to some extent by identifiable sequence-encoded features of their chromatin organization, which impact on transcription factor (TF) accessibility and impose different requirements for gene activation. Moreover, it has become apparent that the interplay between TFs activated by inflammatory stimuli and master regulators exerts a crucial role in controlling cell-type-specific transcriptional outputs.",

Researchers working in multiple model organisms - notably yeast, insects and mammalian cells - have shown that pre-mRNA can be spliced during the process of transcription (i.e. co-transcriptionally), as well as after transcription termination (i.e. post-transcriptionally). Co-transcriptional splicing does not assume that transcription and splicing machineries are mechanistically coupled, yet it raises this possibility. Early studies were based on a limited number of genes, which were often chosen because of their experimental accessibility. Since 2010, eight studies have used global datasets as counting tools, in order to quantify co-transcriptional intron removal. The consensus view, based on four organisms, is that the majority of splicing events take place co-transcriptionally in most cells and tissues. Here, we discuss the nature of the various global datasets and how bioinformatic analyses were conducted. Considering the broad differences in experimental approach and analysis, the level of agreement on the prevalence of co-transcriptional splicing is remarkable.",

We analyze amino acids in specific bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cell sub-populations (i.e. GABAergic vs. glycinergic amacrine cells) and anatomically distinct regions of photoreceptors and M\u00fcller cells (i.e. cell bodies vs. endfeet) by extracting data from previously described pattern recognition analysis. Pattern recognition statistically classifies all cells in the retina based on their neurochemical profile and surpasses the previous limitations of anatomical and morphological identification of cells in the immature retina. We found that the GABA and glycine cellular content reached adult-like levels in most neurons before glutamate. The metabolic amino acids glutamine, aspartate and alanine also reached maturity in most retinal cells before eye opening. When the overall amino acid profiles were considered for each cell group, ganglion cells and GABAergic amacrine cells matured first, followed by glycinergic amacrine cells and finally bipolar cells. Photoreceptor cell bodies reached adult-like amino acid profiles at P7 whilst M\u00fcller cells acquired typical amino acid profiles in their cell bodies at P7 and in their endfeet by P14. We further compared the amino acid profiles of the C57Bl/6J mouse with the transgenic X-inactivation mouse carrying the lacZ gene on the X chromosome and validated this animal model for the study of normal retinal development. This study provides valuable insight into normal retinal neurochemical maturation and metabolism and benchmark amino acid values for comparison with retinal disease, particularly those which occur during development.",

Spontaneous breaking of the symmetry inevitably leads to fields with masses of order the Hubble scale during inflation. When these fields couple to the inflaton they produce a unique signature in the squeezed limit of the three-point function of primordial curvature perturbations. In this paper, we make this connection between naturalness, supersymmetry, Hubble-mass degrees of freedom and the squeezed limit precise. To study the physics in a model-insensitive way, we develop a supersymmetric effective theory of inflation. We use the effective theory to classify all possible interactions between the inflaton and the additional fields, and determine which ones naturally allow large non-Gaussianities when protected by supersymmetry. Finally, we discuss the tantalizing prospect of using cosmological observations as a probe of supersymmetry.",

As an application of this general relativity effect, we consider a pre-inflationary anisotropic geometry characterized by a Kasner-like expansion, which is driven dynamically towards inflation by a scalar field. We investigate the evolution of linear metric fluctuations around this background, and calculate the amplification of the long-wavelength GW of a certain polarization during the anisotropic expansion (this effect is absent for another GW polarization, and for scalar fluctuations). These GW are superimposed to the usual tensor modes of quantum origin from inflation, and are potentially observable if the total number of inflationary e-folds exceeds the minimum required to homogenize the observable universe only by a small margin. Their contribution to the temperature anisotropy angular power spectrum decreases with the multipole l as l^(-p), where p depends on the slope of the initial GW power-spectrum. Constraints on the long-wavelength GW can be translated into limits on the total duration of inflation and the initial GW amplitude. The instability of classical GW (and zero-vacuum fluctuations of gravitons) during Kasner-like expansion (or contraction) may have other interesting applications. In particular, if GW become non-linear, they can significantly alter the geometry before the onset of inflation.",

The primary operating mode of operational radars consists in simultaneous transmission and simultaneous receive of both horizontal and vertical components. The secondary operating mode consists of horizontal transmission and simultaneous receive. Both degrees of polarization are investigated in this thesis. Also, as operational systems are being updated to dual-polarization, research should start investigating the capabilities of fully polarimetric weather radar systems.

This hypothesis has mainly been supported by family cohort studies and the immunological abnormalities found in ASD patients, but had limited findings in genetic association testing.

In the polygenic score test, we examined whether ASD risk alleles with low effect sizes work collectively in specific autoimmune disorders and show significant association statistics. In the genetic variation score test, we tested whether allele-specific associations between ASD and autoimmune disorders can be found using nominally significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. In both tests, we found that ASD is probabilistically linked to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Association coefficients showed that ASD and AS were positively associated, meaning that autism susceptibility alleles may have a similar collective effect in AS. The association coefficients were negative between ASD and MS. Significant associations between ASD and two autoimmune disorders were identified. This genetic association supports the idea that specific immunological abnormalities may underlie the etiology of autism, at least in a number of cases.",

Assuming that a charged slepton is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP), we show how the NLSP decays can be used to probe the axino LSP scenario in hadronic axion models as well as the gravitino LSP scenario at the Large Hadron Collider and the International Linear Collider. We show how one can identify experimentally the scenario realized in nature. In the case of the axino LSP, the NLSP decays will allow one to estimate the value of the axino mass and the Peccei-Quinn scale. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Genome signatures of colon carcinoma cell lines",
        "abstract": "In cancer biology, cell lines are often used instead of primary tumors because of their widespread availability and close reflection of the in vivo state. Cancer is a genetic disease, commonly caused by small- and large-scale DNA rearrangements. Therefore, it is essential to know the genomic profiles of tumor cell lines to enable their correct and efficient use as experimental tools. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the genomic profiles of 20 colon cancer cell lines combining conventional karyotyping (G-banding), comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH). Major differences between the microsatellite instability (MSI) and chromosome instability (CIN) cell lines are shown; the CIN cell lines exhibited complex karyotypes involving many chromosomes (mean: 8.5 copy number changes), whereas the MSI cell lines showed considerably fewer aberrations (mean: 2.6). The 3 techniques complement each other to provide a detailed picture of the numerical and structural chromosomal changes that characterize cancer cells. Therefore, 7 of the cell lines (Colo320, EB, Fri, IS2, IS3, SW480, and V9P) are here completely karyotyped for the first time and, among these, 5 have not previously been cytogenetically described. By hierarchical cluster analysis, we show that the cell lines are representative models for primary carcinomas at the genome level. We also present the genomic profiles of an experimental model for tumor progression, including 3 cell lines (IS1, IS2, and IS3) established from a primary carcinoma, its corresponding liver- and peritoneal metastasis from the same patient. To address the question of clonality, we compared the genome of 3 common cell lines grown in 2 laboratories. Finally, we compared all our results with previously published CGH data and karyotypes of colorectal cell lines. In conclusion, the large variation in genetic complexity of the cell lines highlights the importance of a comprehensive reference of genomic profiles for investigators engaged in functional studies using these research tools. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "27 years after the detection of the thermal neutrino single signal from SN1987A, which confirmed the core-collapse scenario and the possible formation of a neutron star, there has not been detected yet its compact remnant. In particular, the hypercritical accretion model proposed by Chevalier (1989) forecasted the accretion of $\\sim 0.15 M_{\\odot}$ in two hours and after the submergence of the magnetic field in the newborn neutron star as has been proposed by Bernal et al.(2013). In this paper, we revisit such model for SN1987A in a numerical framework, focusing on the neutrino cooling effect in the supernova fall-back dynamics. For that, we carry out numerical simulations of the accretion of matter onto the surface of the newborn neutron star in order to estimate the physical parameters such as the emissivity and luminosity of neutrinos in this regime using both an analytical formula and the tabulated values for several neutrino cooling processes. We use a customized version of the FLASH code to perform the numerical simulations in a 2D spherical mesh. In addition, due to matter effects thermal neutrinos may oscillate resonantly from one flavor to another when they go through the outer layers of the expanding supernova. To investigate these oscillations, we consider an energy of neutrino in the range of 1-30 MeV, the mixing parameter and splitting then this phase of the supernova in four regions: core surface, accretion shock envelope, free fall region and surface of the star. For the magnetized plasma of the first region, we derive the neutrino effective potential up to order $1/M_W^4$. For the other regions and based on each density profile we calculate the probabilities of neutrino oscillations at different radii. Finally, in addition of neutrino luminosity, we estimate the number of events expected as well as the neutrino flavor ratio on Earth, as a signature of this phase.",

The regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of MDR MTB strains remain to be fully elucidated, and further investigation is required in order to develop better strategies for TB control. The present study investigated the expression profile of microRNA (miRNA) in MTB strains, and examined the differences between sensitive MTB and MDR MTB using next generation sequencing (NGS) with Illumina Deep Sequencing technology to better understand the mechanisms of resistance in MDR MTB, A total of 5, 785 and 195, and 6, 290 and 595 qualified Illumina reads were obtained from two MDR MTB strains, and 6, 673 and 665, and 7, 210 and 217 qualified Illumina reads were obtained from two sensitive MTB strains. The overall de novo assembly of miRNA sequence data generated 62 and 62, and 95 and 112 miRNAs between the 18 and 30 bp long from sensitive MTB strains and MDR MTB strains, respectively. Comparative miRNA analysis revealed that 142 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the MDR MTB strain, compared with the sensitive MTB strain, of which 48 were upregulated and 94 were downregulated. There were six similarly expressed miRNAs between the MDR and sensitive MTB strains, and 108 miRNAs were expressed only in the MDR MTB strain. The present study acquired miRNA data from sensitive MTB and MDR MTB strains using NGS techniques, and this identification miRNAs may serve as an invaluable resource for revealing the molecular basis of the regulation of expression associated with the mechanism of drugresistance in MTB.",

        "abstract": "To elucidate the role of exon shuffling in shaping the complexity of the human genome/proteome, we have systematically analyzed intron phase distributions in the coding sequence of human protein domains. We found that introns at the boundaries of domains show high excess of symmetrical phase combinations (i.e., 0-0, 1-1, and 2-2), whereas nonboundary introns show no excess symmetry. This suggests that exon shuffling has primarily involved rearrangement of structural and functional domains as a whole. Furthermore, we found that domains flanked by phase 1 introns have dramatically expanded in the human genome due to domain shuffling and that 1-1 symmetrical domains and domain families are nonrandomly distributed with respect to their age. The predominance and extracellular location of 1-1 symmetrical domains among domains specific to metazoans suggests that they are associated with the rise of multicellularity. On the other hand, 0-0 symmetrical domains tend to be over-represented among ancient protein domains that are shared between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic kingdoms, which is compatible with the suggestion of primordial domain shuffling in the progenote. To see whether the human data reflect general genomic patterns of metazoans, similar analyses were done for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Although the C. elegans data generally concur with the human patterns, we identified fewer intron-bounded domains in this organism, consistent with the lower complexity of C. elegans genes.

Recently, we employed an in vitro hemolysis assay to measure the serum complement activity of perfluorocarbon nanoparticles that differed by size, surface charge, and surface chemistry, quantifying the nanoparticle-dependent complement activity using a metric called Residual Hemolytic Activity (RHA). In the present work, we have used a decision tree learning algorithm to derive the rules for estimating nanoparticle-dependent complement response based on the data generated from the hemolytic assay studies. Our results indicate that physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, namely, size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and mole percentage of the active surface ligand of a nanoparticle, can serve as good descriptors for prediction of nanoparticle-dependent complement activation in the decision tree modeling framework.",

In particular, while previous electroencephalography (EEG) research has demonstrated a reduction in the N400 response to words in a supportive context, it is often challenging to dissociate facilitation due to bottom-up spreading activation from facilitation due to top-down expectations. The goal of the current study was to specifically determine the cortical areas associated with facilitation due to top-down prediction, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings supplemented by EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a semantic priming paradigm. In order to modulate expectation processes while holding context constant, we manipulated the proportion of related pairs across 2 blocks (10 and 50% related). Event-related potential results demonstrated a larger N400 reduction when a related word was predicted, and MEG source localization of activity in this time-window (350-450 ms) localized the differential responses to left anterior temporal cortex. fMRI data from the same participants support the MEG localization, showing contextual facilitation in left anterior superior temporal gyrus for the high expectation block only. Together, these results provide strong evidence that facilitatory effects of lexical-semantic prediction on the electrophysiological response 350-450 ms postonset reflect modulation of activity in left anterior temporal cortex.",

The goal is to free practical digital signature schemes from their current reliance on strong collision resistance by bas- ing the security of these schemes on significantly weaker properties of the underlying hash function, thus providing a safety net in case the (current or future) hash functions in use turn out to be less resilient to collision search than initially thought. We design a specific mode of operation that takes into account en- gineering considerations (such as simplicity, efficiency and compatibility with existing implementations) as well as analytical soundness. Specif- ically, the scheme consists of a regular use of the hash function with randomization applied only to the message before it is input to the hash function.We formally show the sufficiency of weaker than collision- resistance assumptions for proving the security of the scheme.",

BLAST similarity searches against the GenBank nucleotide sequence database revealed that these words were archaeal species-specific, indicating that they are of a signature character. Sequence analysis and genome viewing tools showed these repeats to be restricted to non-coding regions. Thus, archaea appear to possess a non-coding genomic signature that is absent in bacterial species.

Violent stochastic collisional events have been invoked as a possible explanation for some debris discs displaying pronounced asymmetries or having a great luminosity excess. So far, no thorough modelling of the consequences of such events has been carried out, mainly because of the extreme numerical challenge of coupling the dynamical and collisional evolution of dust. Aims. We perform the first fully self-consistent modelling of the aftermath of massive breakups in debris discs. We follow the collisional and dynamical evolution of dust released after the breakup of a Ceres-sized body at 6 AU from its central star. We investigate the duration, magnitude and spatial structure of the signature left by such a violent event, as well as its observational detectability. Methods. We use the recently developed LIDT-DD code (Kral et al., 2013), which handles the coupled collisional and dynamical evolution of debris discs. The main focus is placed on the complex interplay between destructive collisions, Keplerian dynamics and radiation pressure forces. We use the GRaTer package to estimate the system's luminosity at different wavelengths. Results. The breakup of a Ceres-sized body at 6 AU creates an asymmetric dust disc that is homogenized, by the coupled action of collisions and dynamics, on a timescale of a few $10^5$ years. The luminosity excess in the breakup's aftermath should be detectable by mid-IR photometry, from a 30 pc distance, over a period of $\\sim 10^6$ years that exceeds the duration of the asymmetric phase of the disc (a few $10^5$ years). As for the asymmetric structures, we derive synthetic images for the SPHERE/VLT and MIRI/JWST instruments, showing that they should be clearly visible and resolved from a 10 pc distance. Images at 1.6$\\mu$m (marginally), 11.4 and 15.5$\\mu$m would show the inner disc structures while 23$\\mu$m images would display the outer disc asymmetries.",

We analyze amino acids in specific bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cell sub-populations (i.e. GABAergic vs. glycinergic amacrine cells) and anatomically distinct regions of photoreceptors and Muller cells (i.e. cell bodies vs. endfeet) by extracting data from previously described pattern recognition analysis. Pattern recognition statistically classifies all cells in the retina based on their neurochemical profile and surpasses the previous limitations of anatomical and morphological identification of cells in the immature retina. We found that the GABA and glycine cellular content reached adult-like levels in most neurons before glutamate. The metabolic amino acids glutamine, aspartate and alanine also reached maturity in most retinal cells before eye opening. When the overall amino acid profiles were considered for each cell group, ganglion cells and GABAergic amacrine cells matured first, followed by glycinergic amacrine cells and finally bipolar cells. Photoreceptor cell bodies reached adult-like amino acid profiles at P7 whilst Muller cells acquired typical amino acid profiles in their cell bodies at P7 and in their endfeet by P14. We further compared the amino acid profiles of the C57B1/6J mouse with the transgenic X-inactivation mouse carrying the lacZ gene on the X chromosome and validated this animal model for the study of normal retinal development. This study provides valuable insight into normal retinal neurochemical maturation and metabolism and benchmark amino acid values for comparison with retinal disease, particularly those which occur during development.

        "abstract": "It is widely believed that intense-field ionization occurs either though a 'multiphoton' mechanism\\n(for Keldysh parameter \u03b3 > 1) or through a tunnelling mechanism (or 'field ionization'), for \u03b3 < 1.\\nRecently, high-resolution measurements of the parallel-momentum distributions of electrons emitted\\nfrom He and other atoms in intense laser fields have been reported in this journal and elsewhere.\\nThey revealed a remarkable central minimum with two 'horn-like' ends and a double sequence of sharp\\npeaks in the tunnel regime (\u03b3 < 0.5). They are thus found to contradict the smooth distributions\\nobserved under lower resolution in the past, which had been widely interpreted to arise from the\\nfield-ionization (or tunnelling) mechanism. In this letter, we present a discrete photon analysis of\\nthe parallel-momentum distributions for the case of He atom. Our analysis is based on the well-known\\nKFR (Keldysh\u2013Faisal\u2013Reiss) theory of intense-field processes that explicitly take account of\\ndiscrete absorptions of photons; it is also modified to take account of the asymptotic Coulomb\\npotential. Results are obtained for both constant-amplitude fields and short Gaussian pulses.\\nComparison of the results shows that the prominent features in the calculated parallel-momentum\\ndistributions arise from a discrete photon absorption mechanism in the 'tunnel regime' and agree\\nqualitatively well with observed distributions.",

        "title": "Signatures of reionization on Lyman alpha emitters",
        "abstract": "We use a semi-analytic model of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) to constrain the reionization history. By considering two physically motivated scenarios in which reionization ends either early (ERM, z_i ~ 7) or late (LRM, z_i ~ 6), we fix the global value of the IGM neutral fraction (e.g. chi_{HI}=3 times 10^{-4}, 0.15 at z=6.56 for the ERM and LRM, respectively) leaving only the star formation efficiency and the effective escape fraction of Lya photons as free parameters. The ERM fits the observed LAE luminosity function (LF) at z=5.7 and 6.56 requiring no redshift evolution or mass dependence of the star formation efficiency, and LAE star formation rates (SFR) of 3-103 solar masses/year, contributing approximately 8% of the cosmic SFR density at z=5.7. The LRM requires a physically uncomfortable drop of approximately 4.5 times in the SFR of the emitters from z=6.5 to 5.7. Thus, the data seem to imply that the Universe was already highly ionized at z=6.56. The mass-dependent Lya transmissivity is between 0.36-0.51 (ERM) and less than 0.26 (LRM) at z=6.56. The LF data at z=4.5 imply an extra Lya line damping factor of approximately 0.25 possibly due to dust; the presence of a (clumpy) dust component with E(B-V) ~ 0.28 is also required to reproduce the observed large Lya equivalent widths at the same redshift. Additional useful information can be extracted from the line profile (weighted) skewness, found to be S_W=10-17 Angstrom for the two reionization models, which shows an interesting L_alpha-chi_{HI} anti-correlation, holding under the model assumptions. The shortcomings of the model and strategies to overcome them are discussed.",

The indicators are particularly important in the case of acetaminophen (APAP) intoxication, the leading cause of liver failure in the U.S. We hypothesized that gene expression patterns derived from blood cells would provide useful indicators of acute exposure levels. To test this hypothesis, we used a blood gene expression data set from rats exposed to APAP to train classifiers in two prediction algorithms and to extract patterns for prediction using a profiling algorithm. Prediction accuracy was tested on a blinded, independent rat blood test data set and ranged from 88.9% to 95.8%. Genomic markers outperformed predictions based on traditional clinical parameters. The expression profiles of the predictor genes from the patterns extracted from the blood exhibited remarkable (97% accuracy) transtissue APAP exposure prediction when liver gene expression data were used as a test set. Analysis of human samples revealed separation of APAP-intoxicated patients from control individuals based on blood expression levels of human orthologs of the rat discriminatory genes. The major biological signal in the discriminating genes was activation of an inflammatory response after exposure to toxic doses of APAP. These results support the hypothesis that gene expression data from peripheral blood cells can provide valuable information about exposure levels, well before liver damage is detected by classical parameters. It also supports the potential use of genomic markers in the blood as surrogates for clinical markers of potential acute liver damage.",

Here, we show that the epigenetic profile of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ES) is distinct from that of embryonic carcinoma cells, haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and their differentiated progeny. Silent, lineage-specific genes replicated earlier in pluripotent cells than in tissue-specific stem cells or differentiated cells and had unexpectedly high levels of acetylated H3K9 and methylated H3K4. Unusually, in ES cells these markers of open chromatin were also combined with H3K27 trimethylation at some non-expressed genes. Thus, pluripotency of ES cells is characterized by a specific epigenetic profile where lineage-specific genes may be accessible but, if so, carry repressive H3K27 trimethylation modifications. H3K27 methylation is functionally important for preventing expression of these genes in ES cells as premature expression occurs in embryonic ectoderm development (Eed)-deficient ES cells. Our data suggest that lineage-specific genes are primed for expression in ES cells but are held in check by opposing chromatin modifications.",

We propose a new, more general analysis of constraints on dark matter. The constraints can be obtained for any decaying dark matter model by convolving the specific dark matter decay spectrum with a response function. We derive this response function from full-sky radio surveys at 408 MHz, 1.42 GHz and 23 GHz, as well as from the positron flux recently reported by PAMELA. We discuss the influence of astrophysical uncertainties on the response function, such as from propagation and from the profiles of the dark matter and the Galactic magnetic field. As an application, we find that some widely used dark matter decay scenarios can be ruled out under modest assumptions.",

We measure a highly nonclassical critical exponent \u03b7 = 1.493 and construct a universal scaling function of winding number distributions that directly demonstrates the distinct topological sectors of an emergent Z(2) gauge field. The universal quantities used to establish this exotic transition can be used to detect other fractionalized quantum critical points in future model and material systems.",

The two galaxies' apparent proximity suggests that Andromeda's prominent star-forming ring as well as M32's compact elliptical (cE) structure may result from a recent collision. Here we present the first self-consistent model of the M31-M32 interaction that simultaneously reproduces observed positions, velocities, and morphologies for both galaxies. Andromeda's spiral structure is resolved in unprecedented detail, showing that a rare head-on orbit is not necessary to match Andromeda's ring-like morphology. The passage of M32 through Andromeda's disk perturbs the disk velocity structure. We find tidal stripping of M32's stars to be inefficient during the interaction, suggesting that some cEs are intrinsically compact. Additionally, the orbital solution implies that M32 is currently closer to the Milky Way than models have typically assumed, a prediction that may be testable with upcoming observations.",

        "abstract": "DNA replication initiates from thousands of start sites throughout the Drosophila genome and must be coordinated with other ongoing nuclear processes such as transcription to ensure genetic and epigenetic inheritance. Considerable progress has been made toward understanding how chromatin modifications regulate the transcription program; in contrast, we know relatively little about the role of the chromatin landscape in defining how start sites of DNA replication are selected and regulated. Here, we describe the Drosophila replication program in the context of the chromatin and transcription landscape for multiple cell lines using data generated by the modENCODE consortium. We find that while the cell lines exhibit similar replication programs, there are numerous cell line-specific differences that correlate with changes in the chromatin architecture. We identify chromatin features that are associated with replication timing, early origin usage, and ORC binding. Primary sequence, activating chromatin marks, and DNA-binding proteins (including chromatin remodelers) contribute in an additive manner to specify ORC-binding sites. We also generate accurate and predictive models from the chromatin data to describe origin usage and strength between cell lines. Multiple activating chromatin modifications contribute to the function and relative strength of replication origins, suggesting that the chromatin environment does not regulate origins of replication as a simple binary switch, but rather acts as a tunable rheostat to regulate replication initiation events.",

It is often suggested that the ionizing UV flux originates from an early population of massive or very massive stars. Depending on their mass, such stars can explode either as type II supernovae or pair-instability supernovae, or may entirely collapse into a black hole. The resulting neutrino emission can be quite different in each case. We consider here the relic neutrino background produced by an early burst of Population III stars coupled with a normal mode of star formation at lower redshift. The computation is performed in the framework of hierarchical structure formation and is based on cosmic star formation histories constrained to reproduce the observed star formation rate at redshift z \\la 6, the observed chemical abundances in damped Lyman alpha absorbers and in the intergalactic medium, and to allow for an early reionization of the Universe at z \\sim 10-20. We find that although the high redshift burst of Population III stars does lead to an appreciable flux of neutrinos at relatively low energy (E_\\nu \\approx 1 MeV), the observable neutrino flux is dominated by the normal mode of star formation. We also find that predicted fluxes are at the present level of the SuperK limit. As a consequence, the supernova relic neutrino background has a direct impact on models of chemical evolution and/or supernova dynamics.",

Strongly basic zeolites are attractive candidates, but such materials are notoriously difficult to make due to the strong inherent acidity of aluminosilicates. Several research groups have endeavored to produce strongly basic zeolites by treating zeolites with amines, but to date there is no compelling evidence that nitrogen is incorporated into zeolite frameworks. In this communication, we detail synthesis, NMR spectroscopy, and quantum mechanical calculations showing that nitrogen adds onto both surface and interior sites while preserving the framework structure of zeolites. This finding is crucial for the rational design of new biomass-refinement catalysts, allowing 50 years of zeolite science to be brought to bear on the catalytic synthesis of biofuels.",

The charged condensate and its fluctuations are described by an effective field theory Lagrangian. The spectrum of bosonic fluctuations is gapped, while electrons, at temperatures of interest, give rise to gapless excitations near the Fermi surface. These properties determine the evolution of the dwarfs with condensed cores. In particular, we show that such dwarf stars would cool significantly faster than their crystallized counterparts. As a result, the luminosity function for the helium-core dwarfs will have a sharp drop-off after the condensation. It is tempting to interpret the recently discovered abrupt termination of a sequence of 24 helium-core dwarf candidates in NGC 6397 as a signature of the charged condensation.",

In addition, the detection of strong line polarization in supernovae is suggestive of chemical inhomogeneities (\"clumps\") in the layers above the photosphere, which may reflect hydrodynamical instabilities during the explosion. We have developed a fast, flexible, approximate semi-analytic code for modeling polarized line radiative transfer within 3-D inhomogeneous rapidly-expanding atmospheres. Given a range of model parameters, the code randomly generates sets of clumps in the expanding ejecta and calculates the emergent line profile and Stokes parameters for each configuration. The ensemble of these configurations represents both the effects of various host geometries and of different viewing angles. We present results for the first part of our survey of model geometries, specifically the effects of the number and size of clumps (and the related effect of filling factor) on the emergent spectrum and Stokes parameters. We have also developed a method to connect the results of our simulations to robust observational parameters such as maximum degree of polarization and polarized flux throughout the line. Our models, in connection with spectropolarimetric observations, can constrain the 3- D structure of supernova ejecta and offer important insight into the SN explosion physics and the nature of their progenitor system.",

        "abstract": "We propose an alternative formalism to simulate CMB temperature maps in $\\Lambda$CDM universes with nontrivial spatial topologies. This formalism avoids the need to explicitly compute the eigenmodes of the Laplacian operator in the spatial sections. Instead, the covariance matrix of the coefficients of the spherical harmonic decomposition of the temperature anisotropies is expressed in terms of the elements of the covering group of the space. We obtain a decomposition of the correlation matrix that isolates the topological contribution to the CMB temperature anisotropies out of the simply connected contribution. A further decomposition of the topological signature of the correlation matrix for an arbitrary topology allows us to compute it in terms of correlation matrices corresponding to simpler topologies, for which closed quadrature formulae might be derived. We also use this decomposition to show that CMB temperature maps of (not too large) multiply connected universes must show ``patterns of alignment'', and propose a method to look for these patterns, thus opening the door to the development of new methods for detecting the topology of our Universe even when the injectivity radius of space is slightly larger than the radius of the last scattering surface. We illustrate all these features with the simplest examples, those of flat homogeneous manifolds, i.e., tori, with special attention given to the cylinder, i.e., $T^1$ topology.",

Results were further validated using RNAseq data from whole blood in TwinsUK and the most significant proteins were tested for association with aging-related phenotypes after adjustment for age. Eleven proteins were associated with chronological age and were replicated at protein level in an independent population.

The two most strongly associated proteins were chordin-like protein 1 (meta-analysis \u03b2 [SE] = 0.013 [0.001], p = 3.66 \u00d7 10(-46)) and pleiotrophin (0.012 [0.005], p = 3.88 \u00d7 10(-41)).

The event-related potential experiment reported here was designed to explore how early in time memory for a previously established face-scene relationship begins to influence processing of faces, under sequential presentation conditions in which a preview of the scene can promote expectancies about the to-be-presented face. Prior to the current work, the earliest component documented to be sensitive to memory for the relations among arbitrarily paired items was the late positive complex (LPC), but here relational memory effects were evident as early as 270-350 msec after face onset. The latency of these relational memory effects suggests that they may be the precursor to similar effects observed in eye movement behavior. As expected, LPC amplitude was also affected by memory for face-scene relationships, and N400 amplitude reflected some combination of memory for items and memory for the relations among items.",

Unfortunately, the safety factor easily becomes excessive. The design engineers minimize their professional risk, and by doing so they are actually asking the building owner to pay an immediate penalty due to increased first cost of equipment and an ongoing penalty due to maintenance and energy use implications. The penalties associated with excessive safety factors are often not communicated to the client. This paper presents the results of a study of \"rightsizing\" rooftop HVAC systems. The study included intensive interviews with HVAC designers investigating the design process and extensive field measurement of rooftop units (RTUs) during peak cooling conditions. This paper focuses on defining the signature of oversizing, i.e. how to use the physical measurements to quantify the degree of oversizing of an RTU and how to estimate the penalty of oversizing in terms of energy consumption and peak electricity demand. Utility companies incentive programs have not yet identified mechanisms for incentivizing rightsizing of HVAC system. The methodology described in this paper can be used as the basis for such programs. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Our measurements demonstrate that these small crystals are persistently present in the water column beneath the winter fast ice, and when incorporated in sea ice they reduce the mean grain size of the sea-ice cover. By midwinter, larger ice crystals below the ice/water interface are observed to form a porous sub-ice platelet layer with an ice volume fraction of 0.25 \u00b1 0.06. The magnitude and direction of the oceanic heat flux varied between (5 \u00b1 6) W m\u22122 (upwards) and (\u221215 \u00b1 10) W m\u22122 (downwards) in May, but by September it settled between (\u22126 \u00b1 2) and (\u221211 \u00b1 2) W m\u22122. The negative values imply that the ocean acts as a heat sink which is responsible for the growth of 12% of the ice thickness between June and September.

Their interpretation is challenging as even after removing the contribution from detected sources, the residual signal is &gt;10 times higher than expected from distant galaxies below the detection limit and first stars. We propose here a novel interpretation in which early, intermediate-mass, accreting direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), which are too faint to be detected individually in current surveys, could explain the observed fluctuations. We find that a population of highly obscured (NH \u2273 1025 cm-2) DCBHs formed in metal-free haloes with virial temperature 104 K at z \u2273 12 can explain the observed level \u224810-3 (nW m-2 sr-1)2 of the 3.6 and 4.5 \u03bcm fluctuations on scales &gt;100 arcsec. The signal on smaller scales is instead produced by undetected galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts. Albeit Compton-thick, at scales \u03b8 &gt; 100 arcsec DCBHs produce a cosmic X-ray background (0.5-2 keV)-NIRB (4.5 \u03bcm) cross-correlation signal of \u224310-11 erg s-1 cm-2 nW m-2 sr-1 slightly dependent on the specific value of the absorbing gas column (NH \u2248 1025 cm-2) adopted and in agreement with the recent measurements by Cappelluti et al. At smaller scales the cross-correlation is dominated by the emission of high-mass X-ray binaries hosted by the same low-z, undetected galaxies accounting for small-scale NIRB fluctuations. These results outline the great potential of the NIRB as a tool to investigate the nature of the first galaxies and black holes.",

Here we present the potential of hydroacoustic methods to investigate different modes of ice detachments. High-frequency underwater ambient noise recordings are combined with synchronized, high-resolution, time-lapse photography of the Hans Glacier cliff in Hornsund Fjord, Spitsbergen, to identify three types of calving events: typical subaerial, sliding subaerial, and submarine. A quantitative analysis of the data reveals a robust correlation between ice impact energy and acoustic emission at frequencies below 200 Hz for subaerial calving. We suggest that relatively inexpensive acoustic methods can be successfully used to provide quantitative descriptions of the various calving types.",

        "abstract": "If the primordial fluctuations are non-Gaussian, then this non-Gaussianity will be apparent in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) sky. With their sensitive all-sky observation, MAP and Planck satellites should be able to detect weak non-Gaussianity in the CMB sky. On large angular scale, there is a simple relationship between the CMB temperature and the primordial curvature perturbation. On smaller scales; however, the radiation transfer function becomes more complex. In this paper, we present the angular bispectrum of the primary CMB anisotropy that uses the full transfer function. We find that the bispectrum has a series of acoustic peaks that change a sign, and a period of acoustic oscillations is twice as long as that of the angular power spectrum. Using a single non-linear coupling parameter to characterize the amplitude of the bispectrum, we estimate the expected signal-to-noise ratio for COBE, MAP, and Planck experiments. We find that the detection of the primary bispectrum by any kind of experiments should be problematic for the simple slow-roll inflationary scenarios. We compare the sensitivity of the primary bispectrum to the primary skewness and conclude that when we can compute the predicted form of the bispectrum, it becomes a ``matched filter'' for detecting the non-Gaussianity in the data, and much more powerful tool than the skewness. We also show that MAP and Planck can separate the primary bispectrum from various secondary bispectra on the basis of the shape difference. The primary CMB bispectrum is a test of the inflationary scenario, and also a probe of the non-linear physics in the very early universe.",

        "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clonal malignancy of mature B cells that displays a great clinical heterogeneity, with many patients having an indolent disease that will not require intervention for many years, while others present an aggressive and symptomatic leukemia requiring immediate treatment. Although there is no cure for CLL, the disease is treatable and current standard chemotherapy regimens have been shown to prolong survival. Recent advances in our understanding of the biology of CLL have led to the identification of numerous cellular and molecular markers with potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic significance. We have used the recently developed digital multiplexed gene-expression technique (DMGE) to analyze a cohort of 30 CLL patients for the presence of specific genes with known diagnostic and prognostic potential. Starting from a set of 290 genes we were able to develop a molecular signature, based on the analysis of 13 genes, which allows distinguishing CLL from normal peripheral blood and from normal B cells, and a second signature based on 24 genes, which distinguishes mutated from unmutated cases (LymphCLL Mut). A third classifier (LymphCLL Diag), based on a 44-gene signature, distinguished CLL cases from a series of other B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (n = 51). While the methodology presented here has the potential to provide a \"ready to use\" classification tool in routine diagnostics and clinical trials, application to larger sample numbers are still needed and should provide further insights about its robustness and utility in clinical practice.",

Metrics for describing liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data have been developed; however, the wide variety of LC-MS instruments and configurations precludes applying a simple cutoff. Using 1150 manually classified quality control (QC) data sets, we trained logistic regression classification models to predict whether a data set is in or out of control. Model parameters were optimized by minimizing a loss function that accounts for the trade-off between false positive and false negative errors. The classifier models detected bad data sets with high sensitivity while maintaining high specificity. Moreover, the composite classifier was dramatically more specific than single metrics. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the classifier on a separate validation set where it performed comparably to the results for the testing/training data sets. By presenting the methods and software used to create the classifier, other groups can create a classifier for their specific QC regimen, which is highly variable lab-to-lab.

Although they have been widely recognized in the context of high temperature cuprates, bilayer ruthenates, and iron-based superconductors, the focus so far has been exclusively on the uniform nematic phase. Recently, however, it was proposed that on a square lattice a nematic instability in the d-wave charge channel could lead to a spatially modulated nematic state, where the modulation vector q is determined by the relative location of the Fermi level to the van Hove singularity. Interestingly, this finite-q nematic (nematic stripe) phase has also been identified as an additional leading instability that is as strong as the superconducting instability near the onset of spin density wave order. Here, we study the electrical conductivity tensor in the modulated nematic phase for a general modulation vector. Our results can be used to identify nematic stripe phases in correlated materials.",

These peaks arise from the interference of coherently scattered photons. Once the conformation of a protein is changed, these two peaks reflect such change with considerable sensitivity. The present work examines the possibility of characterizing the most common cause of hemolytic anaemia in Egypt and many Mediterranean countries; ??-thalassemia, from its X-ray scattering profile. This disease emerges from a genetic defect causing reduced rate in the synthesis of one of the globin chains that make up hemoglobin. As a result, structurally abnormal hemoglobin molecules are formed. In order to detect such molecular disorder, hemoglobin samples of ??-thalassemia patients are collected, lyophilized and measured using a conventional X-ray diffractometer. Results show significant differences in the X-ray scattering profiles of most of the diseased samples compared to control. The shape of the first scattering peak at 0.27 nm-1, in addition to the relative intensity of the first to the second scattering peaks, provides the most reliable signs of abnormality in diseased samples. The results are interpreted and confirmed with the aid of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of normal and thalassemia samples. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Increased affordability and deployment of advanced tracking technologies have led researchers from various domains to analyze the resulting spatio-temporal movement data sets for the purpose of knowledge discovery. Two different approaches can be considered in the analysis of moving objects: quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis. This research focuses on the latter and uses the qualitative trajectory calculus (QTC), a type of calculus that represents qualitative data on moving point objects (MPOs), and establishes a framework to analyze the relative movement of multiple MPOs. A visualization technique called sequence signature (SESI) is used, which enables to map QTC patterns in a 2D indexed rasterized space in order to evaluate the similarity of relative movement patterns of multiple MPOs. The applicability of the proposed methodology is illustrated by means of two practical examples of interacting MPOs: cars on a highway and body parts of a samba dancer. The results show that the proposed method can be effectively used to analyze interactions of multiple MPOs in different domains.",

        "abstract": "Photon-number resolving detectors are a fundamental building-block of optical quantum information processing protocols. A loop detector, combined with appropriate statistical processing, can be used to convert a binary on/off photon counter into a photon-number-resolving detector. Here we describe the idea of a signature of photon-counts, which may be used to more robustly reconstruct the photon number distribution of a quantum state. The methodology is applied experimentally in a 9-port loop detector operating at a telecommunications wavelength and compared directly to the approach whereby only the number of photon-counts is used to reconstruct the input distribution. The signature approach is shown to be more robust against calibration errors, exhibit reduced statistical uncertainty, and reduced reliance on a-priori assumptions about the input state.",

        "abstract": "Non-invasive brain-computer-interfaces (BCI) coupled with prosthetic devices were recently introduced in the rehabilitation of chronic stroke and other disorders of the motor system. These BCI systems and motor rehabilitation in general involve several motor tasks for training. This study investigates the neurophysiological bases of an EEG-oscillations-driven BCI combined with a neuroprosthetic device in order to define the specific oscillatory signature of the BCI-task. We recorded EEG while 9 healthy participants performed five different motor tasks consisting of closing and opening of the hand: 1) motor imagery without any external feedback and without overt hand movement, 2) motor imagery which moves the orthosis proportional to the produced brain oscillation change with online proprioceptive and visual feedback of the hand moving through a neuroprosthetic device (BCI-condition), 3) passive and 4) active movement of the hand with feedback (seeing and feeling the hand moving) and 5) rest. We analyzed brain activity during the 5 conditions using time-frequency domain bootstrap based statistical comparisons and Morlet transforms. Activity during rest condition was used as reference. Significant contralateral and ipsilateral event related desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythm was present during all motor tasks, largest in contralateral-post-central, medio-central and ipsilateral-pre-central areas identifying the ipsilateral pre-central cortex as an integral part of motor regulation. Changes in task specific frequency power when compared to rest were similar between motor tasks and only significant differences in the time course and some narrow specific frequency bands were observed between motor tasks. We identified EEG features representing proprioception, active intention and passive involvement differentiating brain oscillations during motor tasks that could substantially support the design of novel motor BCI-based rehabilitation therapies. The BCI task induced significantly different brain activity compared to the other motor tasks indicating neural processes unique to the use of body actuators control in a BCI-context.",

        "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a frequent lesion associated with obesity, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. The hallmark feature of fatty liver disease is steatosis, which is the intra-cellular accumulation of lipids resulting in the formation of vesicles in hepatocytes. Steatosis is a precursor of steatohepatitis, a condition that may progress to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and primary liver cancer. We addressed the potential of Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy for grading steatosis on frozen tissue sections. The use of the bright infrared source emitted by synchrotron radiation (SR) allowed the investigation of the biochemical composition at the cellular level. The variance in the huge number of spectra acquired was addressed by principal component analysis (PCA). The study demonstrated that the progression of steatosis corresponds not only to the accumulation of lipids but also to dramatic changes in the qualitative composition of the tissue. Indeed, a lower grade of steatosis showed a decrease in glycogen content and a concomitant increase in lipids in comparison with normal liver. Intermediate steatosis exhibited an increase in glycogen and major changes in lipids, with a significant contribution of esterified fatty acids with elongated carbon chains and unsaturated lipids, and these features were more pronounced in a high grade of steatosis. Furthermore, the approach allows a systematic discrimination of morphological features, leading to a separate investigation of steatotic vesicles and the non-steatotic counterpart of the tissue. This highlighted the fact that dramatic biochemical changes occur in the non-steatotic part of the tissue also despite its normal histological aspect, suggesting that the whole tissue reflects the grade of steatosis.",

The variations in mobility associated with the diffusional anomaly are mirrored in the scaling exponent alpha associated with this multiple time-scale behavior, suggesting that monitoring of 1f(alpha) behavior is a simple and direct method for linking phenomena on three distinctive length and time scales: the local molecular environment, hydrogen-bond network reorganizations, and the diffusivity. Our results indicate that experimental studies of supercooled water to probe the density dependence of 1f(alpha) spectral features, or equivalent stretched exponential behavior in time-correlation functions, will be of interest.",

        "abstract": "Using five years (1994-1998) of simultaneous and collocated measurements of horizontal winds associated with mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region and geomagnetic field measurements in the Indian geomagnetic dip equatorial region, an extensive experimental study has been made on the influences of mesospheric planetary waves on the equatorial electrojet (EEJ). The winds are measured using medium-frequency (MF) radar (1.98 MHz) located at Tirunelveli. The EEJ strength is determined by measuring the geomagnetic field strength at both the geomagnetic dip and off-dip equatorial stations, Trivandrum and Alibag, India. By noting the simultaneous time evolution of spectral signal (Morlet wavelet analysis) in both the EEJ strength and mesospheric winds at 88 km, it is found that mesospheric planetary waves with periodicities of 2-25 days often do propagate up to the ionospheric dynamo region and have their influences on EEJ strength. Sometimes only one of the parameters shows strong spectral signal in this periodicity range. It is also observed that often the diurnal oscillation in EEJ strength and mesospheric winds exhibits coherent variations in amplitude when the signature of mesospheric planetary-scale oscillations is found in the EEJ strength. Also, it is found that variations in high-energy solar radiations (F10.7 is used as a proxy) can influence the EEJ strength at planetary timescales. This leads to an interesting question. What actually causes the vertical coupling between ionosphere and atmosphere through upward propagating planetary waves to be operative only during some (and not all) of the episodes?",

In particular the authors demonstrate how knowledge of different motion classes can be obtained via a Markov chain model of state transitions based on the TF envelope structure associated with the motion sequence being analysed. The class-conditional knowledge thus obtained allows us to effectively extract the motion curves associated with different body parts via a non-parametric partial tracking algorithm that is coupled with an optimum Gaussian g-Snake modelling of the TF structure. The optimum segmentation of the TF structure into different half-cycles as well as the determination of the initial Doppler control points (corresponding to each half-cycle) is facilitated by a dynamic programming algorithm wherein the associated cost function involves a mean-square minimisation of the best quadratic fit to each segment together with a sparsity prior that enables us to control the smoothness of the approximation space in which the time series being analysed is effectively projected. Finally, the authors describe some of the limitations of our approach and point out future research directions that can overcome some of the difficulties associated with the complex interaction between the inherently non-linear dynamics of human gait motion and radar systems.",

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Functional characterization of genes is of great importance for the understanding of complex cellular processes. Valuable information for this purpose can be obtained from pathway databases, like KEGG. However, only a small fraction of genes is annotated with pathway information up to now. In contrast, information on contained protein domains can be obtained for a significantly higher number of genes, e.g. from the InterPro database. RESULTS: We present a classification model, which for a specific gene of interest can predict the mapping to a KEGG pathway, based on its domain signature. The classifier makes explicit use of the hierarchical organization of pathways in the KEGG database. Furthermore, we take into account that a specific gene can be mapped to different pathways at the same time. The classification method produces a scoring of all possible mapping positions of the gene in the KEGG hierarchy. Evaluations of our model, which is a combination of a SVM and ranking perceptron approach, show a high prediction performance. Moreover, for signaling pathways we reveal that it is even possible to forecast accurately the membership to individual pathway components.

        "abstract": "With their long mean free paths and efficient heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM), X-rays could have a dramatic impact on the thermal and ionization history of the Universe. Here we run several semi-numerical simulations of the dark ages and the epoch of reionization (EoR), including both X-rays and ultraviolet radiation fields, attempting to provide an intuitive framework for interpreting upcoming observations. We explore the impact of X-rays on various signals. (i) Reionization history: including X-rays results in an earlier, slightly more extended EoR. However, efficient thermal feedback from X-ray heating could yield an extended epoch in which the Universe was \u224810 per cent ionized. (ii) Reionization morphology: a sizeable (\u02dc10 per cent) contribution of X-rays to reionization results in a more uniform morphology, though the impact is modest when compared at the same global neutral fraction, bar{x}_{H I}. Specifically, X-rays produce a dearth of fully neutral regions and a suppression of small-scale (k \u2273 0.1 Mpc-1) ionization power by a factor of \u22722. However, these changes in morphology cannot be countered by increasing the bias of the ionizing sources, making them a robust indicator of an X-ray contribution to the EoR. (iii) The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect: at a fixed reionization history, X-rays decrease the kSZ power at l = 3000 by \u2248 0.5 \u03bcK2. Our extreme model in which X-rays entirely drive reionization is the only one which is marginally consistent with the recent upper limits on this signal from the South Pole Telescope, assuming no thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ)-dusty galaxy cross-correlation. Since this extreme model is unlikely, we conclude that there should be a sizeable tSZ-dusty galaxy cross-correlation. (iv) The redshifted 21 cm signal: the impact of X-rays on the 21 cm power spectrum during the advanced stages of reionization (bar{x}_{H I}\u2272 0.7) is modest, except in extreme, X-ray-dominated models. The largest impact of X-rays is to govern the timing and duration of IGM heating. In fact, unless thermal feedback is efficient, the epoch of X-ray heating likely overlaps with the beginning of reionization. This results in a 21 cm power spectrum which is \u02dc10-100 times higher at bar{x}_{H I}\u2273 0.9 than obtained from naive estimates ignoring this overlap. On the other hand, if thermal feedback is efficient, the resulting extended epoch between X-ray heating and reionization could provide a clean probe of the matter power spectrum in emission, at redshifts more accessible than the dark ages.",

        "abstract": "Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium transporters, generates Ca(2+)-store depletion within the ER and simultaneously increases Ca(2+) level in the cytosol. Perturbation of Ca(2+) homeostasis leads cells to cope with stressful conditions, including ER stress, which affect the folding of newly synthesized proteins and induce the accumulation of unfolded polypeptides and eventually apoptosis, via activation of the unfolded protein response pathway. In the present work, we analyzed the proteome changes in human hepatoma cells following acute treatment with thapsigargin. We highlighted a peculiar pattern of protein expression, marked by altered expression of calcium-dependent proteins, and of proteins involved in secretory pathways or in cell survival. For specific deregulated proteins, the thapsigargin-induced proteomic signature was compared by Western blotting to that resulting from the treatment of hepatoma cells with reducing agents or with proteasome inhibitors, to elicit endoplasmic reticulum stress by additional means and to reveal novel, potential targets of the unfolded protein response pathway.",

In order to build an interpretation with a significant depth extent we draw upon a range of geophysical data, principally seismic tomographic inversions, receiver functions, gravity and magnetics. We present these results as a series of layers providing a series of depth slices though the cratonic lithosphere. The different geophysical methods suggest partitioning of the WAC into two tectonic elements at the largest scale which is observed in both seismic tomographic images, lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) models and long wavelength gravity signals. The different models of the Moho, or crust-mantle boundary, based on these gravity or seismic datasets show little or no correlation, either for short or long-wavelength features, and show little correlation with new receiver function inferred crustal thickness estimates. Manual interpretation of low-wavelength gravity and magnetic data suggest a possible continuation of the WAC across the western margin of the modern boundary, and also highlight distinct domains interpreted to be of Birimian age.",
