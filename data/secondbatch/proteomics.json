        "abstract": "The enormous dynamic range of human bodily fluid proteomes poses a significant challenge for current MS-based proteomic technologies as it makes it especially difficult to detect low abundant proteins in human biofluids such as blood plasma, an essential aspect for successful biomarker discovery efforts. Here, we present a novel tandem IgY12-SuperMix immunoaffinity separation system for enhanced detection of low abundant proteins in human plasma. The tandem IgY12-SuperMix system separates ~60 abundant proteins from the low abundant proteins in plasma, which allows for significant enrichment of low abundant plasma proteins in the SuperMix flow-through fraction. High reproducibility of the tandem separations was observed in terms of both sample processing recovery and LC-MS/MS identification results based on spectral count data. The ability to quantitatively measure differential protein abundances following application of the tandem separations was demonstrated by spiking six non-human standard proteins at three different levels into plasma. A side-by-side comparison between the SuperMix flow-through and IgY12 flow-through samples analyzed by both 1D and 2D LC-MS/MS revealed a 60-80% increase in proteome coverage as a result of the SuperMix separations, which suggests significantly enhanced detection of low abundant proteins. A total of 695 plasma proteins were confidently identified in a single analysis (with a minimum of two peptides per protein) by coupling the tandem separation strategy with 2D-LC-MS/MS, including 42 proteins with reported normal concentrations of ~100 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL. The concentrations of two selected proteins, M-CSF and MMP8, were independently validated by ELISA as 202 pg/mL and 12.4 ng/mL, respectively. Evaluation of binding efficiency revealed 45 medium-abundant proteins were efficiently captured by the SuperMix column with >90% retention. Taken together, these results illustrate the potential broad utilities of this tandem IgY12-SuperMix strategy for proteomic applications involving human biofluids, where effectively addressing the dynamic range challenge of the specimen is imperative. 10.1074/mcp.M800008-MCP200",

        "abstract": "Subcellular proteomics was used to compare the protein profiles between human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. In total, 106 differential proteins were identified and the altered expression levels of partial identified proteins were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Importantly, pathway analysis and biological validation revealed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype shift in A549 cells as compared with HBE cells. The EMT phenotype of A549 cells can be increased by self-producing TGF-\u03b21 and significantly decreased by silencing heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNPK) expression. As EMT has been considered as an important event during malignant tumor progression and metastasis, investigating EMT and deciphering the related pathways may lead to more efficient strategies to fight lung cancer progression. By integrating the subcellular proteomic data with EMT-related functional studies, we revealed new insights into the EMT progress of lung carcinogenesis, providing clues for further investigations on the discovery of potential therapeutic targets.",

Some free Internet-based proteomics tools have gained wide usage, but there have not been any single bioinformatic framework that in an easy and intuitive way guided the user through the whole process from analyses to submission. Together, these factors may have limited the expansion of proteomics analyses, and also the secondary use (re-analyses) of proteomic data. Vaudel et al. (Proteomics 2014, this issue) are now describing their Compomics framework that guides the user through all the main steps, from the database generation, via the analyses and validation, and through the submission process to PRIDE, a proteomic databank. Vaudel et al. partly base the framework on tools that they have developed themselves, and partly they are integrating other freeware tools into the workflow. One of the most interesting aspects with the Compomics framework is the possibility of extending mass spectrometry-based proteomics outside the MS laboratory itself. With the Compomics framework, any laboratory can handle large amounts of proteomic data, thereby facilitating collaboration and in-depth data analyses. The described software also opens the potential for any laboratory to re-analyze data deposited in PRIDE. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

New proteomic methods (environmental proteomics) can identify proteins that, after validation, might be useful as alternative biomarkers, although this approach also has its limitations, derived mainly from their application to non-model organisms. Initial studies using environmental proteomics were carried out in animals exposed to model pollutants, and led to the concept of protein expression signatures. Experiments have been carried out in model organisms (yeast, Arabidopsis, rat cells, or mice) exposed to model contaminants. Over the last few years, proteomics has been applied to organisms from ecosystems with different pollution levels, forming the basis of an environmental branch in proteomics. Another focus is connected with the presence of metals bound to biomolecules, which adds an additional dimension to metal-biomolecule and metalloprotein characterization - the field of metallomics. The metallomic approach considers the metallome: a whole individual metal or metalloid species within a cell or tissue. A metallomic analytical approach (MAA) is proposed as a new tool to study and identify metalloproteins.",

Both the quality and sensitivity of gel-based nuclear proteomics are limited, however, by the over-representation of histones in the protein mixture. These highly charged proteins overshadow rare species and interfere with IEF. A nuclear isolation and protein extraction procedure, tested on human embryonic stem cells, is reported that effectively isolates intact nuclei and then depletes the sample of histones by taking advantage of their ability to form an insoluble complex with DNA at lower pH (even under denaturing conditions). Ubiquitous histones and abundant nuclear actin, are depleted up to 99 +/- 0.02 and 42 +/- 5%, respectively. This technique greatly improves electrofocusing efficacy and nearly doubles the number of detected protein spots. This approach to nuclear protein isolation for 2-D PAGE opens the door to better investigation of nuclear protein dynamics.",

It follows the technical developments aimed toward global proteomics, the attempt to characterize every expressed protein in a cell by at least one peptide. When applications of the technology are discussed, the focus is placed on yeast biology. In particular, differential quantitative proteomics, the comparison between an experiment and its control, is very discriminating for proteins involved in the process being studied. When trying to understand biological processes on a molecular level, differential quantitative proteomics tends to give a clearer picture than global transcription analyses.

Often, the services within the core facility are also opened out to researchers from other institutions, frequently with a fee being levied for the service provided.

Of the 93 proteins that were identified, a large proportion (60%) was released by calcium chloride.

Targeted use of these labels or mass tags further leads to specific monitoring of diverse aspects of dynamic proteomes. In this review article, commonly used isotope labeling strategies are described, both for quantitative differential protein profiling and for targeted analysis of protein modifications.",

We describe PC proteomics on the basis of sample origins, i.e. tissues, body fluids, and PC cell lines. As regards PC tissues, we report the identification of a number of candidate biomarkers of precursor lesions that may allow early diagnosis of this neoplasia. Moreover, we describe cytoskeletal and hypoxia-regulated proteins that confirm the involvement of cytoskeleton modifications and metabolism adaptations in carcinogenesis. We also discuss the most important biomarkers identified by proteomic analysis involved in local invasion and distant metastasis, and in the cross-talk between pancreatic tumor and the surrounding stroma. Furthermore, we report novel candidate biomarkers identified in serum, plasma, and pancreatic juice of cancer patients compared with cancer-free controls. Proteomic alterations in PC cell line models as compared to normal controls and studies on cell lines treated with drugs or new agents to understand their mechanism of pharmacological action or the onset of drug resistance are also presented. Finally, we discuss the recent improvements obtained in classical 2-DE and high-throughput proteomic strategies able to allow the overcoming of relevant proteomic drawbacks.",

Pathogenic bacteria are suitable for proteomic comparisons in the aim of elucidating proteins with vaccine and diagnostic applications, as well as determining novel targets for drug design and the effects of these drugs on cellular physiology. Strains exhibiting diverse phenotypes including antibiotic or chemical resistances, altered mode of pathogenicity, or differential capability of growth in similar environments, can be compared via protein differential display to correlate relative protein abundances associated with these conditions. Technically, proteins are 'mapped' on 2-D arrays under 'standard' conditions and visually compared to arrays of proteins from a variety of test conditions. High-throughput technologies allow molecules of significance to be elucidated rapidly from within complex mixtures using a combination of cellular pre fractionation to determine cellular location and pathway predictions to aid in overcoming the limitations of 2-D gel technology for the analysis of whole proteomes.",

It involves collaboration between the leading proteomics journals: Journal of Proteome Research, Journal of Proteomics, Molecular and Cellular Proteomics, and Proteomics. The overall level is aimed at Masters/PhD level students who are starting out their research and who would benefit from a solid grounding in the techniques used in modern protein-based research. The tutorial program will cover core techniques and basics as an introduction to scientists new to the field. At a later stage the programme may be expanded with a series of more advanced topics focussing on the application of proteomics techniques to biological problem solving.

As the identification of proteins after classical separation techniques, such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, have become standard methods, new challenges arise in the field of proteomics. The development of \"functional proteomics\" combines functional characterization, like regulation, localization and modification, with the identification of proteins for deeper insight into cellular functions. Therefore, different mass spectrometric techniques for the analysis of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, have been established as well as isolation and separation methods for the analysis of highly complex samples, e.g. protein complexes or cell organelles. Furthermore, quantification of protein levels within cells is becoming a focus of interest as mass spectrometric methods for relative or even absolute quantification have currently not been available. Protein or genome databases have been an essential part of protein identification up to now. Thus, de novo sequencing offers new possibilities in protein analytical studies of organisms not yet completely sequenced. The intention of this review is to provide a short overview about the current capabilities of protein analysis when addressing various biological problems.",

Among 415 retinal protein spots, 11 protein spots showed circadian rhythmicity in their intensities. We performed MALDI-TOF MS and NanoLC-MS/MS analyses and identified proteins contained in the 11 spots. The proteins were related to vesicular transport, calcium-binding, protein degradation, metabolism, RNA-binding, and protein foldings, suggesting the clock-regulation of neurotransmitter release, transportation of the membrane proteins, calcium-binding capability, and so on. We also found a rhythmic phosphorylation of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein and identified one of the amino acid residues modified by phosphorylation.

Therefore we examined eight different protocols, including two different propionylation reagents. This revealed amidation (up to 70%) and methylation (up to 9%) of carboxyl groups as a side reaction. Moreover, incomplete (up to 85%) as well as aspecific propionylation (up to 63%) can occur, depending on the protocol.

On the other hand, proteomics allows serological screening of tumor antigens. Indeed, two-dimensional (2-D) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis allows simultaneously separation several thousand individual proteins from tumor tissue or tumor cell lines. Proteins eliciting humoral response in cancer are identified by 2-D Western blot using cancer patient sera, followed by mass spectrometry analysis and database search. Applied to different types of cancer, the proteome based approach has allowed us to define several tumor antigens.

Trypanosoma cruzi has a complex life cycle, involving insect and mammalian hosts and four distinct developmental stages: epimastigotes, metacyclic trypomastigotes, amastigotes, and bloodstream trypomastigotes. Metacyclogenesis is the process by which T. cruzi epimastigotes differentiate into metacyclic trypomastigotes and acquire infectivity, and involves differential gene expression associated with acquisition of virulence. In T. cruzi, gene expression regulation is achieved mainly posttranscriptionally. Therefore, proteomics-based approaches are extremely useful for gaining a better understanding of the changes that occur in the stage-regulated gene expression program of the parasite at the molecular level. Here, we performed an in-depth quantitative MS-based proteomic study of T. cruzi metacyclogenesis and quantified almost 3000 proteins expressed during the process of differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the most comprehensive quantitative proteomics study of different cell populations of T. cruzi available so far. We identified relevant proteins and pathways involved in the parasite's differentiation and infectivity acquisition, opening new perspectives for further studies that could, ultimately, lead to the identification of new targets for chemotherapy.",

The ecological success of diatoms suggests that they have developed a range of strategies to cope with various biotic and abiotic stress factors. It is of great interest to understand the adaptive responses of diatoms to different stresses in the marine environment. Proteomic technologies have been applied to the adaptive responses of marine diatoms under different growth conditions in recent years such as nitrogen starvation, iron limitation and phosphorus deficiency. These studies have provided clues to elucidate the sophisticated sensing mechanisms that control their adaptive responses. Although only a very limited number of proteomic studies were conducted in diatoms, the obtained data have led to a better understanding of the biochemical processes that contribute to their ecological success. This review presents the current status of proteomic studies of diatom stress responses and discusses the novel developments and applications for the analysis of protein post-translational modification in diatoms. The potential future application of proteomics could contribute to a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying diatom acclimation to a given stress and the acquisition of an enhanced diatom stress tolerance. Future challenges and research opportunities in the proteomics studies of diatoms are also discussed.",

Cell wall proteomics has greatly contributed to the description of the protein content of a compartment specific to plants. Around 400 cell wall proteins (CWPs) of Arabidopsis, representing about one fourth of its estimated cell wall proteome, have been described. The main points to note are that: (i) the diversity of enzymes acting on polysaccharides suggests a great plasticity of cell walls; (ii) CWPs such as proteases, polysaccharide hydrolytic enzymes, and lipases may contribute to the generation of signals; (iii) proteins of unknown functions were identified, suggesting new roles for cell walls. Recently, the characterization of PTMs such as N- and O-glycosylations improved our knowledge of CWP structure. The presence of many glycoside hydrolases and proteases suggests a complex regulation of CWPs involving various types of post-translational events. The first 3-D structures to be resolved gave clues about the interactions between CWPs, or between CWPs and polysaccharides. Future work should include: extracting and identifying CWPs still recalcitrant to proteomics, describing the cell wall interactome, improving quantification, and unraveling the roles of each of the CWPs.",

With greater emphasis in developing countries, one of those was to \"organize workshops at national and international levels to train manpower and exchange information\". This third INPPO highlights covers the workshop organized for the very first time in a developing country, India, at the Department of Botany in University of Delhi on December 26-30, 2013 titled - \"1(st) Plant Proteomics Workshop / Training Program\" under the umbrella of INPPO India-Nepal chapter. Selected 20 participants received on-hand training mainly on gel-based proteomics approach along with manual booklet and parallel lectures on this and associated topics. In house, as well as invited experts drawn from other Universities and Institutes (national and international), delivered talks on different aspects of gel-based and gel-free proteomics. Importance of gel-free proteomics approach, translational proteomics, and INPPO roles were presented and interactively discussed by a group of three invited speakers Drs. Ganesh Kumar Agrawal (Nepal), Randeep Rakwal (Japan), and Antonio Masi (Italy). Given the output of this systematic workshop, it was proposed and thereafter decided to be organized every alternate year; the next workshop will be held in 2015. Furthermore, possibilities on providing advanced training to those students / researchers / teachers with basic knowledge in proteomics theory and experiments at national and international levels were discussed. INPPO is committed to generating next-generation trained manpower in proteomics, and it would only happen by the firm determination of scientists to come forward and do it.

They also provide insight into human development and disease and can be used as models for drug discovery and toxicity analyses. The key properties of hESCs that make them so promising for medical use are that they have the ability to self-renew indefinitely in culture and they are pluripotent, which means that they can differentiate into any of more than 200 human cell types. Since proteins are the effectors of cellular processes, it is important to investigate hESC expression at the protein level as well as at the transcript level. In addition, post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the activity of pivotal proteins in hESCs, and this information can only be determined by studying the proteome. In this review, we summarize the results obtained from several proteomics analyses of hESCs that have been reported in the last few years.",

Therefore, it is essential to establish standard formats for every necessary aspect of proteomics data. One of the recently published data models is the proteomics experiment data repository [Taylor, C. F., Paton, N. W., Garwood, K. L., Kirby, P. D. et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 2003, 21, 247-254]. Compliant with this format, we developed the systematic proteomics laboratory analysis and storage hub (SPLASH) database system as an informatics infrastructure to support proteomics studies. It consists of three modules and provides proteomics researchers a common platform to store, manage, search, analyze, and exchange their data. (i) Data maintenance includes experimental data entry and update, uploading of experimental results in batch mode, and data exchange in the original PEDRo format. (ii) The data search module provides several means to search the database, to view either the protein information or the differential expression display by clicking on a gel image. (iii) The data mining module contains tools that perform biochemical pathway, statistics-associated gene ontology, and other comparative analyses for all the sample sets to interpret its biological meaning. These features make SPLASH a practical and powerful tool for the proteomics community.",

These organelles have the particular ability to concentrate proteins and lipids obtained from medium together with the main proteolytic enzymes originated from the secretory pathway, being at the same time a storage organelle and the main site of protein degradation. Subcellular proteomics have been extensively used for profiling organelles in different cell types. Here, we combine cell fractionation and LC-MS/MS analysis to identify reservosome-resident proteins. Starting from a purified reservosome fraction, we established a protocol to isolate reservosome membranes. Transmission electron microscopy was applied to confirm the purity of the fractions. To achieve a better coverage of identified proteins we analyzed the fractions separately and combined the results. LC-MS/MS analysis identified in total 709 T. cruzi-specific proteins; of these, 456 had predicted function and 253 were classified as hypothetical proteins. We could confirm the presence of most of the proteins validated by previous work and identify new proteins from different classes such as enzymes, proton pumps, transport proteins, and others. The definition of the reservosome protein profile is a good tool to assess their molecular signature, identify molecular markers, and understand their relationship with different organelles.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC or hepatoma) is the most common primary cancer of the liver. It is responsible for approximately one million deaths each year, mainly in underdeveloped and developing countries. The aetiological factors identified in the development of HCC included persistent infection by hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, and exposure to aflatoxins. Although immunization can protect individuals from being infected by the hepatitis B virus, the early detection of HCC in those who have been infected by the virus remains a challenge. Thus most HCCs present late and are not suitable for curative treatment. Hence there is a tremendous interest and urgency to identify novel HCC diagnostic marker(s) for early detection, and tumour specific disease associated proteins as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of HCC. Screening for these HCC proteins has been facilitated by proteomics, a key technology in the global analysis of protein expression and understanding gene function. Present and earlier proteome analyses of HCC have used predominantly experimental in vitro systems. The protein expression profiles of several hepatoma cell lines such as HepG2, Huh7, SK-Hep1, and Hep3B have been compared with normal liver, and nontransformed cell lines (Chang and WRL-68), while a comprehensive proteome analysis to create a protein database was carried out for the cell line HCC-M. In the future, proteome analyses utilizing tumour tissues, which reflect the pathological state of HCC more closely, will be undertaken. This work will complement the gene expression studies of HCC which are already underway. Efforts have also been directed at the proteome analysis of hepatic stellate cells, as these cells play an important role in liver fibrosis. Since liver fibrosis is reversible but not cirrhosis, it is of considerable importance to identify therapeutic targets that can slow its progression.",

The Na2CO3 wash followed by SDS-PAGE prior to in-gel tryptic digestion and LC-MS/MS strategy was effective for the detection of membrane proteins with 47.1% of the identified proteins being transmembrane proteins. Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis showed that biological processes involving transport, lipid metabolism, cell communication, cell adhesion, and cellular component organization were significantly enriched. Comparison of the present data with the previously published reports on mouse liver proteomes confirmed that the MPI Standard provides an excellent resource for the analysis of membrane proteins in the AOHUPO MPI.",

Proteomics has contributed substantially to our understanding of individual organisms at the cellular level as it offers excellent possibilities to probe many protein functions and responses simultaneously. However, it has not yet been widely applied in microbial ecology, although most proteins have an intrinsic metabolic function which can be used to relate microbial activities to the identity of defined organisms in multispecies communities. Albeit still in its infancy, environmental proteomics enables simple protein cataloging, comparative and semi-quantitative proteomics, analyses of protein localization, discovery of post-translational modifications, and even determination of amino-acid sequences and genotypes by strain-resolved proteogenomics. This review traces the historical development of environmental proteomics and summarizes milestone publications in the field.

Histone acetylations affect the regulation of gene transcription, and the loss of learning induced deacetylation at specific histone sites may represent biomarkers for memory loss and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Selected-reaction-monitoring (SRM) has recently been advanced to quantitate peptides and proteins in complex biological systems. In this paper, we provide evidence that SRM-based targeted proteomics can reliably quantify specific histone acetylations in both AD and control brain by identifying the patterns of H3 K18/K23 acetylations Results of targeted proteomics assays have been validated by Western blot (WB) analysis. As compared with LC-MS/MS-TMT (tandem-mass-tagging) and WB methods, the targeted proteomics method has shown higher throughput, and therefore promised to be more suitable for clinical applications. With this methodology, we find that histone acetylation is significantly lower in AD temporal lobe than found in aged controls. Targeted proteomics warrants increased application for studying epigenetics of neurodegenerative diseases.",

In top-down proteomics, it is essential to separate the high mass proteins from the low mass species due to the exponential decay in S/N as a function of increasing molecular mass. SEC is a favored LC method for size-based separation of proteins but suffers from notoriously low resolution and detrimental dilution. Herein, we reported the use of ultrahigh pressure (UHP) SEC for rapid and high-resolution separation of intact proteins for top-down proteomics. Fast separation of intact proteins (6-669 kDa) was achieved in < 7 min with high resolution and high efficiency. More importantly, we have shown that this UHP-SEC provides high-resolution separation of intact proteins using a MS-friendly volatile solvent system, allowing the direct top-down MS analysis of SEC-eluted proteins without an additional desalting step. Taken together, we have demonstrated that UHP-SEC is an attractive LC strategy for the size separation of proteins with great potential for top-down proteomics.",

Using iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics analysis, 126 differential serum proteins were identified and provide valuable insight into the underlying mechanisms of KF.

The tool is able to generate a list of differentially regulated peptide precursors for subsequent MS/MS experiments, minimizing time-consuming acquisition and interpretation of MS/MS data. ICPLQuant is based on two independent units. Unit 1 performs ICPL multiplex detection and quantification and proposes peptides to be identified by MS/MS. Unit 2 combines MASCOT MS/MS protein identification with the quantitative data and produces a protein/peptide list with all the relevant information accessible for further data mining. The accuracy of quantification, selection of peptides for MS/MS-identification and the automated output of a protein list of regulated proteins are demonstrated by the comparative analysis of four different mixtures of three proteins (Ovalbumin, Horseradish Peroxidase and Rabbit Albumin) spiked into the complex protein background of the DGPF Proteome Marker.",

Furthermore, spectrum quality improvement allows the identification of more peptides with greater confidence, the comparison of complex peptide mixtures is facilitated, and the entire proteomics project is presented in concise form. Pep-Miner is an advanced software tool that implements these clustering-based applications. It proved useful in several comparative proteomics projects involving lung cancer cells and various other cell types.

Such a cell has about 1 000 000 000 protein molecules, some of them being present at 10 000 000 copies while others at a very low copy number (say 1 to 10 copies per cell). By studying cell free expression of individual cDNA clones (or pools of known complexity) we address to those rare molecular components that will remain undetected by the current analytical means. For our analysis we use cell free translation systems (wheat germ or rabbit reticulocyte origin) and we study polypeptide products originating from intact, or restriction endonuclease-treated cDNA clones. We conclude that in most instances expressed genes yield transcript(s) that translate into several, and often very numerous families of polypeptide species. In our ISODALT two-dimensional gel system we characterize the proteomic profile of the clonal polypeptide families in terms of their molecular mass, charge, multiple products, and appearance.",

Eight proteins were selected for further investigation by quantitative protein measurements using a MRM assay; apolipoprotein E, carboxypeptidase N subunit 2, complement factor B (CFAB), galectin-3 binding protein (LG3BP), lumican, serum amyloid A-4 protein (SAA4), serum amyloid P-component, and sex hormone binding globulin.

Apolipoprotein E and lumican showed no significant difference in protein levels, sex hormone binding globulin could not be quantified since the MRM assay did not reach the required sensitivity. A model based on the three most significantly decreased proteins (CFAB, LG3BP, and SAA4) showed a sensitivity and specificity of 73 and 66%, respectively, for the initial sample set. A small external validation set yielded 77% sensitivity and 75% specificity.",

A microchannel plate detector is used here for real-time imaging of low levels of tritiated protein separated by two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis. The system employs radioisotope-free, low noise microchannel plates originally developed for photon counting in X-ray astronomy. Using the detector configuration described here, proteins were resolved on mini gels by either one or two-dimensional electrophoresis, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and directly imaged. Tritiated diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) was used as a selective label for the serine hydrolase class of enzymes and their distribution in the central nervous system was examined. This survey revealed approximately 24 protein spots by 2-D electrophoresis. We also investigated the relative sensitivity of these proteins towards DFP and found the peptidase, acylpeptide hydrolase to be the most sensitive brain protein towards this reagent. Using a number of different tritiated standards, it was found that the system can image as little as 0.1 Bq/mm2 of tritium corresponding to 320 attomol of DFP labelled protein/mm2. Moreover, the system has a wide dynamic range (>106) allowing samples of high and low activity to be quantified on the same gel.",

Global protein abundance data for P. gingivalis strain ATCC 33277 internalized for 18 h within human gingival epithelial cells and controls exposed to gingival cell culture medium were obtained at sufficient coverage to provide strong evidence that these changes are profound. A total of 385 proteins were overexpressed in internalized P. gingivalis relative to controls; 240 proteins were shown to be underexpressed. This represented in total about 28% of the protein encoding ORFs annotated for this organism, and slightly less than half of the proteins that were observed experimentally. Production of several proteases, including the classical virulence factors RgpA, RgpB, and Kgp, was decreased. A separate validation study was carried out in which a 16-fold dilution of the P. gingivalis proteome was compared to the undiluted sample in order to assess the quantitative false negative rate (all ratios truly alternative). Truly null (no change) abundance ratios from technical replicates were used to assess the rate of quantitative false positives over the entire proteome. A global comparison between the direction of abundance change observed and previously published bioinformatic gene pair predictions for P. gingivalis will assist with future studies of P. gingivalis gene regulation and operon prediction.",

        "abstract": "Proteins are the molecules that fulfil most cellular functions and represent over 90% of drug targets in the market. Chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI) provides a timely and locally restricted protein inactivation and has proven to specifically destroy protein function using dye-coupled ligands and laser irradiation. CALI involves the generation of short-lived radicals thus limiting the radius of covalent modifications to spatially restricted sites on the target molecule. A transient functional inactivation occurs if the radicals modify amino acids of the target protein that are responsible for function. Here we show specific inactivation of several protein targets, that are members of relevant signal transduction pathways. For each of these targets, simple and high throughput screening-scaleable assays have been developed, making it possible to quantify the observed inactivation. Activities of target proteins have been addressed in cell-free as well as cell-based assays employing human primary and tumor-derived cell lines. In all cases, at least 50% inactivation was achieved. The data presented here demonstrate that CALI is a highly versatile tool for validating disease relevant targets at the protein level. This approach also takes into account post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, glycosylation or acylation, thereby enlarging its applicability for many different types of targets.",

While this step has traditionally been implemented in homogeneous (solution) format, there is a growing trend to use heterogeneous systems in which the enzyme is immobilized on hydrogels or other solid supports. Here, we introduce the use of immobilized enzymes in hydrogels for proteomic sample processing in digital microfluidic (DMF) systems. In this technique, preformed cylindrical agarose discs bearing immobilized trypsin or pepsin were integrated into DMF devices. A fluorogenic assay was used to optimize the covalent modification procedure for enzymatic digestion efficiency, with maximum efficiency observed at 31 \u03bcg trypsin in 2-mm diameter agarose gel discs. Gel discs prepared in this manner were used in an integrated method in which proteomic samples were sequentially reduced, alkylated, and digested, with all sample and reagent handling controlled by DMF droplet operation. Mass spectrometry analysis of the products revealed that digestion using the trypsin gel discs resulted in higher sequence coverage in model analytes relative to conventional homogenous processing. Proof-of-principle was demonstrated for a parallel digestion system in which a single sample was simultaneously digested on multiple gel discs bearing different enzymes. We propose that these methods represent a useful new tool for the growing trend toward miniaturization and automation in proteomic sample processing.",

Blue-native gel electrophoresis has been successful not only for dissection of the inner membrane oxidative phosphorylation system, but also for the components of the outer membrane such as those involved in protein import. Identification of PTMs such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and nitration of mitochondrial membrane proteins has been greatly improved by the use of affinity techniques. However, understanding of the biological effect of these modifications is an area for further exploration. The rapid development of proteomic methods for both identification and quantitation, especially for modifications, will greatly impact the understanding of the mitochondrial membrane proteome.",

The current data analysis platform typically relies on protein-level ratios, which is obtained by summarizing peptide-level ratios for each protein. In shotgun proteomics, however, some proteins are quantified with more peptides than others, and this reproducibility information is not incorporated into the differential expression (DE) analysis. Here we propose a novel probabilistic framework EBprot that directly models the peptide-protein hierarchy and rewards the proteins with reproducible evidence of DE over multiple peptides. To evaluate its performance with known DE states, we conducted a simulation study to show that the peptide-level analysis of EBprot provides better receiver-operating characteristic and more accurate estimation of the false discovery rates than the methods based on protein-level ratios. We also demonstrate superior classification performance of peptide-level EBprot analysis in a spike-in dataset. To illustrate the wide applicability of EBprot in different experimental designs, we applied EBprot to a dataset for lung cancer subtype analysis with biological replicates and another dataset for time course phosphoproteome analysis of EGF-stimulated HeLa cells with multiplexed labeling. Through these examples, we show that the peptide-level analysis of EBprot is a robust alternative to the existing statistical methods for the DE analysis of labeling-based quantitative datasets.

However, relatively few alternative protein isoforms have been experimentally identified, particularly at the protein level. In this study, we assess the ability of proteomics to inform on differently spliced protein isoforms in human and four other model eukaryotes. The number of Ensembl-annotated genes for which proteomic data exists that informs on AS exceeds 33% of the alternately spliced genes in the human and worm genomes. Examining AS in chicken via proteomics for the first time, we find support for over 600 AS genes. However, although peptide identifications support only a small fraction of alternative protein isoforms that are annotated in Ensembl, many more variants are amenable to proteomic identification. There remains a sizeable gap between these existing identifications (10-52% of AS genes) and those that are theoretically feasible (90-99%). We also compare annotations between Swiss-Prot and Ensembl, recommending use of both to maximize coverage of AS. We propose that targeted proteomic experiments using selected reactions and standards are essential to uncover further alternative isoforms and discuss the issues surrounding these strategies.",

By using SRM quantification, we assayed red fluorescent protein (RFP) expressed from plasmids containing several inducible and constitutive promoters and subsequently assessed protein production from the same promoters driving expression of eight mevalonate pathway proteins in Escherichia coli. For each of the promoter systems, the protein level for the first gene in the operon followed that of RFP, however, the levels of proteins produced from genes farther from the promoter were much less consistent. Second, we used targeted proteomics to characterize tyrosine biosynthesis pathway proteins after removal of native regulation. The changes were not expected to cause significant impact on protein levels, yet significant variation in protein abundance was observed and tyrosine production for these strains spanned a range from less than 1 mg/L to greater than 250 mg/L. Overall, our results underscore the importance of targeted proteomics for determining accurate protein levels in engineered systems and fine-tuning metabolic pathways.",

The sequential use of detergent-containing buffers on neurons in culture plates yields four extracts enriched in cytosolic, membrane-bound or enclosed, nuclear, and cytoskeletal proteins. Fractionation of neurons was validated by comparison of the distribution of known subcellular marker proteins in the four extracts using Western blotting. Comparison of extracts by DIGE showed a clear difference in protein composition demonstrating significant variations with a fold change (FC) of at least 1.20 for 82% of the detected spots. Using proteins identified in these spots that could be assigned a subcellular localization based on descriptions in the Uniprot database, an extraction efficiency of 85% was calculated for cytosolic proteins in extract 1, 90% for membrane-bound and membrane-enclosed proteins in extract 2, 82% for nuclear proteins in extract 3 and 38% for cytoskeletal and RAFT proteins in extract 4.",

Proteomics has been used to analyze CSF in order to discover disease-associated proteins and to elucidate the basic molecular mechanisms that either cause, or result from, CNS disorders. However, some disease-associated proteins are of low-abundance and are difficult to detect. A low total-protein concentration, a high amount of albumin and immunoglobins, and a wide dynamic range (several orders of magnitude) of protein concentration cause several difficulties in the identification of low-abundance CSF proteins. In this study, advantage was taken of the range of different hydrophobic properties of CSF proteins, and a reversed-phase solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge was used to prefractionate human lumbar CSF proteins into three separate fractions prior to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis resolution of the proteome. A portion of the high-abundance CSF proteins were removed from two (eluted with 35% and 50% acetonitrile) of the three fractions. Some trace CSF proteins were preferentially enriched in the two fractions, and many proteins were detected in the two-dimensional (2-D) gels of the two fractions. Among the novel proteins identified, sixty-two protein spots that represent forty-two proteins were characterized. Most of the proteins have not been annotated in any previous 2-D map of human CSF, and several have been implicated in CNS diseases. The prefractionation of CSF proteins with SPE, followed by proteomics analysis, provides a new method to explore low-abundance, disease-specific CSF proteins.",

        "abstract": "Site-specific transcription factors (TFs) play an essential role in mammalian development and function as they are vital for the majority of cellular processes. Despite their biological importance, TF proteomic data is scarce in the literature, likely due to difficulties in detecting peptides as the abundance of TFs in cells tends to be low. In recent years, significant improvements in mass spectrometry (MS)-based technologies in terms of sensitivity and specificity have increased the interest in developing quantitative methodologies specifically targeting relatively lowly abundant proteins such as TFs in mammalian models. Such efforts would be greatly aided by the availability of TF peptide-specific information as such data would not only enable improvements in speed and accuracy of protein identifications, but also ameliorate cross-comparisons of quantitative proteomics data and allow for a more efficient development of targeted proteomics assays. However, to date, no comprehensive TF proteotypic peptide database has been developed. To address this evident lack of TF peptide data in public repositories, we are generating a comprehensive, experimentally derived TF proteotypic peptide spectral library dataset based on in vitro protein expression. Our library currently contains peptide information for 89 TFs, and this number is set to increase in the near future. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Such a platform must be able to provide high-throughput operation while having sufficient flexibility to accommodate evolving data analysis tools and methodologies. The Proteomics Research Information Storage and Management system (PRISM) provides a platform that serves the needs of the accurate mass and time tag approach developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. PRISM incorporates a diverse set of analysis tools and allows a wide range of operations to be incorporated by using a state machine that is accessible to independent, distributed computational nodes. The system has scaled well as data volume has increased over several years, while allowing adaptability for incorporating new and improved data analysis tools for more effective proteomics research.",

A major obstacle to reliably determining quantitative changes in protein expression is to overcome error imposed by technical variation and biological variation. In drug discovery and development the issue of biological variation often rises in concordance with the developmental stage of research, spanning from in vitro assays to clinical trials. In this paper we present case studies to raise awareness to the issues of technical variation and biological variation and the impact this places on applying quantitative proteomics. We defined the degree of technical variation from the process of two-dimensional electrophoresis as 20-30% coefficient of variation. On the other hand, biological variation observed experiment-to-experiment showed a broader degree of variation depending upon the sample type. This was demonstrated with case studies where variation was monitored across experiments with bacteria, established cell lines, primary cultures, and with drug treated human subjects. We discuss technical variation and biological variation as key factors to consider during experimental design, and offer insight into preparing experiments that overcome this challenge to provide statistically significant outcomes for conducting quantitative proteomic research.",

In a separate experiment using the same sample and a spike test, we demonstrate that the difference ration was calculated accurately using the 18O-labeling method even if the protein was part of a complex mixture. Our data also suggest that the accuracy of the quantitation can be improved by averaging the difference ratios of several peptides. In comparing our method with the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) method, we show that the 18O-labeling method has the advantages of better recovery and fewer isotope effects. Therefore, the 18O-labeling method is a powerful tool for large-scale proteomics applications.",

The technique was then applied to measure protein abundance levels in brain tissue afflicted with AD relative to normal brain tissue. 2-D LC-MS analysis identified 548 unique proteins (p<0.05).

Bile from four patients with hilar CCA was depleted of albumin and immunoglobulin G and analysed by GeLC-MS/MS. The number of proteins identified per bile sample was between 378 and 741. Overall, the products of 813 unique genes were identified, considerably extending current knowledge of the malignant bile proteome. Of these, 268 were present in at least 3 out of 4 patients.

In practice, however, major problems are encountered with the computer-assisted distinction between (Sec-type) signal peptides that direct exported proteins into the growth medium and lipoprotein signal peptides or amino-terminal membrane anchors that cause protein retention in the membrane. In the present studies, which were aimed at improving methods to predict protein retention in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, we have compared sets of membrane-attached and extracellular proteins of Bacillus subtilis that were recently identified through proteomics approaches. The results showed that three classes of membrane-attached proteins can be distinguished. Two classes include 43 lipoproteins and 48 proteins with an amino-terminal transmembrane segment, respectively. Remarkably, a third class includes 31 proteins that remain membrane-retained despite the presence of typical Sec-type signal peptides with consensus signal peptidase recognition sites. This unprecedented finding indicates that unknown mechanisms are involved in membrane retention of this class of proteins. A further novelty is a consensus sequence indicative for release of certain lipoproteins from the membrane by proteolytic shaving. Finally, using non-overlapping sets of secreted and membrane-retained proteins, the accuracy of different signal peptide prediction algorithms was assessed. Accuracy for the prediction of protein retention in the membrane was increased to 82% using a majority-vote approach. Our findings provide important leads for future identification of surface proteins from pathogenic bacteria, which are attractive candidate infection markers and potential targets for drugs or vaccines.",

The high sensitivity of the assay permits the specific quantification of proteins derived from as little as only 20,000 cells with an error rate of only 5%. The capacity is limited to the analysis of up to 500 different samples per microarray. Protein abundance is determined qualitatively, and quantitatively, if recombinant protein is available. This novel approach was called IPAQ (infrared-based protein arrays with quantitative readout). IPAQ offers a highly sensitive experimental approach superior to the established standard protein quantification technologies, and is suitable for quantitative proteomics.

This is the first such study of human heart. The effect of fixation (ethanol or acetone), staining with haematoxylin and eosin in the presence and absence of xylene, and antibody staining was investigated. Proteins were separated by 2-DE and spots detected by silver staining. Quantitative spot analysis showed that contractile proteins were preserved under all conditions, and no significant differences were found when the groups studied were compared with the control group. However, there were differences in the visual quality of the gel patterns. LMD provided enough protein from blood vessels and myocytes to run one large-format (18 x 24 cm) 2-D gel for each subset of cells. Collection of this material took 70 h (approximately 2800 blood vessels and 17,000 myocytes) and resulted in tissue-specific gel patterns for these two structures. In conclusion, the use of haematoxylin and eosin staining without xylene provided the best morphology and did not significantly affect protein spot number.",

Comparative proteomics revealed proteins exhibiting contrasting behavior between seed samples. Thus, 18 proteins were up-regulated during priming and down-regulated during aging and further displayed an up-regulation upon priming of the aged seeds, meaning that down-regulation of these spot volumes during aging was reversible upon subsequent priming. Also, 11 proteins exhibited the converse behavior characterized by a decrease and an increase of the spot volumes during priming and aging of the control seeds, respectively, and a decrease in the spot volumes upon priming of the aged seeds. The results underpinned the role in seed vigor of several metabolic pathways involved in lipid and starch mobilization, protein synthesis or the methyl cycle. They also corroborate previous studies suggesting that the glyoxylate enzyme isocitrate lyase, the capacity of protein synthesis and components of abscisic acid signaling pathways are likely contributors of seed vigor.",

However, the contributions of these two chaperones to the assembly of the OM proteome remained unclear. We used differential proteomics to determine how the elimination of Skp and SurA affects the assembly of many OMPs. We have shown that removal of Skp has no impact on the levels of the 63 identified OM proteins. However, depletion of SurA in the skp strain has a marked impact on the OM proteome, diminishing the levels of almost all \u03b2-barrel proteins. Our results are consistent with a model in which SurA plays a primary chaperone role in E. coli. Furthermore, they suggest that while no OMPs prefer the Skp chaperone pathway in wild-type cells, most can use Skp efficiently when SurA is absent. Our data, which provide a unique glimpse into the protein content of the nonviable surA skp mutant, clarify the roles of the periplasmic chaperones in E. coli.",

Enrichment strategies, such as those employing affinity matrices, are required for the characterization of such complexes, for example, those containing growth factor receptors. The receptor for the macrophage lineage growth factor, macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1), is the tyrosine kinase, c-Fms. There is evidence that the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) forms distinct multimeric complexes involving autophosphorylated tyrosines in its cytoplasmic region; however, these complexes are difficult to identify by immunoprecipitation, making enrichment necessary. We report here the use of a tyrosine-phosphorylated, GST-fusion construct of the entire CSF-1R cytoplasmic region to characterize proteins putatively associating with the activated CSF-1R. Besides signalling molecules known to associate with the receptor or be involved in CSF-1R-dependent signalling, mass spectrometry identified a number of other molecules binding to the construct. So far among these candidate proteins, dynein, claudin and silencer of death domains co-immunoprecipitated with the CSF-1R, suggesting association. This affinity matrix method, using an entire cytoplasmic region, may have relevance for other growth factor receptors.",

Isotope-coded protein labeling (ICPL), which is based on the nicotinoylation of proteins at lysine residues and free N-termini was used as a simple, reliable and fast method for the comparative analysis of three different cellular states of the halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum through pairwise comparison. The labeled proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, in-gel digested and the proteolytic peptides were separated by LC and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Automated quantitation was performed by comparing the MS peptide signals of (12)C and (13)C nicotinoylated isotopic peptide pairs. The transitions between (i) aerobic growth in complex versus synthetic medium and (ii) aerobic versus anaerobic/phototrophic growth, both in complex medium, provide a wide span in nutrient and energy supply for the cell and thus allowed optimal studies of proteome changes. In these two studies, 559 and 643 proteins, respectively, could be quantified allowing a detailed analysis of the adaptation of H. salinarum to changes of its living conditions. The subtle cellular response to a wide variation of nutrient and energy supply demonstrates a fine tuning of the cellular protein inventory.",

Candidiasis is often associated with the formation of biofilms on the surface of inert or biological materials. Biofilms are structured microbial communities attached to a surface and encased within a matrix of exopolymeric substance (EPS). At present, very little is known about the changes in protein profiles that occur during the transition from the planktonic to the biofilm mode of growth. Here, we report the use of proteomics for the comparative analysis of subcellular fractions obtained from C. albicans biofilm and planktonic cultures, including cell surface-associated proteins and secreted components present in liquid culture supernatants (for planktonic cultures) and EPS (for biofilms). The analysis revealed a high degree of similarity between the protein profiles associated with the planktonic and biofilm extracts, and led to the identification of several differentially expressed protein spots. Among the differentially expressed proteins, there was a preponderance of metabolic enzymes that have been described as cell surface proteins and immunodominant antigens. Proteins found in the biofilm matrix included a few predicted to form part of the secretome, and also many secretion-signal-less proteins. These observations contribute to our understanding of the C. albicans biofilm lifestyle.",

The distinct mass shift upon adenylation of threonine or tyrosine residues renders it a good target for MS detection and identification; however, the fragmentation of adenylylated peptides derived from proteolytic digestion of adenylylated proteins has not yet been systematically investigated. Here, we demonstrate that adenylylated peptides show loss of parts of the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) upon different fragmentation techniques. As expected, causing the least fragmentation of the AMP group, electron transfer dissociation yields less complicated spectra. In contrast, CID and higher energy collision (HCD) fragmentation caused AMP to fragment, generating characteristic ions that could be utilized in the specific identification of adenylylated peptides. The characteristic ions and losses upon CID and higher energy collision fragmentation from the AMP group turned out to be highly dependent on which amino acid was adenylylated, with different reporter ions for adenylylated threonine and tyrosine. We also investigated how adenylylation is best incorporated into search engines, exemplified by Mascot and showed that it is possible to identify adenylylation by search engines.",

We characterized human gallbladder proteins and identified 140 gallbladder-specific proteins with an elevated expression in the gallbladder as compared to the other analyzed tissues. Five genes were categorized as enriched, with at least fivefold higher levels in gallbladder, 60 genes were categorized as group enriched with elevated transcript levels in gallbladder shared with at least one other tissue and 75 genes were categorized as enhanced with higher expression than the average expression in other tissues. We explored the localization of the genes within the gallbladder through cell-type specific antibody-based protein profiling and the subcellular localization of the genes through immunofluorescent-based profiling. Finally, we revealed the biological processes and metabolic functions carried out by these genes through the use of GO, KEGG Pathway, and HMR2.0 that is compilation of the human metabolic reactions.

Cell suspension cultures were used for this first cell wall proteomics study of sugarcane. Proteins extracted from cell walls were identified using an adapted protocol. They were extracted using 0.2 M CaCl2 and 2 M LiCl after purification of cell walls. The proteins were then identified by the innovative nanoACQUITY UPLC MS/MS technology and bioinformatics using the translated SUCEST EST cluster database of sugarcane. The experiments were reproduced three times. Since Sorghum bicolor is the closest plant with a fully sequenced genome, homologous proteins were searched for to complete the annotation of proteins, that is, prediction of subcellular localization and functional domains. Altogether, 69 different proteins predicted to be secreted were identified among 377 proteins. The reproducibility of the experiments is discussed. These proteins were distributed into eight functional classes. Oxidoreductases such as peroxidases were well represented, whereas glycoside hydrolases were scarce.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the skin permeability and toxicological profiles of four chromium species. Chromium permeation across the skin, as determined by an in vitro Franz cell, decreased in the order of sodium chromate>potassium chromate>potassium dichromate>chromium nitrate. The uptake of chromium species within the skin generally showed a contrary trend to the results of permeation, although differences among the various compounds were not large. Levels of in vivo skin deposition of the four compounds showed no statistically significant differences. Potassium chromate produced the greatest disruption of the skin structure as determined by HE staining, followed in order by sodium chromate, potassium dichromate, and chromium nitrate. This indicates that hexavalent chromium elicited greater toxicity to the skin compared to trivalent chromium. A similar result was observed for the viability of skin fibroblasts. To improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to functional changes in proteins, proteomic tools, including 2-DE and MS techniques combined with sequence database correlations, were applied to identify target proteins altered by pathologic states. Eight protein spots, corresponding to cutaneous enzymes involved in energy metabolism and chaperon proteins, which were identified and discussed in this study, were associated with skin cytotoxicity, immunity, and carcinogenesis. In addition, functional proteomics of skin tissues may provide a promising tool for developing therapeutic strategies and can serve as the basis for further research.",

Their post-translational modifications (PTMs) contribute in modeling chromatin structure and recruiting enzymes involved in gene regulation, DNA repair and chromosome condensation. This fundamental aspect, together with the fact that histone PTMs can be epigenetically inherited through cell generations, enlightens their importance in chromatin biology, and the consequent necessity of having biochemical techniques for their characterization. Nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS) is the strategy of choice for protein PTM accurate quantification. However, histones require adjustments to the digestion protocol such as lysine derivatization to obtain suitable peptides for the analysis. nanoLC-MS has numerous advantages, spanning from high confidence identification to possibility of high throughput analyses, but the peculiarity of the histone preparation protocol requires continuous monitoring with the most modern available technologies to question its reliability. The work of Meert et al.

The results demonstrated that ERLPS was highly reproducible and transferable within appropriate loading amounts and linearly correlated response peptides should be selected for each specific experiment.

ICMS exploits the reproducibility of mass fingerprints for individual bacterial and fungal strains as well as the high similarity of mass fingerprints within a species. Comparison of mass spectral data to genomic sequences emphasized the validity of peak patterns as taxonomic markers. Supported by comprehensive databases, MALDI-TOF-MS-based identification has been widely accepted in clinical laboratories within only a few years.",

This review will highlight the technologies available, outline the capabilities, advantages and disadvantages of each and briefly describe applications in nephrology.\\n\\nRECENT FINDINGS: Proteomics provides information about abundance, location, chemical modification and protein-protein interactions that is not available from genomic technologies. Several proteomic approaches are now widely available. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, antibody arrays and protein chips (surface enhanced laser desorption ionization) provide opportunities to identify and compare an abundance of proteins as well as to determine posttranslational modifications, subcellular location and molecular interactions. Recent advances such as multidimensional chromatographic analysis and isotope coded affinity tags have expanded the usefulness of these approaches.\\n\\nSUMMARY: Proteomic technologies are improving and developing rapidly. These techniques will be valuable tools to develop markers for disease, identify and evaluate proteins as drug targets and understand renal physiology at the protein level.",

Krishna et al. [Proteomics 2015, 15, 2618\u20132628] investigated whether incorporation of RNA-seq data into proteogenomics analyses can contribute significantly to validation studies of genome annotation, in two important parasitic organisms Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum. They applied a systematic approach to combine new and previously published proteomics data from T. gondii and N. caninum with transcriptomics data, leading to substantially improved gene models for these organisms. This study illustrates the importance of incorporating experimental data from both proteomics and RNA-seq studies into routine genome annotation protocols.",

To date much effort has been devoted to achieving the highest possible coverage of proteomes with the aim to inform future developments in basic biology as well as in clinical settings. As a result, growing amounts of data have been deposited in publicly available proteomics databases. These data are in turn increasingly reused for orthogonal downstream purposes such as data mining and machine learning. These downstream uses however, need ways to a posteriori validate whether a particular data set is suitable for the envisioned purpose. Furthermore, the (semi-)automatic curation of repository data is dependent on analyses that can highlight misannotation and edge conditions for data sets. Such curation is an important prerequisite for efficient proteomics data reuse in the life sciences in general. We therefore present here a selection of quality control metrics and approaches for the a posteriori detection of potential issues encountered in typical proteomics data sets. We illustrate our metrics by relying on publicly available data from the Proteomics Identifications Database (PRIDE), and simultaneously show the usefulness of the large body of PRIDE data as a means to derive empirical background distributions for relevant metrics.",

In the past several years, the shotgun proteomics technologies have been refined toward further enhancement of proteome coverage. In the complex series of protocols involved in shotgun proteomics, however, loss of proteolytic peptides during the lyophilization step prior to the LC/MS/MS injection has been relatively neglected despite the fact that the dissolution of the hydrophobic peptides in lyophilized samples is difficult in 0.05-0.1% TFA or formic acid, causing substantial loss of precious peptide samples. In order to prevent the loss of peptide samples during this step, we devised a new protocol using Invitrosol (IVS), a commercially available surfactant compatible with ESI-MS; by dissolving the lyophilized peptides in IVS, we show improved recovery of hydrophobic peptides, leading to enhanced coverage of proteome. Thus, the use of IVS in the recovery step of lyophilized peptides will help the shotgun proteomics analysis by expanding the proteome coverage, which would significantly promote the discovery and development of new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.",

Breast cancer proteomics has already identified markers of potential clinical interest (such as the molecular chaperone 14-3-3 sigma) and technological innovations such as large scale and high throughput analysis are now driving the field. Methods in functional proteomics have also been developed to study the intracellular signaling pathways that underlie the development of breast cancer. As illustrated with fibroblast growth factor-2, a mitogen and motogen factor for breast cancer cells, proteomics is a powerful approach to identify signaling proteins and to decipher the complex signaling circuitry involved in tumor growth. Together with genomics, proteomics is well on the way to molecularly characterizing the different types of breast tumor, and thus defining new therapeutic targets for future treatment.",

The framework presented here tackles the issue of checking that experimental data reported using a specific format, CVs and public bio-ontologies (e.g. Gene Ontology, NCBI taxonomy) are compliant with the Minimum Information About a Proteomics Experiment recommendations. The semantic validator not only checks the XML syntax but it also enforces rules regarding the use of an ontology class or CV terms by checking that the terms exist in the resource and that they are used in the correct location of a document. Moreover, this framework is extremely fast, even on sizable data files, and flexible, as it can be adapted to any standard by customizing the parameters it requires: an XML Schema Definition, one or more CVs or ontologies, and a mapping file describing in a formal way how the semantic resources and the format are interrelated. As such, the validator provides a general solution to the common problem in data exchange: how to validate the correct usage of a data standard beyond simple XML Schema Definition validation.

These analysis strategies can help pinpoint protein modifications, splice and genomic variants of biological relevance. We demonstrated the application of these data analysis strategies using a bottom-up proteomics data set obtained in a drug profiling experiment. Furthermore, we have also observed that the presented methods are useful for studying peptide distributions from clinical proteomics samples from a large number of individuals.

        "abstract": "Current proteomics technology is limited in resolving the proteome complexity of biological systems. The main issue at stake is to increase throughput and spectra quality so that spatiotemporal dimensions, population parameters and the complexity of protein modifications on a quantitative scale can be considered. MS-based proteomics and protein arrays are the main players in large-scale proteome analysis and an integration of these two methodologies is powerful but presently not sufficient for detailed quantitative and spatiotemporal proteome characterization. Improvements of instrumentation for MS-based proteomics have been achieved recently resulting in data sets of approximately one million spectra which is a large step in the right direction. The corresponding raw data range from 50 to 100 Gb and are frequently made available. Multidimensional LC-MS data sets have been demonstrated to identify and quantitate 2000-8000 proteins from whole cell extracts. The analysis of the resulting data sets requires several steps from raw data processing, to database-dependent search, statistical evaluation of the search result, quantitative algorithms and statistical analysis of quantitative data. A large number of software tools have been proposed for the above-mentioned tasks. However, it is not the aim of this review to cover all software tools, but rather discuss common data analysis strategies used by various algorithms for each of the above-mentioned steps in a non-redundant approach and to argue that there are still some areas which need improvements.",

Although a large amount of data is generated by high throughput large-scale techniques, a connection of these mostly heterogeneous data from different analytical platforms and of different experiments is limited. Data mining procedures and algorithms are often insufficient to extract meaningful results from large datasets and therefore limit the exploitation of the generated biological information. In our proteomic core facility, which almost exclusively focuses on 2-DE/MS-based proteomics, we developed a proteomic database custom tailored to our needs aiming at connecting MS protein identification information to 2-DE derived protein expression profiles. The tools developed should not only enable an automatic evaluation of single experiments, but also link multiple 2-DE experiments with MS-data on different levels and thereby helping to create a comprehensive network of our proteomics data. Therefore the key feature of our ldquoPROTEOMERrdquo database is its high cross-referencing capacity, enabling integration of a wide range of experimental data. To illustrate the workflow and utility of the system, two practical examples are provided to demonstrate that proper data cross-referencing can transform information into biological knowledge.",

Proteomics 2011, 10, M110.000679), total hESC yield, prolonged self-renewal capacity (i.e.<12 days), and laborious procedure remain substantial hurdles for its conventional application in hESC studies. Here, we devised an enhanced SILAC culture system consisting of a new chemically defined SILAC-medium and a novel culture protocol. As a result, with much less culture maneuvers, approximately 40-fold greater hESCs were produced than the system reported previously. Moreover, the enhanced SILAC culture system was sufficient to support the self-renewal of hESCs for >60 days and was also highly reproducible. As such, it provides a new platform that can be readily adapted by general laboratory for further comprehensive SILAC-based proteomics analysis of hESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells.",

Here, we report a novel ethanol precipitation method (EPM) for HAPs depletion from total tuber proteins. Ethanol showed a dose-dependent effect on depletion of sporamin from sweet potato and patatin from potato tubers, respectively. The 50% ethanol was an optimal concentration. 2DE analysis of EPM-prepared sweet potato proteins also revealed enrichment of SPs in ethanol supernatant (ES) resulting in detection of new low-abundance proteins in ethanol pellet (EP), compared to total fraction. The ES fraction showed even higher trypsin inhibitor activity than total proteins, further showing the efficacy of EPM in enrichment of sporamin in ES fraction. Application of this method was demonstrated for comparative proteomics of two sweet potato cultivars (Hwang-geum and Ho-bac) and purification of SP (sporamin) in its native form, as examples. Comparative proteomics identified many cultivar specific protein spots and selected spots were confidently assigned for their protein identity using MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis. Overall, the EPM is simple, reproducible, and economical for depletion of SPs and is suitable for downstream proteomics study. This study opens a door for its potential application to other tuber crops or fruits rich in carbohydrates. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

We developed a novel protocol to both simplify isolation of nanoparticle bound proteins and improve reproducibility. LC-MS analysis identified and quantified 88 human plasma proteins associated with polystyrene nanoparticles consisting of three different surface chemistries and two sizes, as well as, for four different exposure times (for a total of 24 different samples). Quantitative comparison of relative protein abundances was achieved by spiking an 18O-labeled \"universal\" reference into each individually processed unlabeled sample as an internal standard, enabling simultaneous application of both label-free and isotopic labeling quantification across the entire sample set. Clustering analysis of the quantitative proteomics data resulted in distinctive patterns that classified the nanoparticles based on their surface properties and size. In addition, temporal data indicated that the formation of the stable protein corona was at equilibrium within 5min.

As a result, data in the low terabyte range have been migrated from Peptidome to PRIDE and made publicly available under experiment accessions 17 900-18 271, representing 54 projects, approximately 53 million mass spectra, approximately 10 million peptide identifications, approximately 650 000 protein identifications, approximately 1.1 million biologically relevant protein modifications, and 28 species, from more than 30 different labs.",

Indeed, metaanalysis of 15 recent papers that claim detection of >5000 protein groups reveals that the half-proteome analyses currently requires \u22485 h of chromatographic separation, while deeper analyses yield on average \u226420 new proteins per hour of chromatographic gradient. Therefore, a typical proteomics experiment consists of a \u201chigh-content\u201d part, with the detection rate of approximately 1000 proteins/h, and a \u201clow-content\u201d tail with much lower rate of discovery and respectively, lower cost efficiency.

The MWCO filter also enables sample concentration, thereby increasing the overall sensitivity, and implementation of washing steps involving organic solvents, for example, to remove cell membranes constituents.

Although analysis of gene expression at the mRNA level has enhanced our understanding of the response of plants to heavy metals, many questions regarding the functional translated portions of plant genomes under metal stress remain unanswered. Proteomics offers a new platform for studying complex biological functions involving large numbers and networks of proteins, and can serve as a key tool for revealing the molecular mechanisms that are involved in interactions between toxic metals and plant species. This review focuses on recent developments in the applications of proteomics to the analysis of the responses of plants to heavy metals; such studies provide a deeper understanding of protein responses and the interactions among the possible pathways that are involved in detoxification of toxic metals in plant cells. In addition, the challenges faced by proteomics in understanding the responses of plants to toxic metal are discussed, and some possible future strategies for meeting these challenges are proposed.",

One issue that crept up while discussing which data to store for the PPP concerns whether the raw, binary data coming from the mass spectrometers should be stored, or rather the more compact and already significantly processed peak lists. As this debate is not restricted to the PPP but relates to the proteomics community in general, we will attempt to detail the relative merits and caveats associated with centralized storage and dissemination of raw data and/or peak lists, building on the extensive experience gained during the PPP pilot phase.

But cellular resistance to chemotherapy is multifactorial and may be affected by the cell cycle stage and proliferation status, biochemical mechanisms such as detoxification, cellular drug transport, or DNA replication and repair mechanisms. Several laboratory techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, blotting, and fluorescent microscopy have been used for the identification of MDR markers and mechanisms.

In this study, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was employed to investigate the protein compositions of the adult testis of silkworm. A total of 14431 peptides were identified in the adult testis of B. mori, which were matched to 2292 proteins. Thirty-two heat shock proteins constitute a group of most abundant proteins in the adult testis, suggesting that they are critical for the development, differentiation and survival of germ cells. Other proteins in this analysis were also involved in testis-specific processes mainly including sperm motility, meiosis, germ cell development, and spermatogenesis.

The worms are nourished by a dense population of chemoautotrophic bacterial endosymbionts. Using the energy derived from sulfide oxidation, the symbionts fix CO(2) and produce organic carbon, which provides the nutrition of the host. Although the endosymbionts have never been cultured, cultivation-independent techniques based on density gradient centrifugation and the sequencing of their (meta-) genome enabled a detailed physiological examination on the proteomic level. In this study, the Riftia symbionts' soluble proteome map was extended to a total of 493 identified proteins, which allowed for an explicit description of vital metabolic processes such as the energy-generating sulfide oxidation pathway or the Calvin cycle, which seems to involve a reversible pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase. Furthermore, the proteomic view supports the hypothesis that the symbiont uses nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor. Finally, the membrane-associated proteome of the Riftia symbiont was selectively enriched and analyzed. As a result, 275 additional proteins were identified, most of which have putative functions in electron transfer, transport processes, secretion, signal transduction and other cell surface-related functions. Integrating this information into complex pathway models a comprehensive survey of the symbiotic physiology was established.",

Twenty-four hGH-containing proteins, with significantly different expression proportions of their isoforms were found. The proportions of isoforms were as follows: isoform 1 (87.5%) > isoform 2 (8.1%) > isoform 3 (3.3%) > isoform 4 (1.1%). Deamidation of asparagine to aspartate was identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight MS. Tandem mass spectrometry data demonstrated that hGH is a phosphoprotein (spot 6); phosphorylation was found at Ser-77 in the tryptic peptide (68)YSFLQNPQTSLCFSESIPTPSNR(90), at Ser-176 in the tryptic peptide (172)FDTNSHNDDALLK(184), and at Ser-132 in the peptide (126)SLVYGASDSNVYDLLK(141). The phosphorylation sites at Ser-77 and Ser-176 were consistent with computer-program predictions (NetPhos). These results provide novel clues for further studies of the functions, and mechanisms of action, of hGH in the human pituitary and in growth hormone-related diseases.",

We subsequently aimed to understand the molecular mechanisms of haustoria through a study of their proteome. Extracted proteins were digested using trypsin, separated by LC, and analysed by MS/MS. Searches of a custom Bgh EST sequence database and the NCBI-NR fungal protein database, using the MS/MS data, identified 204 haustoria proteins. The majority of the proteins appear to have roles in protein metabolic pathways and biological energy production. Surprisingly, pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), involved in alcoholic fermentation and commonly abundant in fungi and plants, was absent in our Bgh proteome data set. A sequence encoding this enzyme was also absent in our EST sequence database. Significantly, BLAST searches of the recently available Bgh genome sequence data also failed to identify a sequence encoding this enzyme, strongly indicating that Bgh does not have a gene for PDC.",

In the present study, we investigated the aging process in the ventral prostate (VP) of Noble rats by identifying differentially expressed prostate proteins between 3- and 16-month-old animals using ICAT and MS. In total, 472 proteins were identified with less than a 1% false positive rate, among which 34 were determined to have a greater than two-fold increase or 1.7-fold decrease in expression in the aged VPs versus their younger counterparts. The majority of the differentially expressed proteins identified have not been previously reported to be associated with prostate aging, and they fall into specific functional categories, including oxidative stress/detoxification, chaperones, protein biosynthesis, vesicle transport, and intracellular trafficking. The expression of GST, ferritin, clusterin, kininogen, oxygen regulated protein 150, spermidine synthase, ADP ribosylation factor, and cyclophilin B was verified by Western blot analyses on samples used for the ICAT study, as well as on those obtained from an independent group of animals comprised of three age groups.

We used a cell surface biotin-labeling in combination with differential centrifugation to enrich sperm surface proteins. Using nano-LC MS/MS, 338 proteins were confidently identified in the PM-enriched proteome. Functional categories of sperm-egg interaction, protein turnover, metabolism as well as molecular transport, spermatogenesis, and signal transduction were represented by proteins with high quantitative signal in our study. A highly significant degree of enrichment was found for transmembrane and PM-targeted proteins. Among them, we also report proteins previously not described on bovine sperm (CPQ, CD58, CKLF, CPVL, GLB1L3, and LPCAT2B) of which CPQ and CPVL cell surface localization was further validated.

However, in camelids, almost nothing is known about the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), the membrane surrounding fat globules in milk. The purpose of this study was thus to identify MFGM proteins from Camelus dromedarius milk. Major MFGM proteins (namely, fatty acid synthase, xanthine oxidase, butyrophilin, lactadherin, and adipophilin) already evidenced in cow milk were identified in camel milk using MS. In addition, a 1D-LC-MS/MS approach led us to identify 322 functional groups of proteins associated with the camel MFGM. Dromedary MFGM proteins were then classified into functional categories using DAVID (the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) bioinformatics resources. More than 50% of MFGM proteins from camel milk were found to be integral membrane proteins (mostly belonging to the plasma membrane), or proteins associated to the membrane. Enriched GO terms associated with MFGM proteins from camel milk were protein transport (p-value = 1.73 \u00d7 10(-14)), translation (p-value = 1.08 \u00d7 10(-11)), lipid biosynthetic process (p-value = 6.72 \u00d7 10(-10)), hexose metabolic process (p-value = 1.89 \u00d7 10(-04)), and actin cytoskeleton organization (p-value = 2.72 \u00d7 10(-04)). These findings will help to contribute to a better characterization of camel milk. Identified MFGM proteins from camel milk may also provide new insight into lipid droplet formation in the mammary epithelial cell.",

The latest version of the database also incorporates mass spectrometry-derived data including experimentally verified proteotypic peptides used for multiple reaction monitoring assays. Other novel features include published plasma/serum concentrations for 1278 proteins along with a separate category of plasma-derived extracellular vesicle proteins. As plasma proteins have become a major thrust in the field of biomarkers, we have enabled a batch-based query designated Plasma Proteome Explorer, which will permit the users in screening a list of proteins or peptides against known plasma proteins to assess novelty of their data set.

PFOA can be removed by repeated evaporation prior to mass spectrometry analysis. However, the removal of PFOA by evaporation is a lengthy process that takes approximately 6 h. Toward the goal of decreasing the length of time required to remove PFOA from protein digests, we tested the efficiency of PFOA removal and subsequent peptide recovery using strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography, hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), fluorous solid phase extraction (FSPE), and anion exchange (ANX) chromatography. We found that all these chromatographic techniques except ANX chromatography remove PFOA thoroughly from protein digest. Peptide recovery rates from the SCX chromatography varied widely; nonacidic peptides were recovered at a rate of up to 95%, while acidic peptides were recovered at a rate of less than 10%. On the other hand, acidic peptides were recovered well from HILIC, while peptides whose pIs are greater than 6 were recovered poorly. Peptide recovery using FSPE was considerably lower, less than 10% for most of the peptides. These results indicate that the SCX and HILIC chromatography provide a more rapid alternative to the evaporation method for applications in which recovery of entire set of peptides is not required.",

In this study, cell wall proteins (CWPs) of H. pluvialis were systematically analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) coupled with peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) and sequence-database analysis. In total, 163 protein bands were analyzed, which resulted in positive identification of 81 protein orthologues. The highly complex and dynamic composition of CWPs is manifested by the fact that the majority of identified CWPs are differentially expressed at specific stages of the cell cycle along with a number of common wall-associated 'housekeeping' proteins. The detection of cellulose synthase orthologue in the vegetative cells suggested that the biosynthesis of cellulose occurred during primary wall formation, in contrast to earlier observations that cellulose was exclusively present in the secondary wall of the organism. A transient accumulation of a putative cytokinin oxidase at the early stage of encystment pointed to a possible role in cytokinin degradation while facilitating secondary wall formation and/or assisting in cell expansion. This work represents the first attempt to use a proteomic approach to investigate CWPs of microalgae. The reference protein map constructed and the specific protein markers obtained from this study provide a framework for future characterization of the expression and physiological functions of the proteins involved in the biogenesis and modifications in the cell wall of Haematococcus and related organisms.",

Inhibitors of actin polymerization promote a significant disruption of FAND, indicating that they are compartments influenced by the organizational state of actin in the nucleus.

Other types of microarrays, though not fully developed, also show great potential in diagnostics, protein profiling, and drug identification and validation.

Therefore, in the present study, we used 2-D DIGE to evaluate the differential proteomic profiles of C. glabrata under planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. Candida glabrata biofilms were developed on polystyrene surfaces and age-matched planktonic cultures were obtained in parallel. Initially, biofilm architecture, viability, and antifungal susceptibility were evaluated. Differentially expressed proteins more than 1.5-fold in DIGE analysis were subjected to MS/MS. The transcriptomic regulation of these biomarkers was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. Candida glabrata biofilms were highly resistant to the antifungals and biocides compared with the planktonic mode of growth. Candida glabrata biofilm proteome when compared with its planktonic proteome showed upregulation of stress response proteins, while glycolysis enzymes were downregulated. Similar trend could be observed at transcriptomic level. In conclusion, C. glabrata biofilms possess higher amount of stress response proteins, which may potentially contribute to the higher antifungal resistance seen in C. glabrata biofilms.",

Data from all types of commonly used hybrid mass spectrometers can be simulated. The algorithms are based on empirically derived physicochemical liquid and gas phase models for proteins and peptides. Sample composition in terms of complexity and dynamic range, as well as chromatographic, experimental and MS conditions, can be controlled and adjusted independently. The effect of on-column amounts, gradient length, mass resolution and ion mobility on search specificity will be demonstrated using tryptic peptides from human and yeast cellular lysates simulated over five orders of magnitude in dynamic range. Initial justification of the simulated data sets is achieved by comparing and contrasting the in silico simulated data to experimentally derived results from a 48 protein mixture, spanning a similar magnitude of five orders of magnitude. Additionally, experimental data from replicate and dilutions series experiments will be utilized to determine error rates at the peptide and protein level with respect to mass, area, retention and drift time. The data presented reveal a high degree of similarity at the ion detection, peptide and protein level when analyzed under similar conditions.",

We examine the extent to which these approaches impinge upon a realistic understanding of human diseases, namely how close they come to revealing the causal events involved in the initiation of disease. While tissue sources from human embryogenesis, foetal development and the brain remain the absolute priority, the pragmatic approaches utilize judicious data integration from selected proteomic studies of model organisms. The role of genome-wide disease-related screens, \"humanized\" transgenic analyses, multigenerational gene interference methods, and analyses of post-translational modifications in epigenetic contexts from Drosophila will be crucial, since these avenues are far too slow and transgenically cumbersome in mammals.

A reliable and useful clinical biomarker must a) come from a readily attainable source, such as blood or urine, b) have sufficient sensitivity to correctly identify affected individuals, c) have sufficient specificity to avoid incorrect labeling of unaffected persons, and d) result in a notable benefit for the patient through intervention, such as survival or life quality improvement. Despite these critical descriptors, the few available FDA-approved biomarkers for cancer do not completely fit this definition and their benefits are limited to a small number of cancers. Ovarian cancer exemplifies the need for a diagnostic biomarker of early stage disease. Symptoms are present but not specific to the disease, delaying diagnosis until an advanced and generally incurable stage in over 70% of affected women. As such, diagnostic intervention in the form of oopherectomy can be performed in the appropriate at-risk population if identified such as with a new accurate, sensitive, and specific biomarker. If early stage disease is identified, the requirement for survival and life quality improvement will be met. One of the new technologies applied to biomarker discovery is tour-de-force analysis of serum peptides and proteins. Optimization of mass spectrometry techniques coupled with advanced bioinformatics approaches has yielded informative biomarker signatures discriminating presence of cancer from unaffected in multiple studies from different groups. Validation and randomized outcome studies are needed to determine the true value of these new biomarkers in early diagnosis, and improved survival and quality of life.",

Dual channel imaging and warping of 2-D protein gels were used to visualize global changes in the protein synthesis pattern of cells in response to osmotic stress (6% NaCl). Many vegetative enzymes were repressed in response to salt stress and derepressed after resumption of growth. The enzymes catalyzing the metabolic steps from glucose to 2-oxoglutarate, however, were almost constantly synthesized during salt stress despite the growth arrest. This indicates an enhanced need for the proline precursor glutamate. The synthesis of enzymes involved in sulfate assimilation and in the formation of Fe-S clusters was also induced, suggesting an enhanced need for the formation or repair of Fe-S clusters in response to salt stress. One of the most obvious changes in the protein synthesis profile can be followed by the very strong induction of the SigB regulon. Furthermore, members of the SigW regulon and of the PerR regulon, indicating oxidative stress after salt challenge, were also induced. This proteomic approach provides an overview of cell adaptation to an osmotic upshift in B. subtilis visualizing the most dramatic changes in the protein synthesis pattern.",

Cell line contamination is not an uncommon incident in laboratories handling more than one cell line and many reports have been made on cross contamination of mammalian cell lines. Although problems of misidentification and cross-contamination of fish cell lines have rarely been reported, these are issues of concern for cell culturists that can make scientific results and their reproducibility unreliable. Proper identification of cell lines is thus crucial and protocols for routine and rapid screening are preferred. Cytogenetic evaluation, DNA fingerprinting, microsatellite analysis and PCR methods have been published for inter-species identification of many cell lines, but discerning intra-species contamination has been challenging. More complex DNA fingerprinting and hybridization techniques coupled with isoenzyme analysis have been developed to discriminate intra-species contamination, however, these require complex and time consuming procedures to enable cell identification thus are difficult to apply for routine use. A simple proteomic approach has been made to identify several fish cell lines derived from tissues of the same or differing species. Protein expression signatures (PES) of the evaluated fish cell lines have been developed using 2-DE and image analysis. A higher degree of concordance was seen among cell lines derived from rainbow trout, than from other fish species. Similar concordance was seen in cells derived from the same tissues than from other tissues within the same species. These profiles have been saved in an electronic databank and could be made available to be used for discerning the origins of the various cell lines evaluated. This proteomic approach could thus serve as an additional, valuable and reliable technique for the identification of fish cell lines.",

Of the 93 proteins that were identified, a large proportion (60%) was released by calcium chloride. From bioinformatics analysis, it may be predicted that most of them (87 out of 93) had a signal peptide, whereas only six originated from the cytoplasm. Among the putative apoplastic proteins, a high proportion (67 out of 87) had a basic pI. Numerous glycoside hydrolases and proteins with interacting domains were identified, in agreement with the expected role of the extracellular matrix in polysaccharide metabolism and recognition phenomena.

A momosomic alien chromosome addition line of common wheat was used to produce the fine deletion lines. Endosperm and embryo proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and visualized by staining with Commassie Brilliant Blue, and gel images were analyzed with a computer assisted image analyzer. For the first time, fine gene locations of a few endosperm and embryo proteins were identified on the chromosome 1B. These proteins with their specific gene location on the chromosome can be used as protein markers in breeding programs for quality of wheat proteins. To identify wheat seed proteins and to understand their expression in relation to chromosome deletion, the feasibility of a new analytical approach based on isotope coded affinity tag labeling (ICAT) of peptides in tryptic digests followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has been described. Simplification of the complex tryptic digest prior to mass spectral analysis was performed by treating the samples with light and heavy ICAT labeling reagents. A clear separation of peptide fragment containing the light and heavy reagents was achieved in mass spectral analysis. Out of the 14 peptides detected by mass fragment analysis of the euploid, four were down-regulated, nine up-regulated and one did not show any change due to the terminal deletion of chromosome 1B. Selected peptide fragments were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis for sequence information and the resulting sequence information was submitted to databases for protein identification. Of the five proteins submitted, four were identified as alpha-amylase inhibitor, alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor precursor, proteasome subunit alpha-type 7 and 1,4 alpha-glucan-D-maltohydrolase. With this approach it is possible to identify wheat seed proteins and to understand their expression, which have been reported to be difficult by 2-DE due to cosynthesis of proteins by genes from three genomes, A, B and D.",

To link these function to specific or classes of proteins, identification of the aqueous humor proteome is essential. Aqueous humor obtained from healthy New Zealand white rabbits was analyzed using three synergistic protein separation methods: 1-D gel electrophoresis, 2-DE, and 1-DLC (RPLC) prior to protein identification by MS. As each of these separation methods separates intact proteins based on different physical properties (pIs, molecular weights, hydrophobicity, solubility, etc.) the proteome coverage is expanded. This was confirmed, since overlap between all three separation technologies was only about 8.2% with many proteins found uniquely by a single method. Although the most dominant protein presented in normal aqueous humor is albumin, by using this extensive separation/MS strategy, additional proteins were identified in total amount of 98 nonredundant proteins (plus an additional ten proteins for consideration). This expands the current protein identifications by approximately 65%. The aqueous humor proteome comprises a specific selection of cellular and plasma based proteins and can almost exclusively be divided into four functional groups: cell-cell interactions/wound healing, proteases and protease inhibitors, antioxidant protection, and antibacterial/anti-inflammatory proteins.",

Our 2-DE analysis showed 36 spots with significantly altered expression. Sixteen were identified by MALDI-TOF-PMF and peptide matching with Mus musculus databases. Identified proteins play different roles: cytoskeletal dynamics, proteolysis, biotransformation, oxidative-stress adaptation, and metabolism. Animals from different polluted environments showed contrasting differences in their proteomes, with specific increases and decreases in selected groups of proteins that seem to be co-ordinately regulated. Proteomic data were consistent with metal biomonitoring and conventional biomarker responses, indicating that DR (and PS/ARZ) animals sustained a heavier pollutant burden than SOL specimens and suffered a chronic oxidative stress. Whereas some protein expression differences may protect mice from pollutant toxicity, others should make them more susceptible. Transcript expression signatures agree with the documented lack of correlation between mRNA and protein levels. Nonetheless, a positive significant correlation was found between the gpx1 mRNA molecules and the intensity of one of the two identified GPX1 isospots.",

ASB-14 and Triton X-100 provided the best protein yields (n = 10) for anterior and posterior sclera. The spectrophotometric measurements for ASB-14 were not consistent with SDS-PAGE densitometry. A combination of 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Tween-20, and 0.1% Genapol C-100 was found optimal for extraction from sclera. Proteins from different regions of the eye are best extracted with different detergents. The pressure cycling technology provided superior extraction compared to the other methods. Additional aqueous-organic phase partitioning enables superior fractionation when compared to SDS-PAGE alone. Organic phase fractionation is compatible with MS and allowed identification of 34, 71, and 77 proteins respectively from anterior, posterior, and peripapillary sclera. The extraction strategy may affect the final outcome in protein profiling by MS or by other methods.",

It is now possible to examine the expression of more than 1000 proteins using mass spectrometry technology coupled with various separation methods. High-throughput yeast two-hybrid approaches and analysis of protein complexes using affinity tag purification have yielded valuable protein-protein interaction maps. Large-scale protein tagging and subcellular localization projects have provided considerable information about protein function. Finally, recent developments in protein microarray technology provide a versatile tool to study protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid, protein-lipid, enzyme-substrate, and protein-drug interactions. Other types of microarrays, though not fully developed, also show great potential in diagnostics, protein profiling, and drug identification and validation. This review discusses high-throughput technologies for proteome analysis and their applications. Also discussed are the approaches used for the integrated analysis of the voluminous sets of data generated by proteome analysis conducted on a global scale.",

        "abstract": "In this work, a novel approach based on proteomics is applied for the analysis of the three European marine mussel species: Mytilus edulis (ME), Mytilus galloprovincialis (MG) and Mytilus trossulus (MT), which are of interest in biotechnology and food industry. The proteomes of these species are poorly described in databases, are difficult to diagnose, and have a controversial taxonomy, To characterise species-specific peptides, we compared 51 matrix-assisted laser desorption/ioization-time of flight peptide mass maps generated from 6 random selected prominent spots derived from the two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis of foot protein extracts from several individuals. Minor species-specific differences in the peptide maps were detected in only one of the spots, corresponding to tropomyosin. Two peptides were unique to ME and MG individuals, whereas another peptide was present only in MT individuals. The sequence of these peptides was characterised by, nanoelectrospray ionization-ion trap (nanoESI-IT) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis followed by database searching and de novo sequence interpretation. We detected a single T to D amino acid substitution in MT tropomyosin. Unambiguous and highly-specific species identification was then demonstrated by analysing peptide extracts from tropomyosin spots by micro high-performande liquid chromatography (microHPL) ESI-IT mass spectrometry using the selected ion monitoring configuration, focused on these peptides, in continuous MS/MS operation. Our results suggest that proteomics may be successfully applied for the identification of species whose proteome is not present in databases.",

We used differential detergent fractionation-multidimensional protein identification technology (DDF-MudPIT) to identify 5198 proteins from all cellular compartments. Of these, 1753 were B cell specific, 1972 were stroma specific and 1473 were shared between the two. By modeling programmed cell death (PCD), cell differentiation and proliferation, and transcriptional activation, we have improved functional annotation of chicken proteins and placed chicken-specific death receptors into the PCD process using phylogenetics. We have identified 114 transcription factors (TFs); 42 of the bursal B cell TFs have not been reported before in any B cells. We have also improved the structural annotation of a newly sequenced genome by confirming the in vivo expression of 4006 \"predicted\", and 6623 ab initio, ORFs.

Membrane proteins comprise approximately 20\u201330% of all open reading frames, however they are typically under-represented in many liquid chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomics experiments due to their low abundance and poor solubility. To address these analytical challenges, various membrane protein enrichment, solubilization, digestion and fractionation strategies have been employed to further improve the coverage of the membrane systems while maintaining compatibility with MS detection. This review discusses both established and emerging high-throughput gel-free analytical workflows in membrane proteomics, and the inherent advantages, disadvantages and orthogonality of the various approaches. The issues of critical importance for successful LC-MS/MS detection such as detergent selection and minimizing ion suppression in detergent-based workflows are discussed in detail. Recent studies comparing the performance of different analytical strategies are highlighted in order to provide practical insight into the choice of the most appropriate method for membrane-centric applications ranging from cell surface biomarker discovery to membrane protein interaction network mapping.",

It enables the utilisation of the power of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) for the characterisation of the three-dimensional structures and corresponding dynamical features of proteins. The usual approach to obtain isotopically labelled protein molecules is by expressing the corresponding gene in bacterial or yeast host organisms, which grow on isotope-enriched media. This method has several drawbacks. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to fully label a plant with (15)N-isotopes. The advantage of in vivo labelling of higher organisms is that all constituting proteins are labelled and become available as functional, post-translationally modified, correctly folded proteins. A hydroponics set-up was used to create the first example of a uniformly (15)N-labelled (> 98%) plant species, the potato plant (Solanum tuberosum L., cv. Elkana). Two plants were grown at low costs using potassium-[(15)N]-nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. At harvest time, a total of 3.6 kg of potato tubers and 1.6 kg of foliage, stolons and roots were collected, all of which were fully (15)N-labelled. Gram quantities of soluble (15)N-labelled proteins (composed mainly of the glycoprotein patatin and Kunitz-type protease inhibitors) were isolated from the tubers. NMR results on the complete proteome of potato sap and on an isolated protease inhibitor illustrate the success of the labelling procedure. The presented method of isotope labelling is easily modified to label other plants. Its envisioned impact in the field of structural proteomics of plants is discussed.",

Furthermore, an exact understanding of the structure and morphology of drug carriers is fundamental to understand their role as gene delivery systems. In this work, the adsorption of human plasma proteins bound to cationic liposomes and to their relative DNA lipoplexes was compared. A shotgun proteomics approach based on HPLC coupled to high resolution MS was used for an efficient identification of proteins adsorbed onto liposome and lipoplex surfaces. The distinct pattern of proteins adsorbed helps to better understand the DNA compaction process. The experimental evidence leads us to hypothesize that polyanionic DNA is associated to the lipoplex surface and can interact with basic plasma proteins. Such a finding is in agreement with recent results showing that lipoplexes are multilamellar DNA/lipid domains partially decorated with DNA at their surface. Proteomics experiments showed that the lipoplex corona is rich of biologically relevant proteins such as fibronectin, histones and complement proteins. Our results provide novel insights to understand how lipoplexes activate the immune system and why they are rapidly cleared from the blood stream. The differences in the protein adsorption data detected in the presented experiments could be the basis for the establishment of a correlation between protein adsorption pattern and in vivo fate of intravenously administered nanoparticles and will require some consideration in the future.",

Herein, we propose an approach to the cell-surface molecular interactome by using combination of this EMARS reaction and MS-based proteomics techniques. In the current study, we employed a novel labeling reagent, fluorescein-conjugated arylazide. The fluorescein-tagged proteins resulting from the EMARS reaction were directly detected in the electrophoresis gels with a fluorescence image analyzer. These products were also purified and concentrated by immunoaffinity chromatography with anti-fluorescein antibody-immobilized resins. The purified fluorescein-tagged proteins were subsequently subjected to an MS-based proteomics analysis. Analysis using HRP-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B, which recognizes a lipid raft marker, ganglioside GM1, revealed 30 membrane and secreted proteins that were candidates for the cell-surface molecules coclustering with GM1. The proposed approach will provide a clue to study functional molecular interactions in a variety of biological events on the cell surface.",

The suspension trapping method combines the advantage of efficient SDS-based protein extraction with rapid detergent removal, reactor-type protein digestion, and peptide cleanup. Proteins are solubilized in SDS. The sample is acidified and introduced into the suspension trapping tip incorporating the depth filter and hydrophobic compartments, filled with the neutral pH methanolic solution. The instantly formed fine protein suspension is trapped in the depth filter stack-this crucial step is aimed at separating the particulate matter in space. SDS and other contaminants are removed in the flow-through, and a protease is introduced. Following the digestion, the peptides are cleaned up using the tip's hydrophobic part. The methodology allows processing of protein loads down to the low microgram/submicrogram levels. The detergent removal takes about 5 min, whereas the tryptic proteolysis of a cellular lysate is complete in as little as 30 min. We have successfully utilized the method for analysis of cellular lysates, enriched membrane preparations, and immunoprecipitates. We expect that due to its robustness and simplicity, the method will become an essential proteomics tool.",

Lavage fluid proteins from normal and asthmatic mice were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. A total of 28 protein spots were significantly altered. Several of these proteins were undetectable or at very low levels in normal mice but were significantly increased in airway inflammation. These include lungkine, a recently described chemokine, a family of chitinases including Ym1, Ym2, and acidic mammalian chitinase, gob-5, a protein that mediates mucus secretion, and surfactant protein-D, a C-type lectin capable of modulating inflammatory responses. Overall, proteomics is a powerful tool in unraveling protein expression changes in allergic airway inflammation. The proteins identified in this study may be associated with the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation and may also be found useful as surrogate biomarkers for asthma.",

The activity of protein kinase PKC\u03b4/\u03b8 was inhibited by GKN1, whereas the activity of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 was increased by GKN1, suggesting that GKN1 induced growth inhibition of gastric cancer cells by synergistically regulating the activity of these protein kinases. Seventy-four proteins were found to be regulated by GKN1 by proteomics analysis, including \u03b1-enolase (ENO1) and Cathepsin D. Interestingly, ENO1 is an important hub in the protein-protein interaction network of the 74 differential proteins. Silencing of ENO1 resulted in growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest of gastric cancer cells, similar to the effect of GKN1 overexpression in cells, whereas ENO1 overexpression blocked GKN1-induced growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest. These observations suggested that ENO1 downregulation played an important role in GKN1-induced growth inhibition of gastric cancer cells.",

The probability of identification of the proteins interacting with PP2Ac was increased by searching proteins differently interacting with PP2Ac according to stimulation of Wnt3a, which regulates both the Wnt/beta-catenin and the ERK pathways. Around 100 proteins, pulled-down by His-tagged PP2Ac, were identified in 2-D gels stained with CBB. By MALDI-TOF-MS analyses of 45 protein spots, we identified several proteins that were previously known to interact with PP2A, such as Axin and CaMK IV. In addition, we also identified many proteins that potentially interact with PP2Ac.

We demonstrate, using data sets of protein standards acquired on a variety of mass spectrometers, that SINQ can rapidly provide useful estimates of the absolute quantity of proteins present in a medium-complexity sample. In addition, relative quantitation of standard proteins spiked into a complex lysate background and run without pre-fractionation produces accurate results at amounts above 1 fmol on column. We compare quantitation performance to various precursor intensity- and identification-based methods, including the normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF), exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI), MaxQuant, and Progenesis LC-MS. We anticipate that the SINQ tool will be a useful asset for core facilities and individual laboratories that wish to produce quantitative MS data, but lack the necessary manpower to routinely support more complicated software workflows.

In this study, we used two proteomics approaches, namely label-free shotgun proteomics based on SDS-PAGE gel separation and gas phase fractionation, to investigate the heavy metal stress responses of Sydney rock oysters. Protein samples were prepared from haemolymph of oysters exposed to 100 \u03bcg/L of PbCl(2), CuCl(2), or ZnCl(2) for 4 days in closed aquaria. Peptides were identified using a Bivalvia protein sequence database, due to the unavailability of a complete oyster genome sequence. Statistical analysis revealed 56 potential biomarker proteins, as well as several protein biosynthetic pathways to be greatly impacted by metal stress. These have the potential to be incorporated into bioassays for prevention and monitoring of heavy metal pollution in Australian oyster beds. The study confirms that proteomic analysis of biomonitoring species is a promising approach for assessing the effects of environmental pollution, and our experiments have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying oyster stress responses.",

        "abstract": "Despite recent developments in bottom-up proteomics, the need still exists in a fast, uncomplicated, and robust method for comprehensive sample processing especially when applied to low protein amounts. The suspension trapping method combines the advantage of efficient SDS-based protein extraction with rapid detergent removal, reactor-type protein digestion, and peptide cleanup. Proteins are solubilized in SDS. The sample is acidified and introduced into the suspension trapping tip incorporating the depth filter and hydrophobic compartments, filled with the neutral pH methanolic solution. The instantly formed fine protein suspension is trapped in the depth filter stackthis crucial step is aimed at separating the particulate matter in space. SDS and other contaminants are removed in the flow-through, and a protease is introduced. Following the digestion, the peptides are cleaned up using the tip's hydrophobic part. The methodology allows processing of protein loads down to the low microgram/submicrogram levels. The detergent removal takes about 5 min, whereas the tryptic proteolysis of a cellular lysate is complete in as little as 30 min. We have successfully utilized the method for analysis of cellular lysates, enriched membrane preparations, and immunoprecipitates. We expect that due to its robustness and simplicity, the method will become an essential proteomics tool.",

We critically reviewed differentially expressed proteins from comparative proteomic studies identified by 2-DE followed by MS, especially with MALDI technique. Based on 66 of those studies, a list of 44 proteins is presented as generally detected proteins regardless of species, in vivo or in vitro conditions, tissues and organs, and experimental objective. Similarly, a list of 28 generally detected protein families is presented. The enriched functions linked to these generally detected proteins reveal that there are some common biological features beyond the technical limitations. Cellular stress response can be the universal reason as to why these proteins are generally expressed differentially. Using those proteins as biomarkers for cellular processes other than stress response should be done with caution. In future proteomic studies more profound approaches should be applied to look beyond these proteins to find specific biomarkers. Our results are discussed in relation to a recent viewpoint publication by Petrak et al. [Proteomics 2008, 8, 1744-1749].",

Proteins that are expressed at a particular cell state or in a particular compartment as well as proteins with differential expression between various cells states are commonly delivered by many proteomics studies. Once a list of proteins is derived, a major challenge is to interpret the identified set of proteins in the biological context. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) data represents abundant information that can be employed for this purpose. However, these data have not yet been fully exploited due to the absence of a methodological framework that can integrate this type of information. Here, we propose to infer a network model from an experimentally identified protein list based on the available information about the topology of the global PPI network. We propose to use a Monte Carlo simulation procedure to compute the statistical significance of the inferred models. The method has been implemented as a freely available web-based tool, PPI spider (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/ppispider). To support the practical significance of PPI spider, we collected several hundreds of recently published experimental proteomics studies that reported lists of proteins in various biological contexts. We reanalyzed them using PPI spider and demonstrated that in most cases PPI spider could provide statistically significant hypotheses that are helpful for understanding of the protein list.",

We identified proteins recruited after irradiation in nucleoids of Deinococcus radiodurans and Deinococcus deserti by means of comparative proteomics. Proteins in nucleoid-enriched fractions from unirradiated and irradiated Deinococcus were identified and semiquantified by shotgun proteomics. The ssDNA-binding protein SSB, DNA gyrase subunits GyrA and GyrB, DNA topoisomerase I, RecA recombinase, UvrA excinuclease, RecQ helicase, DdrA, DdrB, and DdrD proteins were found in significantly higher amounts in irradiated nucleoids of both Deinococcus species. We observed, by immunofluorescence microscopy, the subcellular localization of these proteins in D. radiodurans, showing for the first time the recruitment of the DdrD protein into the D. radiodurans nucleoid. We specifically followed the kinetics of recruitment of RecA, DdrA, and DdrD to the nucleoid after irradiation. Remarkably, RecA proteins formed irregular filament-like structures 1 h after irradiation, before being redistributed throughout the cells by 3 h post-irradiation. Comparable dynamics of DdrD localization were observed, suggesting a possible functional interaction between RecA and DdrD. Several proteins involved in nucleotide synthesis were also seen in higher quantities in the nucleoids of irradiated cells, indicative of the existence of a mechanism for orchestrating the presence of proteins involved in DNA metabolism in nucleoids in response to massive DNA damage.

We characterized post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histone H3 N-terminal tails at eight time points during the C. elegans lifecycle, including embryo, larval stages (L1 to L4), dauer and L1/L4 post dauer. Histones were analyzed by our optimized middle-down protein sequencing platform using high mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry. This allows quantification of intact histone tails and detailed characterization of distinct histone tails carrying co-occurring PTMs. We measured temporally distinct combinatorial PTM profiles during C. elegans development. We show that the doubly modified form H3K23me3K27me3, which is rare or non-existent in mammals, is the most abundant PTM in all stages of C. elegans lifecycle. The abundance of H3K23me3 increased during development and it was mutually exclusive of the active marks H3K18ac, R26me1 and R40me1, suggesting a role for H3K23me3 in silent chromatin. We observed distinct PTM profiles for normal L1 larvae and for L1-post dauer larvae, or L4 and L4 post-dauer, suggesting that histone PTMs mediate an epigenetic memory that is transmitted during dauer formation. Collectively, our data describe the dynamics of histone H3 combinatorial code during C. elegans lifecycle and demonstrate the feasibility of using middle-down proteomics to study in vivo development of multicellular organisms.

However, limited treatment options are available for advanced melanoma and this is further compounded by the development of resistance toward existing drugs. Panduratin A (PA), a cyclohexanyl chalcone found in Boesenbergia rotunda, was investigated for its cytotoxic potentials against human malignant melanoma A375 cells. Our initial findings revealed that mitochondrion is the primary acting site of PA on A375 cancer cells and the cytotoxic mechanisms of PA were further investigated using a temporal quantitative proteomics approach by iTRAQ 2D-LC-MS/MS. Comprehensive proteomics analysis identified 296 proteins that were significantly deregulated in PA-treated A375 cells and revealed the involvement of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, secretory and ER stress pathway, and apoptosis. We further confirmed that the PA-induced apoptosis was mediated by prolonged ER stress at least in part via the PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4/CHOP pathway. Pretreatment with cycloheximide, an ER stress inhibitor rescued PA-induced cell death, which was accompanied by the suppression of ER-stress-related HSPA5 and CHOP proteins. The present study provides comprehensive mechanistic insights into the cytotoxic mechanisms of PA.",

However, limitations of existing technologies have made obtaining these secretomes for analysis extremely difficult. Here we employed an in vivo sampling technique using capillary ultrafiltration (CUF) probes to collect secretomes directly from tumor masses. Mass spectrometric proteomics approaches were then used to identify the tumor secretomes. A UV-induced skin fibrosarcoma cell line (UV-2240) was subcutaneously injected into C3H/NeH mice, resulting in tumor masses that initially progressed, then regressed and eventually eradicated. We then implanted CUF probes into tumor masses at the progressive and regressive stage. Five secreted proteins (cyclophilin-A, S100A4, profilin-1, thymosin beta 4 and 10), previously associated with tumor progression, were identified from tumor masses at the progressive stage. Five secreted proteins including three protease inhibitors (fetuin-A, alpha-1 antitrypsin 1-6, and contrapsin) were identified from tumor masses at the regressive stage. The technique involving CUF probes linked to mass spectrometric proteomics reinforces systems biology studies of cell-cell interactions and is potentially applicable to the discovery of in vivo biomarkers in human disease.",

Remobilisation of N and leaf senescence status were followed using (15)N tracing, patterns of chlorophyll level, total protein content and a molecular indicator based on expression of senescence-associated gene 12/Cab genes. Three phases associated with N remobilisation were distinguished. Proteomics revealed that 55 proteins involved in metabolism, energy, detoxification, stress response, proteolysis and protein folding, were significantly induced during N remobilisation. Four proteases were specifically identified. FtsH, a chloroplastic protease, was induced transiently during the early stages of N remobilisation. Considering the dynamics of N remobilisation, chlorophyll and protein content, the pattern of FtsH expression indicated that this protease could be involved in the degradation of chloroplastic proteins. Aspartic protease increased at the beginning of senescence and was maintained at a high level, implicating this protease in proteolysis during the course of leaf senescence. Two proteases, proteasome beta subunit A1 and senescence-associated gene 12, were induced and continued to increase during the later phase of senescence, suggesting that these proteases are more specifically involved in the proteolysis processes occurring at the final stages of leaf senescence.",

We have extended this application of peptide trainer kits to not only build SRM methods but to facilitate real-time elution profile characterization that enables automated adjustment of the scheduled detection windows. Incorporation of dynamic retention time adjustments better facilitate targeted assays lasting several days without the need for constant supervision. This paper provides an overview of how the dynamic retention correction approach identifies and corrects for commonly observed LC variations.

However, most of these are non-valid resulting from multiple causes other than interaction with the bait protein. To discriminate true interactors from off-target recognition, we propose to differentially include an (peptide) antigen during the antibody incubation in the immuno-precipitation experiment. This contrasts the specific antibody-bait protein interactions, versus all other off-target protein interactions. To exemplify the power of the approach, we studied the DMXL2 interactome. From the initial six immuno-precipitations, we identified about 600 proteins. When filtering for interactors present in all anti-DMXL2 antibody immuno-precipitation experiments, absent in the bead controls, and competed off by the peptide antigen, this hit list is reduced to ten proteins, including known and novel interactors of DMXL2. Together, our approach enables the use of a wide range of available antibodies in large-scale protein interaction proteomics, while gaining specificity of the interactions.",

Thus, normalization of peak intensities across an LC-MS proteomics dataset is a fundamental step in pre-processing. However, the downstream analysis of LC-MS proteomics data can be dramatically affected by the normalization method selected. Current normalization procedures for LC-MS proteomics data are presented in the context of normalization values derived from subsets of the full collection of identified peptides. The distribution of these normalization values is unknown a priori. If they are not independent from the biological factors associated with the experiment the normalization process can introduce bias into the data, possibly affecting downstream statistical biomarker discovery. We present a novel approach to evaluate normalization strategies, which includes the peptide selection component associated with the derivation of normalization values. Our approach evaluates the effect of normalization on the between-group variance structure in order to identify the most appropriate normalization methods that improve the structure of the data without introducing bias into the normalized peak intensities.",

The experimental proteomics data of H. pylori comprising 567 proteins (protein coverage: 36.6%) were stored in the Proteome Database System for Microbial Research (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE/), which gives access to raw mass spectra (MALDI-TOF/TOF) in T2D format, as well as to text files of peak lists. For data mining the protein mapping and comparison tool PROMPT (http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/prompt/) was used. The percentage of proteins with transmembrane regions, relative to all proteins detected, was 0, 0.2, 0, 0.5, 3.8 and 6.3% for 2-DE, Supprot, Startline, Sephadex, Pellet, and Etalon, respectively. 2-DE does not separate membrane proteins because they are insoluble in 9 M urea/70 mM DTT and 2% CHAPS. SDS solubilizes a considerable portion of the urea-insoluble proteins and makes them accessible for separation by SDS-PAGE and LC. The 2-DE/MS analysis with urea-solubilized proteins and the 1-DE-LC/MS analysis with the urea-insoluble protein fraction (Pellet) are complementary procedures in the pursuit of a complete proteome analysis. Access to the PROMPT-generated diagrams in the Proteome Database allows the mining of experimental data with respect to other functional aspects.",

The results showed that peptide losses can be reduced with low ACN concentration in washing buffers resulting in a recovery rate of approximately 82%. Furthermore, the effects of ACN concentration and loading amount on the properties of identified peptides were also evaluated. We found that the dynamic-binding capacity of the column was approximately 26 \u03bcg. With increased loading amounts, more hydrophilic peptides were replaced by hydrophobic peptides.",

For three of the spots, the expression patterns were confirmed by Western blotting analysis.

We have found that the acetylation efficiency varies markedly on account of different reactive systems, and demonstrated that stable isotope labeling can be steadily obtained with in-gel digested peptides under optimized conditions. We use this protocol to quantify some proteins of two kinds of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, non-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cells, Hep3B, and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cells, MHCC97-H.

We quantified \u223c6000 proteins in each tissue, but significant protein-level alterations were minimal with inhibitor treatment.

From kidney tissue, we enriched phosphopeptides using titanium dioxide (TiO2 ) and quantified 10\u00a0562 phosphorylation events. Further analysis by phosphotyrosine peptide immunoprecipitation quantified an additional 592 phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation motif analysis revealed that the inhibitors decreased phosphorylation levels of proline-x-serine-proline (PxSP) and serine-proline (SP) sites, consistent with extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibition. The MEK inhibitors had the greatest decrease on the phosphorylation of two proteins, Barttin and Slc12a3, which have roles in ion transport and fluid balance.

        "abstract": "Neurokinin B (NKB) has recently been demonstrated to be secreted from the placenta in abnormally high amounts in preeclampsia (PE) and to cause hypertension in rats, suggesting it may be a mediator of some pathophysiological features of PE. It is also known that NKB receptors exist in the placenta. To determine the effect of high levels of NKB on the placenta, we have performed proteomics on five separate preparations of cultured purified human term cytotrophoblast cells. The results showed a statistically significant decrease in 20 proteins, of which five were unknown proteins. Proteins important in antioxidant defenses that decreased were thioredoxin, cyclophilin A, cytokeratin 1, and peroxiredoxin 5. Two proteins that inhibit intravascular anticoagulation, cytokeratin 1 and annexin 11 were also decreased. Pathways involving pro-inflammatory cytokine activation of NF-kappa B are opposed by Raf kinase inhibitor protein, which was also decreased. Cofilin 1, a protein involved in defense against bacteria, was also decreased. Among other proteins that were suppressed by NKB were proteasome proteins, desmoplakin, and calgizzarin. Western blots confirmed the decrease in cytokeratin 1 and cyclophilin A protein after NKB exposure. In PE, there is reduced antioxidant activity and increased intravascular coagulation. The findings that high levels of NKB, similar to those observed in PE, can impair these two classes of activity support the hypothesis that high NKB levels may contribute to the pathogenesis of PE.",

The complex relationship of rabies virus (RV) with the host leads to its replication and spreading toward the neural network, where viral pathogenic effects appeared as neuronal dysfunction. In order to better understand the molecular basis of this relationship, a proteomics study on baby hamster kidney cells infected with challenge virus standard strain of RV was performed. This cell line is an in vitro model for rabies infection and is commonly used for viral seed preparation. The direct effect of the virus on cellular protein machinery was investigated by 2-DE proteome mapping of infected versus control cells followed by LC-MS/MS identification. This analysis revealed significant changes in expression of 14 proteins, seven of these proteins were viral and the remaining were host proteins with different known functions: cytoskeletal (capping protein, vimentin), anti-oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase), regulatory (Stathmin), and protein synthesis (P0). Despite of limited changes appeared upon rabies infection, they present a set of interesting biochemical pathways for further investigation on viral-host interaction.",

However label-free approaches have considerably higher demands in respect of repeatability of sample preparation and fractionation than multiplexing isotope labeling-based strategies. OFFGEL fractionation promises the necessary separation efficiency and repeatability. To test this platform, 12-fraction peptide OFFGEL electrophoresis and online reversed-phase LC connected to a quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer were used to determine differences of the physiological, pathological and biochemical distinct extraocular muscle allotype in comparison to hind-limb muscle. Close to 70% of the peptides separated by OFFGEL electrophoresis were detected only in a single fraction. To determine the separation repeatability of four samples, we compared the ion volumes of multiple peptides deriving from the thick filament-associated protein titin over several fractions and determined a coefficient of variation below 20%. Of the 474 proteins identified, 61 proteins were differently expressed between the two muscle allotypes and were involved in metabolism, muscle contraction, stress response, or gene expression. Several expression differences were validated using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. We therefore consider peptide OFFGEL fractionation an effective and efficient addition to our label-free quantitative proteomics workflow.",

However, the mechanism by which hyperglycemia inflicts this damage on the structure and function of the heart is unclear. In this study, we examined the relationship between proteome alterations, mitochondrial function, and major biochemical and electrophysiological changes affecting cardiac performance during simulated short-term hyperglycemia. Two-dimensional comparative proteomics analysis of rat hearts perfused with glucose at high (30 mM) or control (5.5 mM) levels revealed that glucose loading alters cardiomyocyte proteomes. It increased expression levels of initial enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and of enzymes of fatty acid beta-oxidation, with consequent up-regulation of enzymes of mitochondrial electron transport. It also markedly decreased expression of enzymes of glycolysis and the final steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Glucose loading increased the rate of Bax-independent apoptosis. High glucose increased the duration of the action potential and elevated level of intracellular cytoplasmic calcium. Surprisingly, glucose loading did not influence levels of nitric oxide or mitochondrial superoxide in isolated cardiomyocytes. In summary, short-term simulated hyperglycemia attenuated expression of many anti-apoptotic proteins. This effect was apparently mediated via alterations in multiple biochemical pathways that collectively increased apoptotic susceptibility.",

Quantitative 2-DE was used to determine the changing protein levels with MALDI-TOF MS identification of proteins. Of the 154 proteins analysed, 13 proteins were significantly altered as a result of the apoptotic stimulus; ten of the proteins showed an increase in level with STS and were identified as heat shock cognate 71 (Hsc71), two isoforms of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), F-actin capping protein, stress-induced phosphoprotein 1, chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1), protein disulphide isomerase A3 (PDI A3) precursor, transitional ER ATPase and actin interacting protein 1 (AIP 1). Three proteins which displayed significant decrease in levels with STS were identified as tubulin, vimentin and glucose regulated protein 94 (GRP94).

Chimeric mRNAs constitute an alternative source of protein diversity, which can be generated either by chromosomal translocations or by trans-splicing events. The occurrence of chimeric mRNAs and proteins is a frequent event in cells from the immune system and cancer cells, mainly as a consequence of gene rearrangements. Recent reports support that chimeric proteins may also be expressed at low levels under normal physiological circumstances, thus, representing a novel source of protein diversity. Notably, recent publications demonstrate that chimeric protein products can be successfully identified through bottom-up proteomic analyses. Several questions remain unsolved, such as the physiological role and impact of such chimeric proteins or the potential occurrence of chimeric proteins in higher eukaryotic organisms different from humans. The occurrence of chimeric proteins certainly seems to be another unforeseen source of complexity for the proteome. It may be a process to take in mind not only when performing bottom-up proteomic analyses in cancer studies but also in general bottom-up proteomics experiments.",

        "abstract": "A proteomics approach has been used to study changes in protein abundance during leaf senescence in white clover. Changes in cell ultrastructure were also examined using transmission electron microscopy. The most obvious ultrastructural changes during senescence occurred in chloroplasts, with progressive loss of thylakoid integrity and accumulation of osmiophilic globules in the stroma. Quantitative analysis of 590 leaf protein spots separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis indicated that approximately 40% of the spots showed significant senescence related changes in abundance. Approximately one-third of the protein spots present in mature green leaves were also visible by two-dimensional electrophoresis of an isolated chloroplast fraction, and these spots represented a major proportion of the proteins showing senescence related declines in abundance. Chloroplast proteins that were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass fingerprinting included rubisco large and small subunits, a rubisco activase and the 33 kDa protein of the photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex. These proteins declined in abundance late in senescence, indicating that the photosynthetic apparatus was being degraded. A chloroplast glutamine synthetase showed partial decline in abundance during late senescence but was maintained at levels that may support provision of glutamine for export to other tissues. The results emphasise the importance of proteolysis, chloroplast degradation and remobilisation of nitrogen in leaf senescence.",

        "abstract": "The large-scale resolution and detection of proteins from complex native mixtures is fundamental to quantitative proteomic analyses. Comprehensive analyses depend on careful tissue handling and quantitative protein extraction and assessment. To most effectively link these analyses with an understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms, it is critical that all protein types - isoforms, splice variants, and those with functionally important post-translational modifications - are quantitatively extracted with high reproducibility. Methodological details concerning protein extraction and resolution using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) are discussed with reference to current in-gel protein detection limits. We confirm a significant increase in total protein, and establish that extraction, resolution, and detection of phospho- and glycoproteins are improved following automated frozen disruption relative to manual homogenisation. The quality of 2DE protein resolution is established using third-dimension separations and 'deep imaging;' substantially more proteins/protein species than previously realized are actually resolved by 2DE. Thus, the key issue for effective proteome analyses is most likely to be detection, not resolution. Thus, these systematic methodological and technical advances further solidify the role of 2DE in top-down proteomics. By routinely assessing as much proteomic data from a sample as possible, 2DE enables more detailed and critical insights into molecular mechanisms underlying different physiological states.

In this study, we used SILAC-based quantitative proteomics to globally identify the genes regulated by miR-373. Totally, 3666 proteins were identified, and 335 proteins were found to be regulated by miR-373. Among the 192 proteins that were downregulated by miR-373, 27 (14.1%) were predicted to have at least one potential match site at their 3'-UTR for miR-373 seed sequence. However, miR-373 did not affect the mRNA level of the five selected candidate targets, TXNIP, TRPS1, RABEP1, GRHL2 and HIP1, suggesting that the protein expressions were regulated by miR-373 via translational inhibition instead of mRNA degradation. Luciferase and mutation assays validated that TXNIP and RABEP1 were the direct target genes of miR-373.

To characterize aromatic group-specific proteins, we compared 2-D gels of aromatic rice to nonaromatic rice using PDQUEST image analysis.

To investigate the mechanism of increased pathogenicity for H9N2 AIV PB2 627K, we analyzed the difference in mouse lung proteins expression response to PB2 K627E. By iTRAQ method, we found that the mutated K627E contributed to a set of differentially expressed lung proteins, including five upregulated proteins and nine downregulated proteins at 12 h postinfection; ten upregulated proteins and 25 downregulated proteins at 72 h postinfection. These proteins were chiefly involved within the cytoskeleton and motor proteins, antiviral proteins, regulation of glucocorticoids signal-associated proteins, pro- and anti-inflammatory proteins. Alteration of moesin, FKBP4, Hsp70, ezrin, and pulmonary surfactant protein A (sp-A) may play important roles in increasing virulence and decreasing lungs antiviral response. Further, three upregulated proteins (moesin, ezrin, and sp-A) caused by PB2 K627E were also confirmed in A549 cells. Moreover, overexpression of sp-A in A549 inhibited virus replication and downregulation promoted virus replication.

Porcine OxyMb was incubated with HNE and analyzed for metmyoglobin (MetMb) formation. MetMb formation was greater in the presence of HNE than controls at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C (p <0.05). MALDI-TOF MS was used to identify adduct formation; only mono-adducts of HNE (via Michael addition) with porcine Mb were detected. LC-ESI-MS/MS identified three histidine (HIS) residues in porcine Mb that were readily adducted by HNE (HIS 24, 36 and 119), whereas in bovine Mb seven histidine residues (HIS 24, 36, 81, 88, 93, 119 and 152) were adducted. Quantitation of HNE-adducted peptides using isotope-labeled phenyl isocyanate indicated that, initially, HIS 36 was preferentially adducted in porcine Mb whereas HIS 81, 88 and 93 were the predominant sites of early HNE adduction in bovine Mb. Preferential HNE adduction at the proximal histidine (HIS 93) was observed exclusively in bovine OxyMb and may explain why lipid oxidation-induced OxyMb oxidation appears more extensive in beef, than in pork.",

Further, 2-D analysis of the kaempferol-treated osteoblast lysates revealed 18 differentially expressed proteins (nine upregulated and nine downregulated) on the basis of >/<2.0-fold as cut-off (p<0.01) that were then identified by MALDI-TOF MS.

Proteomics data were confirmed by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR by randomly selecting two upregulated and two downregulated proteins. Western blot analysis confirmed upregulation of HSP-70 and cytokeratin-14 levels, and downregulation of aldose reductase and caldesmon expression. We further demonstrated that kaempferol treatment inhibits aldose reductase activity in osteoblasts indicating an altered cellular metabolism by decelerating polyol pathway that was associated with the kaempferol-induced osteoblast mineralization.

These proteins included surfactant-associated proteins (SP-A and SP-D), inflammatory proteins (complement component 3, immunoglobulins, lysozyme, etc.), growth factors (e.g., transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha)), calcium-binding proteins (calcyclin, calgranulin A, calreticulin, and calvasculin), and other proteins (e.g., cathepsin D, saposin, and intestinal trefoil factor). To further evaluate changes in protein levels, a simple quantitative strategy was developed in this study. A large decrease in protein levels of SP-A and SP-D (0.24- and 0.38-fold, respectively) following exposure was observed. In contrast, protein levels of TGF-alpha and calcium-binding proteins were significantly increased (4.46- and 1.4-1.8-fold, respectively). Due to the diverse functions of these proteins, the results might contribute to understand the mechanisms involved in lung disorders induced by oil mist exposure.",

However, autoantibodies normally exist in sera of healthy individuals and are enormously diversified. To explore the reservoir of autoantibody in healthy population, we performed a proteomics investigation of autoantibody profiles in the sera of 36 healthy Chinese individuals from Beijing, which may provide valuable reference information to the identification of disease-specific autoantibodies. The results showed that autoantibody profiles varied individually, but some autoantibodies were identified at a high frequency in the healthy population. The autoantibodies against alpha-enolase and those against heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L were positive in more than 50% of the sera samples. The autoantibodies identified in more than 20% of samples included those against annexin II, F-actin capping protein beta subunit and calreticulin. Some of these autoantibodies have been previously reported to be involved in autoimmune conditions and cancers. Autoantibodies in the healthy population are important as a foundation from which disease-specific autoantibodies can be defined. Thus our report on autoantibodies in healthy individuals may be useful as a reference for defining new autoantibody biomarkers.",

Current computational methods for the prediction of GPI-APs are sensitive and specific; however, the analysis of the processing site (omega- or omega-site) of GPI-APs is still challenging. Only 10% of the proteins that are annotated as GPI-APs have the omega-site experimentally verified. We describe an integrated computational and experimental proteomics approach for the identification and characterization of GPI-APs that provides the means to identify GPI-APs and the derived GPI-anchored peptides in LC-MS/MS data sets. The method takes advantage of sequence features of GPI-APs and the known core structure of the GPI-anchor. The first stage of the analysis encompasses LC-MS/MS based protein identification. The second stage involves prediction of the processing sites of the identified GPI-APs and prediction of the corresponding terminal tryptic peptides. The third stage calculates possible GPI structures on the peptides from stage two. The fourth stage calculates the scores by comparing the theoretical spectra of the predicted GPI-peptides against the observed MS/MS spectra. Automated identification of C-terminal GPI-peptides from porcine membrane dipeptidase, folate receptor and CD59 in complex LC-MS/MS data sets demonstrates the sensitivity and specificity of this integrated computational and experimental approach.",

Various stresses trigger over-production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species which lead to oxidative modifications of redox-sensitive proteins. Identification and characterization of redox-sensitive proteins are important steps toward understanding molecular mechanisms of stress responses. Here, we report a high-throughput quantitative proteomic approach termed OxiTRAQ for identifying proteins whose thiols undergo reversible oxidative modifications in Arabidopsis cells subjected to oxidative stress. In this approach, a biotinylated thiol-reactive reagent is used for differential labeling of reduced and oxidized thiols. The biotin-tagged peptides are affinity purified, labeled with iTRAQ reagents, and analyzed using a paralleled HCD-CID fragmentation mode in an LTQ-Orbitrap. With this approach, we identified 195 cysteine-containing peptides from 179 proteins whose thiols underwent oxidative modifications in Arabidopsis cells following the treatment with hydrogen peroxide. A majority of those redox-sensitive proteins, including several transcription factors, were not identified by previous redox proteomics studies. This approach allows identification of the specific redox-regulated cysteine residues, and offers an effective tool for elucidation of redox proteomes.",

In this article, we revisit these definitions of canonical isoforms based on functional genomics and proteomics evidence, focusing on mouse data. We report a novel functional relationship network-based approach for identifying the Highest Connected Isoforms (HCIs). We show that 46% of these HCIs are not the longest transcripts. In addition, this approach revealed many genes that have more than one highly connected isoforms. Averaged across 175 RNA-seq datasets covering diverse tissues and conditions, 65% of the HCIs show higher expression levels than non-highest connected isoforms (NCIs) at the transcript level. At the protein level, these HCIs highly overlap with the expressed splice variants, based on proteomic data from eight different normal tissues. These results suggest that a more confident definition of canonical isoforms can be made through integration of multiple lines of evidence, including highest connected isoforms defined by biological processes and pathways, expression prevalence at the transcript level, and relative or absolute abundance at the protein level. This integrative proteogenomics approach can successfully identify principal isoforms that are responsible for the canonical functions of genes. This article is protected by copyright.

Herein, we demonstrated the compatibility of IEF-FFE with ESI-Fourier transform ICR MS (ESI-FTICR-MS) for top-down experiments. We demonstrated that IEF-FFE of intact proteins were highly reproducible between FFE instruments, between laboratories, and between analyses. Applying native (0.2% hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose) IEF-FFE to an enzyme resulted in no decrease in enzyme activity; applying either native or denaturing (8 M urea) IEF-FFE to a four-protein mixture with different pIs resulted in isolation of each protein into separate fractions in a 96-well plate. After desalting, each protein was sequenced by top-down MS/MS. As an application of this technique, chicken erythrocyte histone H2A-IV and its major modified forms were enriched by IEF-FFE. Top-down analysis revealed Lys-5 to be a major acetylation site, in addition to N-terminal acetylation.",

SurA has been proposed to be the primary chaperone escorting the bulk mass of OM proteins across the periplasm. However, the impact of SurA deletion on the global OM proteome has not been determined, limiting therefore our understanding of the function of SurA. By using a differential proteomics approach based on 2-D LC-MS(n), we compared the relative abundance of 64 OM proteins, including 23 beta-barrel proteins, in wild-type and surA strains. Unexpectedly, we found that the loss of SurA affects the abundance of eight beta-barrel proteins. Of all the decreased proteins, FhuA and LptD are the only two for which the decreased protein abundance cannot be attributed, at least in part, to decreased mRNA levels in the surA strain. In the case of LptD, an essential protein involved in OM biogenesis, our data support a role for SurA in the assembly of this protein and suggest that LptD is a true SurA substrate. Based on our results, we propose a revised model in which only a subset of OM proteins depends on SurA for proper folding and insertion in the OM.",

Using mouse liver homogenates (control and paracetamol (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol, APAP)-treated), we have determined the quantitative variation in the 2-D DIGE process and established statistically valid thresholds for assigning quantitative changes between samples. Thresholds were dependent on normalised spot volume, ranged from approximately 1.2 fold for large volume spots to 3.5 fold for small volume spots and were not markedly affected by the particular cyanine dye combination or by multiple operators carrying out the dye labelling reaction. To minimise the thresholds, substantial user editing was required when using ImageMaster 2D-Elite software. The difference thresholds were applied to the test system and quantitative protein differences were determined using replicate gels of pool samples and single gels from multiple individual animals (control vs treated in each gel). Throughout, the differences revealed with a particular cyanine dye combination were mirrored almost without exception when the dye combination was reversed. Both pool and individual sample analyses provided unique data to the study. The inter-animal response variability in inbred mice was approximately nine times that contributed by the 2-D DIGE process. A number of the most frequently observed protein changes resulting from APAP-treatment were identified by mass spectrometry. Several of these can be rationalised based on available data on the mechanism of APAP hepatotoxicity but others cannot, indicating that proteomics can provide further insights into the biochemical basis of APAP toxicity.",

Recent advances in the understanding of ecdysone action have relied to a large extent on the application of molecular genetic tools in Drosophila. Here, we used a comprehensive quantitative SILAC mass spectrometry-based approach to study the global, dynamic proteome of a Drosophila cell line to investigate how hormonal signals are transduced into specific cellular responses. Global proteome data after ecdysone treatment after various time points were then integrated with transcriptome data. We observed a substantial overlap in terms of affected targets between the dynamic proteome and transcriptome, although there were some clear differences in timing effects. Also, downregulation of several specific mRNAs did not always correlate with downregulation of their corresponding protein counterparts and in some cases there was no correlation between transcriptome and proteome dynamics whatsoever. In addition, we performed a comprehensive interactome analysis of EcR, the major target of ecdysone. Proteins co-purified with EcR include factors involved in transcription, chromatin remodeling, ecdysone signaling, ecdysone biosynthesis and other signaling pathways. Novel ecdysone-responsive proteins identified in this study might link previously unknown proteins to the ecdysone signaling pathway and might be novel targets for developmental studies. To our knowledge, this is the first time that ecdysone signaling is studied by global quantitative proteomics. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

One of the most adopted protocols applies propionic anhydride for derivatization. However, the propionyl group is not sufficiently hydrophobic to fully retain the shortest histone peptides in RP LC, and such procedure also hampers the discovery of natural propionylation events. In this work we tested 12 commercially available anhydrides, selected based on their safety and hydrophobicity. Performance was evaluated in terms of yield of the reaction, MS/MS fragmentation efficiency, and drift in retention time using the following samples: (i) a synthetic unmodified histone H3 tail, (ii) synthetic modified histone peptides, and (iii) a histone extract from cell lysate. Results highlighted that seven of the selected anhydrides increased peptide retention time as compared to propionic, and several anhydrides such as benzoic and valeric led to high MS/MS spectra quality. However, propionic anhydride derivatization still resulted, in our opinion, as the best protocol to achieve high MS sensitivity and even ionization efficiency among the analyzed peptides.",

However, there is no perspective research to elucidate the causations between chromium exposure and hepatotoxicity. In the present study, the impact of hexavalent/trivalent chromium on the liver and the underlying pathogenic processes were revealed in the female nude mice model. The liver damage under different treatments was evaluated by histologic examination. Functional proteome tools combined with a network analysis revealed statistically significant candidate protein networks predicted to be changed in the presence of chromium compounds. RNA interference-mediated silencing and immunohistochemistry were used to confirm whether the candidate protein was capable of resulting in hepatotoxicity elicited by chromium. Potassium chromate as the Cr(VI) compound generated greater oxidative stress, apoptosis and hepatotoxicity compared to chromium nitrate [Cr(III)]-treated samples. The most meaningful changes were observed amongst proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, calcium homeostasis and apoptosis. Furthermore, abrogation of transitional ER ATPase (VCP) led to significant inhibition in hepatic cell viability under Cr(VI) administration, and the expression profiles of cytokeratin were closely correlated with apoptotic degrees of liver tissue. Collectively, our findings suggest that Cr(VI) might induce the accumulation of misfolded proteins and adverse effects leading to cell apoptosis and liver injury. These signature networks represent an approach to discover novel relationships in complex data, and functional proteomics of liver may provide solid evidence of chromium-caused hepatic damage via the skin.",

Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, complement C3, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, chitinase 3-like protein 3, chitinase 3-like protein 4, and acidic mammalian chitinase demonstrated significantly enhanced up-regulation by UFP with a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content and a higher oxidant potential.

However, application of these technologies to the mitochondrial proteome has been limited due to the considerable complement of hydrophobic membrane proteins in mitochondria, which precipitate during first dimension isoelectric focusing of standard 2-D gels. In addition, functional information regarding protein:protein interactions is lost during 2-D gel separation due to denaturing conditions in both gel dimensions. To resolve these issues, 2-D blue-native gel electrophoresis was applied to the mitochondrial proteome. In this technique, membrane protein complexes such as those of the respiratory chain are solubilized and resolved in native form in the first dimension. A second dimension sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel then denatures the complexes and resolves them into their component subunits. Refinements to this technique have yielded the levels of throughput and reproducibility required for proteomics. By coupling to tryptic peptide fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, a partial mitochondrial proteome map has been assembled. Applications of this functional mitochondrial proteomics method are discussed.",

To investigate the impact of iron deficiency on bioenergetic pathways, comparative proteomics was combined with spectroscopic as well as voltametric oxygen measurements to assess protein dynamics linked to functional properties of respiratory and photosynthetic machineries. Although photosynthetic electron transfer is largely compromised under iron deficiency, our quantitative and spectroscopic data revealed that the functional antenna size of photosystem II (PSII) significantly increased. Concomitantly, stress-related chloroplast polypeptides, like 2-cys peroxiredoxin and a stress-inducible light-harvesting protein, LhcSR3, as well as a novel light-harvesting protein and several proteins of unknown function were induced under iron-deprivation. Respiratory oxygen consumption did not decrease and accordingly, polypeptides of respiratory complexes, harboring numerous iron-sulfur clusters, were only slightly diminished or even increased under low iron. Consequently, iron-deprivation induces a transition from photoheterotrophic to primarily heterotrophic metabolism, indicating that a hierarchy for iron allocations within organelles of a single cell exists that is closely linked with the metabolic state of the cell.",

However, due to the small mass difference between labeled and unlabeled peptide species, this approach has usually been restricted to high-resolution mass spectrometers. In this study we explored whether the high-resolution scanning mode, together with the extremely high scanning speed of the linear IT allows the 16O/18O-labeling method to be used for accurate, large-scale quantitative analysis of proteomes. A protocol, including digestion, desalting, labeling, MS and quantitative analysis was developed and tested using protein standards and whole proteome extracts. Using this method we were able to identify and quantify 140 proteins from only 10 mug of a proteome extract from mesenchymal stem cells. Relative expression changes larger than twofold can be identified with this method at the 95% confidence level. Our results demonstrate that accurate quantitative analysis using 16O/18O labeling can be performed in the practice using linear IT MS, without compromising large-scale peptide identification efficiency.",

We describe a CCD camera-based imaging instrument, equipped with both a high-pressure Xenon arc lamp and a UV transilluminator, which provides broad-band wavelength coverage (380-700 nm and UV). With six-position filter wheels, both excitation and emission wavelengths may be selected, providing optimal measurement and quantitation of virtually any dye and allowing excellent spectral resolution among different fluorophores. While spatial resolution of conventional fixed CCD camera imaging systems is typically inferior to laser scanners, this problem is circumvented with the new instrument by mechanically scanning the CCD camera over the sample and collecting multiple images that are subsequently automatically reconstructed into a complete high-resolution image. By acquiring images in succession, as many as four different fluorophores may be evaluated from a gel. The imaging platform is suitable for analysis of the wide range of dyes and tags commonly encountered in proteomics investigations. The instrument is unique in its capabilities of scanning large areas at high resolution and providing accurate selectable illumination over the UV/visible spectral range, thus maximizing the efficiency of dye multiplexing protocols.",

In order to get insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of Pseudomonas sp. M1 to catabolize beta-myrcene, an expression proteomics approach was used in this study. Results indicate that the catabolic enzyme machinery for beta-myrcene utilization (MyrB, MyrC, and MyrD and other uncharacterized proteins) is strongly induced when beta-myrcene is present in the growth medium. Since an M1 mutant, lacking a functional 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase, is not able to grow in mineral medium with beta-myrcene or propionic acid as the sole C-source, and also based on the expression proteomic analysis carried out in this study, it is suggested that the beta-myrcene catabolic intermediate propionyl-CoA is channeled into the central metabolism via the 2-methylcitrate cycle. Results also suggest that the major alteration occurring in the central carbon metabolism of cells growing in beta-myrcene-containing media is related with the redistribution of the metabolic fluxes leading to increased oxaloacetate production. Other up-regulated proteins are believed to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation or to play important structural roles, contributing to the adaptive alteration of cell wall and membrane organization and integrity, which are essential features to allow the bacterium to cope with the highly lipophilic beta-myrcene as C-source.",

For the bacterium Bacillus subtilis thioredoxin A (TrxA) was described as the product of an essential gene indicating a key role during growth. By means of mRNA profiling Smits et al. (J. Bacteriol. 2005, 187, 3921-3930) suggested a critical function for TrxA in sulfur utilization during stationary phase. We extended the analysis of TrxA to exponential growth and characterized a trxA conditional mutant by proteome analysis complemented by transcriptomics. After TrxA-depletion, the growth rate was dramatically decreased. The cells responded at mRNA and protein level by the increased expression of genes involved in the utilization of sulfur, which represents the most obvious response as visualized by gel-based proteomics. Furthermore, several genes of the antioxidant response were found at higher expression levels after TrxA-depletion. When sulfate was replaced by thiosulfate or methionine as sulfur source, the growth inhibition was abolished. In the presence of thiosulfate but in the absence of TrxA, the induction of the sulfur limitation response and the oxidative stress response was not observed. Our results show that the global change of gene expression is primarily caused by the interruption of the sulfate utilization after TrxA depletion. Thus, its function in sulfate assimilation renders TrxA an essential protein in growing B. subtilis cells.",

Proteins from cysts, germinated cysts and appressoria grown in vitro were isolated and separated by 2-DE. Statistical quantitative analysis of the protein spots from five independent experiments of each developmental stage revealed significant up-regulation of ten spots on gels from germinated cysts compared to cysts. Five spots were significantly up-regulated on gels from appressoria compared to germinated cysts and one of these up-regulated spots was not detectable on gels from cysts. In addition, one spot was significantly down-regulated and another spot not detectable on the gels from appressoria. The corresponding proteins to 13 of these spots were identified with high confidence using tandem mass spectrometry and database searches. The functions of the proteins that were up-regulated in germinated cysts and appressoria can be grouped into the following categories: protein synthesis (e.g. a DEAD box RNA helicase), amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species scavenging. The spot not detected in appressoria was identified as the P. infestans crinkling- and necrosis-inducing protein CRN2. The identified proteins are most likely involved in the establishment of the infection of the host plant.",

There is a need to combine selective proteomic datasets with sophisticated computational analysis to devise a robust classification approach. This paper describes an integrated MS-based proteomics and bioinformatics approach to classifying a range of fish samples. A classifier is developed using training data that successfully discriminates between Barramundi and Nile Perch samples using a selected protein subset of the proteome. Additionally, the classifier is shown to successfully discriminate between test samples not used to develop the classifier, including samples that have been cooked, and to classify other fish species as neither Barramundi nor Nile Perch. This approach has applications to truth in labeling for fishmongers and restaurants, monitoring fish catches, and for scientific research into distances between species.",

The PCA plot was able to describe the variation in the protein expression related to dose and time, by separation or clustering of different animal groups. PLSR followed by variable selection (Jack-knifing) was used to select proteins that varied significantly in relation to the dose related response of the hydrazine treatment. The 10 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated proteins with highest rank in the PLSR model were identified by mass spectrometry. Hydrazine treatment induced altered expression of proteins related to lipid metabolism, Ca(2+) homeostasis, thyroid hormone pathways and stress response. Several of the identified proteins have not previously been implicated in hydrazine toxicity and may thus be regarded as new potential biomarkers of induced liver toxicity.",

Over 100 spots were reproducibly resolved per 2-DE map; 55 differentially expressed spots were quantitatively detected and analyzed, and 14 of these showed an increase in protein expression of more than fourfold. Epoxide hydrolase, peroxisomal antioxidant enzyme, and sarcosine oxidase (SOX) have been identified by ESI MS/MS, and acyl-CoA oxidase, multifunctional protein, and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase were immunolocalized by Western blotting.

However, the precise molecular mechanism of action of genistein has not been completely elucidated. In this study, we used quantitative proteomics to identify the genistein-induced protein alterations in gastric cancer cells and investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for the anti-cancer actions of genistein. Total 86 proteins were identified to be regulated by genistein, most of which were clustered into the regulation of cell division and G2/M transition, consistent with the anti-cancer effect of genistein. Many proteins including kinesin family proteins, TPX2, CDCA8, and CIT were identified for the first time to be regulated by genistein. Interestingly, five kinesin family proteins including KIF11, KIF20A, KIF22, KIF23, and CENPF were found to be simultaneously downregulated by genistein. Significantly decreased KIF20A was selected for further functional studies. The silencing of KIF20A inhibited cell viability and induced G2/M arrest, similar to the effects of genistein treatment in gastric cancer. And the silencing of KIF20A also increased cancer cell sensitivity to genistein inhibition, whereas overexpression of KIF20A markedly attenuated genistein-induced cell viability inhibition and G2/M arrest. These observations suggested that KIF20A played an important role in anti-cancer actions of genistein, and thus may be a potential molecular target for drug intervention of gastric cancer.",

Also, we identified a set of polymeric peaks (at multiples of 180.6 Da) that is present in several normal spectra (B1-B8).

Proteomics analyses of the vesicles identified 269 proteins that include various orthologs of marker proteins and proteins with putative functions in vesicle formation and release. Analogous to their mammalian counterparts, the subcellular origin of the vesicular constituents of both cell lines is dominated by membrane-associated and cytosolic proteins with functions that are consistent with their localization in MVs.

For this reason, Z. bailii is the most important microbial contaminant of acidic food products but the mechanisms behind this intrinsic resistance to acetic acid are very poorly characterized. To gain insights into the adaptive response and tolerance to acetic acid in Z. bailii, we explored an expression proteomics approach, based on quantitative 2DE, to identify alterations occurring in the protein content in response to sudden exposure or balanced growth in the presence of an inhibitory but nonlethal concentration of this weak acid. A coordinate increase in the content of proteins involved in cellular metabolism, in particular, in carbohydrate metabolism (Mdh1p, Aco1p, Cit1p, Idh2p, and Lpd1p) and energy generation (Atp1p and Atp2p), as well as in general and oxidative stress response (Sod2p, Dak2p, Omp2p) was registered. Results reinforce the concept that glucose and acetic acid are coconsumed in Z. bailii, with acetate being channeled into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. When acetic acid is the sole carbon source, results suggest the activation of gluconeogenic and pentose phosphate pathways, based on the increased content of several proteins of these pathways after glucose exhaustion.",

        "abstract": "One of the main goals in proteomics is to solve biological and molecular questions regarding a set of identified proteins. In order to achieve this goal, one has to extract and collect the existing biological data from public repositories for every protein and afterward, analyze and organize the collected data. Due to the complexity of this task and the huge amount of data available, it is not possible to gather this information by hand, making it necessary to find automatic methods of data collection. Within a proteomic context, we have developed Protein Information and Knowledge Extractor (PIKE) which solves this problem by automatically accessing several public information systems and databases across the Internet. PIKE bioinformatics tool starts with a set of identified proteins, listed as the most common protein databases accession codes, and retrieves all relevant and updated information from the most relevant databases. Once the search is complete, PIKE summarizes the information for every single protein using several file formats that share and exchange the information with other software tools. It is our opinion that PIKE represents a great step forward for information procurement and drastically reduces manual database validation for large proteomic studies. It is available at http://proteo.cnb.csic.es/pike.",

Post-translational modifications of histones play an important role in this process. Previously, we found by ChIP-seq widespread changes of specific histone H3 marks in two divergent reprogramming routes leading to alternative pluripotent sates [1]. Here, using an unbiased middle-down proteomics approach we have identified 72 unique isoforms of histone H4 and quantified 56 of them in the same set of samples. We found substantial differences between somatic and late-phase reprogramming cells. Also, ESCs and iPSCs displayed higher levels of H4 acetylation and tri-methylation concomitantly with lower levels of mono- and di-methylation when compared to cells undergoing reprogramming. Our data shows that the epigenetic remodeling induced by the reprogramming process goes beyond histone H3 and reveals the importance of H4 modifications as well. The presented data is a valuable resource to study the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the acquisition of induced pluripotency. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved",

Here, we found for the first time that Gram-positive bacteria naturally produce MVs into the extracellular milieu. Further characterizations showed that the density and size of Staphylococcus aureus-derived MVs are both similar to those of Gram-negative bacteria. With a proteomics approach, we identified with high confidence a total of 90 protein components of S. aureus-derived MVs. In the group of identified proteins, the highly enriched extracellular proteins suggested that a specific sorting mechanism for vesicular proteins exists. We also identified proteins that facilitate the transfer of proteins to other bacteria, as well to eliminate competing organisms, antibiotic resistance, pathological functions in systemic infections, and MV biogenesis. Taken together, these observations suggest that the secretion of MVs is an evolutionally conserved, universal process that occurs from simple organisms to complex multicellular organisms. This information will help us not only to elucidate the biogenesis and functions of MVs, but also to develop therapeutic tools for vaccines, diagnosis, and antibiotics effective against pathogenic strains of Gram-positive bacteria.",

This relies on the presence of the amino acid sequence of the protein in the current databanks. Despite this, it is desirable to be able to use the technique for organisms whose genomes are not yet fully sequenced and apply cross-species protein identification. In this study, we have re-examined the feasibility of such approaches by considering the extent of protein similarity between genome sequences using a data set of 29 complete bacterial and two eukaryotic genomes. A range of protein and peptide features are considered, including protein isoelectric focussing point, protein mass, and amino acid conservation. The effectiveness of PMF approaches has then been tested with a series of computer simulations with varying peptide number and mass accuracy for several cross-species tests. The results show that PMF alone is unsuitable in general for divergent species jumps, or when protein similarity is less than 70% identity. Despite this, there exists a considerable enrichment above random of tryptic peptide conservation and PMF promises to remain useful when combined with other data than just peptide masses for cross-species protein identification.",

We have applied a small-scale chemical proteomics method using bisindolylmaleimide (Bis) class of protein kinase C inhibitors to study the Bis-binding proteome in a cell culture model of basal breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231). Using MS, we identified 174 proteins captured by the Bis-probe in phorbol ester (PMA) stimulated cells. Gene ontology analysis broadly categorised these proteins as ATP binding (42%), GTP binding (6%) and having nucleoside-triphosphatase activity (21%). Of the 64 enzymes captured by the Bis-probe, the majority had either ATP and/or nucleotide binding functions. Two previously unreported Bis binding protein kinases, serine/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase 1 (SRPK1) and interferon-induced RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) were observed. We then incorporated SILAC for quantitation to examine the proteins that were differentially captured by the Bis-probe following 30 and 60 min PMA stimulation. This provided novel evidence for PMA regulation of the enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, nucleolar RNA helicase 2 and Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M.",

It forms monolayer biofilms where extracellular polymeric substances are essential for cell attachment and metal sulfide leaching. High-throughput proteomics has been applied to study the early process of biofilm formation on pyrite by At. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270. After 24 h contact with the mineral, planktonic and sessile (biofilm) cell subpopulations were separated and proteins extracted. In total, 1319 proteins were detected in both samples. Sixty-two of these were found to be increased in biofilms. Additionally, 25 proteins were found to be decreased in the biofilm cell subpopulation. Three transcriptional factors were found to be increased or decreased among both cell subpopulations, suggesting their potential involvement in the regulation of these processes. Although no significant differences were observed for the known proteins related to ferrous iron and sulfur oxidation pathways among both cell subpopulations, the results presented here show that the early steps of At. ferrooxidans biofilm formation consist of a set of metabolic adaptations following cell attachment to the mineral surface. Functions such as extracellular polymeric substances biosynthesis seem to be pivotal. This first high-throughput proteomic study may also contribute to the annotation of several unknown At. ferrooxidans proteins found.",

One aspect of significant importance is the definition of T cell antigens. This report describes the development and implementation of a proteomic approach to defining such antigens. Large quantities of subcellular protein fractions of M. tuberculosis were resolved by two-dimensional liquid phase electrophoresis (2-D LPE), resulting in 355 and 299 fractions of culture filtrate and cytosolic proteins, respectively. Analysis of these fractions against splenocytes of C57Bl/6 mice infected with M. tuberculosis resulted in the identification of 37 fractions that stimulated a dominant T cell response, as measured by the production of interferon-gamma. Additionally, when the 2-D LPE fractions were assayed against splenocytes harvested at 10 and 40 days post infection significant changes in the T cell response were observed. Molecular characterization of the proteins contained in each of the 38 immunodominant fractions by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry resulted in the identification of 30 individual proteins. Many of these represented previously defined antigens. However 17 of these proteins were novel T cell antigens. The data presented demonstrate that proteomics offers a rapid and facile approach for elucidation of immunodominant T cell antigens of pathogenic bacteria.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the functional improvements remain undefined. We employed large-scale label-free quantitative proteomics to identify proteins that were differentially regulated following cellular transplantation in a swine model of myocardial infarction (MI). We identified 22 proteins that were significantly up-regulated after trilineage cell transplantation compared to both MI and Sham groups. Among them, 12 proteins, including adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 and tropomodulin-1, are associated with positive regulation of muscular contraction whereas 11 proteins, such as desmoplakin and zyxin, are involved in embryonic and muscular development and regeneration. Moreover, we identified 21 proteins up-regulated and another 21 down-regulated in MI, but reversed after trilineage cell transplantation. Proteins up-regulated after MI but reversed by transplantation are related to fibrosis and apoptosis. Conversely, proteins down-regulated in MI but restored after cell therapy are regulators of protein nitrosylation. Our results show that the functionally beneficial effects of trilineage cell therapy are accompanied by differential regulation of protein expression in the recipient myocardium, which may contribute to the improved cardiac function.",

A partial proteome map was constructed by separating the total bacteroid proteins using high-resolution 2-DE. Of the several hundred protein spots analyzed using PMF, 180 spots were tentatively identified by searching the available database for B. japonicum, (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/index.html). The data showed that the bacteroid expressed a dominant and elaborate protein network for nitrogen and carbon metabolism, which is closely dependent on the plant supplied metabolites, and seems aptly supported by a selective group of bacteroid transporter proteins. However, they seem to lack a defined fatty acid and nucleic acid metabolism. Interestingly, the proteins related to protein synthesis, scaffolding and degradation were among the most predominant spots of the bacteroid proteome. In addition, several proteins, which showed fairly good expression, were identified to be involved with cellular detoxification, stress regulation and signaling communication components. This preliminary proteomic data matches very well with several biochemical and genetic reports, and clearly shows the inter-connection between several metabolic pathways that meet the needs of the bacteroid. It is expected that in the future this will allow us to develop testable hypotheses about the roles of several of these proteins in context to the metabolic pathway connections and metabolite fluxes.",

Growth experiments (glucose or combined with oxygen limitation) were conducted to measure external metabolites. Fluxes of the central metabolism were calculated from these data with low error. In exponential phase, glycolysis is active and amino acids are used for growth. In later phases, dehydroquinate synthetase is suppressed and acetate metabolism starts. There are strain-specific differences for these phases. A time series of 2-D gel protein expression data on COL strain delivered a second data set (glucose limitation) on which fluxes were calculated. The comparison with the metabolite-predicted fluxes shows, in general, good correlation. Outliers point to different regulated enzymes for S. aureus COL under these limitations. In exponential growth, there is lower activity for some enzymes in upper glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway and stronger activity for some in lower glycolysis. In transition phase, aspartate kinase is expressed to meet amino acid requirements and in later phases there is high expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and lysine synthetase.

By imaging MS analysis based on principal component analysis (PCA), we could find numerous alterations in the KO mouse brain. Furthermore, we could also know the information on the position of altered substances all together. PCA provides information about which molecules in tissue microdomains have altered and is helpful in analyzing large dataset of imaging MS, while exact identification of each molecule from peaks in MALDI imaging MS may require additional analyses such as MS/MS. Direct imaging with PCA is a powerful tool to perform in situ proteomics and will lead to novel findings.

Largely, a result of poor liquid chromatographic performance, the limitations in this mass range may be addressed by alternative separations that replace chromatography. Herein, the short migration times of CZE-ESI-MS/MS have been extended to size-sorted whole proteins in complex mixtures from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01. An electrokinetically pumped nanospray interface, a coated capillary, and a stacking method for on-column sample concentration were developed to achieve high-loading capacity and separation resolution. We achieved full width at half maximum of 8-16 s for model proteins up to 29 kDa and identified 30 proteins in the mass range of 30-80 kDa from P. aeruginosa PA01 whole cell lysate.

Proteotypic peptides were selected and isotopically labeled heavy versions were used for technical optimization and for quantification of the corresponding light version in biological samples. This approach allowed to quantify simultaneously nine PIPs in leaf membranes and 13 PIPs together with three autoinhibited H(+) ATPases, two ammonium transporters, and two NRTs in root membranes. Similarly, it was used to investigate the effect of a salt stress on the expression of these latter 20 transporters in roots. These novel isoform-specific data were compared with published transcriptome information and revealed a close correlation between PIP isoforms and transcripts levels.

Two-day-old seedlings were subjected to 10% PEG for 2 days. Plasma membranes were purified from seedlings using a two-phase partitioning method and their purity was verified by measuring ATPase activity. Using the gel-based proteomics, four and eight protein spots were identified as up- and downregulated, respectively, whereas in the nanoLC MS/MS approach, 11 and 75 proteins were identified as up- and downregulated, respectively, under PEG treatment. Out of osmotic stress responsive proteins, most of the transporter proteins and all proteins with high number of transmembrane helices as well as low-abundance proteins could be identified by the LC MS/MS-based method. Three homologues of plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which are transporter proteins involved in ion efflux, were upregulated under osmotic stress. Gene expression of this protein was increased after 12\u2009h of stress exposure. Among the identified proteins, seven proteins were mutual in two proteomics techniques, in which calnexin was the highly upregulated protein. Accumulation of calnexin in plasma membrane was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. These results suggest that under hyperosmotic conditions, calnexin accumulates in the plasma membrane and ion efflux accelerates by upregulation of plasma membrane H+-ATPase protein.",

Integrative concepts of development of novel therapeutic targets and the application of proteomics in drug development are also discussed. Several aspects are touched including the development of novel therapeutic targets, proteomics as a tool to discover biomarkers, discovery and validation of prognostic and predictive biomarkers, and biobanking versus proteomics.

        "abstract": "In studies of cell adhesion, migration, growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, synthetic peptides containing the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif have been extensively used as the inhibitors of integrin-ligand interactions. The RGD motif is an integrin-recognition motif found in many ligands, so that the RGD-containing peptides can be used to probe integrin functions in various biological systems. A linear RGD is a tripeptide consisting of a flexible structure that makes the motif bind to its receptor with inefficient chelating affinity. Therefore, we designed a cyclic-RGD peptide (Tpa-RGDWPC, cRGD) with rigid skeleton to closely bind with its receptor. The cRGD was obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis method using Rink amide resin. We showed that the cRGD exerts more potency than linear RGD on inhibiting cell growth of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. This stimulated us to question how cRGD inhibits cell growth of MCF-7 cells. Moreover, understanding what molecular mechanism underlies the effect that RGD motif exerts on MCF-7 cells is also of considerable importance. We used proteomics and bioinformatics to survey the global changes in proteins after cRGD treatment in MCF-7 cells. The classification of these proteins is shown according to the different biological processes in which they are involved. Most of the proteins that appear to be strongly influenced by cRGD treatment are involved in metabolism, cell growth, responsive to external stimulus, cell communication, reproduction and cell death. This is the first report which monitors the protein expression profile of MCF-7 cells in response to treatment with RGD-containing peptides in a time-course analysis. The clustering data indicated temporal patterns of altered protein expression that can be categorized into early, intermediate and late response proteins. These patterns of protein expression may be important for predicting its response to cRGD. In summary, these results provide a molecular explanation for the properties of cRGD in breast cancer cells and present a valuable in-depth description of their possible impact on breast cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis caused by mycobacteria, mainly Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a major infectious disease of the respiratory system. An early diagnosis followed by chemotherapy is the major control strategy. In an effort to identify the antigens suitable for immunodiagnosis and vaccines, the proteins secreted in a culture medium from the M. tuberculosis K-strain, which is the most prevalent among the clinical isolates in Korea and belongs to the Beijing family, were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) and compared with those from the M. tuberculosis H37Rv and CDC1551 strains. Eight proteins, Rv0652, Rv1636, Rv2818c, Rv3369, Rv3865, Rv0566c, MT3304, and Rv3160, were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) or liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) and found to be relatively abundant in the culture medium from the M. tuberculosis K-strain but less so from the CDC1551 or H37Rv strains. In addition, Rv3874 (CFP-10), Rv-0560c and Rv3648c, which were expressed increasingly in the K and CDC1551 strains, were also identified using the same proteomics technology. All proteins were prepared by molecular cloning, expression in Escherichia coli followed by affinity purification. Among them, three proteins, rRv3369, rRv0566c, and rRv3874, were selected by prescreening and examined for their potential as serodiagnostic antigens using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. When 100 sera from tuberculosis patients and 100 sera from the healthy controls were analyzed, rRV3369, rRv3874, and rRv0566c showed a sensitivity of 60%, 74%, and 43%, and a specificity of 96%, 97%, and 84%, respectively. These results suggest that the rRv3369 and rRv3874 proteins, which were expressed more abundantly in the more recently obtained clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis than in the laboratory-adapted H37Rv strain, are promising for use in the serodiagnosis of tuberculosis.",

Two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC)-nano electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) as well as one-dimensional LC-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS/MS were evaluated and shown that additional separation introduced at the peptide level was not as efficient as simple prefractionation of protein extracts in extending the range and total number of proteins identified. Direct LC-nanoESI MS/MS analyses of peptides from total solubilized fraction and the excised gel bands from one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fractionated insolubilized fraction afforded the best combination in efficient construction of a nonredundant cell map. Compiling data from multiple variations of rapid shotgun proteomics analyses is nonetheless useful to increase sequence coverage and confidence of hits especially for those proteins identified primarily by a single or two peptide matches. While the returned hit score in general reflects the abundance of the respective proteins, it is not a reliable index for differential expression. Using another closely related hepatoma Hep3B as a comparative basis, 16 proteins with more than two-fold difference in expression level as defined by spot intensity in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis were identified which notably include members of the heat shock protein (Hsp) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRPN) families. The observed higher expression level of hnRNP A2/B1 and Hsp90 in Hep3B led to a search for reported functional roles mediated in concert by both these multifunctional cellular chaperones. In agreement with the proposed model for telomerase and telomere bound proteins in promoting their interactions, data was obtained which demonstrated that the expression proteomics data could be correlated with longer telomeric length in tumorigenic Hep3B. This biological significance constitutes the basis for further delineation of the dynamic interactions and modifications of the two protein families and demonstrated how proteomic and biological investigation could be mutually substantiated in a productive cycle of hypothesis and pattern driven research.",

        "abstract": "The quest for high-throughput proteomics has revealed a number of critical issues. Whilst improved two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) sample preparation, staining and imaging issues are being actively pursued by industry, reliable high-throughput spot matching and quantification remains a significant bottleneck in the bioinformatics pipeline, thus restricting the flow of data to mass spectrometry through robotic spot excision and protein digestion. To this end, it is important to establish a full multi-site Grid infrastructure for the processing, archival, standardisation and retrieval of proteomic data and metadata. Particular emphasis needs to be placed on large-scale image mining and statistical cross-validation for reliable, fully automated differential expression analysis, and the development of a statistical 2-DE object model and ontology that underpins the emerging HUPO PSI GPS (Human Proteome Organization Proteomics Standards Initiative General Proteomics Standards). The first step towards this goal is to overcome the computational and communications burden entailed by the image analysis of 2-DE gels with Grid enabled cluster computing. This paper presents the proTurbo framework as part of the ProteomeGRID, which utilises Condor cluster management combined with CORBA communications and JPEG-LS lossless image compression for task farming. A novel probabilistic eager scheduler has been developed to minimise make-span, where tasks are duplicated in response to the likelihood of the Condor machines' owners evicting them. A 60 gel experiment was pair-wise image registered (3540 tasks) on a 40 machine Linux cluster. Real-world performance and network overhead was gauged, and Poisson distributed worker evictions were simulated. Our results show a 4:1 lossless and 9:1 near lossless image compression ratio and so network overhead did not affect other users. With 40 workers a 32x speed-up was seen (80% resource efficiency), and the eager scheduler reduced the impact of evictions by 58%.",

In ADCs, potent cytotoxic drugs are coupled via a linker to reactive residues in IgG monoclonal antibodies. Linkage to lysine residues in the IgGs, using N-hydroxysuccinimide ester based chemistry, is one of the possible options. To control drug load and specificity, proper knowledge is required about which lysine residues are most accessible and reactive. Here, we combine native MS and bottom-up proteomics to monitor the overall drug load and site-specific lysine reactivity, using N-hydroxysuccinimide-based tandem mass tags. High-resolution Orbitrap native MS enables us to monitor and quantify, due to the achieved baseline resolution, the sequential incorporation of up to 69 tandem mass tag molecules into human IgGs. Complementary, bottom-up proteomics facilitates the identification of some very reactive \u201chot-spot\u201d conjugation sites. However, we also identify lysine residues that are highly resistant to chemical labeling. Our integrated approach gives insight into the conjugation properties of IgGs at both the intact protein and residue levels, providing fundamental information for controlling drug load and specificity in lysine-linked ADCs.",

The study is based on quantitative 2-DE and is complemented by Western blot validation. Excluding redundancies due to proteolysis and post-translational modified isoforms of over 2000 protein spots, 13 proteins were revealed as regulated with statistical variance being within the 95th confidence level and were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting in MALDI MS. Progression-associated proteins belong to the functional complexes of anaerobic glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, steroid biosynthesis, prostaglandin biosynthesis, the regulation and maintenance of the cytoskeleton, protein biosynthesis and degradation, the regulation of apoptosis or other functions. Partial but significant overlap was revealed with previous proteomics and transcriptomics studies in colorectal carcinoma. Among upregulated proteins we identified 3-HMG-CoA synthase, protein phosphatase 1, prostaglandin E synthase 2, villin 1, annexin A1, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoserine aminotransferase 1, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1), while glucose-regulated protein 78, cathepsin D, lamin A/C and quinolate phosphoribosyltransferase were downregulated.",

Given their importance in various industrially relevant areas and in human health, numerous investigations have focussed on the particular physiology of these fixed microorganisms. It is now well recognised that bacteria present in biofilms behave quite differently from their planktonic counterparts. In particular, biofilm organisms are far more resistant to antimicrobial agents than are planktonic organisms. The mechanisms involved in the resistance of biofilm bacteria to antimicrobials are complex and still not fully understood. One of the hypotheses that suggested to explain the increased resistance of biofilms to antimicrobial agents assumes the existence of significant differences in gene expression. Although the expression of a limited number of genes appears to be altered during biofilm growth, a number of proteomics studies have revealed large physiological differences between free-living and biofilm bacteria. Moreover, multiple phenotypes were identified during the different stages of biofilm development. This review presents recent data on protein expression in sessile microorganisms that support the existence of a specific metabolic behaviour of biofilm bacteria.",

Label-free approaches to relative quantification in proteomics such as spectral counting have gained popularity since no additional chemistries are needed. Here, we show a label-free method for relative quantification based on the TIC from peptide MS/MS spectra collected from data-dependent runs can be used effectively as a quantitative measure and expands the dynamic range over isotope labeling experiments allowing for abundance differences up to approximately 60:1 in a screen for proteins that bind to phosphotyrosine residues.",

The latter can constitute an issue if near isobaric ion signals are present in such spectra because they may distort quantification results. We propose a simple remedy for this problem by identifying reporter ions via the accurate mass differences within a single tandem mass spectrum instead of applying fixed mass error tolerances for all tandem mass spectra. Our results show that this leads to unambiguous reporter ion identification and complete removal of interfering signals.

In order to explore the impact of a ribo-seq-derived protein sequence search space on MS/MS spectrum identification, we performed a comprehensive proteome study on a human cancer cell line, using both shotgun and N-terminal proteomics, next to ribosome profiling, which was used to delineate (alter- native) translational reading frames. By including protein-level evidence of sample-specific genetic variation and alternative translation, this strategy improved the identification score of 69 proteins and identified 22 new proteins in the shotgun experiment. Furthermore, we discov- ered 18 new alternative translation start sites in the N-terminal proteomics data and observed a correlation between the quantitative measures of ribo-seq and shotgun proteomics with a Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0.483 to 0.664. Overall, this study demonstrated the benefits of ribosome profiling for MS-based protein and peptide identification and we believe this approach could develop into a common practice for next-generation proteomics.",

To control the inflation of file sizes, strategies for file compression, particularly for mzML files, were explored. Best practices for encoding information such as protein grouping and PTM localisation were refined and documented. Additional example files for the mzQuantML format were designed to provide support for selected reaction monitoring techniques. Enhancements to the PSI Common Query Interface (PSICQUIC) and PSI-MI XML were discussed.

Here we report a novel technique using capillary ultrafiltration (CUF) probes to identify the secreted proteins involved in wound healing. CUF probes, which use semipermeable membrane hollow fibers to continuously capture secreted proteins, were used to sample skin wound fluids. To identify low-abundance proteins, we digested the CUF probe-collected wound fluid with trypsin and then directly subjected it to MS without using 2-DE separation. Two protein fragments with masses of 1565.7 and 1694.8 Da were identified by MS as peptides of thymosin beta10 and beta4, respectively. This is the first identification of thymosin beta10 as an in vivo constituent of the skin wound fluid. The LKKTETQ peptide, a common actin-binding domain of thymosin beta4 and beta10, significantly enhanced skin wound healing in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that the enhancement of wound healing by LKKTETQ may be mediated by purinergic receptors. The technique of using CUF probes linked to mass spectrometric proteomics represents a powerful method to identify in vivo secreted proteins, and may be applicable for identification of proteins relevant in various human diseases.",

Quantitative protein profiles of the fractionated samples were generated by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, in which the experimental samples and the internal control samples were labeled with different dyes and co-separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This approach succeeded in resolving 3890 protein spots. For 364 of the protein spots, the expression level in lung cancer was more than twofold different from that in the healthy volunteers. These differences were statistically significant (Student's t-test, p-value less than 0.05). Mass spectrometric protein identification revealed that the 364 protein spots corresponded to 58 gene products, including the classical plasma proteins and the tissue-leakage proteins catalase, clusterin, ficolin, gelsolin, lumican, tetranectin, triosephosphate isomerase and vitronectin.

Nearly 2000 well-resolved spots were detected in silver-stained gels, with focused areas in the 4-6.5 pH range. Different protein expression signatures were found at each site, with the highest number of more intense spots in animals with the highest metal content. Nineteen more intense protein spots were analyzed out by nanospray-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry, de novo sequencing and a bioinformatics search for their possible identification. While sequence tags of 16 more intense protein spots were obtained, including several proteins induced by pollutant exposure of model organisms, only 2 proteins were unambiguously identified: hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH).

However, very early stimulation steps of T lymphocytes are not compromised, since CD69 receptor, the earliest membrane activation marker, is expressed by T cells at a level comparable to that observed on 1 g activated lymphocytes. Since CD69 engagement, together with submitogenic doses of phorbol esters, transduces an activation signal to T lymphocytes, we undertook a comparative study on the stimulation mediated through this receptor on human CD3+ cells cultured under conditions similar to those which occur during exposure to microgravity, i.e. in clinorotation, or at 1 g. During the early hours of activation, increased levels of intracellular calcium and increased mitochondrial membrane potential were detectable in clinorotating as well as in 1 g cells. However, after 48 hours clinorotation, interleukin 2 production by T lymphocytes was significantly reduced and cell proliferation was greatly decreased. By means of a differential proteomics approach on T cells activated in clinorotation or at 1 g for 48 hours, we were able to detect statistically significant quantitative protein alterations. Seven proteins with modified expression values were identified; they are involved in nucleic acids processing, proteasome regulation and cytoskeleton structure.",

Integration of transcriptomics data generated under the same conditions (2780 expressed genes) allowed us to compile a comprehensive expression profile of B. japonicum during soybean symbiosis, which comprises 3587 genes/proteins (43% of the predicted B. japonicum genes/proteins). Analysis of this data set revealed both the biases and the complementarity of these global profiling technologies. A functional classification and pathway analysis showed that most of the proteins involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism are expressed, including a complete set of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, several gluconeogenesis and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes, as well as several proteins that were previously not considered to be present during symbiosis.

Within 20 min, complete cleavage products of a limited set of bacterial proteins with molecular masses of about 4-125 kDa were obtained by on-probe digestion with immobilized trypsin. Bacterial peptides suitable for unimolecular decomposition analysis were generated within 5 min, and the sequence information obtained allowed identification of abundant proteins, and accordingly, their bacterial sources via searches in the NCBI database. Analysis of fragmentation products was also shown to allow for identification of bacterial peptides identical in mass but differing slightly in amino acid sequence by manual data analysis. In this work, Bacillus subtilis 168, B. globigii, B. sphaericus 14577, B. cereus T, and B. anthracis Sterne were examined, and various cold shock proteins were identified in all species. In addition, DNA-binding, 60 kDa-heat shock, surface-related and other stress-protective proteins were identified in the bacterial cell digests, and species-specific tryptic peptides could be generated from each of the Bacillus species studied. Bacterial peptides could be analyzed with greater sensitivity and mass accuracy than the parent proteins. The applicability of this targeted proteomics approach to the rapid identification of Bacillus species was further established by analyzing binary cell mixtures.",

The resulting IS presents a high coverage of the AML proteome compared to single cell lines allied with high technical reproducibility, thus enabling its use for AML patient comparison. This was confirmed by comparing the protein regulation between the five cell lines and by applying the IS to patient material; hence, we were able to reproduce specific functional regulations known to be related to disease progression and molecular genetic abnormalities.

The method used includes microsome preparation, iTRAQ labeling followed by narrow range peptide IEF in an immobilized pH-gradient (IPG-IEF) and LC-MS/MS analysis. We demonstrate that the microsomal preparation and iTRAQ labeling is reproducible regarding protein content and composition. The rationale using narrow range peptide IPG-IEF separation is demonstrated by its ability to: (i) lowering the complexity of the sample by two-thirds while keeping high proteome coverage (96%), (ii) providing high separation efficiency, and (iii) allowing for peptide validation and possibly identifications of post-transcriptional modifications. After analyzing one-fifth of the IEF fractions (effective pH range of 4.0-4.5), a total of 3704 proteins were identified, among which 527 were predicted to be membrane proteins. One of the proteins found to be differentially expressed was Serca 2, a calcium pump located in the ER membrane that potentially could result in changes of apoptotic response toward Doxorubicin.",

SameSpots was found to increase the proportion of low volume data for DP but not for DIGE. For all the analysis methods applied in this study, the assumptions of parametric tests were met. Analysis of the same images gave significantly lower noise with SameSpots (over traditional) for DP, but no difference for DIGE. We propose that SameSpots gave lower noise with DP due to the stabilisation of the spot area by the common spot outline, but this was not seen with DIGE due to the co-detection process which stabilises the area selected. For studies where measurement of small abundance changes is required, a cost-benefit analysis highlights that DIGE was significantly cheaper regardless of the analysis methods. For studies analysing large changes, DP with SameSpots could be an effective alternative to DIGE but this will be dependent on the biological noise of the system under investigation.",

The possibility to differentiate these cells into neural precursors and neural cells in vitro provides the opportunity to study neural development, nerve cell biology, neurological disease as well as contributing to clinical research. The neural differentiation process is associated with changes at protein and their post-translational modifications (PTMs). PTMs are important regulators of proteins physicochemical properties, function, activity and interaction with other proteins, DNA/RNA and complexes. Moreover, the interplay between PTMs is essential to regulate a range of cellular processes and that abnormalities in PTM signaling are associated with several diseases. Altogether, this makes PTMs very relevant to study in order to uncover disease pathogenesis and increase the understanding of molecular processes in cells. Substantial advances in PTM enrichment methods and mass spectrometry has allowed the characterization of a subset of PTMs in large-scale studies. This review focuses on the current state-of-the-art of proteomic, as well as PTMomic studies related to human neural differentiation from pluripotent stem cells.

To determine the functional components in signaling pathways triggered by LMP1, we combined the novel strategy of phosphoprotein enrichment with proteomics technology to elucidate the signaling cascade activated by LMP1. We found that LMP1 could increase the quantity of total phosphoproteins by 18.03%, and 43 proteins showed significant changes in the degree of phosphorylation when LMP1 was expressed. Twenty-five signaling molecules or downstream targets of signaling pathways triggered by LMP1 were identified, several of which had previously been implicated in LMP1 signal pathways. The other proteins, including annexin A2, heat shock protein 27, stathmin, annexin I, basic transcription factor 3, and porin, were novel signaling molecules or targets with no previously known function in LMP1 signal transduction.

To this end the model strain Cronobacter turicensis 3032 was grown at 25, 37, 44, and 47 degrees C, and whole-cell and secreted proteins were iTRAQ-labelled and identified/quantified by 2-D-LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. While 44 degrees C caused only minor changes in C. turicensis growth rate and protein profile, 47 degrees C affected the expression of about 20% of all 891 identified proteins and resulted in a reduced growth rate and rendered the strain non-motile and filamentous. Among the heat-induced proteins were heat shock factors, transcriptional and translational proteins, whereas proteins affecting cellular morphology, proteins involved in motility, central metabolism and energy production were down-regulated. Notably, numerous potential virulence factors were found to be up-regulated at higher temperatures, suggesting an elevated pathogenic potential of Cronobacter sp. under these growth conditions. Significant alterations in the protein expression profile and growth rate of C. turicensis exposed to 25 degrees C indicate that at this temperature the organism is cold-stressed. Up-regulated gene products comprised cold-shock, DNA-binding and ribosomal proteins, factors that support protein folding and proteins opposing cold-induced decrease in membrane fluidity, whereas down-regulated proteins were mainly involved in central metabolism.",

The level of these proteins was generally higher in cells adhered to HA surface, indicating a higher level of cellular proliferation in these cells. The significance of these findings was further assessed by Western blot analysis. The differential protein profile in HA and CNT strengthened HA established in our study should be valuable for future design of biocompatible ceramics.",

However, little is known regarding the mechanism(s) underlying the pathogenesis of PCV2-induced disease and the interaction of the virus with the host immune system. Here, we present a proteomics study on inguinal lymph nodes of piglets inoculated with PCV2, in order to better understand the pathogenesis of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome and the pathways might be affected after infection. We used two proteomics strategies, 2-DE and 1-DE followed by (16)O/(18)O peptide labelling and peptide identification and quantification by MS. More than 100 proteins were found to be differentially regulated and the results obtained by the two strategies were fairly concordant but also complementary, the (18)O labelling approach being a more robust alternative. Analysis of these proteins by systems biology tools revealed the implication of acute phase response and NrF2-mediated oxidative stress, suggesting a putative role for these pathways in the pig immune response. Besides, CD81 was found to be up-regulated, suggesting a possible role in the internalization of the virus. The use of proteomics technologies together with biology analysis systems opens up the way to gain more exhaustive and systematic knowledge of virus-pathogen interactions.",

Further studies revealed that it also plays essential roles in nonapoptotic processes, which is assumed to be regulated by its phosphorylation. However, the exact mechanisms are still poorly understood. To study the nonapoptotic effects of FADD, a comprehensive strategy of proteomics identification combined with bioinformatic analysis was undertaken to identify proteins differentially expressed in three cell lines containing FADD and its mutant, FADD-A and FADD-D. The cell lines were thought to bear wild-type FADD, unphosphorylated FADD mimic and constitutive phosphorylated FADD mimic, respectively. A total of 47 proteins were identified to be significantly changed due to FADD phosphorylation. Network analysis using MetaCore\u2122 identified a number of changed proteins that were involved in cellular metabolic process, including lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation. The finding that FADD-D cell line showed an increase in fatty acid oxidation argues that it could contribute to the leaner phenotype of FADD-D mice as reported previously. In addition, six proteins related to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway were also specifically overexpressed in FADD-D cell line. Finally, the c-Myc gene represents a convergent hub lying at the center of dysregulated pathways, and was upregulated in FADD-D cells. Taken together, these studies allowed us to conclude that impaired mitochondrial function and proteolysis might play pivotal roles in the dysfunction associated with FADD phosphorylation-induced disorders.",

Furthermore, we report and validate a new interaction between PP5 and an Hsp90 adaptor protein, stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1; HOP). Mutation of PP5, replacing key basic amino acids (K97A and R101A) in the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) region known to be necessary for the interactions with Hsp90, abolished both the known interaction of PP5 with cell division cycle 37 homolog and the novel interaction of PP5 with stress-induced phosphoprotein 1.

Label-free analysis offers an opportunity to estimate the effectiveness of this approach without incorporating chemical labels. Human plasma samples were used to quantitatively assess the reproducibility of these two methods using nano-LC-data-independent acquisition MS. We have selected 18 candidate proteins and a comparison of both methodologies showed that both of the methods were reproducible and fell below 20% residual SD. With the same candidate proteins, individual inter-day variability for the samples was also processed, allowing us to monitor instrument reproducibility. Overall, a total of 131 proteins were identified by both methods with 272 proteins identified by enrichment and 200 identified by immunodepletion. Reproducibility of measurements of the amount of protein in the processed sample for individual proteins is within analytically acceptable standards for both methodologies. This enables both methods to be used for biomarker studies. However, when sample is limited, enrichment is not suitable as larger volumes (>1.0 mL) are required. In experiments where sample is not limited then a greater number of proteins can be reliably identified using enrichment.",

Spectral quality scoring reduces the number of investigated mass spectra without a loss of information. Stringent quality-based selection and the combination of different de novo sequencing methods substantially increase the catalog of significant peptide alignments. The de novo sequences passing a reliability filter are subsequently submitted to error tolerant BLAST searches and MS-BLAST hits are validated by a sampling technique. With the described workflow, we identified up to 20% more groups of homologous proteins in proteome analyses with organisms whose genome is not sequenced than by state-of-the-art database searches in an Arabidopsis thaliana database.

Changes in nuclear receptor transcription factors (THRalpha1, RORalpha4, HNF4alpha, NUR77), other transcription factors (GATA1, AP-2alpha, OCT1, ATF6alpha, ZFP161, ZNF354A, PDCD2), and transcription cofactors (PC4, PCAF, MTA1, TCEA1, JMY) are indicative of major, co-ordinated changes in transcription. Proteins involved in DNA repair/recombination, ribosomal RNA synthesis, RNA processing, nuclear transport, nuclear organization, protein translation, glycolysis, lipid metabolism, several protein kinases (PKCdelta, MAP3K4, GRK3), as well as proteins with no established functional role were also observed. The observed proteins suggest nuclear regulatory roles for proteins involved in cytosolic processes such as glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism, and roles in overall nuclear structure/organization for proteins previously associated with meiosis and/or spermatogenesis (synaptonemal complex proteins 1 and 2 (SYCP1, SYCP2), meiosis-specific nuclear structural protein 1 (MNS1), LMNC2, zinc finger protein 99 (ZFP99)).

Here, we outline a concept for integrating approaches for quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics. The strategy was applied to the analysis of changes in signalling and protein synthesis occurring after activation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) pathway in a T-cell line (Jurkat cells). For this purpose, peptides were obtained from four biological replicates of activated and control Jurkat T-cells and phosphopeptides enriched via a TiO2 -based chromatographic step. Both phosphopeptide-enriched and flow-through fractions were analyzed by LC-MS. We observed 1314 phosphopeptides in the enriched fraction whereas 19 were detected in the flow-through, enabling the quantification of 414 and eight phosphoproteins in the respective fractions. Pathway analysis revealed the differential regulation of many metabolic pathways. Among the quantified proteins, 11 kinases with known TCR-related function were detected. A kinase-substrate database search for the phosphosites identified also confirmed the activity of a further ten kinases. In total, these two approaches provided evidence of 19 unique TCR-related kinases. The combination of phosphoproteomics and conventional quantitative shotgun analysis leads to a more comprehensive assessment of the signalling networks needed for the maintenance of the activated status of Jurkat T-cells.",

While about half of all MFM are caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric and extra-sarcomeric proteins (desmin, filamin C, plectin, VCP, FHL1, ZASP, myotilin, \u03b1B-crystallin, and BAG3), the other half of these diseases is due to still unresolved gene defects. The present study aims at the proteomic characterization of pathological protein aggregates in skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with MFM-causing gene mutations. The technical strategy is based on the dissection of plaque versus plaque-free tissue areas from the same individual patient by laser dissection microscopy, filter-aided sample preparation, iTRAQ-labeling, and analysis on the peptide level using offline nano-LC and MALDI-TOF-TOF MS/MS for protein identification and quantification. The outlined workflow overcomes limitations of merely qualitative analyses, which cannot discriminate contaminating nonaggregated proteins. Dependent on the MFM causing mutation, different sets of proteins were revealed as genuine (accumulated) plaque components in independent technical replicates: (i) \u03b1B-crystallin, desmin, filamin A/C, myotilin, PRAF3, RTN2, SQSTM, XIRP1, and XIRP2 (patient with defined MFM mutation distinct from FHL1) or (ii) desmin, FHL1, filamin A/C, KBTBD10, NRAP, SQSTM, RL40, XIRP1, and XIRP2 (patient with FHL1 mutation). The results from differential proteomics indicate that plaques from different patients exhibit protein compositions with partial overlap, on the one hand, and mutation-dependent protein contents on the other. The FHL1 mutation-specific pattern was validated for four patients with respect to desmin, SQSTM, and FHL1 by immunohistochemistry.",

Recently, several experimental approaches using thioredoxins have been developed for this purpose. Thioredoxins comprise a large family of redox-active enzymes capable of reducing protein disulphides to cysteines and of participating in a variety of processes, such as enzyme modulation, donation of reducing equivalents and signal transduction. In this study we screened the target proteomes of three different thioredoxins from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, using site-directed active-site cysteine-to-serine mutants of its m-, x- and y-type thioredoxins. The properties of a thioredoxin that determine the outcome of such analyses were found to be target-binding capacity, solubility and the presence of non-active-site cysteines. Thus, we explored how the choice of thioredoxin affects the target proteomes and we conclude that the m-type thioredoxin, TrxA, is by far the most useful for screening of disulphide proteomes. Furthermore, we improved the resolution of target proteins on non-reducing/reducing 2-DE, leading to the identification of 14 new potentially redox-regulated proteins in this organism. The presence of glycogen phosphorylase among the newly identified targets suggests that glycogen breakdown is redox-regulated in addition to glycogen synthesis.",

This so-called ligand fishing process can be performed by combining surface plasmon resonance biosensors with MS. This combination generates a unique and automated method to quantify and characterize biomolecular interactions, and identify the interaction partners. A general problem in chip-based affinity separation systems is the large surface-to-volume ratio of the fluidic system. Extreme care, therefore, is required to avoid nonspecific adsorption, resulting in losses of the target protein and carry-over during the affinity purification process, which may lead to unwanted signals in the final MS analysis and a reduction in sensitivity. In this study, carry-over of protein and low-molecular weight substances has been investigated systematically and cleaning strategies are presented. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that by the introduction of colloidal particles as a capturing and transporting agent, the recovery yield of the affinity-purified ligand could be improved nearly twofold.",

Of these, 62 were up-regulated and 105 were down-regulated in MM compared with M, while 5 spots were detected only in MM. Proteins involved in primary metabolism showed down-regulation in MM suggesting energy in MM might be utilized for proanthocyanidin biosynthesis via secondary metabolic pathways which leads to the development of brown seed coat color. Besides, down-regulation of two isoforms of isoflavone reductase indicated reduced isoflavones in seed coat of MM which was confirmed by quantitative estimation of total and individual isoflavones using HPLC.

Our previous study showed its roles in cell migration and DNA-damage response processes in breast cancer initiation. In order to understand its roles in tumorigenesis, we extended our studies to analyze tumors derived from Polyomavirus Middle T-Antigen (PyMT) ANXA1-heterozygous (ANXA1+/- ) and null (ANXA1-/- ) mice. We performed quantitative comparison of ANXA1+/- and ANXA1-/- tumors employing reductive dimethyl labelling quantitative proteomics. We observed 253 differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) with high statistical significance among over 5000 quantified proteins. Combinatorial use of pathway and network-based computational analyses of the DEPs revealed that ANXA1 primarily modulates processes related to cytoskeletal remodelling and immune responses in these mammary tumors. Of particular note, ANXA1-/- tumor showed reduced expression of a known epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker Vimentin (VIM), as well as myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which has been reported to induce Rho-kinase mediated assembly of stress fibres known to be implicated in EMT. Integrative network analysis of established interactome of ANXA1 alongside with DEPs further highlights the involvement of ANXA1 in EMT. Functional role of ANXA1 in tumorigenesis was established in invasion assay where knocking down ANXA1 in murine mammary tumor cell line 168FARN showed lower invasive capability. Altogether, this study emphasizes that ANXA1 plays modulating roles contributing to invasion-metastasis in mammary tumorigenesis, distinctive to its roles in cancer initiation.

We present a logical workflow that scores data-dependent selected ion chromatograms and leverage information about semianalytical LC/LC dimension prior to MS. Our method can be successfully used to identify unexpected modifications in peptides with excellent chromatography characteristics, independent of fragmentation pattern and activation methods. We illustrate analysis of ion chromatograms detected in two different modes by RF linear ion trap and electrostatic field orbitrap.",

Recent advances include the development of 2-D DIGE, a proteomic equivalent to mRNA differential display, in which differentially labeled samples are multiplexed and analyzed by high-resolution 2-DE. This study presents a new 2-D DIGE protocol, in which complex protein samples from normal and leukemic human bone marrow mesenchymal progenitor cells were used as model samples for a novel combination of liquid-phase IEF with 2-D DIGE. Using liquid-phase IEF, the normal and leukemic cells were pre-fractionated into five subproteomes after multiplexing but prior to DIGE. Under these conditions, 2-D DIGE resolved >5000 protein-containing spots within the pH range 4.6-7.0. Differential labeling combined with subsequent MALDI-MS/MS identified proteins that were differentially expressed in leukemic cells. This analysis mapped protein identities to 128 mesenchymal progenitor cell proteins with at least one unique peptide match at >95% confidence. Of these proteins, 72 (56%) were expressed more than 1.25-fold higher or lower in leukemic cells compared with normal cells (p<0.05). These data were used to infer gene ontology biological processes that may be altered in leukemic bone marrow mesenchymal progenitor cells.",

In particular, the HSP70 chaperones in yeast mediate a large volume of protein folding through transient associations with their substrates. This chaperone interaction network can be disturbed by various perturbations, such as environmental stress or a gene deletion. Here, we consider deletions of two major chaperone proteins, SSA1 and SSB1, from the chaperone network in Sacchromyces cerevisiae. We employ a SILAC-based approach to examine changes in global and local protein abundance and rationalise our results via network analysis and graph theoretical approaches. Although the deletions result in an overall increase in intracellular protein content, correlated with an increase in cell size, this is not matched by substantial changes in individual protein concentrations. Despite the phenotypic robustness to deletion of these major hub proteins, it cannot be simply explained by the presence of paralogues. Instead, network analysis and a theoretical consideration of folding workload suggest that the robustness to perturbation is a product of the overall network structure. This highlights how quantitative proteomics and systems modelling can be used to rationalise emergent network properties, and how the HSP70 system can accommodate the loss of major hubs.",

Hence, understanding the biological traits that impact yield and quality of these products is the specific aim of much biological experimentation.

The aim of this review is to present an overview of the specific topics of interest within farm animal proteomics, and to highlight some of the areas where synergy between classic model organism proteomics and farm animal proteomics is rapidly emerging.

Damage to the myocardium occurs not only during ischemia, but also during reperfusion, where a massive release of oxygen-free radicals (OFR) occurs. We have previously utilized 2-DE and MS to define 57 protein spot changes during brief ischemia/reperfusion (15 min ischemia, 60 min reperfusion; 15I/60R) injury in a rabbit model (White, M. Y., Cordwell, S. J., McCarron, H. C. K., Prasan, A. M. et al., Proteomics 2005, 5, 1395-1410) and shown that the majority of these occur because of physical and/or chemical PTMs. In this study, we subjected rabbit myocardium to 15I/60R in the presence of the OFR scavenger N-(2-mercaptopropionyl) glycine (MPG). Thirty-seven of 57 protein spots altered during 15I/60R remained at control levels in the presence of MPG (15I/60R + MPG). Changes to contractile proteins, including myosin light chain 2 (MLC-2) and troponin C (TnC), were prevented by the addition of MPG. To further investigate the individual effects of ischemia and reperfusion, we generated 2-DE gels from rabbit myocardium subjected to brief ischemia alone (15I/0R), and observed alterations of 33 protein spots, including 18/20 seen in both 15I/60R-treated and 15I/60R + MPG-treated tissue. The tissue was also subjected to ischemia in the presence of MPG (15I/0R + MPG), and 21 spot changes, representing 14 protein variants, remained altered despite the presence of the OFR scavenger. These ischemia-specific proteins comprised those involved in energy metabolism (lactate dehydrogenase and ATP synthase alpha), redox regulation (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase 51 kDa and GST Mu), and stress response (Hsp27 and 70, and deamidated alpha B-crystallin). We conclude that contractile dysfunction associated with myocardial stunning is predominantly caused by OFR damage at the onset of reperfusion, but that OFR-independent damage also occurs during ischemia. These ischemia-specific protein modifications may be indicative of early myocardial injury.",

Unlike humans, most animals produce little or no triglycerides in hair follicles to harbor Propionibacterium acnes a fact that has encumbered the development of novel treatments for acne lesions. Although genetic mutant mice with acne-like skins have been used for screening anti-acne drugs, the mice generally have deficits in immune system that turns out to be inappropriate to generate antibodies for developing acne vaccines. Here, we employed a bioengineering approach using a tissue chamber integrated with a dermis-based cell-trapped system (DBCTS) to mimic the in vivo microenvironment of acne lesions. Human sebocyte cell lines were grown in DBCTS as a scaffold and inserted into a perforated tissue chamber. After implantation of a tissue chamber bearing human sebocytes into ICR mice, P. acnes or PBS was injected into a tissue chamber to induce host immune response. Infiltrated cells such as neutrophils and macrophages were detectable in tissue chamber fluids. In addition, a proinflammatory cytokine macrophage-inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) was elevated after P. acnes injection. In tissue chamber fluids, 13 proteins including secreted proteins and cell matrix derived from mouse, human cells or P. acnes were identified by proteomics using isotope-coded protein label (ICPL) coupled to nano-LC-MS analysis. After P. acnes infection, four proteins including fibrinogen, alpha polypeptide, fibrinogen beta chain, S100A9, and serine protease inhibitor A3K showed altered concentrations in the mimicked acne microenvironment. The bioengineered acne model thus provides an in vivo microenvironment to study the interaction of host with P. acnes and offers a unique set-up for screening novel anti-acne drugs and vaccines.",

The ability to adapt to oxidative stress associated with host immune defense may be one mechanism by which P. aeruginosa establishes infection in the cystic fibrosis lung and eventually out-competes other pathogenic bacteria to persist into chronic infection. We utilized a proteomics approach to identify the proteins associated with the oxidative stress response of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to hydrogen peroxide and superoxide-inducing paraquat. 2-DE and MS allowed for the identification of 59 and 58 protein spots that were statistically significantly altered following H(2) O(2) and paraquat treatment, respectively. We observed a unique mass and pI pattern for alkylhydroperoxide reductase C (AhpC) that was replicated by hypothetical protein PA3529 following treatment with 10\u2009mM H(2) O(2) . AhpC belongs to the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin family and is a redox enzyme responsible for removing peroxides in bacterial cells. MS analysis showed that PA3529 was altered by the formation of a dimer via a disulfide bond in a manner analogous to that known for AhpC, and by cysteine overoxidation to Cys-sulfonic acid (SO(3) H) postoxidative stress. PA3529 is therefore a functional AhpC paralog expressed under H(2) O(2) stress. Following paraquat-induced oxidative stress, we also observed the overabundance and likely oxidative modification of a second hypothetical antioxidant protein (PA3450) that shares sequence similarity with 1-Cys peroxiredoxins. Other induced proteins included known oxidative stress proteins (superoxide dismutase and catalase), as well as those involved in iron acquisition (siderophore biosynthesis and receptor proteins FpvA and FptA) and hypothetical proteins, including others predicted to be antioxidants (PA0848). These data suggest that P. aeruginosa contains a plethora of novel antioxidant proteins that contribute to its increased resistance against oxidative stress.",

In the absence of a complete camel genome sequence, the number of protein identifications was maximised by searching three primary sequence databases: Swiss-Prot, alpaca and camel EST. This search strategy enabled the identification of 1274 peptide sequences, of which 735 were found in at least two independent samples. Functional annotations for proteins identified from alpaca and camel EST sequences were mapped from basic local alignment search tool (protein) searches. These 735 peptides, which included many novel sequences found only in the camel EST database, were grouped to 147 protein descriptors. Gene ontology term analysis of human proteins with sequence similarity showed that camel urine may be particularly enriched in proteins from extracellular compartments and vesicles, and with functions that include carbohydrate-binding and peptidase inhibitor activities. If their biological functions are conserved between species, many of the camel urinary proteins could be involved in various stress and immune responses, and some may have antimicrobial activities.

Multivariate statistical tests, which look for correlated changes between sample types, provide an alternate approach for identifying spots with differential expression. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), a multivariate statistical approach, was combined with an iterative threshold process to identify which protein spots had the greatest contribution to the model, and compared to univariate test for three datasets. This included one dataset where no biological difference was expected. The novel multivariate approach, detailed here, represents a method to complement the univariate approach in identification of differentially expressed protein spots.

Therefore, we applied an alternative electrophoretic technique for separating membrane proteins: two-dimensional BAC/SDS electrophoresis (2-DB) using the cationic detergent benzyldimethyl-n-hexadecylammonium chloride in the first and the anionic detergent SDS in the second dimension. The use of 2-DB resulted in an improved separation of hydrophobic proteins. Thus, extremely hydrophobic proteins such as cytochrome-c oxidase subunit I with a grand average hydrophobicity (GRAVY) index of 0.74 and a total of 12 known transmembrane domains (TMD) or Sec61alpha with a GRAVY index of 0.56 and a total of ten known TMD could be identified by MS/MS analyses of protein spots derived from 2-DB gels.",

Of these, 138 were annotated as hypothetical in the genome databases and the rest could be assigned to several metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, transport, and structural functions. Comparative analysis with a whole cell proteome study resulted in the validation of the expression of 173 additional proteins. Of these, 38 proteins previously reported in other stages were not found in the only large-scale study of the total epimastigote stage proteome. A selected set of identified proteins was analyzed further to investigate gene copy number, sequence variation, transmembrane domains, and targeting signals. The genes were cloned and the proteins expressed with a c-myc epitope tag in T. cruzi epimastigotes. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the localization of these proteins in different cellular compartments such as ER, acidocalcisome, mitochondrion, and putative cytoplasmic transport or delivery vesicles.

Included are acid-soluble proteins, several known and predicted coat proteins, and proteins of unknown function. Over half of these proteins are small (less than 100 amino acids) and would have been undetectable by conventional gel-based analysis. We also identified 20 proteins, whose levels modestly increased at the later time points when metabolism has likely resumed. Taken together, our data show that isobaric labeling of complex mixtures is particularly effective for temporal studies. Furthermore, we describe a rigorous statistical approach to define relevant changes that takes into account the nature of data obtained from multidimensional protein identification technology coupled with the use of isobaric tags.

The quality of the identification depends on the studied organism, its complexity and its representation in the protein databases. Nevertheless, this basic function identification is insufficient for certain applications namely for the development of RNA-based gene-silencing strategies, commonly termed RNA interference (RNAi) in animals and post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants, that require an unambiguous identification of the targeted gene sequence. A PTGS strategy was considered in the study of the infection of Oryza sativa by the Rice Yellow Mottle Virus (RYMV). It is suspected that the RYMV recruits host proteins after its entry into plant cells to form a complex facilitating virus multiplication and spreading. The protein partners of this complex were identified by a classical proteomic approach, nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Among the identified proteins, several were retained for a PTGS strategy. Nevertheless most of the protein candidates appear to be members of multigenic families for which all paralog genes are not present in protein databases. Thus the identification of the real expressed paralog gene with classical protein database searches is impossible. Consequently, as the genome contains all genes and thus all paralog genes, a whole genome search strategy was developed to determine the specific expressed paralog gene. With this approach, the identification of peptides matching only a single gene, called discriminant peptides, allows definitive proof of the expression of this identified gene. This strategy has several requirements: (i) a genome completely sequenced and accessible; (ii) high protein sequence coverage. In the present work, through three examples, we report and validate for the first time a genome database search strategy to specifically identify paralog genes belonging to multigenic families expressed under specific conditions.",

We here elucidate the potential of interfacing Orbitrap-MS to ion-pair RP HPLC for intact protein analysis. Using gradients of ACN and monolithic columns of 1.0 and 0.10\u2009mm id, peak capacities between 120 and 130 were achievable within 20-25 min separation time. Compared with silica-based stationary phases, protein recovery and carryover from monolithic columns were found clearly superior. Intact proteins were detectable in a mass range covering 5.7-150 kDa with LODs in the low femtomol range. Compared with UV detection, MS detection with a scanning speed of 1.6 s per spectrum on average led to a 26% increase in chromatographic peak widths, whereas chromatographic patterns were mostly preserved in extracted ion chromatograms at an acquisition rate of 0.5 s per spectrum. Isotopic resolution of multiply charged ions was demonstrated for proteins up to 42 kDa. A micro-HPLC-Orbitrap-MS setup employing a 1.0 mm id column was utilized to characterize a 150 kDa recombinant monoclonal antibody. The applicability of nano-HPLC-Orbitrap-MS to the analysis of highly complex protein mixtures is demonstrated for the 70% ethanol extractable subproteome of wheat grains.",

However, genome sequencing does not reveal which genes are expressed by individual isolates. Here, we have therefore performed a comprehensive survey of the composition and variability of the S. aureus exoproteome. This involved multilocus sequence typing, virulence gene, and prophage profiling by multiplex PCR, and proteomic analyses of secreted proteins using 2-DE. Dissection of the exoproteomes of 25 clinical isolates revealed that only seven out of 63 identified secreted proteins were produced by all isolates, indicating a remarkably high exoproteome heterogeneity within one bacterial species. Most interesting, the observed variations were caused not only by genome plasticity, but also by an unprecedented variation in secretory protein production due to differences in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Our data imply that genomic studies on virulence gene conservation patterns need to be complemented by analyses of the extracellular protein pattern to assess the full virulence potential of bacterial pathogens like S. aureus. Importantly, the extensive variability of secreted virulence factors in S. aureus also suggests that development of protective vaccines against this pathogen requires a carefully selected combination of invariably produced antigens.",

Patients often present symptoms at a late stage, and there is a high recurrence rate after treatment. In this article, we report the first proteomic analysis of oral tongue carcinoma to globally search for tumor related proteins. Apart from helping us to understand the molecular pathogenesis of the carcinoma, these proteins may also have potential clinical applications as biomarkers, enabling the tumor to be identified at an early stage in high risk individuals, treatment response to be predicted, and residual or recurrent carcinoma to be detected sooner after treatment. The protein expression profiles of ten oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas and their matched normal mucosal resection margins were examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy. A number of tumor-associated proteins including heat shock protein (HSP)60, HSP27, \u03b1 B-crystalline, ATP synthase \u03b2, calgranulin B, myosin, tropomyosin and galectin 1 were consistently found to be significantly altered in their expression levels in tongue carcinoma tissues, compared with their paired normal mucosae. The expression profile portrays a global protein alteration that appears specific to oral tongue cancer. The potential of utilizing these tumor related proteins for screening cancer and monitoring recurrence warrants further investigation.",

However, the functional properties and mechanisms of this bacterium under stress conditions are rarely reported and still need more understanding on how the bacterium can survive in stress environments. In this study, we examined the oxidative stress induced proteins of this bacterium by proteomic approach combining two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. When the bacterium encountered oxidative stress, peroxiredoxin, as an antioxidant enzyme, is one of the interesting stressed proteins which appeared to be systematically increased with different pI. There are four isoforms of peroxiredoxin, denoted as Prx I, Prx II, Prx III and Prx IV, which are observed at the same molecular weight of 27 kDa but differ in pI values of 5.0, 4.87, 4.81 and 4.79, respectively. The H2O2 concentration directly increased Prx II, Prx III and Prx IV intensities, but decreased Prx I intensity. These shifting of peroxiredoxin isoforms may occur by a post-translational modification. Otherwise, the longer time of oxidative stress had not affected the expression level of peroxiredoxin isoforms. Therefore, this finding of peroxiredoxin intends to know the bacterial adaptation under oxidative stress. Otherwise, this protein plays an important role in many physiological processes and able to use in the industrial applications.",

After imbibition in water, ABA, or GA3 solutions, beechnuts were subjected to cold stratification, which breaks their dormancy. ABA delayed, whereas GA3 promoted seed dormancy breaking. Proteome maps for water, ABA, and GA3 were established, which displayed 1544 silver-stained spots. A total of 74 spots, showing significant changes in volume, were identified by MS. Of these, 18, 45, and 16 spots were identified as water-, ABA-, and GA3-responsive, respectively (five were regulated by both hormones). The classification of proteins showed that most of the proteins associated with dormancy breaking in water are involved in energy metabolism and protein destination. Most of the ABA-responsive proteins are involved in protein destination, energy metabolism, and development. Most of the GA3-responsive proteins are involved in energy metabolism (many more than for ABA and water) and plant defense. We conclude that the mechanism of seed dormancy breaking involves the proteins of many processes, beginning with hormone signal initiation, through signal transduction, transcription, protein synthesis, energy metabolism, storage materials, and ending with the cell cycle.",

RCC comprises a heterogeneous group of tumours with various molecular and cytogenetic abnormalities and different histological features as cell types and tumour architecture. Molecular genetic and proteomic tools led to the discovery of potential diagnostic prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers of RCC. In this review we discuss recent developments in understanding genotype-phenotype relationships, with attention to manganese superoxide dismutase, a mitochondrial enzyme related to the redox cycle which affects various regulatory functions of cells. The expression of this protein has been evaluated in numerous human tumour types including RCC, and post-translational modifications are being investigated.",

Using a three-step approach, we classified sera from rats with liver cirrhosis following different treatment insults. The approach consisted of: (i) protein profiling using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) technology; (ii) selection of a statistically significant serum biomarker set using machine learning algorithms; and (iii) identification of selected serum biomarkers by peptide sequencing. We generated serum protein profiles from three groups of rats: (i) normal (n=8), (ii) thioacetamide-induced liver cirrhosis (n=22), and (iii) bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrosis (n=5) using a weak cation exchanger surface. Profiling data were further analyzed by a recursive support vector machine algorithm to select a panel of statistically significant biomarkers for class prediction. Sensitivity and specificity of classification using the selected protein marker set were higher than 92%. A consistently down-regulated 3495 Da protein in cirrhosis samples was one of the selected significant biomarkers. This 3495 Da protein was purified on-chip and trypsin digested. Further structural characterization of this biomarkers candidate was done by using cross-platform matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight/time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Combined data from PMF and MS/MS spectra of two tryptic peptides suggested that this 3495 Da protein shared homology to a histidine-rich glycoprotein. These results demonstrated a novel approach to discovery of new biomarkers for early detection of liver cirrhosis and classification of liver diseases.",

Using narrow range 2-DE gels and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, we identified three sex steroid-regulated proteins: the galectin-related-inter-fiber (GRIFIN) which is a galectin family member protein of unknown function, the fatty acid-binding protein epidermal-5 (FABP5) protein responsible for the fatty acid uptake and transport and the small heat shock \u03b1A-crystallin (CRYAA) protein involved in preventing aggregation of denatured or unfolded proteins. Changes in the expression of these proteins revealed a predominant estrogenic effect and the multiple CRYAA protein species reflected posttranslational modifications. Sex steroid-mediated modifications of CRYAA were confirmed by Western blotting analysis. This study provides new target proteins for sex steroids with a potential link to age-related diseases associated with proteotoxic stress.",

The total number of non-redundant protein identifications from each experiment was: 524 proteins by 2-D (SCX/C18) nanoflow liquid chromatography-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-LC MS/MS (MudPIT)); 381 proteins by nanoLC-MS/MS with gas phase fractionation by mass range selection; 390 proteins by nanoLC-MS/MS with gas phase fractionation by ion abundance selection; 898 proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) separation of proteins, in-gel digestion, and nanoLC-MS/MS of gel slices; and 422 proteins by isoelectric focusing of proteins, in-gel digestion and nanoLC-MS/MS of gel slices. The total number of non-redundant protein identifications in the five experiments was 1204. Combining only the two best experiments, the SDS-PAGE gel slices and the Mudpit, produces 1024 proteins identified, more than 85% of the total.

Immunohistochemistry revealed absence of secretagogin-expressing cells in most of the colorectal cancer tissue specimens. However, some colorectal cancers were characterized by secretagogin-expressing cells. In normal mucosa, positively stained cells exhibited a neuroendocrine cell-characteristic morphology and mucosal location. In colorectal cancer tissues, secretagogin-expressing cells were characterized by a malignant morphology.

Proteomic studies have identified proteins and biochemical pathways that may be involved in molecular crosstalk in BFA-pathogen associations. Future work can build upon this promising start and functional analyses coupled with interactome bioassays will be carried out to investigate the role of candidate peptides and proteins in BFA-human pathogen associations.

        "abstract": "This study employed differential proteomic and immunoassay techniques to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms utilized by human muscle (vastus lateralis) in response to high altitude hypoxia exposure. Two groups of subjects, participating in a medical research expedition (A, n = 5, 19 d at 5300 m altitude; B, n = 6, 66 d up to 8848 m) underwent a \u2248 30% drop of muscular creatine kinase and of glycolytic enzymes abundance. Protein abundance of most enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation was reduced both in A and, particularly, in B. Restriction of \u03b1-ketoglutarate toward succinyl-CoA resulted in increased prolyl hydroxylase 2 and glutamine synthetase. Both A and B were characterized by a reduction of elongation factor 2 alpha, controlling protein translation, and by an increase of heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein involved in chaperone-mediated autophagy. Increased protein levels of catalase and biliverdin reductase occurred in A alongside a decrement of voltage-dependent anion channels 1 and 2 and of myosin-binding protein C, suggesting damage to the sarcomeric structures. This study suggests that during acclimatization to hypobaric hypoxia the muscle behaves as a producer of substrates activating a metabolic reprogramming able to support anaplerotically the tricarboxylic acid cycle, to control protein translation, to prevent energy expenditure and to activate chaperone-mediated autophagy.",

A total of 1332 proteins were identified and quantified, and 127 proteins were characterized as differentially expressed between adult and cord neutrophils. The differentially expressed proteins are mapped in KEGG pathways into five clusters and indicated impaired functions of neonatal neutrophils in proteasome, lysosome, phagosome, and leukocyte transendothelial migration. In particular, many proteins associated with NETosis, a critical mechanism for antimicrobial process and auto-clearance, were also found to be downregulated in cord neutrophils.

Moreover, less abundant proteins are difficult to identify. To simplify the proteome, and explore functional associations, nondenaturing anion exchange column chromatography was used to separate a soluble protein extract from Escherichia coli. Successive fractions were then analysed using 2-D PAGE and selected spots from both the gels for the start material and the fractionated material were quantified and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Enrichments of up to 13-fold were attained for individual protein spots and peptide mass fingerprints were of significantly higher quality after chromatographic separation. The marked anomalies between predicted p/and column elution position contrasted with the almost perfect correlation with migration distance on isoelectric focusing (IEF) and were explored further for basic proteins.",

Hypothalamic neurons monitor and respond to alterations of circulating nutrients and hormones that reflect the peripheral energy status. These extracellular signals are integrated within the cell at the ATP:AMP ratio and at the level of ROS, triggering gene expression associated with glucose and lipid metabolism. In order to identify new molecular factors potentially associated with the control of energy homeostasis, metabolic adaptation, and regulation of feed intake, hypothalami from ad libitum fed and energy restricted cows were characterized using 2-DE and MALDI-TOF-MS. Among 189 different protein spots identified, nine proteins were found to be differentially expressed between groups. Beside the 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase, stress-induced phosphoprotein-1, heat shock protein 70 kDa-protein-5, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein-2, [Cu-Zn]-superoxide dismutase, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1, and inorganic pyrophosphatase were found to be up-regulated, whereas glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and aconitase-2 were down-regulated in the restricted group. In conclusion, differentially expressed proteins are related to energy and nucleotide metabolism and cellular stress under conditions of dietary energy deficiency. These proteins may be new candidate molecules that are potentially involved in signaling for maintaining energy homeostasis.",

Seventy-five out of 196 differential proteins were positively identified. Based on the functions, these proteins were grouped into nine categories, covering a wide range of molecular processes including the secondary metabolites (caffeoylquinic acids and iridoids) biosynthetic-related proteins, photosynthesis, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, stress, DNA, transport-related proteins, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, cell wall. Of note is the increasing expression of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase and 5-enol-pyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase, which was crucial to supply more precursor for the secondary metabolites including caffeoylquinic acids and iridoids.

The 2DE approach after PEG-fractionation of total proteins coupled with MS (MALDI-TOF/TOF and nESI-LC-MS/MS) analyses led to identification of 49 unique proteins out of 63 differential spots. SDS-PAGE in combination with nESI-LC-MS/MS shotgun approach was applied to identify secreted proteins in the leaf apoplast upon infection and resulted in cataloging of 501 unique proteins, of which 470 and 31 proteins were secreted from rice and C. miyabeanus, respectively. Proteins mapped onto metabolic pathways implied their reprogramming upon infection. The enzymes involved in Calvin cycle and glycolysis decreased in their protein abundance, whereas enzymes in the TCA cycle, amino acids, and ethylene biosynthesis increased. Differential proteomes also generated distribution of identified proteins in the intracellular and extracellular spaces, providing a better insight into defense responses of proteins in rice against C. miyabeanus.

However, randomized trials of hormone replacement therapy with synthetic estrogens in humans failed confirmation and phytoestrogens, natural plant hormones with agonistic properties for estrogen receptors, could represent potential alternatives. The aim of the present study is to characterize an animal model for alternative hormone replacement with genistein as a natural estrogenic compound. We performed a 2-DE/ESI-LC-MS approach in order to identify protein species varying with genistein receipt and sex in their relative abundance in the healthy murine heart (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE). Oral genistein treatment revealed a substantial effect on the relative abundance of both estrogen receptors. Several enzymes of the fatty acid metabolism and their transcriptional regulators varied differentially in male and in female animals, at the transcript and/or the protein species level. Increased levels of enzyme species involved in the oxidative phosphorylation and generation of ROS were accompanied by decreased amounts of antioxidants in male mice receiving genistein compared with control males, which have been previously associated with various pathological conditions. Exposure of female animals to genistein provoked an increased abundance of two species of LIM domain-binding protein and one species of desmin. These proteins have been associated with cardiac hypertrophy and our data warrant caution for the use of them as molecular markers, since the animals did not exhibit any histological signs of cardiac hypertrophy.",

This allows us to use various fractionation schemes before the protease digestion, which is expected to improve the coverage of the analyzed protein mixture and also to provide an additional insight into the structure of the purified macromolecular complex and the nature of protein-protein interactions involved. We illustrate our new approach by analysis of soluble nuclear complexes containing histone H4 purified from HeLa cells. In particular, we observed different fractionation patterns of HAT1 and RbAp46 proteins as compared with RbAp48 protein, all identified as interaction partners of H4 histone. In addition, we report all components of the licensing MCM2-7 complex and the apoptosis-related DAXX protein among the interaction partners of the soluble H4. Finally, we show that HAT1 requires N-terminal tail of H4 for its stable association with this histone.",

The result showed a sensitivity of 100% for SARS patients and a specificity of 92.8% for controls. Furthermore, the levels of these proteins significantly correlated with certain clinico-pathological parameters. The dramatic increase in TF-alpha(1)-AT may be the result of degradation of alpha(1)-AT. As alpha(1)-AT plays an important role in the protection of lung function, its degradation may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of SARS. These findings indicate that increased TF-alpha(1)-AT may be therapeutically relevant, and may also be a useful biological marker for the diagnosis of SARS.",

Human embryonal carcinoma cells (ECCs), stem cells of human teratocarcinomas, are considered a close but malignant counterpart to human ESCs. In this study, a comprehensive quantitative proteomic analysis of ESCs and ECCs was carried out using the iTRAQ method. Using two-dimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry analyses, we identified and quantitated ~1,800 proteins. Among these are proteins associated with pluripotency and development as well as tight junction signaling and TGF beta receptor pathway. Nearly ~200 proteins exhibit >2 fold difference in abundance between ESCs and ECCs. Examples of early developmental markers high in ESCs include beta- galactoside-binding lectin (LGALS1), undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor-1 (UTF1), DNA cytosine methyltransferase 3 isoform-B (DNMT3B), melanoma antigen family-A4 (MAGEA4), and interferon induced transmembrane protein-1 (IFITM1). In contrast, CD99-antigen (CD99), growth differentiation factor-3 (GDF3), cellular retinoic acid binding protein-2 (CRABP2), and developmental pluripotency associated-4 (DPPA4) were among the highly expressed proteins in ECCs. Several proteins that were highly expressed in ECCs such as heat shock 27 kDa protein-1 (HSPB1), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MAP3K1), nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor like-2 (NFKBIL2), and S100 calcium-binding protein-A4 (S100A4) have also been attributed to malignancy in other systems. Importantly, immunocytochemistry was used to validate the proteomic analyses for a subset of the proteins. In summary, this is the first large scale quantitative proteomic study of human ESCs and ECCs, which provides critical information about the regulators of these two closely related, but developmentally-distinct, stem cells.",

Using these, the strength and signifi-cance of expression level-dependent features in codon usage were determined for the genes of the Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Haemophilus influenzae genomes. The comparison of codon usage features with protein abundance data confirmed a relationship between these to be present, although exceptions to this, possibly related to functional context, were found.

To investigate the effects of light on the plant responses to cadmium (Cd) stress, we performed a comparative physiological and proteomic analysis of light- and dark-grown Arabidopsis cells after exposure to Cd. Treatment with different concentrations of Cd resulted in stress-related phenotypes such as cell growth inhibition and decline of cell viability. Notably, light-grown cells were more sensitive to heavy metal toxicity than dark-grown cells, and the basis for this appears to be the elevated Cd accumulation, which is twice as much under light than dark growth conditions. Protein profiles analyzed by 2D DIGE revealed a total of 162 protein spots significantly changing in abundance in response to Cd under at least one of these two growing conditions. One hundred and ten of these differentially expressed protein spots were positively identified by MS/MS and they are involved in multiple cellular responses and metabolic pathways. Sulfur metabolism-related proteins increased in relative abundance both in light- and dark-grown cells after exposure to Cd. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, redox homeostasis, and anti-oxidative processes were decreased both in light- and dark-grown cells, with the decrease being lower in the latter case. Remarkably, proteins associated with cell wall biosynthesis, protein folding, and degradation showed a light-dependent response to Cd stress, with the expression level increased in darkness but suppressed in light. The possible biological importance of these changes is discussed.",

Our goal is to alert the scientific community about the associated bias that definitely should be avoided, and to provide critical recommendations on sample preparation and experimental design, in order to better take advantage of the aptness of proteomic approaches aiming at improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms in biomineralization.",

More than 5200 non-redundant proteins were identified with 23, four, and four proteins identified uniquely in basal, HER2-neu-amplified, and luminal breast cancer cells, respectively. An in silico mRNA analysis using publicly available breast cancer tissue microarray data was carried out as a preliminary verification step.

Eighteen out of 31 proteins were quantified in the proteomes of ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer tissues.

To complement this distributed approach, we also performed centralized analysis of the raw MS/MS data provided by the participants. Due to the data redundancy inherent in such a project, centralized analysis has the potential to reduce the computational effort by reducing redundancy before the analysis. Centralized analysis can also unify the process and take advantage of data sharing among laboratories to improve protein identification and validation.

We have conducted a meta-analysis using several million peptide observations from five model eukaryotes, establishing a consistent, semi-quantitative analysis pipeline. By inferring and comparing protein abundances across orthologs, we observe: (i) the accuracy of spectral counting predictions increases with sampling depth and can rival that of direct biochemical measurements, (ii) the quantitative makeup of the consistently observed core proteome in eukaryotes is remarkably stable, with abundance correlations exceeding R(S)=0.7 at an evolutionary distance greater than 1000 million years, and (iii) some groups of proteins are more constrained than others. We argue that our observations reveal stabilizing selection: central parts of the eukaryotic proteome appear to be expressed at well-balanced, near-optimal abundance levels. This is consistent with our further observations that essential proteins show lower abundance variations than non-essential proteins, and that gene families that tend to undergo gene duplications are less well constrained than families that keep a single-copy status.",

It is evident that mitochondrial defects and the dysfunctions of oxidative phosphorylation and energy production in ovarian cancer cells were directly related to their resistance to platinum drugs. Using 2-D DIGE, we compared mitochondrial proteins from two platinum-sensitive human ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3 and A2780) with that of four platinum-resistant sublines (SKOV3/CDDP, SKOV3/CBP, A2780/CDDP, and A2780/CBP). Among the 236 differentially expressed spots, five mitochondrial proteins (ATP-\u03b1, PRDX3, PHB, ETF, and ALDH) that participate in the electron transport respiratory chain were identified through mass spectrometry. All of them are downregulated in one or two of the platinum-resistant cell lines. Three proteins (ATP-\u03b1, PRDX3, and PHB) were validated by using western blot and immunohistochemistry. There is a significant decrease of PHB in tumor tissues from ovarian cancer patients who were resistant to platinum-based chemotherapies. This is the first direct mitochondrial proteomic comparison between platinum-sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cells. These studies demonstrated that 2-D DIGE-based proteomic analysis could be a powerful tool to investigate limited mitochondrial proteins, and the association of PHB expression with platinum resistance indicates that mitochondria defects may contribute to platinum resistance in ovarian cancer cells.",

Comparison of the protein profiles of Golgi-enriched fractions of cells that were either mock infected or infected with mouse hepatitis virus revealed the significant depletion or enrichment of 116 proteins. Although ribosomal/nucleic acid binding proteins were enriched in the Golgi-fractions of mouse hepatitis virus-infected cells, proteins annotated to localize to several organelles of the secretory pathway were overrepresented among the proteins that were depleted from these fractions upon infection. We hypothesized that proteins, of which the abundance or distribution is affected by infection, are likely to be involved in the virus life cycle. Indeed, depletion of a small subset of the affected proteins by using small interfering RNAs identified several host factors involved in coronavirus infection. Transfection of small interfering RNAs targeting either C11orf59 or Golgi apparatus glycoprotein 1 resulted in increased virus replication, whereas depletion of vesicle-trafficking protein vesicle-trafficking protein sec22b enhanced the release of infectious progeny virus. Overexpression of these proteins, on the other hand, had a negative effect on virus replication. Overall, our study shows that the SILAC approach is a suitable tool to study host-pathogen interactions and to identify host proteins involved in virus replication.",

The overall functional characterization of the 162 identified proteins from primary cultures of HUVECs confirms the metabolic capabilities of endothelium and illustrates various cellular functions more related to cell motility and angiogenesis, protein folding, anti-oxidant defenses, signal transduction, proteasome pathway and resistance to apoptosis. In comparison with controls cells, the differential proteomic analysis of HUVECs treated by the pro-apoptotic topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide further revealed the variation of eight proteins, namely, GRP78, GRP94, valosin-containing protein, proteinase inhibitor 9, cofilin, 37-kDa laminin receptor protein, bovine apolipoprotein, and tropomyosin. These data suggest that etoposide-induced apoptosis of human vascular endothelial cells results from the intricate involvement of multiple apoptosis processes including at least the mitochondrial and the ER stress pathways.

Previous reports have shown that inhibition of the ERK pathway in mammalian cells delays entry as well as progression through mitosis, suggesting the existence of molecular targets of this pathway in M phase. In this report we employed 2-DE and MS to survey proteins and PTMs in the presence versus absence of MKK1/2 inhibitor. Targets of the ERK pathway in G2/M were identified as elongation factor 2 (EF2) and nuclear matrix protein, 55 kDa (Nmt55). Phosphorylation of each protein increased under conditions of ERK pathway inhibition, suggesting indirect control of these targets; regulation of EF2 was ascribed to phosphorylation and inactivation of upstream EF2 kinase, whereas regulation of Nmt55 was ascribed to a delay in normal mitotic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. 2-DE Western blots probed using anti-phospho-Thr-Pro antibody demonstrated that the effect of ERK inhibition is not to delay the onset of phosphorylation controlled by cdc2 and other mitotic kinases, but rather to regulate a small subset of targets in M phase in a nonoverlapping manner with cdc2.",

Mxi1 protein, which is a c-myc antagonist, may be essential in controlling cellular growth and differentiation. Previously, multiple tubular cysts were observed in kidney of Mxi1-deficient mice aged 6 months and more. Presently, 2-DE and MALDI-TOF MS was employed to identify the differentially expressed proteins in the kidney. Several proteins were identified, among them, apolipoproteinA1 which is a major component of the high-density lipoprotein complex and has anti-inflammation effects, was significantly decreased in the Mxi1-deficient mouse. We confirm the development of inflammation and renal fibrosis and the expression of extracellular matrix molecules including transforming growth factor were also increased in cystic kidney. These results indicate that expression of proteins related with inflammation and renal fibrosis changes by Mxi1 inactivation in polycystic kidney.",

This reaction has a dual purpose: (i) to allow the relative protein quantification in two different conditions and (ii) to restrict the positive charges of peptides to the presence of arginine and histidine. The N-acylated peptides are separated by cation-exchange chromatography into two groups, neutral and singly charged peptides (R+H<or=1) that are neither retained nor analyzed, whereas the multiply charged peptides (R+H>1) are retained into the column and can be eluted in batch or further fractionated using a saline gradient before LC-MS/MS analysis. In silico analysis revealed that the selective isolation of RH peptides considerably simplifies the complex mixture of peptides (three RH peptides/protein) and at the same time they represent 84% of the whole proteomes. The selectivity, and recovery of the method were evaluated with model proteins and with a complex mixture of proteins extracted from Vibrio cholerae.",

Human embryonal carcinoma cells (ECCs), stem cells of human teratocarcinomas, are considered a close but malignant counterpart to human ESCs. In this study, a comprehensive quantitative proteomic analysis of ESCs and ECCs was carried out using the iTRAQ method. Using two-dimensional LC and MS/MS analyses, we identified and quantitated approximately 1800 proteins. Among these are proteins associated with pluripotency and development as well as tight junction signaling and TGFbeta receptor pathway. Nearly approximately 200 proteins exhibit more than twofold difference in abundance between ESCs and ECCs. Examples of early developmental markers high in ESCs include beta-galactoside-binding lectin, undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor-1, DNA cytosine methyltransferase 3beta isoform-B, melanoma antigen family-A4, and interferon-induced transmembrane protein-1. In contrast, CD99-antigen (CD99), growth differentiation factor-3, cellular retinoic acid binding protein-2, and developmental pluripotency associated-4 were among the highly expressed proteins in ECCs. Several proteins that were highly expressed in ECCs such as heat shock 27 kDa protein-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1, nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor like-2, and S100 calcium-binding protein-A4 have also been attributed to malignancy in other systems. Importantly, immunocytochemistry was used to validate the proteomic analyses for a subset of the proteins. In summary, this is the first large-scale quantitative proteomic study of human ESCs and ECCs, which provides critical information about the regulators of these two closely related, but developmentally distinct, stem cells.",

The most widely used protease, trypsin, has high specificity and generates peptides that are considered to be ideally suited for bottom-up LC-MS technology. By exploiting key factors affecting enzymatic activity we obtained a simple, straightforward, and rapid in-solution digest protocol that performed better than the conventional overnight digestion method in terms of amino acid coverage of proteins, number of peptides generated, and peptide ion abundances. Prolonged digestion time, such as overnight digestion, leads to decline in protein amino acid coverage and loss of tryptic peptides. This was found to be caused by complete digestion by trypsin leading to an increased number of small peptides that are not LC-MS detectable. Slow-rate nontryptic digestion of peptides is a contributing factor for loss of peptide ion intensities during extended digestion time. Our work demonstrates that for both qualitative and quantitative bottom-up proteomic studies it is beneficial to prevent trypsin digestion to go to completion by reducing treatment time from the conventional several hours to a few minutes cleavage time.",

Proteins were extracted from the bacterial cells, separated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography and mass analyzed. At the end of the chromatography run, the uncharged masses of the multiply charged proteins were determined via automated software routines. The resulting data provided an accurate mass expression profile of the proteins found in the individual strains. From the individual expression profiles, it was possible to identify unique proteins corresponding to strains with thermal resistance. One protein found only in the thermal tolerant strains was sequenced and identified as homologous to a hypothetical protein found in the thermal tolerant bacteria, Methylobacillus flagellatus KT.

Members of the Betaproteobacteria (i.e. Dechloromonas, Ralstonia, Rhodoferax, Polaromonas, Delftia, Chromobacterium) and the Firmicutes dominated the biostimulated aquifer community. Proteome characterization revealed distinct differences between the microbial biomass collected from groundwater influenced by biostimulation and groundwater collected upgradient of the EVO injection points.

Interestingly, the atypical NosZ of Dechloromonas spp. was highly abundant, suggesting active nitrous oxide (N2 O) respiration. c-Type cytochromes were barely detected, as was citrate synthase, a biomarker for hexavalent uranium reduction activity, suggesting that uranium reduction has not commenced 4 days post EVO amendment.

        "abstract": "High-throughput MS/MS was used to identify proteins secreted by Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae) during growth on 13 media in vitro and in planta during infection of wheat heads. In vitro secreted proteins were collected from the culture filtrates, and in planta proteins were collected by vacuum infiltration. A total of 289 proteins (229 in vitro and 120 in planta) were identified with high statistical confidence. Forty-nine of the in planta proteins were not found in any of the in vitro conditions. The majority (91-100%) of the in vitro proteins had predicted signal peptides, but only 56% of the in planta proteins. At least 13 of the nonsecreted proteins found only in planta were single-copy housekeeping enzymes, including enolase, triose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglucomutase, calmodulin, aconitase, and malate dehydrogenase. The presence of these proteins in the in planta but not in vitro secretome might indicate that significant fungal lysis occurs during pathogenesis. On the other hand, several of the proteins lacking signal peptides that were found in planta have been reported to be potent immunogens secreted by animal pathogenic fungi, and therefore could be important in the interaction between F. graminearum and its host plants.",

However, the presence of MB has been the subject of concern, and efforts have been made to efficiently remove the dye after photo-treatment. For this study, plasma was collected by apheresis from 10 donors (group A), then treated using the MacoPharma THERAFLEX procedure (MB; 1 microM, and light exposure; 180 J/cm(2)) (group B), and finally filtered in order to remove the dye (group C). Proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and peptides showing modifications were characterized by mass spectrometry. Clottable and antigenic fibrinogen levels, as well as fibrin polymerization time were measured. Analyses of the gels focused on a region corresponding to pI between 4.5 and 6.5, and M(r) from 7000 to 58 000. In this area, 387 +/- 47 spots matched, and four of these spots presented significant modifications. They corresponded to changes of the gamma-chain of fibrinogen, of transthyretin, and of apolipoprotein A-I, respectively. A decrease of clottable fibrinogen and a prolongation of fibrin polymerization time were observed in groups B and C. Removal of MB by filtration was not responsible for additional protein alterations. The effect of over-treatment of plasma by very high concentrations of MB (50 microM) in association with prolonged light exposure (3 h) was also analyzed, and showed complex alterations of most of the plasma proteins, including fibrinogen gamma-chain, transthyretin, and apolipoprotein A-I. Our data indicates that MB treatment at high concentration and prolonged illumination severely injure plasma proteins. By contrast, at the MB concentration used to inactivate viruses, damages are apparently very restricted.",

        "abstract": "Membrane proteomic analysis has been proven to be a promising tool for identifying new and specific biomarkers that can be used for prognosis and monitoring of various cancers. Membrane proteins are of great interest particularly those with functional domains exposed to the extracellular environment. Integral membrane proteins represent about one-third of the proteins encoded by the human genome and assume a variety of key biological functions, such as cell-to-cell communication, receptor-mediated signal transduction, selective transport, and pharmacological actions. More than two-thirds of membrane proteins are drug targets, highlighting their immensely important pharmaceutical significance. Most plasma membrane proteins and proteins from other cellular membranes have several PTMs; for example, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and nitrosylation, and moreover, PTMs of proteins are known to play a key role in tumor biology. These modifications often cause change in stoichiometry and microheterogeneity in a protein molecule, which is apparent during electrophoretic separation. Furthermore, the analysis of glyco- and phosphoproteome of cell membrane presents a number of challenges mainly due to their low abundance, their large dynamic range, and the inherent hydrophobicity of membrane proteins. Under pathological conditions, PTMs, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are frequently altered and have been recognized as a potential source for disease biomarkers. Thus, their accurate differential expression analysis, along with differential PTM analysis is of paramount importance. Here we summarize the current status of membrane-based biomarkers in various cancers, and future perspective of membrane biomarker research.",

Our results show that all sugars tested were catabolized via the bifid shunt. Sixty-eight proteins that exhibited changes in abundance of threefold or greater were identified by MS. A striking observation was the differential expression of proteins related to the pyruvate metabolism. Further analysis of acetic acid and lactic acid in the culture supernatants by HPLC at the end of fermentation showed that more lactic acid was produced during growth on fructose, ribose, xylose, galactose and more acetic acid was produced during the fermentation of glucose and mannose. Growth experiments revealed that B. longum NCC2705 preferentially used fructose, ribose, xylose, and galactose with higher growth rates over glucose and mannose. Furthermore, five proteins (GroEL, Eno, Tal, Pgm, and BL0033) exhibited clear phosphorylation modifications at serine and/or tyrosine residues. BL0033, a component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, was significantly more abundant in bacteria grown on fructose and, to a lesser extent, ribose and xylose. RT-PCR analysis revealed that all genes of the ABC transporter are induced in the presence of these sugars suggesting that BL0033, BL0034, BL0035, and BL0036 constitute an ABC transporter with fructose as preferred substrate.",

Analysis of human blood plasma is a challenge due to the large number of peptides and proteins present and the very wide range of concentrations. In order to identify as many proteins as possible for subsequent comparative studies, we developed an industrial-scale (2.5 liter) approach involving sample pooling for the analysis of smaller proteins (M(r) generally < ca. 40 000 and some fragments of very large proteins). Plasma from healthy males was depleted of abundant proteins (albumin and IgG), then smaller proteins and polypeptides were separated into 12 960 fractions by chromatographic techniques. Analysis of proteins and polypeptides was performed by mass spectrometry prior to and after enzymatic digestion. Thousands of peptide identifications were made, permitting the identification of 502 different proteins and polypeptides from a single pool, 405 of which are listed here. The numbers refer to chromatographically separable polypeptide entities present prior to digestion. Combining results from studies with other plasma pools we have identified over 700 different proteins and polypeptides in plasma. Relatively low abundance proteins such as leptin and ghrelin and peptides such as bradykinin, all invisible to two-dimensional gel technology, were clearly identified. Proteins of interest were synthesized by chemical methods for bioassays. We believe that this is the first time that the small proteins in human blood plasma have been separated and analyzed so extensively.",

Human embryonal carcinoma cells (ECCs), stem cells of human teratocarcinomas, are considered a close but malignant counterpart to human ESCs. In this study, a comprehensive quantitative proteomic analysis of ESCs and ECCs was carried out using the iTRAQ method. Using two-dimensional LC and MS/MS analyses, we identified and quantitated approximately 1800 proteins. Among these are proteins associated with pluripotency and development as well as tight junction signaling and TGFbeta receptor pathway. Nearly approximately 200 proteins exhibit more than twofold difference in abundance between ESCs and ECCs. Examples of early developmental markers high in ESCs include beta-galactoside-binding lectin, undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor-1, DNA cytosine methyltransferase 3beta isoform-B, melanoma antigen family-A4, and interferon-induced transmembrane protein-1. In contrast, CD99-antigen (CD99), growth differentiation factor-3, cellular retinoic acid binding protein-2, and developmental pluripotency associated-4 were among the highly expressed proteins in ECCs. Several proteins that were highly expressed in ECCs such as heat shock 27 kDa protein-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1, nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor like-2, and S100 calcium-binding protein-A4 have also been attributed to malignancy in other systems. Importantly, immunocytochemistry was used to validate the proteomic analyses for a subset of the proteins. In summary, this is the first large-scale quantitative proteomic study of human ESCs and ECCs, which provides critical information about the regulators of these two closely related, but developmentally distinct, stem cells.",

Endothelial cells isolated from native umbilical cords were subjected to 21, 5, or 1% O(2) for 24 h. 2-D PAGE was performed and candidate proteins were identified using LC-MS/MS. Lowering of O(2) from 21 to 5% induced upregulation of cofilin-1, cyclophilin A, tubulin and tubulin fragments, a fragment of glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) and calmodulin. The upregulation of Grp78 suggested that ER stress proteins were altered and indeed Grp94 and caspase 12 expression were increased in cells exposed to 5% O(2). The presence of ER stress is also supported by findings of blunted caffeine-evoked ER calcium release in cells exposed to 5 and 1% O(2). Exposure to 1% O(2) caused increases in cofilin-1, cyclophilin A, and caspase 12 as well as a decrease of beta-actin, but it did not alter the expression of calmodulin, tubulin, Grp78, and Grp94. Incubation with CoCl(2), a stabilizer of the hypoxia-inducible factor, increased the expression of several of the proteins. The present investigations reveal that lowering O(2), probably in part through hypoxia-inducible factor, alter the expression of a series of proteins mainly involved in cytoskeletal changes (e.g. cofilin-1, tubulin, and beta-actin) and in ER stress/apoptosis (e.g. Grp78/94, caspase 12, and cyclophilin A).",

To accomplish this, P. gingivalis cells were grown under conditions of hemin limitation (0.01 microg/mL) to avoid the oxygen protective effect of hemin on oxidative stress. The proteins were then extracted from cultures either left untreated or subjected to oxidative stress and separated by 2-DE.

To date, a comprehensive documentation of PTEN interacting proteins has not been performed. The goal of our study was to characterize the PTEN interactome using affinity pull-down and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Wild-type PTEN cDNA was inserted into pTRC-His2 vector to create a 6-His tagged protein, which was expressed in Escherichia coli. Lysate from a human lymphoma cell line was used in pull-down assays, utilizing affinity for nickel-agarose beads. Bound proteins were eluted with imidazole, digested and analyzed on an LCQ DecaXP ion trap mass spectrometer. The nickel affinity pull-down efficiency was evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Acquired data were searched against the NCBI nr.fasta nonredundant protein database using the SEQUEST algorithm and screened using INTERACT and ProteinProphet. All experiments were performed in duplicate with 6-His-lacZ serving as control. A total of 79 proteins were identified in the wild-type 6-His-PTEN pull-down by MS/MS. We further validated a subset of the proteins present in the PTEN interactome by performing immunoprecipitation using an anti-PTEN antibody and establishing the presence of the proteins in the immunocomplex by Western blot analysis. A search of published PTEN interactions was also performed using Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, Human Protein Reference Database, the IntAct Project database, and PubMed. This in silico analysis confirmed 42 out of 79 (53%) of the proteins identified by MS/MS. The remaining 37 proteins represent probable PTEN interactions not previously documented in public databases or reported in the literature. These results highlight the value of combining both in vitro biochemical approaches with in silico analyses for a comprehensive study of protein-protein interactions.",

In this model, the identified peptides were sampled from the designed proteins and their cross-correlation scores were simulated according to the results from reverse database searching. The simulated result of 18 control proteins was consistent with the experimental one, demonstrating the efficiency of our model. According to the simulated results of human liver sample, ProteinProphet returned slightly higher probabilities and lower specificity than real cases. PROT_PROBE was a more efficient method with higher specificity. Predicted results from a Poisson model roughly coincide with real datasets, and the method of two-peptide hits seems solid but imprecise. However, the probabilities of identified proteins are strongly correlated with several experimental factors including spectra number, database size and protein abundance distribution.",

The experimental design included two groups of rainbow trout, which were fed organic feed either with or without astaxanthin. In total, 96 proteins were found to be affected by tissue damage, clearly demonstrating in this lower vertebrate the complexity and magnitude of the cellular response, in the context of a regenerative process. Using a bioinformatics approach, the main biological function of these proteins were assigned, showing the regulation of proteins involved in processes such as apoptosis, iron homeostasis, and regulation of muscular structure. Interestingly, it was established that exclusively within the astaxanthin feed group, three members of the annexin protein family (annexin IV, V, and VI) were regulated in response to tissue damage.",

Analysis of copper toxicity was conducted in two strains of E. siliculosus isolated from (i) an uncontaminated coast in southern Peru (Es32) and (ii) a copper polluted rocky beach in northern Chile (Es524). Es32 was more sensitive than Es524, with toxicity detected at 50 microg/L Cu, whereas Es524 displayed negative effects only when exposed to 250 microg/L Cu. Differential soluble proteome profiling for each strain exposed to sub-lethal copper levels allowed to identify the induction of proteins related to processes such as energy production, glutathione metabolism as well as accumulation of HSPs. In addition, the inter-strain comparison of stress-related proteomes led to identify features related to copper tolerance in Es524, such as striking expression of a PSII Mn-stabilizing protein and a Fucoxanthine chlorophyll a-c binding protein. Es524 also expressed specific stress-related enzymes such as RNA helicases from the DEAD box families and a vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase. These observations were supported by RT-qPCR for some of the identified genes and an enzyme activity assay for vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase. Therefore, the occurrence of two different phenotypes within two distinct E. siliculosus strains studied at the physiological and proteomic levels strongly suggest that persistent copper stress may represent a selective force leading to the development of strains genetically adapted to copper contaminated sites.",

Here, we analyzed the Tor kinase in Aspergillus fumigatus, which is the most important airborne fungal pathogen of humans. Because deletion of the single tor gene was apparently lethal, we generated a conditional lethal tor mutant by replacing the endogenous tor gene by the inducible xylp-tor gene cassette. By both 2DE and gel-free LC-MS/MS, we found that Tor controls a variety of proteins involved in nutrient sensing, stress response, cell cycle progression, protein biosynthesis and degradation, but also processes in mitochondria, such as respiration and ornithine metabolism, which is required for siderophore formation. qRT-PCR analyses indicated that mRNA levels of ornithine biosynthesis genes were increased under iron limitation. When tor was repressed, iron regulation was lost. In a deletion mutant of the iron regulator HapX also carrying the xylp-tor cassette, the regulation upon iron deprivation was similar to that of the single tor inducible mutant strain. In line, hapX expression was significantly reduced when tor was repressed. Thus, Tor acts either upstream of HapX or independently of HapX as a repressor of the ornithine biosynthesis genes and thereby regulates the production of siderophores.",

The lack of models of residual distributions that can be used to assign likelihood to differential expression reflects the difficulty in tackling the combined effect of variability in spot intensity and uncertain recognition of the same spot in different gels. In this report we have analyzed a series of four triplicate two-dimensional gels of chicken embryo heart samples at two distinct development stages to produce such a model of residual distribution. In order to achieve this reference error model, a nonparametric procedure for consistent spot intensity normalization had to be established, and is also reported here. In addition to variability in normalized intensity due to various sources, the residual variation between replicates was observed to be compounded by failure to identify the spot itself (gel alignment). The mixed effect is reflected by variably skewed bimodal density distributions of residuals. The extraction of a global error model that accommodated such distribution was achieved empirically by machine learning, specifically by bootstrapped artificial neural networks. The model described is being used to assign confidence values to observed variations in arbitrary 2-DE gels in order to quantify the degree of over-expression and under-expression of protein spots.",

Milk samples from three healthy cows collected 3 h before the LPS challenge were compared with milk samples collected 4 and 7 h after the LPS challenge, making it possible to describe the inflammatory response of individual cows. Quantitative protein profiles were obtained for 80 milk proteins, of which 49 profiles changed significantly for the three cows during LPS challenge. New information obtained in this study includes the quantified increase of apolipoproteins and other anti-inflammatory proteins in milk, which are important for the cow's ability to balance the immune response, and the upregulation of both complement C3 and C4 indicates that more than one complement pathway could be activated during LPS-induced mastitis.

Here, we compared a bacteriophage encoded cell wall hydrolase, PlyC, a multimeric lysin of the C1 bacteriophage, with the established glycosidase, mutanolysin, from Streptomyces globisporus for their suitability to efficiently digest Spy cell walls and release cell wall-anchored Spy proteins for subsequent proteome research. Our results show that PlyC is superior for cell wall protein extraction compared to mutanolysin due to its higher activity and specificity as an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase. Furthermore, our experimental design allowed us to delineate the actual localization of the proteins despite contamination with intracellular proteins.",

Based on (18) O/(16) O-labeling technique, striatal proteins were separated using online 2D-LC, and identified by nano-ESI-quadrupole-TOF. A total of 370 proteins were identified, including 76 significantly differentially expressed proteins. Twenty-two downregulated proteins were found in composition of vesicle, ten of which were involved in neuronal transmission and recycling across synapses. These include N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment receptor proteins (SNAP-25, syntaxin-1A, syntaxin-1B, VAMP2), synapsin-1, septin-5, clathrin heavy chain 1, AP-2 complex subunit beta, dynamin-1, and endophilin-A1. Moreover, MS result for syntaxin-1A was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Overall, these synaptic changes induced by neurotoxin may serve as a reference for understanding the functional mechanism of striatum in PD.",

MALDI-TOF/TOF characterisation identified 81 distinct proteins. Analyses of selected IF proteins (45) indicated 17 distinct proteins with mainly defence-related functions, whereas analyses of IB proteins (70) identified 63 distinct proteins of diverse natures, including proteins of non-canonical natures. The presence of non-canonical proteins in IB extracts is discussed in the light of evidence supporting a low level of contamination of purified walls from symplastic proteins.

In numerous experiments the rate of significant differences found far exceeded 5%. Several factors were identified as causing the following rates of false significant differences in spot intensities: (i) running samples in two different 2-DE runs (42%), (ii) running second dimension gels produced in two different gel casters (16%), (iii) normalizing the entire gel instead of separately normalizing several different gel zones (11%), (iv) using IPG strips from different packages (19%), (v) dividing the whole sample into subgroups during software analysis (9%).

We tested our computational approach on two sets of human smooth muscle cell protein extracts that were affected differently by DNase I treatment. Differential proteomic analysis by saturation DIGE resulted in the identification of 41 human proteins. The application of our approach to these 41 input proteins consisted of four steps: (i) Compilation of a human protein-protein interaction network from public databases; (ii) calculation of interaction scores based on functional similarity; (iii) determination of a set of candidate proteins that are needed to efficiently and confidently connect the 41 input proteins; and (iv) ranking of the resulting 25 candidate proteins. Two of the three highest-ranked proteins, beta-arrestin 1, and beta-arrestin 2, were experimentally tested, revealing that their abundance levels in human smooth muscle cell samples were indeed affected by DNase I treatment. These proteins had not been detected during the experimental proteomic analysis. Our study suggests that our computational approach may represent a simple, universal, and cost-effective means to identify additional proteins that remain elusive for current 2D gel-based proteomic profiling techniques.",

The information emerging from this genome expression profiling and the detailed investigation of the biological role of candidate genes, as targets of phenol toxicity or as determinants of phenol resistance in P. putida KT2440, will allow more rationale strategies for developing bacteria with greater solvent tolerance with impact in bioremediation and whole-cell biotransformations in media with organic solvents.",

It has been proposed that the organism is relatively resistant to osmotic and dry stress compared to other species of the Enterobacteriaceae group. To understand the mechanisms involved in osmotic stress response, 2-DE protein analysis coupled to MALDI-TOF MS was employed to investigate changes in the protein profiles of E. sakazakii cells in response to two different types of osmotic stress (physical desiccation and growth in hyperosmotic media). In total, 80 differentially expressed protein spots corresponding to 53 different protein species were identified. Affiliation of proteins to functional categories revealed that a considerable number of the differentially expressed proteins from desiccated and hyperosmotic grown samples belonged to the same functional category but were regulated in opposite directions. Our data show that the protein pattern of NaCl-grown cultures reflect more or less a general down-regulation of central metabolic pathways, whereas adaptation of (non-growing) cells in a desiccated state represents an accumulation of proteins that serve some structural or protective role. The most striking effects observed for both types of osmotic stress in E. sakazakii were a significant down-regulation of the motility apparatus and the formation of filamentous cells.",

Proteins were extracted from rice leaf sheath at 0, 12, 24, 48 h after cutting and separated by two-dimensional (2-D) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Changes in differentially displayed proteins were found in leaf sheaths after cutting in the 0-48 h time course. Ten proteins were up-regulated, while 19 proteins were down-regulated compared with those on the four 2-D gels. Among them, 14 proteins were analyzed by N-terminal, or internal amino acid sequence. The clear functions of nine proteins could be identified. Six proteins did not yield amino acid sequence information due to their blocked N-termini. Furthermore, 11 proteins were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and identified protein database matching. It was shown that the down-regulated proteins were calreticulin (nos. 5, 6), histone H1 (no. 15) and hemoglobin (no. 17), putative peroxidase (no. 19); the up-regulated proteins were Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitor (no. 23), putative receptor-like protein kinase (nos. 24, 25), calmodulin-related protein (no. 26), small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (no. 27), mannose-binding rice lectin (nos. 28, 29).

A comparison of the temporal expression pattern of 107 proteins related to protein synthesis between the reference cultures and the furfural-treated cultures showed that a temporal downregulation of these proteins was retarded after the addition of furfural. The expression levels of 20 enzymes in glucose fermentation and 5 enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were reduced by furfural, with notably delayed temporal downregulations of Glk1p, Tdh1p, Eno1p and Aco1p, which is correlated to the reduced ethanol formation rate and glucose consumption rate by 66.7 and 60.4%, respectively. In the presence of furfural, proteins catalyzing the upper part of the super pathway of sulfur amino acid biosynthesis were repressed at all time points, which is related to the inhibited growth of furfural-treated yeast. The expressions of 18 proteins related to stress response showed increased trends, including several highly induced heat shock proteins and proteins related to cellular signaling pathways.",

The PBM and the space between the PBM and the bacteroid membrane, called peribacteroid space (PS), mediate the exchange of metabolites between the symbionts. Proteome analysis was used as an approach to characterise the proteins in the PBM and the PS. A standard differential centrifugation procedure including a Percoll gradient was used for symbiosome isolation from pea root nodules. Proteins in the PBM and PS fractions obtained from the symbiosomes were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and 89 spots were analysed by tandem mass spectrometry. The proteins of 46 spots could be identified by database search. The results showed that PS and even PBM preparations from pea symbiosomes always contain abundant amounts of bacteroid proteins as a contaminate. Interestingly, in addition to a few PS/PBM proteins a number of endomembrane proteins (less likely representing a contaminate), including V-ATPase, BIP, and an integral membrane protein known from COPI-coated vesicles, were found in the PBM fraction, supporting the role of the endomembrane system in PBM biogenesis.",

How they modulate their gene expression to adapt is poorly understood. ArcA, homologue of a global regulator controlling hundreds of genes involved in aerobic and anaerobic respiration in E. coli, was shown to be important in aerobiosis/anaerobiosis of S. oneidensis as well. Loss of ArcA, in addition to altering transcription of many genes, resulted in impaired growth under aerobic condition, which was not observed in E. coli. To further characterize the impact of ArcA loss on gene expression on the level of proteome under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) based proteomic approach was employed. Results show that ArcA loss led to globally altered gene expression, generally consistent with that observed with transcripts. Comparison of transcriptomic and proteomic data permitted identification of 17 high-confidence ArcA targets. Moreover, our data indicate that ArcA is required for regulation of cytochrome c proteins, and the menaquinone level may play a role in regulating ArcA as in E. coli. Proteomic data-guided growth assay revealed that the aerobic growth defect of ArcA mutant is presumably due to impaired peptide utilization.",

In this study, we employed an iTRAQ-based LC-LC MS/MS approach to identify differentially expressed proteins in cortical synapse proteomes of Cacna1a R192Q KI and wild-type mice. All expression differences determined were subtle and in the range of 10-30%. Observed upregulated proteins in the mutant mice are involved in processes, such as neurite outgrowth and actin dynamics, vesicle turnover, and glutamate transporters. Our data support the view that in Cacna1a R192Q KI mice, several compensatory mechanisms counterbalancing a dysregulated glutamatergic signaling have come into effect. We propose that such adaptation mechanisms at the synapse level may play a role in the pathophysiology of FHM and possibly in the common forms of migraine.",

Cell stability during such treatment, however, may become compromised and result in the release of intracellular proteins that complicate the final analysis. Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen, causing community and hospital-acquired infections, and is a serious healthcare concern due to the increasing prevalence of multiple antibiotic resistances amongst clinical isolates. We employed a cell surface \"shaving\" technique with either trypsin or proteinase-K combined with LC-MS/MS. Trypsin-derived data were controlled using a \"false-positive\" strategy where cells were incubated without protease, removed by centrifugation and the resulting supernatants digested. Peptides identified in this fraction most likely result from cell lysis and were removed from the trypsin-shaved data set. We identified 42 predicted S. aureus COL surface proteins from 260 surface-exposed peptides. Trypsin and proteinase-K digests were highly complementary with ten proteins identified by both, 16 specific to proteinase-K treatment, 13 specific to trypsin and three identified in the control. The use of a subtracted false-positive strategy improved enrichment of surface-exposed peptides in the trypsin data set to approximately 80% (124/155 peptides). Predominant surface proteins were those associated with methicillin resistance-surface protein SACOL0050 (pls) and penicillin-binding protein 2' (mecA), as well as bifunctional autolysin and the extracellular matrix-binding protein Ebh. The cell shaving strategy is a rapid method for identifying surface-exposed peptide epitopes that may be useful in the design of novel vaccines against S. aureus",

Abl kinase inhibitors (protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors) represent standard treatment for CML and induce remission in the majority of patients with early disease, however these drugs do not target leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) effectively, thus preventing cure. Previously, we identified the farnesyl transferase inhibitor BMS-214662 as a selective inducer of apoptosis in LSCs of CML patients relative to normal controls; however, the mechanism underlying LSC-specific apoptosis remains unclear. To identify pathways involved in the favourable effects of BMS-214662 in CML, we employed a proteomic approach (based on iTRAQ) to analyse changes in protein expression in response to drug treatment in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of CD34(+) CML cells. The study identified 88 proteins as altered after drug treatment, which included proteins known to be involved in nucleic acid metabolism, oncogenesis, developmental processes and intracellular protein trafficking. We found that expression of Ebp1, a negative regulator of proliferation, was upregulated in the nucleus of BMS-214662-treated cells. Furthermore, proteins showing altered levels in the cytosol, such as histones, were predominantly derived from the nucleus and BMS-214662 affected expression levels of nuclear pore complex proteins. Validation of key facets of these observations suggests that drug-induced alterations in protein localisation, potentially via loss of nuclear membrane integrity, contributes to the LSC specificity of BMS-214662, possibly via Ran proteins as targets.",

        "abstract": "Brief periods of myocardial ischemia prior to timely reperfusion result in prolonged, yet reversible, contractile dysfunction of the myocardium, or \"myocardial stunning\". It has been hypothesized that the delayed recovery of contractile function in stunned myocardium reflects damage to one or a few key sarcomeric proteins. However, damage to such proteins does not explain observed physiological alterations to myocardial oxygen consumption and ATP requirements observed following myocardial stunning, and therefore the impact of alterations to additional functional groups is unresolved. We utilized two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to identify changes to the protein profiles in whole cell, cytosolic- and myofilament-enriched subcellular fractions from isolated, perfused rabbit hearts following 15 min or 60 min low-flow (1 mL/min) ischemia. Comparative gel analysis revealed 53 protein spot differences (> 1.5-fold difference in visible abundance) in reperfused myocardium. The majority of changes were observed to proteins from four functional groups: (i) the sarcomere and cytoskeleton, notably myosin light chain-2 and troponin C; (ii) redox regulation, in particular several components of the NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex; (iii) energy metabolism, encompassing creatine kinase; and (iv) the stress response. Protein differences appeared to be the result of isoelectric point shifts most probably resulting from chemical modifications, and molecular mass shifts resulting from proteolytic or physical fragmentation. This is consistent with our hypothesis that the time course for the onset of injury associated with myocardial stunning is too brief to be mediated by large changes to gene/protein expression, but rather that more subtle, rapid and potentially transient changes are occurring to the proteome. The physical manifestation of stunned myocardium is therefore the likely result of the summed functional impairment resulting from these multiple changes, rather than a result of damage to a single key protein.",

We identified and quantified 339 human monocyte-derived DC transmembrane proteins, including 33 previously uncharacterized molecules.

This motivates the development and use of a filtering algorithm that removes spectra that contribute little to protein identification. Removal of unidentifiable spectra reduced both the amount of computational and human time spent on analyzing spectra as well as the chances of obtaining false identifications. Thorough testing on various proteome datasets from different instruments showed that the best suggested machine-learning classifier is, on average, able to recognize half of the unidentified spectra as bad spectra. Further analyses showed that several unidentified spectra classified as good were derived from peptides carrying unanticipated amino acid modifications or contained sequence tags that allowed peptide identification using homology searches.

In vitro secreted proteins were collected from the culture filtrates, and in planta proteins were collected by vacuum infiltration. A total of 289 proteins (229 in vitro and 120 in planta) were identified with high statistical confidence. Forty-nine of the in planta proteins were not found in any of the in vitro conditions. The majority (91-100%) of the in vitro proteins had predicted signal peptides, but only 56% of the in planta proteins. At least 13 of the nonsecreted proteins found only in planta were single-copy housekeeping enzymes, including enolase, triose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglucomutase, calmodulin, aconitase, and malate dehydrogenase. The presence of these proteins in the in planta but not in vitro secretome might indicate that significant fungal lysis occurs during pathogenesis. On the other hand, several of the proteins lacking signal peptides that were found in planta have been reported to be potent immunogens secreted by animal pathogenic fungi, and therefore could be important in the interaction between F. graminearum and its host plants.",

Identification of specific biomarkers of renal fibrosis may thus not only help us to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in this process, but also improve diagnosis in the clinic. In this review, the existing literature on proteomic approaches to study renal fibrosis is presented and evaluated.

The pilocarpine-induced TLE provides a model to investigate the molecular and functional characterization of epileptogenesis by mimicking the human epileptic condition. Here, we employed a 2-D gel-based proteomic technique to profile proteome changes in the rat hippocampus after pilocarpine treatment. Using MALDI MS and MS/MS, 57 differentially expressed proteins were identified, which were found either up-regulated and/or down-regulated at the two time points 12 h (acute period; Ap) and 72 h (silent period; Sp) compared with the control. These proteins can be related to underlying mechanism of pilocarpine-induced TLE, indicating cytoskeleton modification, altered synaptic function, mitochondrial dysfunction, changed ion channel, and chaperone. Five of the identified proteins, synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), synapsin-2 (SYN2), homer protein homolog 2 (HOMER2), alpha-internexin (INA), and voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) were investigated by semiquantitative RT-PCR, and SNAP25 and INA were further validated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry staining. Furthermore, association of these pilocarpine-induced proteins with biological functions using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool showed that nucleic acid metabolism, system development, tissue and cell morphology were significantly altered. IPA of the canonical networks indicated that six membrane proteins (e.g., SNAP25, SYN2, and HOMER2) participated in three biological networks as starting proteins. Our results offer a clue to identify biomarkers for the development of pharmacological therapies targeted at epilepsy.",

The results compared favorably with three state-of-the-art peak detection algorithms and four machine-learning algorithms. For the high-resolution ovarian cancer data set, seven biomarkers (m/z windows) were found by our method, which achieved 97.30 and 99.10% accuracy at 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, from 50 independent cross-validation samples, which is significantly better than other profiling and dimensional reduction methods. The results show that the method is capable of finding parsimonious sets of biologically meaningful biomarkers with better accuracy than existing methods.

The proteins involved in tamoxifen resistance of breast tumor cells as well as the mechanisms by which they interact, are still unknown. Some years ago, we established the xenograft breast tumor 3366, sensitive to tamoxifen and the 3366/TAM, resistant to tamoxifen, derived after two years of in vivo passages of the parental 3366 under tamoxifen treatment. Here, we compare the protein expression levels of both xenografts. 2-DE of proteins from total cell extracts showed very high reproducibility among tumors from each group (tamoxifen sensitive and tamoxifen resistant). The heuristic clustering analysis of these gels pooled them correctly in both groups. Twelve proteins were found up-regulated in the tamoxifen-resistant line, while nine were down-regulated. The proteins differentially expressed were identified by MS and sequence database analysis. Biological functions of these proteins are related to cell-cell adhesion and interaction, signal transduction, DNA and protein synthesis machinery, mitochondrial respiratory chain, oxidative stress processes and apoptosis. Three of the identified proteins (ALG-2 interacting protein and two GDP-dissociation inhibitors) could be directly involved in the resistance phenomenon.",

Owing to PTM, not less than 500 millions biological activities arise from approximately 20 000 protein-coding genes in human. Hundreds of PTM were characterized in living beings among which is a large variety of glycosylations. Many compounds have been developed to tentatively block each kind of glycosylation so as to study their biological functions but due to their complexity, many off-target effects were reported. Insulin resistance exemplifies this problem. Several independent groups described that inhibiting the removal of O-GlcNAc moieties using O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc), a nonselective inhibitor of the nuclear and cytoplasmic O-GlcNAcase, induced insulin resistance both in vivo and ex vivo. The development of potent and highly selective O-GlcNAcase inhibitors called into question that elevated O-GlcNAcylation levels are responsible for insulin resistance; these compounds not recapitulating the insulin-desensitizing effect of PUGNAc. To tackle this intriguing problem, a South Korean group recently combined ATP-affinity chromatography and gel-assisted digestion to identify proteins, differentially expressed upon treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with PUGNAc, involved in protein turnover and insulin signaling.",

Due to its capability to reduce solid ferric iron, S. oneidensis plays an important role in microbially induced corrosion of metal surfaces. Since this requires cellular adhesion to the metal surface, biofilm growth is an essential feature of this process. The goal of this work was to compare the global protein expression patterns of sessile and planktonic grown S. oneidensis cells by two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis. Mass spectrometry was used as an identification tool of the differentially expressed proteins. An IPG strip of pH 3-10 as well as pH 4-7 was applied for iso-electrofocusing. Analysis of the 2-D patterns pointed out a total of 59 relevant spots. Among these proteins, we highlight the involvement of a protein annotated as an agglutination protein (AggA). AggA is a TolC-like protein which is presumably part of an ABC transporter. Another differentially expressed protein is RibB, an enzyme of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway. Riboflavin is the precursor molecule of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and may be necessary for the altered respiratory properties of the biofilm cells versus planktonic cells. Some proteins that were identified indicate an anaerobic state of the biofilm. This anaerobic way of living affects the energy gaining pathways of the cell and is reflected by the presence of several proteins, including those of a heme-utilization system.",

Caspases 3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) results showed increased cell death in the IR samples; reversely, minor apoptosis was detected in the SEE/IR group. Pretreatment with SEE significantly restored the content of antioxidant enzymes (SOD1 and catalase) and remarkably inhibited the intracellular ROS concentration in terms of reducing p47phox translocation. Proteome tools revealed that 20 proteins were significantly modulated in protein intensity between IR and SEE/IR groups. Particularly, SEE administration could attenuate the carbonylation level of several chaperone proteins. Network analysis suggested that saffron extract could alleviate IR-induced ER stress and protein ubiquitination, which finally lead to cell apoptosis. Taken together, SEE could reduce hepatic IR injury through modulating protein oxidation and our results might help to develop novel therapeutic strategies against ROS-caused diseases.",

Using imaging MS, calprotectin can be detected as a marker of the inflammatory response to bacterial challenge. In a murine model of Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia, protein images of S100A8 and S100A9 collected at different time points throughout infection aid in visualization of the innate immune response to this pathogen. Calprotectin is detectable within 6 h of infection as immune cells respond to the invading pathogen. As the bacterial burden decreases, signals from the inflammatory proteins decrease. Calprotectin is no longer detectable 96-144 h post infection, correlating to a lack of detectable bacterial burden in lungs.

Characterization of apalbumin2a by LC-MALDI TOF/TOF MS revealed that it is a minority homolog of the major basic royal jelly protein, apalbumin2, carrying two fully occupied N-glycosylation sites, one with high-mannose structure, HexNAc2Hex9, and another carrying complex type antennary structures, HexNAc4Hex3 and HexNAc5Hex4.

To address the significance of this cycle in plant cells, we performed integrated biochemical, immunocytochemical, and quantitative proteomics analyses in the Arabidopsis thaliana ggt1 knockout mutant (lacking apoplastic GGT1 isoform) and its corresponding wild-type (WT). The ggt1 knockout leaves exhibited an increased ascorbate and GSH content, increased apoplastic GSH content, and enhanced protein carbonylations in the low-molecular weight range compared to WT. The combined iTRAQ and LC-MS/MS-based quantitative proteomics approach identified 70 proteins (out of 1013 identified proteins) whose abundance was significantly different in leaves of ggt1 mutant compared to WT, with a fold change \u22651.5. Mining of the proteome data for GSH-associated genes showed that disruption of gamma-glutamyl cycle in ggt1 knockout-leaves was associated with the induction of genes encoding four GSTs in the phi class (GSTF2, GSTF6, GSTF9, and GSTF10), a GSH peroxidase (GPX1), and glyoxylase II. Proteins with a lower abundance compared to the WT are involved in chloroplast functions, carbohydrate/maltose metabolism, and vegetative storage protein synthesis. Present findings suggest that GGT1 plays a role in redox signaling. The disruption of the gamma-glutamyl cycle in the ggt1 mutant results in pleiotropic effects related to biotic and abiotic stress response, antioxidant metabolism, senescence, carbohydrate metabolism, and photosynthesis, with strong implications for plant adaptation to the environment.",

We identified several proteins linked to epithelial-mesenchymal-transition, including increased abundance of Vimentin and HDGF in the membrane, and Casein Kinase II \u03b1 and Annexin A2 in the lumen of exosomes, respectively, from metastatic cells. The change in exosome protein abundance correlated little, although significant for FL3 vs. T24, with changes in cellular mRNA expression. Our proteomic approach may help identification of proteins in the membrane and lumen of exosomes potentially involved in the metastatic process. This article is protected by copyright.

Studies on isolated chlorosomes from Chlorobaculum tepidum based on SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting and molecular biology have revealed that they contain ten chlorosomal proteins, but no comprehensive information is available about the protein composition of the entire organelle. To extend these studies, chlorosomes were isolated from C. tepidum using three related and one independent isolation protocol and characterized by absorption spectroscopy, tricine SDS-PAGE, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electron microscopy. Tricine SDS-PAGE showed the presence of more than 20 proteins with molecular weights ranging between 6 and 70 kDa. The chlorosomes varied in size. Their hydrodynamic radius (R(h) ) ranged from 51 to 75 nm and electron microscopy indicated that they were on average 140 nm wide and 170 nm long. Furthermore, the mass of 184 whole chlorosome organelles determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy ranged from 27 to 237 MDa being on average 88 (\u00b128) MDa. In contrast their mass-per-area was independent of their size, indicating that there is a strict limit to chlorosome thickness. The average protein composition of the C. tepidum chlorosome organelles was obtained by MS/MS-driven proteomics and for the first time a detailed protein catalogue of the isolated chlorosomal proteome is presented. Based on the proteomics results for chlorosomes isolated by different protocols, four proteins that are involved in the electron or ion transport are proposed to be tightly associated with or incorporated into C. tepidum chlorosomes as well as the ten Csm proteins known to date.",

However, to our knowledge, none of them have been conceived to meet the particular needs generated by the study of organisms whose genomes are not sequenced. In that context, we have developed OVNIp, an open-source application which facilitates the whole process of proteomics results interpretation. One of its unique attributes is its capacity to compile multiple results (from several search engines and/or several databank searches) with a resolution of conflicting interpretations. Moreover, OVNIp enables automated exploitation of de novo sequences generated from unassigned MS/MS spectra leading to higher sequence coverage and enhancing confidence in the identified proteins. The exploitation of these additional spectra might also identify novel proteins through a MS-BLAST search, which can be easily ran from the OVNIp interface. Beyond this primary scope, OVNIp can also benefit to users who look for a simple standalone application to both visualize and confirm MS/MS result interpretations through a simple graphical interface and generate reports according to user-defined forms which may integrate the prerequisites for publication.

The endosperm cap that covers the radicle plays a regulatory role during germination and is a major target of abscisic acid-induced inhibition of germination. Cress (Lepidium sativum) is a close relative of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). Cress seeds offer the unique possibility of performing tissue-specific proteomics due to their larger size while benefiting the genomic tools available for Arabidopsis. This work provides the first description of endosperm cap proteomics during seed germination. An analysis of the proteome of the cress endosperm cap at key stages during germination and after radicle protrusion in the presence and absence of abscisic acid led to the identification of 144 proteins, which were clustered by the changes in their abundances and categorized by function. Proteins with a function in energy production, protein stability and stress response were overrepresented among the identified endosperm cap proteins. This strongly suggests that the cress endosperm cap is not a storage tissue as the cereal endosperm but a metabolically very active tissue regulating the rate of radicle protrusion.",

We attempted to identify novel isoforms of Pru av 1, the major cherry allergen, at the cDNA and the protein level by a combination of molecular biology and proteomic tools. A cDNA library was screened with patients immunoglobulin E (IgE) and a specific hybridization probe. Edman sequencing, mass spectrometry (MS), and MS/MS were performed after detecting Pru av 1 on 2-D maps by immunoblotting using patients IgE and a monoclonal antibody. Partial amino acid sequences were completed with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy. The IgE-binding properties of the Pru av 1 spots were analyzed by 2-D blot inhibition. cDNA library analysis revealed a novel Pru av 1 isoform. MS and N-terminal sequencing confirmed the cDNA sequences at the protein level. A series of spots were confirmed as the already known Pru av 1. One spot, exclusively detected with patients sera, was identified as the novel isoform. A partial amino acid sequence detected with MS/MS was completed by PCR-cloning. The 2-D blot inhibition revealed epitope differences between the novel isoform and the previously published Pru av 1. Our data demonstrate that a synergistic combination of molecular biology and proteomics represents a powerful tool for reliable and comprehensive identification of allergen isoforms and variants. The newly identified isoform showed diverging IgE-binding properties and may be relevant for the diagnosis or therapy of cherry allergy.",

In two separate approaches, phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations followed by 1-D-PAGE, and 2-DE, were used for protein separation. Proteins were identified by MS. By following these approaches, 96 proteins were found to undergo PTM in response to CRP in human platelets, including 11 novel platelet proteins such as Dok-1, SPIN90, osteoclast stimulating factor 1, and beta-Pix. Interestingly, the type I transmembrane protein G6f was found to be specifically phosphorylated on Tyr-281 in response to platelet activation by CRP, providing a docking site for the adapter Grb2. G6f tyrosine phoshporylation was also found to take place in response to collagen, although not in response to the G protein-coupled receptor agonists, thrombin and ADP. Further, we also demonstrate for the first time that Grb2 and its homolog Gads are tyrosine-phosphorylated in CRP-stimulated platelets. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of platelet activation through the GPVI collagen receptor, helping to build the basis for the development of new drug targets for thrombotic disease.",

Three issues are holding back large-scale pro- teomics studies: low-throughput, high technical variation, and study designs lacking statis- tical power. We identified image analysis as the central factor connecting these three issues. By developing an improved image analysis workflow we shortened project timelines, decreased technical variation, and thus enabled large-scale proteomics studies that are sta- tistically powered. Rather than detecting protein spots on each gel image and matching spots across gel images, the improved workflow is based on aligning images first, then creating a consensus spot pattern and finally propagating the consensus spot pattern to all gel images for quantitation. This results in a data table without gaps. As an example we show here a study aimed at discovering circulating biomarkers for chronic obstructive pul- monary disease (COPD). Eight candidate biomarkers were identified by comparing plasma from 24 smokers with COPD and 24 smokers without COPD. Among the candidates are proteins such as plasma retinal-binding protein (RETB) and fibrinogen that had previously been linked to the disease and are frequently monitored in COPD patients, as well as other proteins such as apolipoprotein E (ApoE), inter-a-trypsininhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITIH4), and glutathione peroxidase.",

The present technique does not rely on the use of detergents, strong organic acids or cyanogen bromide-mediated proteolysis. A buffered solution of 60% methanol was used to extract, solubilize, and tryptically digest proteins within a preparation of Halobacterium (H.) halobium purple membranes. Analysis of the digested purple membrane proteins by microLC-MS/MS resulted in the identification of all the predicted tryptic peptides of bacteriorhodopsin, including those that are known to be post-translationally modified. In addition, 40 proteins from the purple membrane preparation were also identified, of which 80% are predicted to contain between 1 and 16 transmembrane domains. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, the same extraction, solubilization, and digestion conditions were applied to a plasma membrane fraction prepared from human epidermal sheets. A total of 117 proteins was identified in a single microLC-MS/MS analysis, of which 55% are known to be integral or associated with the plasma membrane. Due to its simplicity, efficiency, and absence of MS interfering compounds, this technique can be used for the characterization of other integral membrane proteins and may be concomitantly applied for the analysis of membrane protein complexes or large-scale proteomic studies of different membrane samples.",

After a period of descriptive urinary proteomics the field is moving out of the discovery phase into an era of validation of urinary biomarkers in larger prospective studies. Although mainly due to the site of production of urine, the majority of these studies apply to the kidney and the urinary tract, but recent data show that analysis of the urinary proteome can also be highly informative on non-urogenital diseases and used in their classification. Despite this progress in urinary biomarker discovery, the contribution of urinary proteomics to the understanding of the pathophysiology of disease upon analysis of the urinary proteome is still modest mainly because of problems associated to sequence identification of the biomarkers. Until now, research has focused on the highly abundant urinary proteins and peptides, but analysis of the less abundant and naturally existing urinary proteins and peptides still remains a challenge.

The PRE-CSFs generally exhibited a less complex LC-MS profile than the relative POST-CSFs suggesting a suppressive role of the tumor toward proteins and peptides production or release. Particularly, a panel of peptides, identified as alpha- and beta-hemoglobin chains fragments, were generally absent in the PRE-CSF and present in the POST ones independently from contaminant blood hemoglobin. Among them, the LVV- and VV-hemorphin-7 showed the most repeatable trend and with a few remarkable exceptions: their unusual absence in POST surgery CSF was in fact interestingly correlated to the presence of tumor in the patient despite surgery due to metastases or to subtotal resection.

Isolate IST439 was the first bacterium recovered while the clonal variant IST4113 was obtained after 3 years of persistent infection and intravenous therapy with ceftazidime/gentamicin. This isolate exhibits higher resistance levels towards different classes of antimicrobials. Proteins of the functional categories Energy metabolism, Translation, Nucleotide synthesis, Protein folding and stabilization are more abundant in IST4113, compared with IST439, suggesting an increased protein synthesis, DNA repair and stress resistance in IST4113. The level of proteins involved in peptidoglycan, membrane lipids and lipopolysaccharide synthesis is also altered and proteins involved in iron binding and transport are more abundant in IST4113.

Instead, the ORF models for these proteins have been predicted by suitable algorithms and/or through comparison with known, homologous proteins from other organisms, approaches which may be prone to error. In the present study, we used a combination of 2-DE, MALDI-TOF-MS and PMF to identify 1151 different proteins in E. coli K12 JM109. Comparison of the experimental with the theoretical Mr and pI values (4000 experimental values each) allowed the identification of numerous proteins with incorrect or incomplete ORF annotations in the current E. coli genome databases. Several inconsistencies in genome annotation were verified experimentally, and up to 55 candidates await further investigation.

In an attempt to contribute to the discovery of useful biomarkers for its diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring, we embarked on a mapping of Candida albicans immunogenic proteins specifically recognized by antibodies produced during the natural course of systemic Candida infection in this high-risk population. About 85 immunoreactive protein species were detected with systemic candidiasis patients' serum specimens by using immunoproteomics (i.e., two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by Western blotting), and identified through a combination of peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), de novo peptide sequencing using nano-electrospray ionization-ion trap (ESI-IT) MS, and genomic database searches. This proteomic approach has led to the characterization of 42 different housekeeping enzymes as C. albicans antigens. Their biological significance is also discussed. Furthermore, this study is the first to report that 26 of them exhibit antigenic properties in C. albicans, and 35 of them become targets of the human antibody response to systemic candidiasis. Our findings suggest that the production of antibodies to C. albicans phosphoglycerate kinase and alcohol dehydrogenase during systemic candidiasis could be associated with a differentiation of the human immune response. We also highlight the relationship between changes in maintenance of circulating levels of specific anti-Candida antibodies and patients' outcome. Some of these variations, especially the rise of high anti-enolase antibody concentrations, appear to be related to recovery from systemic candidiasis in these patients, which might serve as markers for predicting their outcome. This approach could therefore provide new challenges for diagnosis and clinical follow-up of these fungal infections, and even for antifungal drug or vaccine design.",

We now extend our initial studies to serum proteins at early stage (1 month) and advanced stages of tumorigenesis (12 months). Notably, serum proteins from wild-type and tumor bearing mice were extracted with a lysis buffer containing 5 mol/L urea, 2 mol/L thiourea, 40 mmol/L Tris, 4% CHAPS, 100 mmol/L DTT, 0.5% BioLyte 3-10, separated by 2-DE and studied by image analysis. On average 400 protein spots per gel were excised and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. We identified 45 common and 5 uniquely expressed proteins in wild-type and tumor bearing mice. Apart from uniquely identified proteins we observed for n = 9 proteins differential expression when wild-type and tumor bearing mice were compared. This included serpins and other protease inhibitors, lipocalins, transthyretins, globins, and Igs. Notably, we demonstrate significant regulation of alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, hemoglobin subunit alpha, vitamin D-binding protein, major urinary proteins, and transthyretin (up to eight-fold) in serum of lung tumor bearing mice. Disease association of these proteins in human malignancies has been reported. Thus, an identification of regulated serum proteins in this lung cancer disease model provides excellent opportunities for the search of novel biomarkers.",

However, it is only recently that the depth of that complexity has become somewhat quantitatively and qualitatively appreciated. With the resurgence of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and the advances in mass spectrometry virtually all venom components can be visualized and identified given sufficient effort and resources. Here we present the use of 2-DE for examining venom complexity as well as demonstrating interesting approaches to selectively delineate subpopulations of venom proteins based on particular characteristics of the proteins such as antibody cross-reactivity or enzymatic activities. 2-DE comparisons between venoms from different species of the same genus (Bothrops) of snake clearly demonstrated both the similarity as well as the apparent diversity among these venoms. Using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry we were able to identify regions of the two-dimensional gels from each venom in which certain classes of proteins were found. 2-DE was also used to compare venoms from Crotalus atrox and Bothrops jararaca. For these venoms a variety of staining/detection protocols was utilized to compare and contrast the venoms. Specifically, we used various stains to visualize subpopulations of the venom proteomes of these snakes, including Coomassie, Silver, Sypro Ruby and Pro-Q-Emerald. Using specific antibodies in Western blot analyses of 2-DE of the venoms we have examined subpopulations of proteins in these venoms including the serine proteinase proteome, the metalloproteinase proteome, and the phospholipases A2 proteome. A functional assessment of the gelatinolytic activity of these venoms was also performed by zymography. These approaches have given rise to a more thorough understanding of venom complexity and the toxins comprising these venoms and provide insights to investigators who wish to focus on these venom subpopulations of proteins in future studies.",

To understand cross-talk between excess Zn and Fe deficiency, we investigated physiological parameters of Arabidopsis plants and applied iTRAQ-OFFGEL quantitative proteomic approach to examine protein expression changes in microsomal fraction from Arabidopsis shoots under those physiological conditions. Arabidopsis plants manifested shoot inhibition and chlorosis symptoms when grown on Fe-deficient media compared to basal MGRL solid medium. iTRAQ-OFFGEL approach identified 909 differentially expressed proteins common to all three biological replicates; the majority were transporters or proteins involved in photosynthesis, and ribosomal proteins. Interestingly, protein expression changes between excess Zn and Fe deficiency showed similar pattern. Further, the changes due to excess Zn were dramatically restored by the addition of Fe. To obtain biological insight into Zn and Fe cross-talk, we focused on transporters, where STP4 and STP13 sugar transporters were predominantly expressed and responsive to Fe-deficient conditions. Plants grown on Fe-deficient conditions showed significantly increased level of sugars. These results suggest that Fe deficiency might lead to the disruption of sugar synthesis and utilization.",

Poor molecular characterization of IPF has led to insufficient understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, resulting in lack of effective therapies. In this study, we have integrated a label free LC-MS based approach with systems biology to identify signaling pathways and regulatory nodes within protein interaction networks that govern phenotypic changes that may lead to IPF. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of proteins modulated in response to bleomycin treatment identified PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling as the most significant pro-fibrotic pathways. Similar analysis of proteins modulated in response to VEGF-inhibitor (CBO-P11) treatment identified Natural Killer cell signaling and PTEN signaling as the most significant anti-fibrotic pathways. mTOR and ERK were identified to be key mediators of pro- and anti-fibrotic response, where BLM treatment resulted in increased expression and VEGF-inhibitor treatment attenuated expression of mTOR and ERK. Using a BLM mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis and VEGF-inhibitor CBO-P11 as a therapeutic measure, we identified a comprehensive set of signaling pathways and proteins that contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis that can be targeted for therapy against this fatal disease.

The complete ten day old lens proteome of Mus musculus C57BL/6J was resolved into 900 distinct spots by large gel carrier ampholyte based 2-DE. The predicted amino acid sequences of all 16 crystallins ubiquitous in mammals were corroborated by mass spectrometry (MS). In detailed individual spot analyses, the primary structure of the full murine C57BL/6J beaded filament component phakinin CP49 was sequenced by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem MS and amended at two positions. This definitive polypeptide sequence was aligned to the mouse genome, thus identifying the entire C57BL/6J genomic coding region. Also, two murine C57/6J polypeptides, both previously classified as gamma F crystallin, were clearly distinguished by MS and electrophoretic mobility. Both were assigned to their respective genes, one of the polypeptides was reclassified as C57BL/6J gamma E crystallin. Building on these data and previous investigations an updated crystallin reference map was put forth and several non crystallin lenticular components were examined. These results represent the first part of a comprehensive investigation of the mouse lens proteome (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE) with emphasis on understanding genetic effects on proteins and disease development.",

However, even in spite of recent technological advances, validating a new biomarker candidate, where generation of suitable antibodies is required, is still a long-lasting task. Methods to accelerate initial validation by MS approaches have been suggested, but all methods described so far are associated with serious drawbacks, finally leading to non-generic methods of detection and quantification. Moreover, when complex body fluids are used as samples, efficient debulking strategies are crucial to open a window of analytical sensitivity in the ng/mL range, where many diagnostically relevant analytes are present. Here we report the proof-of-principle of a multi-dimensional strategy for accelerated initial validation of biomarker candidates by MS, which promises to be generally applicable, sensitive and quantitative. The method presented employs a combination of electrophoretic and chromatographic steps on the peptide level, followed by MS quantification using isotopically labeled synthetic peptides as internal standards. Our proposed workflow includes up to four dimensions, finally resulting in a desired LOD sufficient to detect and quantify diagnostically relevant analytes from complex samples. Although the current state of the method only represents a starting point for further validation and development, it reveals great potential in biomarker validation.",

Once the confidently matched spectra were removed, the remainder was filtered against a nonannotated library of background spectra that cleaned up the dataset from spectra of common protein and chemical contaminants. The rectified spectral dataset was further subjected to rapid batch de novo interpretation by PepNovo software, followed by the MS BLAST sequence-similarity search that used multiple redundant and partially accurate candidate peptide sequences. Importantly, a single dataset was acquired at the uncompromised sensitivity with no need of manual selection of MS/MS spectra for subsequent de novo interpretation. This approach enabled a completely automated identification of novel proteins that were, otherwise, missed by conventional database searches.",

To explore the physiological function of CAPN3, we compared the proteomes of transgenic mice that overexpress CAPN3 (CAPN3 Tg) and their nontransgenic (non-Tg) counterparts. We first examined known muscular dystrophy-related proteins to determine if overexpression of CAPN3 results in a change in their distribution or concentration. This analysis did not identify any known muscular dystrophy proteins as substrates of CAPN3. Next, we used a proteomic approach to compare and identify differentially represented proteins in 2-DE of CAPN3 Tg and non-Tg mice. LC-MS/MS analysis led to the identification of ten possible substrates for CAPN3, classified into two major functional categories: metabolic and myofibrillar. Myosin light chain 1 (MLC1) was focused upon because our previous studies suggested a role for CAPN3 in sarcomere remodeling. In this study, CAPN3 was shown to proteolyze MLC1 in vitro. These studies are the first to identify possible substrates for CAPN3 in an in vivo system and support a role for CAPN3 in sarcomere remodeling by cleavage of myofibrillar proteins such as MLC1. In addition, these data also suggest a role for CAPN3 in mitochondrial protein turnover.",

NFT mainly consist of a hyperphosphorylated form of the protein tau, which is responsible for stabilisation of the neuronal cytoskeleton by microtubule binding and is unable to function properly in its hyperphosphorylated form. Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) is able to phosphorylate tau in a cellular context which could play a role in the formation of these NFT. In order to learn more about the effect of GSK-3beta in the brain, two-dimensional electrophoresis patterns of cerebrum extracts of GSK3beta[S9A] transgenic mice and wild type mice were compared quantitatively. Fifty-one spots were identified as being different in integrated intensity by at least a factor 1.5. The spots were subsequently identified by mass spectrometry. Identification of several proteins linked to signal transduction pathways in which GSK3beta plays a role, indicates that our population of identified proteins includes some down stream proteins of GSK3beta. This study may contribute to filling the gaps between GSK3beta, its substrates and finally the phosphorylation of tau.",

The separated proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and 63 proteins were analyzed by a gas-phase protein sequencer. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of 33 out of 63 proteins were determined in this manner. N-terminal regions of the remaining proteins could not be sequenced. The internal amino acid sequences of 12 proteins were determined by sequence analysis of peptides obtained by the Cleveland peptide mapping method. The amino acid sequences were compared with those of known plant and animal protein sequences to understand the nature of these proteins. As expected, leaf blades revealed predominantly the presence of photosynthetic proteins. Using this experimental approach named as proteome analysis, the functional proteins during blast fungus infection of rice with different levels of nitrogen nutrient were analyzed. Twelve proteins which appeared to change with different levels of nitrogen nutrient were identified. It was revealed that the level of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase was increased by top-dressing with nitrogen nutrient. Additionally, the pathogenesis related protein were observed following blast fungus infection using immunoblot analysis. It was conjectured that these proteins might be involved in incompatible interaction in rice plants following blast fungus infection. The information obtained on the amino acid sequences and antibodies interaction is expected to be helpful in predicting the function of these proteins.",

Western blot revealed that the expression levels of CRAMP and S100A9 were positively correlated with the time-course treated with MSU. Further analysis of GeneGO Pathway demonstrated that these differentially expressed proteins are primarily related to the immune-related complement system and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Moreover, seven genes from the TCA cycle were found to be significantly down-regulated at the transcriptional level and its correlation with gout and possible therapeutic applications are worth further investigation.

Western blot analysis of kinase suppressor of Ras1, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, elongation factor 2, 60\u2009kDa heat-shock protein, and catalase supported the proteome evidence. Based on the changes found in the protein-expression levels of these proteins, we proposed a cellular-signalling pathway to explain the hepatic-cell response to the intake of a diet containing MA.",

Its overexpression is strongly associated with advanced disease, metastasis and poor clinical outcome. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the poor prognosis of breast tumors with HER-2/neu-positive status, parallel proteomic analyses were performed on estrogen receptor-negative and node-positive breast tumors with or without overexpression of the HER-2/neu oncogene, using laser capture microdissection and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The differentially expressed proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Cytokeratin 19 (CK19), one of the identified proteins, was highly expressed in the HER-2/neu-positive breast tumors when compared with HER-2/neu-negative breast tumors. The enhanced overexpression of CK19 in HER-2/neu-positive tumors was further analyzed using semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and reverse-phase protein arrays. Immunohistochemical staining of sections from a breast tumor tissue microarray of 97 tumors showed moderate to strong staining against anti-CK19 antibody in 20 (5 with moderate and 15 with strong staining) of the 26 HER-2/neu-positive tumors (76.9%) and in 22 (12 with moderate and 10 with strong staining) of 52 HER-2/neu-negative tumors (48%) (p = 0.002). Our results indicate that CK19, an intermediate fragment of the cytoskeleton, and other proteins showing differential expression, are likely to be intricately involved in intra- and intercellular molecular events driving the more aggressive tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis associated with HER-2/neu-positive tumors.",

This pathogen can infect a wide range of hosts, and is the causative agent of Q fever in humans. Surface-exposed and cell envelope associated proteins are thought to be important for both pathogenesis and protective immunity. Herein, we propose a complementary strategy consisting of (i) in silico prediction and (ii) inventory of the proteomic composition using three enrichment approaches coupled with protein identification. The efficiency of classical Triton X-114 phase partitioning was compared with two novel procedures; isolation of alkaline proteins by liquid-phase IEF, and cell surface enzymatic shaving using biofunctional magnetic beads. Of the 2026 protein sequences analyzed using seven distinct bioinformatic algorithms, 157 were predicted to be outer membrane proteins (OMP) and/or lipoproteins (LP). Using the three enrichment protocols, we identified 196 nonredundant proteins, including 39 predicted OMP and/or LP, 32 unknown or poorly characterized proteins, and 17 effectors of the Type IV secretion system. We additionally identified eight proteins with moonlighting activities, and several proteins apparently peripherally associated with integral or anchored OMP and/or LP.",

HPV 16 E7 binds to tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein, and interferes with its function, causing release of the transcription factor E2F, which influences expression of cell cycle-related genes. This study was performed to identify the genes and proteins modulated by the HPV E7 oncogene. An HPV-negative cervical cancer cell line (C33A) was prepared to establish a stable cell line expressing E7. In order to analyze the target molecules modulated by E7 expression, we used two approaches: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and DNA microarrays. Forty-seven spots were identified in C33A/E7 by two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI/TOF MS. Protein disulfide isomerase A3, integrase interactor 1 protein, growth inhibitory protein, glutathione S-transferase P, and vav proto-oncogene were down-regulated, whereas heat shock 60 kDa protein 1, Ku70 binding protein, alpha enolase, 26S proteasome subunit were up-regulated. A genomic approach using a microarray kit showed that IL-12R beta 1, cytochrome c, and tumor necrosis factor receptor II were induced by the E7 oncogene. These results suggest that E7 can evade immune surveillance by suppressing or inducing these cell signaling factors, cell cycle regulators, and chaperones.",

A more in-depth analysis can be performed by one of the most suitable methods that allows for the simultaneous screening of many components without prior identification, the analysis of the proteome. As a model for testing this kind of approach, we compared protein expression of two types of tomato plants, having the same genetic background, except for a virus resistance trait introduced by genetic engineering. When proteins extracted from seedlings of the two types were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis, no significant differences, either qualitative or quantitative, were detected, indicating that in this case the expression of major proteins was unmodified by the genetic manipulation. Fifteen proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting.",

Using a protein standard generated by SILAC-labeling, a total of 675 proteins were identified and 30 were differentially expressed between at least two of the tumors. The protein standard contained the proteomes of seven cell lines from multiple histogenic origins and displayed superior features compared to standard super-SILAC. The expression of some proteins correlated with metastatic capabilities, such as myosin-9 (nonmuscle myosin II A) and L-lactate dehydrogenase A, while the expression of elongation factor tu correlated inversely to metastatic capabilities. The expression of these proteins was biochemically validated, and expression of myosin-9 in clinical breast cancer samples was further shown to be altered in primary tumors versus corresponding lymph node metastasis. Our study demonstrates an improved strategy for quantitative comparison of an unlimited number of tumor tissues, and provides novel insights into key proteins associated with the colonization phase of metastasis formation.",

Database searches using several fully sequenced genomes from the Saccharomyces genera indicated that the non-cerevisiae proteins in the 2-D pattern of lager strains were most closely related to S. bayanus. For many proteins the regulation of the bayanus-like protein and its cerevisiae counterpart varied in a strain-dependent manner, e.g. the bayanus-like form of Tdh3p was roughly eight-fold more abundant than the cerevisiae form in the OG2252 strain. We also found differential regulation of cerevisiae- and bayanus-like proteins during various stress conditions like low temperature growth, and adaptation to high temperatures or high salinity, e.g. for Arg1p, Sti1p and Pdc1p. Our data on the differential regulation of the two genomes in these hybrid strains may have important industrial implications for strain improvement and strain protection.",

RSV induced apoptosis in all the cells in a dose-dependent manner; however, Bax+/- and p53+/+ cells were more susceptible than their knockout counterparts (Bax-/- and p53-/-, respectively). Using Bax+/- cells as a model, proteomic analysis revealed four RSV-responsive events: fragmentation of lamin A/C protein; increase in concentration of a more basic isoelectric variant of the ribosomal protein P0; and decrease in concentration of dUTPase as well as stathmin 1. Lamin A cleavage in response to RSV treatment was confirmed using Western blot analysis. Caspase-6 was activated, which was evidenced by cleavage and accumulation in active form of caspase-6 as well as upregulation of the protease activity. RSV-elicited lamin A cleavage and apoptosis were entirely abrogated by the peptide inhibitors of caspase-6. Likewise, partial knockdown of caspase-6 expression using small interfering RNA resulted in significant inhibition of RSV-elicited lamin A cleavage and apoptosis. Furthermore, the lower apoptosis sensitivity of the knockout cells (Bax-/- and p53-/-) correlated with the relatively reduced processing of caspase-6 and lamin A cleavage. Taken together, these data highlight the critical role of caspase-6 and its cleavage of lamin A in apoptotic signaling triggered by RSV in the colon carcinoma cells, which can be activated in the absence of Bax or p53.",

A number of methods exist for differential analysis of complex proteomic mixtures. Here, a label-free mass spectrometric approach comparing the ion intensities of tryptic peptides was adopted, which was combined with prefractionation of whole cell lysate proteins by 1-D SDS-PAGE. Using this approach, 60 proteins were found to be affected by E-2. These comprised 55 up-regulated and five down-regulated proteins. These proteins varied widely in their physiochemical properties with pIs of 4-12 and molecular weights of 9-500 kDa. Pathway analysis revealed that the majority of changes were related and together describe an up-regulated pathway consistent with the events of cell proliferation. The quantitative approach used here is relatively straightforward, avoids the use of costly labelling reagents, was reproducible within acceptable limits and has a linear response over a useful concentration range.",

To optimize methods to isolate exosomes from blood plasma, we performed a comparative evaluation of three exosome isolation techniques (differential centrifugation cou- pledwith ultracentrifugation, epithelial cell adhesion molecule immunoaffinity pull-down, and OptiPrepTM density gradient separation) using normal human plasma. Based onMS, Western blotting and microscopy results, we found that the OptiPrepTM density gradient method was superior in isolating pure exosomal populations, devoid of highly abundant plasma proteins. In addition, we assessed the stability of exosomes in plasma over 90 days under various stor- age conditions. Western blotting analysis using the exosomal marker, TSG101, revealed that exosomes are stable for 90 days. Interestingly, in the context of cellular uptake, the isolated exosomes were able to fuse with target cells revealing that they were indeed biologically active",

The data indicate that heterozygous Sod2+/- mice exhibit a mild mitochondrial oxidative stress which is partly compensated by the antioxidant defense system linked to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, urea cycle, beta-oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The results of this study are compatible with our hypothesis that the Sod2+/- mouse is a suitable animal model for studying clinically silent mitochondrial abnormalities.",

To better understand the mechanism of this phenomenon, we consecutively put the selective pressures of resistant maize population on C. lunata strain WS18 (low virulence) artificially. As a result, the virulence of this strain was significantly enhanced. Using 2DE, 12 up-regulated and four down-regulated proteins were identified in virulence-increased strain compared to WS18. Our analysis revealed that melanin synthesis-related proteins (Brn1, Brn2, and scytalone dehydratase) and stress tolerance-related proteins (HSP 70) directly involved in the potential virulence growth as crucial markers or factors in C. lunata. To validate 2DE results and screen differential genes at mRNA level, we constructed a subtracted cDNA library (tester: virulence-increased strain; driver: WS18). A total of 188 unigenes were obtained this way, of which 14 were indicators for the evolution of pathogen virulence. Brn1 and hsp genes exhibited similar expression patterns corresponding to proteins detected by 2DE. Overall, our results indicated that differential proteins or genes, being involved with melanin synthesis or tolerance response to stress, could be considered as hallmarks of virulence increase in C. lunata.",

We combined iTRAQ labeling and Orbitrap mass spectrometry to discover proteins with different CSF abundance between six RRMS patients and 18 neurological disease controls. From 777 quantified proteins seven were selected as biomarker candidates, namely chitinase-3-like protein 1, secretogranin-1 (Sg1), cerebellin-1, neuroserpin, cell surface glycoprotein MUC18, testican-2 and glutamate receptor 4. An independent sample set of 13 early-MS patients, 13 RRMS patients and 13 neurological controls was used in a multiple reaction monitoring verification study. We found the intracellular calcium binding protein Sg1 to be increased in early-MS patients compared to RRMS and neurological controls. Sg1 should be included in further studies to elucidate its role in the early phases of MS pathogenesis and its potential as a biomarker for this disease.",

To better understand the role of nuclear proteins in water-deficit condition, a nuclear proteome was developed from a dehydration-sensitive rice cultivar IR-64 followed by its comparison with that of a dehydration-tolerant c.v. Rasi. The 2-DE protein profiling of c.v. IR-64 coupled with MS/MS analysis led to the identification of 93 dehydration-responsive proteins (DRPs). Among those identified proteins, 78 were predicted to be destined to the nucleus, accounting for more than 80% of the dataset. While the detected number of protein spots in c.v. IR-64 was higher when compared with that of Rasi, the number of DRPs was found to be lesser. Fifty seven percent of the DRPs were found to be common to both sensitive and tolerant cultivars, indicating significant differences between the two nuclear proteomes. Further, we constructed a functional association network of the DRPs of c.v. IR-64, which suggests that a significant number of the proteins are capable of interacting with each other. The combination of nuclear proteome and interactome analyses would elucidate stress-responsive signaling and the molecular basis of dehydration tolerance in plants.

Pearson correlation analysis showed that the composition of the mitochondrial complexes was unchanged under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, with the exception of complex II.

Several of these proteins have been described as being involved in the process of inflammation, such as Erp29, Hspa9a, AnxaI, Ran GTPase, P4hb, Clic1 and Psma1. The analysis of the consequences of their variation unravels an overall anti-inflammatory response of macrophages during the interaction with heat-inactivated cells.

This methodology employs isoelectric focusing of peptides on immobilized pH gradient (IPG) gels in the first dimension, followed by reversed-phase chromatography in the second dimension, and subsequent tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The traditional approach to this mixture problem employs strong-cation-exchange (SCX) chromatography in the first dimension. Here, we present a direct comparison of these two first-dimensional techniques using complex protein samples derived from the testis of Rattus norvegicus. It was found that the use of immobilized pH gradients (narrow range pH 3.5-4.5) for peptide separation in the first dimension yielded 13% more protein identifications than the optimized off-line SCX approach (employing the entire pI range of the sample). In addition, the IPG technique allows for a much more efficient use on mass spectrometer analysis time. Separation of a tryptic digest derived from a rat testis sample on a narrow range pH gradient (over the 3.5-4.5 pH range) yielded 7626 and 2750 peptides and proteins, respectively. Peptide and protein identification was performed with high confidence using SEQUEST in combination with a data filtering program employing pI and statistical based functions to remove false-positives from the data.",

Quantitative analysis of CYP expression levels is important when studying the efficacy of new drug molecules and assessing drug-drug interactions in drug development. At present, chemical probe-based assay is the most widely used approach for the evaluation of CYP activity although there are cross-reactions between the isoforms with high sequence homologies. Therefore, quantification of each isozyme is highly desired in regard to meeting the ever-increasing requirements for carrying out pharmacokinetics and personalized medicine in the academic, pharmaceutical, and clinical setting. Herein, an absolute quantification method was employed for the analysis of the seven isoforms CYP1A2, 2B6, 3A4, 3A5, 2C9, 2C19, and 2E1 using a proteome-derived approach in combination with stable isotope dilution assay. The average absolute amount measured from twelve human liver microsomes samples were 39.3, 4.3, 54.0, 4.6, 10.3, 3.0, and 9.3 (pmol/mg protein) for 1A2, 2B6, 3A4, 3A5, 2C9, 2C19, and 2E1, respectively. Importantly, the expression level of CYP3A4 showed high correlation (r = 0.943, p < 0.0001) with the functional activity, which was measured using bufalin-a highly selective chemical probe we have developed. The combination of MRM identification and analysis of the functional activity, as in the case of CYP3A4, provides a protocol which can be extended to other functional enzyme studies with wide application in pharmaceutical research.",

However, the fertility of TGMS rice line during hybrid seed production is frequently influenced by low temperature, thus leading to its fertility/sterility alteration and hybrid seed production failure. To understand the mechanism of fertility alternation under low temperature inducement, the extracted proteins from young panicles of two TGMS rice lines at the fertility alternation sensitivity stage were analyzed by 2DE. Eighty-three protein spots were found to be significantly changed in abundance, and identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF MS. The identified proteins were involved in 16 metabolic pathways and cellular processes. The young panicles of TGMS rice line Zhu 1S possessed the lower ROS-scavenging, indole-3-acetic acid level, soluble protein, and sugar contents as well as the faster anther wall disintegration than those of TGMS rice line Zhun S. All these major differences might result in that the former is more stable in fertility than the latter. Based on the majority of the 83 identified proteins, together with microstructural, physiological, and biochemical results, a possible fertile alteration mechanism in the young panicles of TGMS rice line under low temperature inducement was proposed. Such a result will help us in breeding TGMS rice lines and production of hybrid seed.",

Until now, little is known about the effects of vegetable consumption at the proteome level. Therefore, the effect of increased vegetable intake on the protein expression in the colonic mucosa of healthy mice was studied. Aim was to identify the proteins that are differentially expressed by increased vegetable consumption and to discriminate their possible role in the protection against colorectal cancer. Mice were fed four different vegetable diets, which was followed by analysis of total cellular protein from colonic mucosal cells by a combination of 2-DE and MS. We found 30 proteins that were differentially expressed in one or more diets as compared to the control diet. Six could be identified by MALDI-TOF MS: myosin regulatory light chain 2, carbonic anhydrase I, high-mobility group protein 1, pancreatitis-associated protein 3, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ATP synthase oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein. Alterations in the levels of these proteins agree with a role in the protection against colon cancer. We conclude that these proteins are suitable markers for the health effect of food on cancer. The observed altered protein levels therefore provide support for the protective effects of vegetables against colorectal cancer.",

Proteasomal subunits are found to be upregulated and phospho-catalase level also got altered. Severe oxidative stress inside erythrocyte is evident from the ROS analysis and Oxyblot(TM) experiments. Peroxiredoxin-2 shows significant dimerization in the SCD patients, a hallmark of oxidative stress inside erythrocytes. One interesting fact is that most of the differentially regulated proteins are also common for hemoglobinopathies such as E\u03b2 thalassemia. These could provide important clues in understanding the pathophysiology of SCD and lead us to better patient management in the future.",

        "abstract": "Cancer is a diverse disease, and biomarkers reflecting this diversity will lead to better therapeutic strategies. By linking proteomic data and clinico-pathological parameters, we are identifying proteins informative for fea- tures of clinical relevance to cancer patients. To obtain proteome data, we developed a large format system for two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and an application of highly sensitive fluorescent dye for laser microdissection. Following the comprehensive proteome study of more than 1,000 surgical specimens and cor- responding clinico-pathological data, we concluded that the proteome reflects the major cancer phenotypes such as histological differentiation, poor prognosis, and response to treatment. Furthermore, we found that certain single proteins predict the clinical outcome in many types of malignancies including esophageal cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing\u2019s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. By monitoring biomarker proteins to predict the clinical outcome, we will be able to optimize the therapeutic strategy, either by intensifying treatment or by avoiding over-treatment. The results of the cancer proteomics studies are integrated into a proteome database named Genome Medicine Database of Japan Proteomics. The above establish proteomics as a primary tool in the development of novel diagnostic modalities for personalized medicine.",

Bone integrity is maintained by the dynamic processes of bone resorption and bone formation (bone remodeling). Osteoporosis results when there is an imbalance of the two counteracting processes. Bone mineral density, measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry has been the primary method to assess fracture risk for decades. Recent studies demonstrated that measurement of bone turnover markers allows for a dynamic assessment of bone remodeling, while imaging techniques, such as dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, do not. The application of proteomics has permitted discoveries of new, sensitive, bone turnover markers, which provide unique information for clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients with bone diseases. This review summarizes the recent findings of proteomic studies on bone diseases, properties of mesenchymal stem cells with high expansion rates and osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation, with emphasis on the role of quantitative proteomics in the study of signaling dynamics, biomarkers and discovery of therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a developmental disorder of the enteric nervous system characterized by aganglionosis in distal gut. The estimated population incidence of HSCR is 1/5000 live births, but higher in Asian populations. As the disease mainly manifested bowel motility disturbance, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Furthermore, in the long term up to 75% of patients showed unsatisfactory postoperative bowel function like incontinence or constipation, and 10% required a permanent colostomy. Improved therapy of HSCR is required, but the pathophysiological mechanism for postoperative bowel dysfunction is not clear. In this study, we perform a proteomics study in HSCR patients, expecting some findings in protein alterations to provide more information to reveal the pathophysiological mechanisms of disturbed bowel function before and after surgery therapy. As a result, we identified 16 proteins expressed differently in aganglionic segment of HSCR patients. These proteins function diversely, and included cytoskeleton proteins, regulatory proteins and some enzymes. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In the present study, we performed a 2-DE based proteomic research on HSCR patients, in order to find some clue for the pathomechanism of bowel motility of HSCR disease. As a character of this study, we also compared the expression of altered proteins in ganglionic segment of HSCR patients with that in normal children. Our results showed that some altered proteins found in aganglionic segment had also changed their expression in ganglionic segment comparing with normal children. This result suggested that the ganglionic segment of HSCR patients was not completely normal, and this is important because it provided more information to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of bowel dysfunction and will help to the therapy of HSCR disease.",

Besides traditional genetic, molecular, cellular and biochemical methods studying plant-virus interactions, both global and specialized proteomics methods are emerging as useful approaches for the identification of all the host proteins that play roles in virus infections. The various proteomics approaches include measuring differential protein expression in virus infected versus noninfected cells, analysis of viral and host protein components in the viral replicase or other virus-induced complexes, as well as proteome-wide screens to identify host protein - viral protein interactions using protein arrays or yeast two-hybrid assays. In this review, we will discuss the progress made in plant virology using various proteomics methods, and highlight the functions of some of the identified host proteins during viral infections. Since global proteomics approaches do not usually identify the molecular mechanism of the identified host factors during viral infections, additional experiments using genetics, biochemistry, cell biology and other approaches should also be performed to characterize the functions of host factors. Overall, the ever-improving proteomics approaches promise further understanding of plant-virus interactions that will likely result in new strategies for viral disease control in plants.",

        "abstract": "Honey bees play a crucial role in pollinating wild and cultivated vegetation, with substantial implications on our economy and food supply. Our scientific knowledge of bees consists largely of behavioral or macroscopic-level biological studies. Although in the past several decades there have been some advances in our knowledge of specific hormones, genes, and proteins, molecular biology of bees remain poorly understood relative to the depth to which we understand humans, and typical model organisms such as the mouse or fruit fly. This is due in part to the lack of available reagents for interrogating protein-specific information in standard assays such as Western blot, immunolocalization, and im- munoaffinity purification, as well as a relatively difficult system for introducing small, interfering RNAs. Given the available genome sequence then, mass spectrometry-based proteomics techniques are ideally suited to studies in bees; starting from so little knowledge, the discovery-based nature of proteomics should allow for a very steep learning curve relative to better-studied systems such as fruit fly. To this end, twenty-two honey bee proteomics papers have been published since 2005. Here we present a brief summary of biochemical/molecular biological research in bees, including some of the challenges; we focus on the proteomics work to date, and relate these findings to recent transcriptomic work and proteomic studies in other social insects. We end with some speculation on where proteomics is most likely able to provide insight into bee biology where other methods would fail. As the general population and scientific community become increasingly aware of the value of honey bees to both our economy and ecosystem, proteomics will play an important role in improving our understanding of this beneficial insect. \u00ac\u00a9 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

In this study, we analyzed the proteomic alterations in the pulp of 'Hong Anliu' versus its wild type (WT) at four maturing stages by using 2-DE combined with MALDI-TOF-TOF MS. Among the 74 differentially expressed proteins identified, the majority are predicted to be involved in stress response, carbohydrate/energy metabolism and regulation, or protein fate, modification and degradation. Particularly, expression levels of six anti-oxidative enzymes were altered by the mutation; and assays of their respective enzymatic activities indicated an enhanced level of oxidative stress in 'Hong Anliu', implying a regulatory role of oxidative stress on carotenogenesis. This conclusion was further confirmed by our observation that treatment of fruit pulps with tert-butylhydroperoxide (a ROS progenitor) induced lycopene accumulation in 'Hong Anliu' only. Gene expression showed that genes predicted to function upstream of lycopene biosynthesis were generally upregulated in juice sacs, but downregulated in segment membranes in both 'Hong Anliu' and its WT. The result suggests an important role of post-transcriptional regulation on carotenogenesis since lycopene was induced in 'Hong Anliu' but not WT. The result also implies that carotenogenesis in juice sacs and segment membranes of citrus fruits may be regulated by different mechanisms.",

These proteins function to promote encapsidation of the RNA genome and virus particle assembly as well as playing potential roles in viral RNA synthesis. Nucleocapsid proteins can also associate with cellular proteins and signaling cascades. The arterivirus nucleocapsid (N) protein is no exception and localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus in virus-infected cells. This study generated an interactome map of the N protein from a highly virulent North American strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). This is a major pathogen of swine resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Crucial to the study was the use of SILAC coupled to affinity purification using GFP-traps and LC-MS/MS. This approach has not been applied before to the investigation of host/viral protein interactomes and this study revealed that the PRRSV N protein interacts with the host cell protein synthesis machinery especially at the level of translation initiation as well as with the RNA post-transcriptional modification machinery. Applications of the dataset can include studies of virus/host interactions and the design of live attenuated recombinant vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a gram-negative facultative aerobic bacterium living at oxic-anoxic interfaces in nature. The plasticity of terminal electron-acceptors used under anaerobic conditions is huge, but the adaptation to these different environmental conditions remains unclear. In this work, we used a proteomic approach to study the protein content when the organism is grown under anaerobic respiration conditions on insoluble ferric oxide. By analysis of two-dimensional gel patterns of soluble protein extracts, we discovered 20 differentially displayed proteins. The protein spots were further analyzed by mass spectrometry for which we used, in addition to nano-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to an electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight instrument, a recently introduced matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) tandem-time of flight mass spectrometer. The instrument allows the acquisition of high quality spectra, in both the mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry mode, and is therefore able to identify protein spots unambiguously. Advantageous to electrospray ionization is a minimised sample handling, inherent to MALDI ionization, and the presence of high energy fragmentation ions, generating sequence information that also can differentiate isobaric amino acids. With this strategy, we could point out a regulatory protein that is up-regulated under iron (III) respiration. This protein, the aerobic respiration control protein (ArcA), has been reported as being a regulator during anaerobiosis in other species. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the possible involvement of ArcA from S. oneidensis MR-1 in the reduction of ferric oxide.",

Translocations involving their genes lead to sarcomas. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF), although not grouped in this family, presents structural and functional similarities with TET proteins and is involved in translocation leading to carcinoma. Beside their role in RNA metabolism, the precise cellular functions of these multifunctional proteins are not yet fully elucidated. We previously showed that both TLS/FUS and PSF display activities able to pair homologous DNA on membrane in an in vitro assay. In the present study, we address the question whether EWS and hTAF(II)68 also display pairing on membrane activities, and to a larger extent whether other proteins also exhibit such activity. We applied the pairing on membrane assay to 2-DE coupled to MS analysis for a global screening of DNA pairing on membrane activities. In addition to TLS/FUS and PSF, this test allowed us to identify EWS and hTAF(II)68, but no other proteins, indicating a feature specific to a protein family whose members share extensive structural similarities. This common activity suggests a role for TET proteins and PSF in genome plasticity control.",

We have used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), oligonucleotide microarrays and principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize the U937 cell line as a model system for the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. A total of 226 differentially expressed proteins were found, of which 41 were selected by PCA for identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Based on the PCA results, three marker proteins were selected for confirmation of differential expression using Western blot and quantitative real time-PCR. The selected marker proteins were: gamma interferon inducible lysosomal thiol reductase, cathepsin D and adipocyte-fatty acid binding protein. All three proved to be good differentiation markers for macrophage maturation of U937 cells as well as peripheral blood-derived macrophages. The transcriptomics data revealed a large number of additional putative differentiation markers in U937 macrophages, many of which are known to be expressed in peripheral blood-derived macrophages. These include osteospontin, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and HC-gp39. Our results show that the characteristics of U937 macrophages resemble those of inflammatory (exudate) macrophages, exemplified by the down-regulation of 5' nucleotidase and the up-regulation of leucine aminopeptidase mRNAs. In conclusion, using the powerful combination of transcriptomics, 2-DE and PCA, our results show that U937 cells differentiated by PMA treatment are an excellent model system for monocyte derived macrophage generation from blood.",

Although a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this higher sensitivity of females, the precise mechanism is not well understood. The objective of this study was to identify changes in global protein expression in liver tissues of male and female rats with pathologically evident ASH by 2-DE (dimensional electrophoresis). ASH was induced in the SD (Sprague-Dawley) rats by feeding ethanol (EtOH) containing Lieber-DeCarli diet for 6 wk followed by a single injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg, i.p.). Higher liver injury in females in the ASH group as compared to the males was confirmed by HE stained liver sections. As identified by 2-DE, 22 protein-spots were differentially expressed in the females in the ASH group as compared to the males. Following identification of these proteins by MALDI-MS, they were mainly categorized into metabolism and oxidative stress-related proteins. The expression pattern of a few of these oxidative stress-related proteins like Ferritin Heavy chain (Ferritin-H chain), ER stress protein 60 (ER 60) and Heat-shock protein-60 (HSP 60) were verified by Western blotting. To conclude, the current study has identified a set of proteins that highlights potential novel mechanisms associated with higher liver injury noted in the female rat ASH model.",

Microtubule destabilising drugs such as the combretastatins form the largest group of tumour vascular disrupting agents and cause selective shutdown of tumour blood flow within minutes to hours, leading to secondary tumour cell death. Targeting the tumour vasculature is a proven anticancer strategy but early treatment response biomarkers are required for personalising treatment planning. Protein induction following treatment with combretastatin A4-phosphate was examined in a mouse fibrosarcoma model (fs188), where tumour cells express only the matrix-bound isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF188). These tumours are relatively resistant to vascular disruption by combretastatin A4-phosphate and hence a study of protein induction following treatment could yield insights into resistance mechanisms. The distribution of a number of proteins induced following treatment were visualised by MALDI-mass spectrometry imaging. Responses identified were validated by LC-ESI-MS/MS and immunohistochemical staining. Significant changes in proteins connected with necrosis, cell structure, cell survival and stress-induced molecular chaperones were identified. Protein-protein interactions were identified using STRING 9.0 proteomic network software. These relationship pathways provided an insight into the activity of the active tumour milieu and a means of linking the identified proteins to their functional partners.",

HCT-8 cells were incubated with interleukin 1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interferon-\u03b3 for 2 h. Total cellular protein extracts were separated by 2D gel electrophoresis and analyzed by an immunodetection using antiubiquitin antibody. Differential ubiquitinated proteins were then identified by LC-ESI MS/MS. Seven proteins were differentially ubiquitinated between control and inflammatory conditions. Three of them were chaperones: Grp75 and Hsc70 were more ubiquitinated (p < 0.05) and Grp78 was less ubiquitinated (p < 0.05) under inflammatory conditions. The results for Grp75 and Grp78 were then confirmed in HCT-8 cells and in 2-4-6-trinitrobenzen sulfonic acid induced colitis in rats mimicking inflammatory bowel disease by immunoprecipitation. No difference was observed in irritable bowel syndrome like model. In conclusion, we showed that a proteomic approach is suitable to identify ubiquitinated proteins and that UPS-regulated expression of Grp75 and Grp78 may be involved in inflammatory response. Further studies should lead to the identification of ubiquitin ligases responsible for Grp75 and Grp78 ubiquitination.",

To systemically identify novel protein biomarkers associated with CAD progression for early diagnosis and possible therapeutic intervention, we employed an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach to analyze the proteome changes in the plasma collected from a pair of wild-type versus apolipoprotein E knockout (APOE(-/-) ) mice which were fed with a high fat diet. In a multiplex manner, iTRAQ serves as the quantitative 'in-spectra' marker for 'cross-sample' comparisons to determine the differentially expressed/secreted proteins caused by APOE knock-out. To obtain the most comprehensive proteomic data sets from this CAD-associated mouse model, we applied both MALDI and ESI-based mass spectrometric (MS) platforms coupled with two different schemes of multidimensional liquid chromatography (2-D LC) separation. We then comparatively analyzed a series of the plasma samples collected at 6 and 12\u2009wk of age after the mice were fed with fat diets, where the 6- or 12-wk time point represents the early or intermediate phase of the fat-induced CAD, respectively. We then categorized those proteins showing abundance changes in accordance with APOE depletion. Several proteins such as the \u03b3 and \u03b2 chains of fibrinogen, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein C-I, and thrombospondin-4 were among the previously known CAD markers identified by other methods. Our results suggested that these unbiased proteomic methods are both feasible and a practical means of discovering potential biomarkers associated with CAD progression.",

The highly hydrophobic nature of lipid raft proteins pose significant problems of solubilization and recovery that hinder analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) and may under-report the composition of lipid rafts. In a previous investigation of the monocyte lipid raft in which proteins were digested with trypsin following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis we identified 52 proteins. Here we report the development of a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-aided approach in which proteins are digested in solution and examined by high-performance liquid chromatography-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MALDI-MS/MS) using a novel LC-MALDI interface thereby circumventing the need to separate proteins on gels. Using this approach we identified 71 proteins in the lipid raft, 45 of which were not detected using in-gel digestion. Among the new proteins are alpha- and beta-tubulin, tubulinspecific chaperone A, a folding protein involved in tubulin dimer assembly, and KIF13, a microtubule motor protein indicating that proteins involved in microtubule assembly and trafficking are more readily detected using an in-solution approach. To investigate why tubulin was not identified by in-gel digestion, we compared the distribution of alpha-tubulin and the raft marker flotillin-2 in buoyant density gradients before and after separation on SDS-gels. Both proteins were present in the raft fractions, but tubulin was selectively lost following separation on SDS-gels. Assemblies of cytoskeletal proteins with lipid rafts may therefore be resolved using in-solution digestion that would be missed using gel-based approaches.",

In the present report, we describe an improved detection method for RPPA combining near-infrared with one or two rounds of tyramide-based signal amplification. The LOQ was lowered from 6.84 attomoles with a direct detection protocol to 0.21 attomole with two amplification steps. We validated this method in the context of intracellular signal transduction triggered by follicle-stimulating hormone in HEK293 cells. We consistently detected phosphorylated proteins in the sub-attomole range from less than 1 ng of total cell extracts. Importantly, the method correlated with Western blot analysis of the same samples while displaying excellent intra- and inter-slide reproducibility. We conclude that RPPA combined with amplified near-infrared detection can be used to capture the subtle regulations intrinsic to signalling network dynamics at an unprecedented throughput, from minute amounts of biological samples.",

Thus, to identify any useful HCC-related biomarkers is still a need. We performed SELDI-TOF MS to identify differentially expressed proteins in HCC serum using weak cation exchange protein chips. Protein characterization was performed by 2-DE separation and nano flow LC-MS/MS. A total of 55 sera were collected from HCC patients and compared with those from 48 patients with chronic hepatitis and 9 healthy individuals. A candidate marker of about 8900 Da was detected as differentially expressed in patients with chronic hepatitis C and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC. We identified this differentially expressed protein as complement C3a. The expression of C3a in HCC sera was further validated by PS20 chip immunoassay and Western blotting. Complement C3a was found to be elevated in patients with chronic hepatitis C and HCV-related HCC. The combination of SELDI-TOF MS and 2-DE provides a solution to identify disease-associated serum biomarkers.",

Here we revealed uterine proteins of late-gestation rats by 2-D shotgun proteomic analysis and correlated protein expression with uterine functions. After duplication, 239 proteins were identified. About 190 proteins commonly found in duplicate analyses were subjected to functional annotation. The proteins associated with signal transduction fell into three known pathways. Western blotting and functional data indicated that: (i) a reduction of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase-related proteins was associated with the decrease of contraction rate, (ii) a reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase type II-alpha regulatory chain (PKARII alpha) was associated with an increase in the relaxation response to 8-bromo-cAMP, and (iii) in the presence of Ras, an increased expression of nucleolin was associated with the elevation of Bcl-xL, an antiapoptotic protein. In conclusion, 2-D shotgun proteomic analysis provides a global database of uterine proteins for hypothesis-driven studies. Our data suggest that in late-gestation uteri down-regulation of PKARII alpha and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase may cause functional remodeling and lead to uterine quiescent. Up-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins (nucleolin and Bcl-xL) in the Ras-mediated pathway may maintain cell survival and counteract cell loss during remodeling.",

To explore direct HIF-1 targets, here we used differential gel electrophoresis (DIGE) to compare the HIF-1-regulated proteins between leukemic U937T-cell line with and without conditional induction of HIF-1alpha protein by tetracycline-off system. Among the upregulated proteins identified, mRNA levels of annexin A1, macrophage-capping protein (CapG), S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4), S100A11, acyl-CoA-binding protein and calcyclin-binding protein also increased. The expressions of the annexin A1, CapG and S100A4 genes were significantly induced by hypoxia in five adherent cell lines tested besides U937 cells, while their expressions were blocked by the short hairpin RNA specifically against HIF-1alpha. Further luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that HIF-1alpha directly bound to three hypoxia-responsive elements located at intron 1 of S100A4 gene and hypoxia-responsive element at -350 to -346 of CapG gene, which are essential for HIF-1-induced expression. Additionally, the role of S100A4 expression in migration and invasion of cancer cells were also confirmed. These findings would provide new sights for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying HIF-1 action.",

Across all four growth conditions, 976 gene products were identified with high confidence, which is equal to approximately 28% of all predicted proteins in the D. vulgaris genome. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the proteins identified were distributed among almost all functional classes, with the energy metabolism category containing the greatest number of identified proteins. At least 154 ORFs originally annotated as hypothetical proteins were found to encode the expressed proteins, which provided verification for the authenticity of these hypothetical proteins. Proteomic analysis showed that proteins potentially involved in ATP biosynthesis using the proton gradient across membrane, such as ATPase, alcohol dehydrogenases, heterodisulfide reductases, and [NiFe] hydrogenase (HynAB-1) of the hydrogen cycling were highly expressed in all four growth conditions, suggesting they may be the primary pathways for ATP synthesis in D. vulgaris. Most of the enzymes involved in substrate-level phosphorylation were also detected in all tested conditions. However, no enzyme involved in CO cycling or formate cycling was detected, suggesting that they are not the primary ATP-biosynthesis pathways under the tested conditions. This study provides the first proteomic overview of the cellular metabolism of D. vulgaris. The complete list of proteins identified in this study and their abundances (peptide hits) is provided in Supplementary Table 1.",

To explore mechanisms of TGFbeta action, we performed systemic analysis of functional dependencies between 153 proteins which changed their expression and synthesis upon treatment of human breast epithelial cells with TGFbeta1. We found that TGFbeta1 initiated signaling via a scale-free network of proteins which affect primary cellular metabolism, stress response, signal transduction, transport, transcription, cytoskeleton, and cell death. Multiple inputs into each functional domain were observed, emphasizing robustness of TGFbeta1 signaling. Network analysis demonstrated importance of a Plag1/CNK1/RASSF1A/Src-dependent prozone effect, as a systemic feature which is crucial for TGFbeta1-dependent activation of Erk1/2 and regulation of cell proliferation. We showed that the balance between Plag1, CNK1, RASSF1A and Src defined whether TGFbeta1 will stimulate, inhibit or will have no effect on a long-term activation of Erk1/2 and subsequent TGFbeta1 inhibitory or stimulatory effect on cell proliferation. This is the first demonstration of importance of systemic features for incorporation of Erk1/2 activation into TGFbeta1 signaling.",

To gain insights into these processes, we conducted quantitative proteomic analyses with 21T series of breast cell lines, which include a normal, primary tumor and a metastatic tumor that were isolated from a single patient. Stable isotope labeling of amino acid in cell culture followed by LC-MS/MS analysis was performed and deregulated proteins were identified using statistical analysis. Gene ontology analysis revealed that proteins involved in metabolic processes were the most deregulated in both tumorigenesis and metastasis. Interaction network analysis indicated that ERBB2 signaling played a critical role in tumorigenesis. In addition to known markers such as ERBB2 and E-cadherin, novel markers, including BRP44L, MTHFD2 and TIMM17A, were found to be overexpressed in 21T breast cancer cells and verified in additional breast cell lines. mRNA expression analysis as well as immunohistochemistry analysis in breast cancer tissues indicated that expression level of TIMM17A was directly correlated with tumor progression, and survival analysis suggested that TIMM17A was a powerful prognosis factor in breast cancer. More interestingly, overexpression and siRNA knockdown experiments indicated an oncogenic activity of TIMM17A in breast cancer. Our study provides a list of potential novel markers for breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis using a unique cell model. Further studies on TIMM17A as well as other markers on the list may reveal mechanisms that result in more effective therapeutics for cancer treatment.",

Further, markers for determining the integrity and status of a biological sample were identified. The protein fragment stathmin 2-20 correlated well with the general level of postmortem degradation and may serve as a sample quality indicator for future work, both in animal and human postmortem brains. Finally, a novel method for preventing degradation of proteins and peptides in postmortem tissue is presented using rapid and uniform conductive heat transfer on tissue prior to the actual sample preparation procedures, which enables the relatively low-abundant neuropeptides to remain intact, minimizes degradation of proteins by proteolysis, and conserves the PTMs of the neuropeptides.",

The events that have led to the birth of proteomics are also recalled, ending with a description of the now well-known limitations of two-dimensional gels in proteomics. However, the often-underestimated advantages of two-dimensional gels are also underlined, leading to a description of how and when to use two-dimensional gels for the best in a proteomics approach.

Advances in nanotechnology have begun to allow researchers to identify low-abundance proteins in samples through techniques that rely upon both nanoparticles and nanoscale devices. Coupled with rapid advances made in protein identification and isolation over the past decade, currently available technology enables more effective multiplexing and improved signal-to-noise, which enhances detection of low-abundance proteins in cellular and tissue lysates significantly. Techniques, including nanowires, nanocantilevers, bio-barcoding and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, permit the detection of proteins into the low attomolar range, where many biologically important cellular processes occur.

Biomedical and biochemical engineering continue to grow as important facets of the discipline. Within these, the value and applicability of proteomics were demonstrated in a number of interesting presentations. This year, as in the recent past, the AIChE Annual Meeting was held in conjunction with the American Electrophoresis Society Annual Meeting. American Electrophoresis Society presenters offered further academic and industrial viewpoints on the still-developing role of proteomics and proteomic technologies in biological and clinical analyses.",

However, more recently, the field has become formalized by combining the techniques for large-scale protein separation (two-dimensional electrophoresis) with very precise, high fidelity approaches to the analysis and characterisation of the separated proteins (mass spectrometry). These approaches bring to reality the powerful scope of proteomics, enabling the interpretation of cell physiology through profiling the molecular biodescriptors of gene expression, the proteins. Applications of proteomics are wide ranging and can be found within many disciplines, although one of the more developed fields that is examined here covers the arena of toxicological and pharmacological profiling. In this paper, the current technologies that make proteomics possible will be looked at. Some areas where proteomics has delivered valuable biological insight will also be considered, and there will be a look towards future areas of development.",

Many laboratories are applying the rapidly emerging technologies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms associated with cancer development, progression, and severity in addition to developing drugs and identifying patients who will benefit most from molecular targeted compounds. Various proteomic approaches are now available for protein separation and identification, and for characterization of the function and structure of candidate proteins. In spite of significant challenges that still exist, proteomics has rapidly expanded to include the discovery of novel biomarkers for early detection, diagnosis and prognostication (clinical application), and for the identification of novel drug targets (pharmaceutical application). To achieve these goals, several innovative technologies including 2-D-difference gel electrophoresis, SELDI, multidimensional protein identification technology, isotope-coded affinity tag, solid-state and suspension protein array technologies, X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and computational methods such as comparative and de novo structure prediction and molecular dynamics simulation have evolved, and are being used in different combinations.

Here, the TAP-tagged bait protein is expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The two concatenated purification steps of the classical TAP are performed after addition of the purified bait to brain tissue homogenates, cell and nuclear extracts. Without prior genetic manipulation of the target, upscaling, free choice of cell compartments and avoidance of expression triggered heat shock responses could be achieved in one go. By the strategy of separating bait expression from the prey protein environment numerous established, mostly tissue-specific binding partners of the protein kinase A catalytic subunit C beta 1 were identified, including interactions in binary, ternary and quaternary complexes. In addition, the previously unknown small molecule inhibitor-dependent interaction of C beta 1 with the cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory protein-1 was verified. The uncoupled tandem affinity purification procedure presented here expands the application range of the in vivo TAP assay and may serve as a simple strategy for identifying cell- and tissue-specific protein complexes.",

In the past decade, 18 studies have been performed to analyze the protein content of isolated organelles from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we integrate the data sets and compare them with other large scale studies on protein localization and abundance. We evaluate the completeness and reliability of the organelle proteomics studies. Reliability depends on the purity of the organelle preparations, which unavoidably contain (small) amounts of contaminants from different locations. Quantitative proteomics methods can be used to distinguish between true organellar constituents and contaminants. Completeness is compromised when loosely or dynamically associated proteins are lost during organelle preparation and also depends on the sensitivity of the analytical methods for protein detection. There is a clear trend in the data from the 18 organelle proteomics studies showing that proteins of low abundance frequently escape detection. Proteins with unknown function or cellular abundance are also infrequently detected, indicating that these proteins may not be expressed under the conditions used. We discuss that the yeast organelle proteomics studies provide powerful lead data for further detailed studies and that methodological advances in organelle preparation and in protein detection may help to improve the completeness and reliability of the data.",

Here, we review proteomics studies of human brain samples in light of recent advances of mass spectrometry, focusing on the general strategies for experimental design and analysis (e.g., sample pooling and replication, selection of proteomics platforms, and false discovery rate in data processing), because quantitative analysis of clinical samples is confounded by a number of variables, including genetic differences, antemortem and postmortem factors, and experimental errors. Diverse proteomics platforms are also discussed with respect to sensitivity, throughput, and accuracy. Regarding the enormous complexity of the human brain and the limitation of current proteomics technologies, it may be more practical to analyze a subset of proteome in a functional context, in order to facilitate the identification of important disease-related proteins in the substantial noise reflecting biological and technical variances.",

Based on the clinical presentation, rabies can be classified into encephalitic (furious) or paralytic (numb) rabies. Early diagnosis of this disease is particularly important as rabies is invariably fatal if adequate post exposure prophylaxis is not administered immediately following the bite.\\n\\nMETHODS: In this study, we carried out a quantitative proteomic analysis of the human brain tissue from cases of encephalitic and paralytic rabies along with normal human brain tissues using an 8-plex isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) strategy.\\n\\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We identified 402 proteins, of which a number of proteins were differentially expressed between encephalitic and paralytic rabies, including several novel proteins. The differentially expressed molecules included karyopherin alpha 4 (KPNA4), which was overexpressed only in paralytic rabies, calcium calmodulin dependent kinase 2 alpha (CAMK2A), which was upregulated in paralytic rabies group and glutamate ammonia ligase (GLUL), which was overexpressed in paralytic as well as encephalitic rabies. We validated two of the upregulated molecules, GLUL and CAMK2A, by dot blot assays and further validated CAMK2A by immunohistochemistry. These molecules need to be further investigated in body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid in a larger cohort of rabies cases to determine their potential use as antemortem diagnostic biomarkers in rabies. This is the first study to systematically profile clinical subtypes of human rabies using an iTRAQ quantitative proteomics approach.",

In addition we introduce the concepts of flow cytometry sorting to demonstrate the importance of being able to use flow cytometry as a cell separation technology to identify and collect purified cell populations. Data demonstrating the speed and versatility of this combination of flow cytometry-based cell separation and protein separation and subsequent analysis, examples of protein maps from purified sorted cells, and an analysis of the overall procedure will be shown.

With more than 600 ubiquitin ligases encoded by the human genome, many of which remain to be studied, considerable effort is being placed on the development of methods for identifying substrates of specific ubiquitin ligases. In this review, we describe proteomic technologies for identification of ubiquitin ligase targets with a particular focus on members of the cullin-RING E3 class of ubiquitin ligases, which use F-box proteins as substrate specific adaptor proteins. Various proteomic methods are described and are compared with genetic approaches that are available. The continued development of such methods is likely to have a substantial impact on the ubiquitin-proteasome field.",

As the effort and the intensive debate it has sparked continue, it is becoming apparent that a paradigm shift is needed in proteomics in order to truly comprehend the complexity of the human proteome and assess its subtle variations among individuals. This review introduces the concept of population proteomics as a future direction in proteomics research. Population proteomics is the study of protein diversity in human populations. High-throughput, top-down mass spectrometric approaches are employed to investigate, define and understand protein diversity and modulations across and within populations. Population proteomics is a discovery-oriented endeavor with a goal of establishing the incidence of protein structural variations and quantitative regulation of these modifications. Assessing human protein variations among and within populations is viewed as a paramount undertaking that can facilitate clinical proteomics' effort in discovery and validation of protein features that can be used as markers for early diagnosis of disease, monitoring of disease progression and assessment of therapy. This review outlines the growing need for analyzing individuals' proteomes and describes the approaches that are likely to be applied in such a population proteomics endeavor.",

There are a large number of applicable experimental techniques available for this pathogen and it has become a model organism for the study of intracellular pathogens. With the completion of the genomes for a type I (GT-1), type II (ME49) and type III (VEG) strains, proteomic studies on this organism have been greatly facilitated. Several subcellular proteomic studies have been completed on this pathogen. These studies have helped elucidate specialized invasion organelles and their composition, as well as proteins associated with the cytoskeleton. Global proteomic studies are leading to improved strategies for genome annotation in this organism and an improved understanding of protein regulation in this pathogen. Web-based resources, such as EPIC-DB and ToxoDB, provide proteomic data and support for studies on T. gondii. This review will summarize the current status of proteomic research on T. gondii.",

Several in-depth proteomic studies have been conducted on primary or immortalized cultures of neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells, and yet more remains to be done. Additionally, neurons and glial cells have been obtained from embryonic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells, and proteins associated with the differentiation process have been characterized to a certain degree with a view to further investigations.

Because previous studies suggest that lipofuscin contains protein that may impact pathogenic mechanisms, we pursued proteomics analysis of lipofuscin. The composition of RPE lipofuscin and its mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood in part because of the heterogeneity of isolated preparations. We purified RPE lipofuscin granules by treatment with proteinase K or SDS and showed by light, confocal, and transmission electron microscopy that the purified granules are free of extragranular material and associated membranes. Crude and purified lipofuscin preparations were quantitatively compared by (i) LC MS/MS proteomics analyses, (ii) immunoanalyses of oxidative protein modifications, (iii) amino acid analysis, (iv) HPLC of bisretinoids, and (v) assaying phototoxicity to RPE cells. From crude lipofuscin preparations 186 proteins were identified, many of which appeared to be modified. In contrast, very little protein ( approximately 2% (w/w) by amino acid analysis) and no identifiable protein were found in the purified granules, which retained full phototoxicity to cultured RPE cells. Our analyses showed that granules in purified and crude lipofuscin preparations exhibit no statistically significant differences in diameter or circularity or in the content of the bisretinoids A2E, isoA2E, and all-trans-retinal dimer-phosphatidylethanolamine. The finding that the purified granules contain minimal protein yet retain phototoxic activity suggests that RPE lipofuscin pathogenesis is largely independent of associated protein. The purified granules also exhibited oxidative protein modifications, including nitrotyrosine generated from reactive nitrogen oxide species and carboxyethylpyrrole and iso[4]levuglandin E(2) adducts generated from reactive lipid fragments. This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating RPE lipofuscin to be a potent generator of reactive oxygen species and supports the hypothesis that such species, including reactive fragments from lipids and retinoids, contribute to the mechanisms of RPE lipofuscin pathogenesis.",

One such pathology is childhood herpes simplex encephalitis, which shows a pattern of rare but diverse disease-disposing genetic variants. The present report shows how proteomics can help to understand susceptibility to childhood herpes simplex encephalitis and other viral infections, suggests that proteomics may have a particularly important role to play, emphasizes that variation over the population is a critical issue for proteomics and notes some new challenges for proteomics and related bioinformatics tools in the context of rare but diverse genetic defects.",

Obtaining noninvasive biomarkers (e.g., from the maternal circulation, urine or cervicovaginal fluid) may be more feasible for obstetric diseases than for diseases of the fetus, for which invasive methods are required (e.g., amniotic fluid, fetal urine). However, studies providing validated proteomics-identified biomarkers are limited.

In this report we evaluate in a direct comparative assessment two state-of-the-art quantitative proteomic approaches, namely difference in gel electrophoresis (DiGE) and metabolic stable isotope labeling. Therefore, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown under well defined experimental conditions in chemostats under two single nutrient-limited growth conditions using 14N- or 15N-labeled ammonium sulfate as the single nitrogen source. Following lysis and protein extraction from the two yeast samples, the proteins were fluorescently labeled using different fluorescent CyDyes. Subsequently, the yeast samples were mixed, and the proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Following in-gel digestion, the resulting peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Relative ratios in protein expression between these two yeast samples were determined using both DiGE and metabolic stable isotope labeling. Focusing on a small, albeit representative, set of proteins covering the whole gel range, including some protein isoforms and ranging from low to high abundance, we observe that the correlation between these two methods of quantification is good with the differential ratios determined following the equation RMet.Lab. = 0.98RDiGE with r2 = 0.89. Although the correlation between DiGE and metabolic stable isotope labeling is exceptionally good, we do observe and discuss (dis)advantages of both methods as well as in relation to other (quantitative) approaches.",

        "abstract": "Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are a diverse group of malignancies derived from mesenchymal tissue. Numerous different sub-types of sarcoma can be identified histologically and this reflects the capacity of mesenchymal precursor cells to differentiate along recognisable somatic lineages, although some sarcomas do not display any clear line of differentiation and form tumours with no obvious normal cellular counterpart. The morphological heterogeneity of sarcomas is paralleled by differences in biological behaviour that contribute to difficulties in understanding tumour progression and patterns of response to treatment. Although five-year survival rates of up to 80% can be achieved for localised sarcomas, some specific high-grade histological subtypes continue to portent poor prognosis, and metastasis at presentation remains a common problem. Identifying in advance the chemosensitivity of primary sarcomas, those sarcomas destined to metastasise, and successfully treating metastatic disease continues to pose a significant challenge. Proteomic analysis combined with mass spectroscopy and bioinformatics is a powerful approach to analysing molecular abnormalities responsible for the biological behaviour of sarcomas. Investigating abnormalities downstream of the genome using protein expression analysis has several important advantages over DNA sequencing or mRNA expression studies in cancer research. Sophisticated proteomic technologies have only recently been applied to the study of sarcomas with the principle aim of discovering new disease-specific biomarkers that will facilitate more accurate classification of sarcomas into clinically relevant sub-types as well as identifying novel therapeutic targets. This article will review recent developments and summarise the emerging role of proteomic analysis in the strategy of applying molecular classification to both the diagnosis and targeted treatment of sarcomas. \u00a9 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",

On September 18, 2010, the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) convened the \"International Workshop on Proteomic Data Quality Metrics\" in Sydney, Australia, to identify and address issues facing the development and use of such methods for open access proteomics data. The stakeholders at the workshop enumerated the key principles underlying a framework for data quality assessment in mass spectrometry data that will meet the needs of the research community, journals, funding agencies, and data repositories. Attendees discussed and agreed upon two primary needs for the wide use of quality metrics: (i) an evolving list of comprehensive quality metrics and (ii) standards accompanied by software analytics. Attendees stressed the importance of increased education and training programs to promote reliable protocols in proteomics. This workshop report explores the historic precedents, key discussions, and necessary next steps to enhance the quality of open access data. By agreement, this article is published simultaneously in Proteomics, Proteomics Clinical Applications, Journal of Proteome Research, and Molecular and Cellular Proteomics, as a public service to the research community.

Even though rapidly advancing proteomic techniques have facilitated the identification of roughly one third of the platelet proteome, a combination of abundance-based and activity-based proteomics methodologies is needed for elucidation of platelet functional characteristics including the definition of a \"core proteome\" and recognition of diverse enzyme activity profiles associated with various physiological states. In this review, we describe the latest mass spectrometry-based techniques capable of providing some of these physiological details required for more comprehensive evaluation of the human platelet repertoire.",

However, simply taking a straight verbatim approach to catalog all proteins in all tissues of different organisms is not viable. Researchers may need to focus on the perspectives of proteomics that are essential to the functional outcome of the cells. In Integrative Proteomics, expert researchers contribute both historical perspectives, new developments in sample preparation, gel-based and non-gel-based protein separation and identification using mass spectrometry. Substantial chapters are describing studies of the sub-proteomes such as phosphoproteome or glycoproteomes which are directly related to functional outcomes of the cells. Structural proteomics related to pharmaceutics development is also a perspective of the essence. Bioinformatics tools that can mine proteomics data and lead to pathway analyses become an integral part of proteomics. Integrative proteomics covers both look-backs and look-outs of proteomics. It is an ideal reference for students, new researchers, and experienced scientists who want to get an overview or insights into new development of the proteomics field.",

Whereas the mechanism of PrPSc formation and its infectivity are the subject of intensive research, the exact physiological function of PrPC and the mechanism of neurotoxicity are still unknown. Since prion infections are not limited to a monofunctional event, the PrPC/PrPSc conversion, this review will focus on recent insights into the biology of the prion protein uncovered by proteomic approaches. Recent neuroproteomic studies on the protein profile modifications associated with chronic prion infection in cell systems depicted the co-occurring biochemical abnormalities which are the basis of the prion-induced neuronal death and comprise targets for curative drugs. The involvement of other pathways in prion infectivity opens new insights into understanding of the mechanism of cellular toxicity at the molecular level. This can provide further perspectives for identification of novel therapeutic targets and also allows an integrated paradigm in the prion conversion/toxicity biology.",

While the synthesis of cellulosic biofuels is currently an achievable technology, associated production costs due to biomass recalcitrance, sugar composition and ineffectual conversion make their production impractical. In order to overcome these issues significant research will be required in areas ranging from plant cell wall biosynthesis, microbial host metabolism and tolerance that enable targeted engineering of these systems. Proteomics will play a central role in implementing this strategy by identifying new targets for biofuel crop engineering, analyzing engineered biochemical pathways and characterizing plant cell wall biosynthesis.

On the one hand, we enquire whether iTRAQ is used `optimally'; in other words, whether the community is keeping up with the methods that have been devised and the requirements that have become recognised, in quantitative proteomics. On the other hand, there is the question of whether an iTRAQ paper is written in such a way as to allow other researchers to challenge or improve the results. To tackle these two problems, we have reviewed the iTRAQ literature and gathered data about the methods; in this study, we discuss the experimental designs, the use of biological and technical replicates, the confirmation through additional experiments, the strategies to identify differential expression and supplementary information. Our conclusions aim at giving recommendations in light of our statistics.",

Currently, the limited understanding of aetiology prevents curative treatments for haematological malignancies. Until recently, the primary focus was on cytogenetics. Gene expression profiling and metaphase karyotyping has been done extensively, yet the lack of correlation between transcript and protein has limited the comprehensiveness of these approaches. Transcriptomics has dominated the field with significant emphasis being placed upon SNP genotyping, copy number variation analysis, DNA sequencing and methylation profiling. However, the integration of the existing knowledge with proteomics is needed to discover the molecular mechanisms of haematological malignancies and for the development of diagnostic tests. Proteomic analysis allows for direct assessment of the expressed, modified and degraded proteins. The Human Serum and Plasma Proteome Projects coupled with advancing technologies with increased sensitivity and throughput are beginning to produce productive breakthroughs including new markers for the detection of early stages of leukaemias and lymphomas. This review summarizes recent research efforts in the field of haematological malignancies, and examines relevant high throughput proteomic technologies, limitations, and pathophysiological background.

Ex vivo analysis of exosomes may provide biomarker discovery platforms and form non-invasive tools for disease diagnosis and monitoring. These vesicles have never before been studied in the context of bladder cancer, a major malignancy of the urological tract. We present the first proteomics analysis of bladder cancer cell exosomes. Using ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion, exosomes were highly purified from cultured HT1376 bladder cancer cells and verified as low in contaminants by Western blotting and flow cytometry of exosome-coated beads. Solubilization in a buffer containing SDS and DTT was essential for achieving proteomics analysis using an LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF MS approach. We report 353 high quality identifications with 72 proteins not previously identified by other human exosome proteomics studies. Overrepresentation analysis to compare this data set with previous exosome proteomics studies (using the ExoCarta database) revealed that the proteome was consistent with that of various exosomes with particular overlap with exosomes of carcinoma origin. Interrogating the Gene Ontology database highlighted a strong association of this proteome with carcinoma of bladder and other sites. The data also highlighted how homology among human leukocyte antigen haplotypes may confound MASCOT designation of major histocompatability complex Class I nomenclature, requiring data from PCR-based human leukocyte antigen haplotyping to clarify anomalous identifications. Validation of 18 MS protein identifications (including basigin, galectin-3, trophoblast glycoprotein (5T4), and others) was performed by a combination of Western blotting, flotation on linear sucrose gradients, and flow cytometry, confirming their exosomal expression. Some were confirmed positive on urinary exosomes from a bladder cancer patient. In summary, the exosome proteomics data set presented is of unrivaled quality. The data will aid in the development of urine exosome-based clinical tools for monitoring disease and will inform follow-up studies into varied aspects of exosome manufacture and function.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurotrauma or injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) are a serious public health problem worldwide. Approximately 75% of all traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are concussions or other mild TBI (mTBI) forms. Evaluation of concussion injury today is limited to an assessment of behavioral symptoms, often with delay and subject to motivation. Hence, there is an urgent need for an accurate chemical measure in biofluids to serve as a diagnostic tool for invisible brain wounds, to monitor severe patient trajectories, and to predict survival chances. Although a number of neurotrauma marker candidates have been reported, the broad spectrum of TBI limits the significance of small cohort studies. Specificity and sensitivity issues compound the development of a conclusive diagnostic assay, especially for concussion patients. Thus, the neurotrauma field currently has no diagnostic biofluid test in clinical use.Content: We discuss the challenges of discovering new and validating identified neurotrauma marker candidates using proteomics-based strategies, including targeting, selection strategies and the application of mass spectrometry (MS) technologies and their potential impact to the neurotrauma field.\\n\\nSUMMARY: Many studies use TBI marker candidates based on literature reports, yet progress in genomics and proteomics have started to provide neurotrauma protein profiles. Choosing meaningful marker candidates from such 'long lists' is still pending, as only few can be taken through the process of preclinical verification and large scale translational validation. Quantitative mass spectrometry targeting specific molecules rather than random sampling of the whole proteome, e.g., multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), offers an efficient and effective means to multiplex the measurement of several candidates in patient samples, thereby omitting the need for antibodies prior to clinical assay design. Sample preparation challenges specific to TBI are addressed. A tailored selection strategy combined with a multiplex screening approach is helping to arrive at diagnostically suitable candidates for clinical assay development. A surrogate marker test will be instrumental for critical decisions of TBI patient care and protection of concussion victims from repeated exposures that could result in lasting neurological deficits.",

Eight TMA blocks were produced containing 48 different normal human tissues in triplicate and cancer tissue from 216 individually different tumors in duplicate. Sections from these blocks were immunohistochemically stained using five commercial and five in-house generated antibodies. Digital images for annotation of expression profiles were generated using a semiautomated approach. Five hundred seventy-six images and annotation data corresponding to a total of 30 Gbytes of data were collected for each antibody. The data presented here suggest that antibody-based profiling of protein expression in tissues can be used as a valuable tool in clinical proteomics.",

By focusing the use of traditional proteomics techniques with hypothesis-driven selection methods, this approach efficiently addresses the identification of novel elements in a signal transduction pathway of interest. However, focused proteomics serves only as a starting point in the investigation of novel signaling proteins. While focused proteomics studies can suggest the involvement and general biochemical function of a protein in a signaling pathway, these findings must be further investigated and validated. Through the integrated use of focused proteomics with complementary approaches such as genetics, biochemistry and cell physiology, a complete and detailed mechanism of signal transduction can be determined.",

Furthermore, in combination with mass spectrometry (MS), SPR can be used to both selectively enrich for and identify proteins from a complex sample. Here we illustrate the use of SPR-MS to solve proteomics-based research questions, describing applications that use very different types of immobilized components: such as small (drug or messenger) molecules, peptides, DNA and proteins.

To this end, we developed ProteoConnections, a bioinformatics platform tailored to address the pressing needs of proteomics analyses. The primary focus of this platform is to organize peptide and protein identifications, evaluate the quality of the acquired data set, profile abundance changes, and accelerate data interpretation. Peptide and protein identifications are stored into a relational database to facilitate data mining and to evaluate the quality of data sets using graphical reports. We integrated databases of known PTMs and other bioinformatics tools to facilitate the analysis of phosphoproteomics data sets and to provide insights for subsequent biological validation experiments. Phosphorylation sites are also annotated according to kinase consensus motifs, contextual environment, protein domains, binding motifs, and evolutionary conservation across different species. The practical application of ProteoConnections is further demonstrated for the analysis of the phosphoproteomics data sets from rat intestinal IEC-6 cells where we identified 9615 phosphorylation sites on 2108 phosphoproteins. Combined proteomics and bioinformatics analyses revealed valuable biological insights on the regulation of phosphoprotein functions via the introduction of new binding sites on scaffold proteins or the modulation of protein-protein, protein-DNA, or protein-RNA interactions. Quantitative proteomics data can be integrated into ProteoConnections to determine the changes in protein phosphorylation under different cell stimulation conditions or kinase inhibitors, as demonstrated here for the MEK inhibitor PD184352.",

        "abstract": "The nucleolus is involved in regulating several aspects of stress responses and cell cycle arrest through the tumor suppressor p53. Under normal conditions, p53 is a short-lived protein that is present in cells at a barely detectable level. Upon exposure of cells to various forms of exogenous stress, such as DNA damage, there is a stabilization of p53 which is then responsible for an ensuing cascade of events. To further investigate the effect of p53 activation, we used a MS-based proteomics method to provide an unbiased, quantitative and high-throughput approach for measuring the subcellular distribution of the proteome that is dependent on p53. The spatial proteomics method analyses a whole cell extract created by recombining differentially labeled subcellular fractions derived from cells in which proteins have been mass labeled with heavy isotopes [Boisvert, F.-M., Lam, Y. W., Lamont, D., Lamond, A. I., Mol. Cell. Proteomics 2010, 9, 457-470]. This was used here to measure the relative distribution between cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus of around 2000 proteins in HCT116 cells that are either expressing wild-type p53 or null for p53. Spatial proteomics also facilitates a proteome-wide comparison of changes in protein localization in response to a wide range of physiological and experimental perturbations. We used this method to study differences in protein localization in HCT116 cells either with or without p53, and studied the differences in cellular response to DNA damage following treatment of HCT116 cells with etoposide in both p53 wild-type and null genetic backgrounds.",

Proteomics offers an efficient means for a comprehensive analysis of pituitary protein expression. This paper reports on the application of proteomics for the mapping of major proteins in a normal (control) pituitary. Pituitary proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with immobilized pH 3-10 gradient strips. Major protein spots that were visualized in the two-dimensional gel by silver staining were excised, and the proteins in these spots were digested with trypsin. The tryptic digests were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the mass spectrometric data were used to identify the proteins through searches of the SWISS-PROT or NCBInr protein sequence databases. The majority of the proteins were identified on the basis of peptide mass fingerprinting data obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Several proteins were also characterized based on product-ion spectra measured by post-source decay analysis and/or liquid chromatography-electrospray-quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry. To date, 62 prominent protein spots, corresponding to 38 different proteins, were identified. The identified proteins include important pituitary hormones, structural proteins, enzymes, and other proteins. The protein identification data were used to establish a two-dimensional reference database of the human pituitary, which can be accessed over the Internet (http://www.utmem.edu/proteomics). This database will serve as a tool for further proteomics studies of pituitary protein expression in health and disease.",

Studies of NSC include the investigation of primary, CNS-derived cells as well as animal and human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived sources. NSCs provide a means with which to study normal neural development, neurodegeneration and neurological disease and are clinically relevant sources for cellular repair to the damaged and diseased CNS. Proteomics studies of NSCs have the potential to delineate molecules and pathways critical for NSC biology and the means by which NSC can participate in neural repair. In this review, we provide a background to NSC biology, including the means to obtain them and the caveats to these processes. We then focus on advances in the proteomic interrogation of NSCs, from the analysis of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and crosstalk, of approaches to comparing NSCs, of spatial expression to gain an understanding of, for instance, the secretome, and of temporal expression to elucidate mechanisms of differentiation. We also discuss some of the methods tht will undoubtedly be useful in the investigation of NSC, but which have not yet been applied to the field. While many proteomics studies of NSC have largely catalogued the proteome or post-translational modifications of specific cellular states, without delving into specific functions, some have led to understandings of functional processes or identified markers that could not have been identified via other means. Many challenges remain in the field including the precise identification and standardization of NSCs used for proteomic analyses, as well as how to translate fundamental proteomics studies to functional biology. The next level of investigation will require interdisciplinary approaches, combining the skills of those interested in the biochemistry of proteomics with those interested in modulating NSC function.",

In an earlier study employing DNA microarrays, we had identified genes that were differentially expressed at the transcript level in human brain tissue from cases of tuberculous meningitis. In the current study, we used a quantitative proteomics approach to discover protein biomarkers for tuberculous meningitis.\\n\\nMETHODS: To compare brain tissues from confirmed cased of tuberculous meningitis with uninfected brain tissue, we carried out quantitative protein expression profiling using iTRAQ labeling and LC-MS/MS analysis of SCX fractionated peptides on Agilent's accurate mass QTOF mass spectrometer.\\n\\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Through this approach, we identified both known and novel differentially regulated molecules. Those described previously included signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA) and protein disulfide isomerase family A, member 6 (PDIA6), which have been shown to be overexpressed at the mRNA level in tuberculous meningitis. The novel overexpressed proteins identified in our study included amphiphysin (AMPH) and neurofascin (NFASC) while ferritin light chain (FTL) was found to be downregulated in TBM. We validated amphiphysin, neurofascin and ferritin light chain using immunohistochemistry which confirmed their differential expression in tuberculous meningitis. Overall, our data provides insights into the host response in tuberculous meningitis at the molecular level in addition to providing candidate diagnostic biomarkers for tuberculous meningitis.",

One of the primary goals of bioinformatics is to enable any researcher to interpret the vast amounts of data generated in modern biology, by providing user-friendly and robust end-user applications, clear documentation, and corresponding teaching materials. In that spirit, we here present an extensive tutorial for peptide and protein identification, available at http://compomics.com/bioinformatics-for-proteomics. The material is completely based on freely available and open-source tools, and has already been used and refined at numerous international courses over the past 3 years. During this time, it has demonstrated its ability to allow even complete beginners to intuitively conduct advanced bioinformatics workflows, interpret the results, and understand their context.

It is central to neuronal development as well as experience-dependent remodeling of the adult nervous system as occurs during memory formation. Aberrant forms of synaptic plasticity also accompany a variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases, and unraveling the biological basis of synaptic plasticity has been a major goal in neurobiology research. The biochemical and structural mechanisms underlying different forms of synaptic plasticity are complex, involving multiple signaling cascades, reconfigurations of structural proteins and the trafficking of synaptic proteins. As such, proteomics should be a valuable tool in dissecting the molecular events underlying normal and disease-related forms of plasticity. In fact, progress in this area has been disappointingly slow. We discuss the particular challenges associated with proteomic interrogation of synaptic plasticity processes and outline ways in which we believe proteomics may advance the field over the next few years.

Such pipelines can automatically and rapidly generate high-confidence protein identifications from large datasets in a searchable format covering multiple experimental runs. However, the main challenge for the community now is to use these resources as they are, by taking full advantage of the pooling of information, so that the next barrier in our understanding of biology may be broken. There are currently two pipelines in the public domain that provide such potential: PeptideAtlas and the Genome Annotating Proteomic Pipeline.

Under the current conditions, it appears likely that the situation will not change significantly: we will be flooded by reports on biomarkers, but not see any implementation.

We have shown that it is spatially restricted and tested its efficacy in living cells. FALI is efficient using conventional antibodies and single chain variable fragment phage display antibodies (that are compatible with high-throughput applications). We have shown that singlet oxygen is one of the major components required for FALI-mediated damage. The half-maximal radius of damage is approximately 40 A. FALI causes the specific loss of function of beta 1 integrin in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells resulting in a reduction in invasiveness. The efficacy of diffuse light sources (such as a desk lamp) with FALI to inactivate many samples in parallel provides an inexpensive, high-throughput method of wide general applicability for functional proteomics.",

Using a magnetic purification procedure and high-performance LC-MS/MS proteome analysis, a list of 2108 non-redundant proteins was established, of which 24% featured membrane-spanning domains. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that the most abundant proteins were linked to signaling, vesicular trafficking and the cytoskeleton. The present repertoire validates our purification method and paves the way for a future proteomics approach to study the dynamics of macropinocytosis.",

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has begun to play a significant role in the interrogation of histone PTMs, revealing many new aspects of these modifications that cannot be easily determined with standard biological approaches.

The M. haemolytica genome is currently in draft form, and annotation is incomplete. Relying on the principle of gene sequence conservation across species, we used annotated genomes from closely related species to identify, confirm, and functionally annotate 495 M. haemolytica proteins. To conduct quantitative comparative proteomics, we developed a protein quantitation method based on the cross correlation function of the SEQUEST algorithm. When M. haemolytica was cultivated in the presence of 1/4 MIC of CTC and CTC + SMZ, expression of proteins involved in energy production, nucleotide metabolism, translation, and the bacterial stress response (chaperones) were affected. The most notable subMIC effect was a significant decrease in the expression of leukotoxin A, which is an important M. haemolytica virulence factor. Reduction in leukotoxin expression could be one of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of these antibiotics against bovine respiratory disease.",

In this paper, we present an alternate approach to purify subcellular organelles containing a fluorescent reporter molecule. The gel-free procedure involves fluorescence-assisted sorting of the secretory granules followed by gentle extraction in a buffer compatible with tryptic digestion and MS. Once the subcellular organelle labeled, this procedure can be done in a single day, requires no major modification to any instrumentation and can be readily adapted to the study of other organelles. When applied to corticotrope secretory granules, it led to a much enriched granular fraction from which numerous proteins could be identified through MS.",

Here, we applied semi-quantitative label-free proteomics using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with LC-MS/MS and normalized spectral counting together with fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy to characterize the metaproteome of the lung lichen symbiosis Lobaria pulmonaria. In addition to the myco- and photobiont, L. pulmonaria harbors proteins from a highly diverse prokaryotic community, which is dominated by Proteobacteria and including also Archaea. While fungal proteins are most dominant (75.4% of all assigned spectra), about the same amount of spectra were assigned to prokaryotic proteins (10%) and to the green algal photobiont (9%). While the latter proteins were found to be mainly associated with energy and carbohydrate metabolism, a major proportion of fungal and bacterial proteins appeared to be involved in PTMs and protein turnover and other diverse functions.",

        "abstract": "Within cells, proteins can co-assemble into functionally-integrated and spatially restricted multicomponent complexes. Often, the affinities between individual proteins are relatively weak, and proteins within such clusters may interact only indirectly with many of their other protein neighbors. This makes proteomic characterization difficult using methods such as immunoprecipitation or crosslinking. Recently, several groups have described the use of enzymecatalyzed proximity-labeling reagents that covalently tag the neighbors of a targeted protein with a small molecule such as fluorescein or biotin. The modified proteins can then be isolated by standard pull-down methods, and identified by mass spectrometry. Here we will describe the techniques, as well as their similarities and differences. We discuss their applications, both to study protein assemblies, and to provide a new way for characterizing organelle proteomes. We stress the importance of proteomic quantitation and independent target validation in such experiments. Furthermore, we suggest that there are biophysical and cell-biological principles that dictate the appropriateness of enzyme-catalyzed proximity-labeling methods to address particular biological questions of interest.",

Microarray technology is becoming the method of choice for such a task. Although protein microarray can provide a high throughput analytical platform for protein profiling and protein-protein interaction, most of the current reports are limited to labeled detection using fluorescence or radioisotope techniques. These limitations deflate the potential of the method and prevent the technology from being adapted in a broader range of proteomics applications. In recent years, label-free analytical approaches have gone through intensified development and have been coupled successfully with protein microarray. In many examples of label-free study, the microarray has not only offered the high throughput detection in real time, but also provided kinetics information as well as in situ identification.

A total of 2282 peptides were identified by matching LC-MS data to accurate mass and time (AMT) tag databases that were previously established for human breast (cancer) cell lines. One thousand and three unique proteins were confidently identified with two or more peptides. Based on gene ontology categorization, identified proteins appear to cover a wide variety of biological functions and cellular compartments.

Last but not least, the non-secreted proteins liberated in the culture medium upon lysis of a few dead cells heavily contaminate the so-called secreted proteins preparations. Several techniques have been used in the past for concentration of proteins secreted in culture media. These techniques present several drawbacks, such as coprecipitation of salts or poor yields at low protein concentrations. Improved techniques based on carrier-assisted TCA precipitation are described and discussed in this report. These techniques have been used to analyze the secretome of myeloid cells (macrophages, dendritic cells) and enabled to analyze proteins secreted at concentrations close to 1 ng/mL, thereby allowing the detection of some of the cytokines (TNF, IL-12) secreted by the myeloid cells upon activation by bacterial products.",

This framework standardizes the terminology for describing protein identification results, associated with the HUPO-Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) mzIdentML standard, while still allowing for differing methodologies to reach that final state. It is proposed that developers of software for reporting identification results will adopt this terminology in their outputs. While the new terminology does not require any changes to the core mzIdentML model, it represents a significant change in practice, and, as such, the rules will be released via a new version of the mzIdentML specification (version 1.2) so that consumers of files are able to determine whether the new guidelines have been adopted by export software.",

The search for specific mRNA, proteins, or metabolites that can serve as diagnostic markers has also increased, as has the fact that these biomarkers may be useful in following and predicting disease progression or response to therapy.

Non-invasive footprinting analysis is also discussed as this has many applications to in vitro cell systems. Finally, for studying biotic or abiotic stresses on animals, plants or microbes, we believe that metabolomics could very easily be applied to large populations, because this approach tends to be of higher throughput and generally lower cost than transcriptomics and proteomics, whilst also providing indications of which area of metabolism may be affected by external perturbation.",

Both perturbations increase the flux of the progenitor ROS, superoxide, but the molecular underpinnings of the resulting phenotypes are poorly understood. Improved understanding of such processes could lead to advances in the treatment of numerous age-related disorders. Superoxide toxicity can act through protein carbonylation. Analysis of carbonylated proteins is attractive since carbonyl groups are not present in the 20 canonical amino acids and are amenable to labeling and enrichment strategies. Here, carbonylated proteins were labeled with biotin hydrazide and enriched on streptavidin beads. On-bead digestion was used to release carbonylated protein peptides, with relative abundance ratios versus controls obtained using the iTRAQ MS-based proteomics approach. Western blotting and biotin quantitation assay approaches were also investigated. By both Western blotting and proteomics, Paraquat exposure, but not Sod2 knockdown, resulted in increased carbonylated protein relative abundance. For Paraquat exposure versus control, the median carbonylated protein relative abundance ratio (1.53) determined using MS-based proteomics was in good agreement with that obtained using a commercial biotin quantitation kit (1.36).",

The shotgun proteomics strategy, in which proteolytic peptides are analyzed in data-dependent mode, enables a detection of the most comprehensive proteome (>10\u00a0000 proteins from whole-cell lysate). The quantitative proteomics uses stable isotopes or label-free method to measure relative protein abundance. The isotope labeling strategies are more precise and accurate compared to label-free methods, but labeling procedures are complicated and expensive, and the sample number and types are also limited. Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH) is a recently developed technique, in which data-independent acquisition is coupled with peptide spectral library match. In principle SWATH method is able to do label-free quantification in an MRM-like manner, which has higher quantification accuracy and precision. Previous data have demonstrated that SWATH can be used to quantify less complex systems, such as spiked-in peptide mixture or protein complex. Our study first time assessed the quantification performance of SWATH method on proteome scale using a complex mouse-cell lysate sample. In total 3600 proteins got identified and quantified without sample prefractionation. The SWATH method shows outstanding quantification precision, whereas the quantification accuracy becomes less perfect when protein abundances differ greatly. However, this inaccuracy does not prevent discovering biological correlates, because the measured signal intensities had linear relationship to the sample loading amounts; thus the SWATH method can predict precisely the significance of a protein. Our results prove that SWATH can provide precise label-free quantification on proteome scale.",

The result will be a growing number of protein structures of important pharmacologic targets that will help to streamline the process of identification and optimization of lead compounds for drug development.

To circumvent these difficulties, in the last few years, we have utilized several different separation methodologies and mass spectrometric platforms that greatly enhanced the identification coverage and the depth of protein profiling of CSF to characterize CSF proteome.

Although the majority of reference materials are developed to support measurement quality of routine assays, the development of reference materials for a diverse and changing research field such as proteomics represents unique challenges. In order to define common measurement components and common features of typical proteomic samples, the metrology underpinning proteomics must be considered due to the diversity and changing nature of the field. Reference materials can then be designed around common aspects in order to produce reference materials with the broadest applicability. Reference materials are needed to support both qualitative and quantitative proteomic measurements, involving different design considerations. Consensus and validated statistical approaches to describe the confidence in qualitative measurement, such as protein identification, needs to be established. Common sources of measurement bias also need to be considered in proteomic reference material design.",

Other than development of intensive therapies, the clinical outcome of patients with soft tissue sarcoma remains very poor, particularly when diagnosed at a late stage. Unique mutations have been associated with certain soft tissue sarcomas, but their etiologies remain unknown. The proteome is a functional translation of a genome, which directly regulates the malignant features of tumors. Thus, proteomics is a promising approach for investigating soft tissue sarcomas. Various proteomic approaches and clinical materials have been used to address clinical and biological issues, including biomarker development, molecular target identification, and study of disease mechanisms. Several cancer-associated proteins have been identified using conventional technologies such as 2D-PAGE, mass spectrometry, and array technology. The functional backgrounds of proteins identified were assessed extensively using in vitro experiments, thus supporting expression analysis. These observations demonstrate the applicability of proteomics to soft tissue sarcoma studies. However, the sample size in each study was insufficient to allow conclusive results. Given the low frequency of soft tissue sarcomas, multi-institutional collaborations are required to validate the results of proteomic approaches.",

The most common human etiological agent within this genus is Campylobacter jejuni - the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the developed world. While this organism has been extensively studied at the cellular level, and the genome sequences of several strains have now been elucidated, little is known regarding the role of individual proteins in virulence processes, such as adhesion, colonization and toxicity towards host cells. Proteomics encompasses the global analysis of proteins at the organism level. The technologies included under this term have now started to be utilized for understanding how Campylobacter species respond to changes in the environment, with an emphasis on the human host, as well as to map subcellular locations of proteins, in particular those that are surface-associated. C. jejuni is also of great significance as, unlike most other bacteria, it is able to post-translationally modify its proteins. The analysis of such proteins represents a major challenge in understanding this organism at the proteomic and cellular levels. This review will examine the state-of-the-art in Campylobacter proteomics, as well as provide insights into strategies that need to be undertaken to provide a comprehensive understanding of this organism at the molecular and functional level.",

In the next 3 years the series will cover the theoretical basis of the fundamental topics in the various areas of proteomic analysis, i.e. sample preparation and handling, mass spectrometry, post-translational modifications and quantitation given by leading experts in the field. This summer school series embodies a unique advantage in comparison with conventional scientific meetings and university curricula: internationally renowned experts will give a detailed perspective view of the fundamentals of their particular proteome research area, something which is usually not encountered at conferences and congresses. Here, we give a report on the first European Summer School 'Sample Preparation and Handling' within the series 'Proteomic Basics' that was held at the monastery in Neustift close to Bressanone/Brixen, Italy from August 12 to 18, 2007.",

Proteomics seems well-placed to benefit this medically important area but the scarcity of embryonic tissues poses a major challenge. In this study, we applied a microsample proteomics strategy to investigate the first branchial arch, an embryonic structure crucial for facial development, and found that proteome analysis is both practicable and informative despite the scarcity of tissue. Exploiting the embryonic chick as a tractable source of accurately staged tissue, we developed a sequential extraction procedure to interface with one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1-D PAGE) and 2-D PAGE. In 2-D gels, about 8% of the visible proteome changed between embryonic days 3 and 5, and the identities determined for 21 proteins accorded with the rapid growth during this period. These results led to the first molecular identification of chicken alpha-fetoprotein, and an unusual localisation of vimentin to endoderm. With over 470 protein spots accessible, this comparative proteomics approach has good prospects for providing new markers, functional hypotheses and genes to target in functional tests. A broader value of extending these approaches to facial development in other species and to other areas in embryology can be anticipated.",

Stable isotope labeling has been performed at both the protein as well as the peptide level using either metabolic or chemical labeling. Here, we present a straightforward and cost-effective triplex quantification method that is based on stable isotope dimethyl labeling at the peptide level. Herein, all proteolytic peptides are chemically labeled at their alpha- and epsilon-amino groups. We use three different isotopomers of formaldehyde to enable the parallel analysis of three different samples. These labels provide a minimum of 4 Da mass difference between peaks in the generated peptide triplets. The method was evaluated based on the quantitative analysis of a cell lysate, using a typical \"shotgun\" proteomics experiment. While peptide complexity was increased by introducing three labels, still more than 1300 proteins could be identified using 60 microg of starting material, whereby more than 600 proteins could be quantified using at least four peptides per protein. The triplex labeling was further utilized to distinguish specific from aspecific cAMP binding proteins in a chemical proteomics experiment using immobilized cAMP. Thereby, differences in abundance ratio of more than two orders of magnitude could be quantified.",

Assessment of tumor grade on pathological examination is the most powerful means for prognostication as well as for stratification of patients into those who might respond to conventional or targeted therapy. Although there exist several grading systems in common use, all suffer from significant disparity among observers. In an attempt to objectify this process as well as to acquire grade-specific mechanistic information, we performed LC-MS/MS-based proteomics analysis on 50 clear cell kidney cancers equally distributed among normal tissues and Fuhrman grades 1-4. Initial experiments confirmed the utility of using archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples for LC-MS/MS-based proteomics analysis, and the LC-MS/MS findings were validated by extensive immunoblotting. We now show that changes among many biochemical processes and pathways are strongly grade-dependent with the glycolytic and amino acid synthetic pathways highly represented. In addition, proteins relating to acute phase and xenobiotic metabolism signaling are highly represented. Self-organized mapping of proteins with similar patterns of expression led to the creation of a heat map that will be useful in grade characterization as well as in future research relating to oncogenic mechanisms and targeted therapies for kidney cancer.",

Most of these data are either provided as supplementary information through journal web sites or directly made available by the authors through their own web resources. Integration of these data within a single resource that displays information in the context of individual proteins is likely to enhance the use of proteomic data in biomedical research. Human Proteinpedia is one such portal that unifies human proteomic data under a single banner. The goal of this resource is to ultimately capture and integrate all proteomic data obtained from individual studies on normal and diseased tissues. We anticipate that harnessing of these data will help prioritize experiments related to protein targets and also permit meta-analysis to uncover molecular signatures of disease. Finally, we encourage all biomedical investigators to maximize dissemination of their valuable proteomic data to rest of the community by active participation in existing repositories such as Human Proteinpedia.",

The anticipated findings will help to understand microgravity-specific behavior, which has been observed in bacteria, as well as in plant, animal and human cells. To date, the analyses revealed that cell cultures are more sensitive to microgravity than cells embedded in organisms and that proteins changing under microgravity are highly interactive. Furthermore, one has to distinguish between primary gravity-induced and subsequent interaction-dependent changes of proteins, as well as between direct microgravity-related effects and indirect stress responses. Progress in this field will impact on tissue engineering and medicine and will uncover possibilities of counteracting alterations of protein expression at lowered gravity.",

In this report, we describe a fast and efficient method for the isolation of the ERalpha receptosome for proteomics analysis. Using immobilized estrogen response element on a Sepharose column in combination with two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF MS, significant amounts of proteins could be isolated and identified. Differences in ERalpha complex composition with the ER ligands 17beta-estradiol, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and ICI-182,780 could also be observed.

These experiments typically generate a large volume of highly complex data, and the volume and complexity are only increasing with time. There exist many software pipelines for analyzing these data (each typically with its own file formats), and as technology improves, these file formats change and new formats are developed. Files produced from these myriad software programs may accumulate on hard disks or tape drives over time, with older files being rendered progressively more obsolete and unusable with each successive technical advancement and data format change. Although initiatives exist to standardize the file formats used in proteomics, they do not address the core failings of a file-based data management system: (1) files are typically poorly annotated experimentally, (2) files are \"organically\" distributed across laboratory file systems in an ad hoc manner, (3) files formats become obsolete, and (4) searching the data and comparing and contrasting results across separate experiments is very inefficient (if possible at all). Here we present a relational database architecture and accompanying web application dubbed Mass Spectrometry Data Platform that is designed to address the failings of the file-based mass spectrometry data management approach. The database is designed such that the output of disparate software pipelines may be imported into a core set of unified tables, with these core tables being extended to support data generated by specific pipelines. Because the data are unified, they may be queried, viewed, and compared across multiple experiments using a common web interface.

Bottom-up proteomics ultimately provides the peptide sequences derived from the tandem MS analyses of peptides after the proteome has been digested. Top-down proteomics conversely entails the MS analyses of intact proteins for more effective characterization of genetic variations and/or post-translational modifications. Herein, we describe recent efforts toward efficient integration of bottom-up and top-down LC-MS-based proteomics strategies. Since most proteomics separations utilize acidic conditions, we exploited the compatibility of pepsin (where the optimal digestion conditions are at low pH) for integration into bottom-up and top-down proteomics work flows. Pressure-enhanced pepsin digestions were successfully performed and characterized with several standard proteins in either an off-line mode using a Barocycler or an on-line mode using a modified high pressure LC system referred to as a fast on-line digestion system (FOLDS). FOLDS was tested using pepsin and a whole microbial proteome, and the results were compared against traditional trypsin digestions on the same platform. Additionally, FOLDS was integrated with a RePlay configuration to demonstrate an ultrarapid integrated bottom-up top-down proteomics strategy using a standard mixture of proteins and a monkey pox virus proteome.",

Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) were purified by incubation in low-pH citrate buffer, treatment in a French press, and centrifugation over a continuous sucrose gradient. OMVs characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) contained the previously described outer membrane proteins OmpL1, Qlp42, LipL32, LipL41, LipL36 and Loa22. In addition, unknown, hypothetical and putative outer membrane proteins were identified. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry and fraction collection (LC-MS+) measured the intact mass profile of the major outer membrane protein, LipL32, and the putative lipoprotein Qlp42. In contrast to a predicted molecularmass of 27,653.5 Da for LipL32 after cleavage of its signal peptide, intact mass proteomics measured the mass as ranging from 28,468 to 28,583 Da, consistent with lipidation of LipL32. In contrast to a predicted molecular mass of 39.8 kDa for Qlp42, the actual mass was measured as 24,811 and 26,461 Da consistent with a 30 kDa doublet observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and processing of the N-terminus of the mature protein. These studies indicate that purified OMVs are highly compatible with proteomics technologies including 2-DE and intact mass proteomics using LC-MS+ that facilitates definition of actual molecular masses of intact outer membrane proteins, and heterogeneity associated with them.",

        "abstract": "Computationally aided protein identification of mass spectrometry (MS) data has been a challenge for the proteomic community since the field's inception. As the community attempts to address challenges such as computational site assignment of posttranslational modifications (PTMs), selective reaction monitoring data analysis, and the transition of proteomic assays to the clinic a robust framework with defined metrics is essential. The frameworks used for protein identification are currently score based, not hypothesis driven nor deterministic, resulting in a gradation from poor to good but without the ability to recognize when a given tandem MS spectrum has insufficient information in the context of the proteome to be identified. Means of computing deterministic and pseudodeterministic assays have been proposed by both us and others [Sherman, J., McKay, M.J., Ashman, K., Molloy, M.P., Unique ion signature mass spectrometry, a deterministic method to assign peptide identity. Mol. Cell. Proteomics 2009, 8, 2051-2062; Kiyonami, R., Schoen, A., Prakash, A., Peterman, S., et al., Increased selectivity, analytical precision, and through-put in targeted proteomics. Mol. Cell. Proteomics 2011, 10, M110.002931]. We believe it is crucial to incorporate the complexity of the proteome into the design of the experiment/data analysis upstream and that by doing so proteomic data analysis will become more robust. The seminal paper by Claude Shannon published in 1948 provides the robust mathematical framework now called Information Theory, to achieve this goal. Information Theory defines appropriate metrics for information and complexity as well as means to account for interference, all of which is directly applicable to peptide identification. We attempt to encourage the adoption of Information Theory as a means to ensure that appropriate metrics are used to measure the uncertainty in a peptide identification with or without PTM site assignment.",

Alterations to mitochondrial pathways and thereby deriving oncometabolites are also detailed. The third section of the review is a discussion of how and to what extent (mutations to) tumor suppressors and oncogenes end up influencing cancer cell metabolism and cell fate, either promoting survival and proliferation or autophagy and apoptosis.

Possible consequences of modifications, which are commonly applied to raw spectral counts to improve abundance estimations, are considered. The use of spectral counting for different types of quantitation studies is explored and critiqued. Different statistical methods and underlying frameworks that have been applied to spectral count analysis are described and compared, and problem areas that undermine confident statistical analysis are considered.

While comparative cDNA microarray analyses though restricted to up-regulated targets largely revealed genes involved in controlling gene/protein expression (19%) and signal transduction processes (13%), proteomics/PROTEOMEX-defined candidate biomarkers include enzymes of the cellular metabolism (36%), transport proteins (12%), and cell motility/structural molecules (10%). Candidate biomarkers defined by proteomics and PROTEOMEX are frequently shared, whereas the sharing rate between cDNA microarray and proteome-based profilings is limited. Putative candidate biomarkers provide insights into their cellular (dys)function and their diagnostic/prognostic value but still warrant further validation in larger patient numbers. Based on the fact that merely three candidate biomarkers were shared by all applied technologies, namely annexin A4, tubulin alpha-1A chain, and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1, the analysis at a single hierarchical level of biological regulation seems to provide only limited results thus emphasizing the importance and benefit of performing rather combinatorial screenings which can complement the standard clinical predictors.",

Proteins were extracted according to 11 different storage conditions and samples were resolved by 2-DE. Data generated by 2-DE was subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant partial least squares regression (DPLSR). Applying PCA to 2-DE data revealed the samples to form groups according to frozen storage time, whereas differences due to different storage tempera- tures or chilled storage in modified atmosphere packing did not lead to distinct changes in pro- tein pattern. Applying DPLSR to the 2-DE data enabled the selection of protein spots critical for differentiation between 3 and 6 months frozen storage with 12 months frozen storage. Some of these protein spots have been identified by MS/MS, revealing myosin light chain 1, 2 and 3, triose-phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase A and two a- actin fragments, and a nuclease diphosphate kinase B fragment to change in concentration, during frozen storage. Application of proteomics, multivariate data analysis and MS/MS to ana- lyse protein changes in cod muscle proteins during storage has revealed new knowledge on the issue and enables a better understanding of biochemical processes occurring",

All protein forms annotated in UniProtKB (both the canonical sequences and isoforms) were evaluated in this study. In addition, natural and disease-associated amino acid variants annotated in UniProtKB were included in the evaluation. The peptide unicity was also evaluated for each data set. Furthermore, the peptide information in the UniProtKB data sets was also compared against the available peptide-level identifications in the main MS-based proteomics repositories. Identifying the peptides observed in these repositories is an important resource of information for protein databases as they provide supporting evidence for the existence of otherwise predicted proteins. Likewise, the repositories could use the information available in UniProtKB to direct reprocessing efforts on specific sets of peptides/proteins of interest. In summary, we provide comprehensive information about the different organism-specific sequence data sets available from UniProt, together with the pros and cons for each, in terms of search space for MS-based bottom-up proteomics workflows. The aim of the analysis is to provide a clear view of the tryptic search space of UniProt and other protein databases to enable scientists to select those most appropriate for their purposes.",

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the effect of cadmium (Cd) treatment on B. juncea roots, two quantitative proteomics approaches--fluorescence two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) and multiplexed isobaric tagging technology (iTRAQ)--were implemented. Several proteins involved in sulfur assimilation, redox homeostasis, and xenobiotic detoxification were found to be up-regulated. Multiple proteins involved in protein synthesis and processing were down-regulated. While the two proteomics approaches identified different sets of proteins, the proteins identified in both datasets are involved in similar biological processes. We show that 2-D DIGE and iTRAQ results are complementary, that the data obtained independently using the two techniques validate one another, and that the quality of iTRAQ results depends on both the number of biological replicates and the number of sample injections. This study determined the involvement of enzymes such as peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase and 2-nitropropane dioxygenase in alternatives redox-regulation mechanisms, as well as O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione-conjugate membrane transporter, as essential players in the Cd hyperaccumation and tolerance of B. juncea.",

It was scheduled November 22(nd), 2001 from 16:40 to 18:00 at the Geneva University Hospital. The objective of the MS round table was to bring together two kinds of specialists in mass spectrometry: those who develop and commercialise MS equipment and those who use it as a tool in proteomic sciences. Six expert users and six representatives of leading MS instrument companies were thus invited to actively participate in this round table and share their points of view. The main objectives of this round table were not only to share experiences, but also to share dreams regarding MS technology and discuss the actual limits. It also focused on what MS users presently expect from MS producers and what are the current priorities in terms of development, for the benefit of all parties. Although it was one of the final events of the meeting, this MS round table attracted an audience of some fifty participants of the congress who were actively involved in the debate.",

Here, we demonstrate comprehensive mapping of the O-glycosylation of flagellin from Campylobacter jejuni 11168 by use of a bottom-up proteomics approach that incorporates differential ion mobility spectrometry (also known as high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry or FAIMS) together with proteolysis with proteinase K. Proteinase K provides complementary sequence coverage to that achieved following trypsin proteolysis. The use of FAIMS increased the number of glycopeptides identified. Novel glycans for this strain were identified (pseudaminic acid and either acetamidino pseudaminic acid or legionaminic acid), as were novel glycosylation sites: Thr208, Ser343, Ser348, Ser349, Ser395, Ser398, Ser423, Ser433, Ser436, Ser445, Ser448, Ser451, Ser452, Ser454, Ser457 and Thr465. Multiply glycosylated peptides were observed, as well as variation at individual residues in the nature of the glycan and its presence or absence. Such extreme heterogeneity in the pattern of glycosylation has not been reported previously, and suggests a novel dimension in molecular variation within a bacterial population that may be significant in persistence of the organism in its natural environment. These results demonstrate the usefulness of differential ion mobility in proteomics investigations of PTMs.",

Thus, to investigate the effects of AT supplementation on the plasma proteome of healthy subjects we have undertaken a double-blind, randomised, parallel design supplementation study in which healthy subjects (n = 32; 11 male and 21 female) consumed AT supplements (134 or 268 mg/day) or placebo capsules for up to 28 days. Plasma samples were obtained before supplementation and after 14 and 28 days of supplementation for analysis of changes in the plasma proteome using 2-DE and MALDI-MS. Using semiquantitative proteomics, we observed that proapolipoprotein A1 (identified by MS and Western blotting) was altered at least two-fold. Using quantitative ELISA techniques, we confirmed a significant increase in plasma apolipoprotein A1 concentration following supplementation with AT which was both time and dose dependent (p < 0.01 after 28 days supplementation with 268 mg AT/day). These data demonstrate the time and dose sensitivity of the plasma proteome to AT supplementation.",

This organism causes a wealth of infections within the human host as a result of the vast arsenal of toxins encoded within its genome. Previous transcriptomic studies have shown that toxin production in S. aureus can be strongly impacted by the negative regulator CodY. CodY acts by directly, and indirectly (via Agr), repressing toxin production during times of plentiful nutrition. In this study, we use iTRAQ-based proteomics for the first time to study virulence determinant production in S. aureus, so as to correlate transcriptional observations with actual changes in protein synthesis. Using a codY mutant in the epidemic CA-MRSA clone USA300 we demonstrate that deletion of this transcription factor results in a major upregulation of toxin synthesis in both post-exponential and stationary growth. Specifically, we observe hyper-production of secreted proteases, leukocidins and hemolysins in both growth phases in the USA300 codY mutant. Our findings demonstrate the power of mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics for studying toxin production in S. aureus, and the importance of CodY to this central process in disease causation and infection.",

        "abstract": "The majority of biologically active proteins are glycosylated, therefore any approach to proteomics which fails to address the analysis of oligosaccharides is necessarily incomplete. To appreciate the structure of a glycoprotein fully, to understand the roles for the attached oligosaccharides and to monitor disease associated changes it is necessary to visualise the sugars as well as the protein. To achieve this aim when biological samples are available at the low microgram level or less has involved increasing the sensitivity of the technology for glycan analysis. Since one protein may have many different oligosaccharides attached to it (glycoforms) this is a major technical challenge. CD59, for example, has over 100 different sugars at one N-linked glycosylation site. Applications of recently developed technology suggest that it is now becoming realistic to extend the proteomics analysis of glycoproteins to include details of glycosylation. This is achieved by releasing the N-glycans from the protein in a gel by optimised peptide-N-glycosidase F digestion. The released glycans are then tagged with the fluorophore, 2-amino benzamide. The labelled glycan pools (containing 50-100 femtomoles of glycans) are resolved by predictive normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on an amide based column or by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column. Preliminary structural assignments are confirmed by exoglycosidase array digestions of the entire glycan pool. Complementary matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry, which requires 10-20 times as much sugar for a single run, can be used where there is sufficient material. This provides a composition analysis but not linkage information.",

Understanding these processes is critical to the regulation of animal reproduction, but few studies have attempted to define the full repertoire of sperm surface proteins in animals of agricultural importance. Recent developments in proteomics technologies, subcellular fractionation, and optimised solubilisation strategies have enhanced the potential for the comprehensive characterisation of the sperm surface proteome. Here we report the identification of 419 proteins from a mature bull sperm plasma membrane fraction. Protein domain enrichment analyses indicate that 67% of all the proteins identified may be membrane associated. A large number of the proteins identified are conserved between mammalian species and are reported to play key roles in sperm-egg communication, capacitation and fertility. The major functional pathways identified were related to protein catabolism (26S proteasome complex), chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex and fundamental metabolic processes such as glycolysis and energy production. We have also identified 118 predicted transmembrane proteins, some of which are implicated in cell adhesion, acrosomal exocytosis, vesicle transport and immunity and fertilisation events, while others have not been reported in mammalian LC-MS-derived sperm proteomes to date. Comparative proteomics and functional network analyses of these proteins expand our system's level of understanding of the bull sperm proteome and provide important clues toward finding the essential conserved function of these proteins.",

Newer technologies such as laser capture microdissection and highly sensitive mass spectrometry methods are currently being used together to identify greater numbers of lower abundance proteins that are differentially expressed between defined cell populations. Novel technologies still in developmental phases will enable identification of validated targets in small biopsy specimens, including high density protein arrays, antibody arrays and lysate arrays. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) analysis enables the high throughput characterization of lysates from very few tumor cells and may be best suited for clinical biomarker studies. We present SELDI-TOF data herein to show the accuracy of the method in a small cohort of breast tumors, as well as its potential discriminatory capability.

These proteins included several of the expected carriers of Ub including Ub-conjugating enzymes and histone proteins. To perform these experiments, a cell line coexpressing epitope tagged His(6X)-Ub and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated by stably transfecting HEK293 cells. Ubiquitinated proteins were purified using nickel-affinity chromatography and digested in solution with trypsin. Complex mixtures of peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography and analyzed by nano LC-MS/MS using the LCQ quadrupole ion-trap mass spectrometer. Proteins identified from His(6X)-Ub-GFP transfected cells were compared to a list of proteins from HEK293 cells, which associate with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose in the absence of His-tagged Ub. In a proof of principle experiment, His(6X)-Ub-GFP transfected cells were treated with As (III) (10 microM, 24 h) in an attempt to identify substrates increasingly modified by Ub. In this experiment, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a DNA repair protein and known ubiquitin substrate, was confidently identified.

IPeak provides a graphical user interface (GUI) as well as a command-line interface, which is implemented in JAVA and can work on all three major operating system platforms: Windows, Linux/Unix, and OS X. IPeak has been designed to work with the mzIdentML standard from the Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) as an input and output, and also been fully integrated into the associated mzidLibrary project, providing access to the overall pipeline, as well as modules for calling Percolator on individual search engine result files. The integration thus enables IPeak (and Percolator) to be used in conjunction with any software packages implementing the mzIdentML data standard. IPeak is freely available and can be downloaded under an Apache 2.0 license at https://code.google.com/p/mzidentml-lib/.",

As increasing amounts of neuroproteomic data become available, it is necessary to formulate methods to integrate these data in a meaningful way to obtain a more comprehensive picture of neuronal subcompartments. Furthermore, computational methods can be used to make biologically relevant predictions from large proteomic data sets. Here, we applied an integrated proteomics and systems biology approach to characterize the presynaptic (PRE) nerve terminal. For this, we carried out proteomic analyses of presynaptically enriched fractions, and generated a PRE literature-based protein-protein interaction network. We combined these with other proteomic analyses to generate a core list of 117 PRE proteins, and used graph theory-inspired algorithms to predict 92 additional components and a PRE complex containing 17 proteins. Some of these predictions were validated experimentally, indicating that the computational analyses can identify novel proteins and complexes in a subcellular compartment. We conclude that the combination of techniques (proteomics, data integration, and computational analyses) used in this study are useful in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of functional components, especially low-abundance entities and/or interactions in the PRE nerve terminal.",

It is therefore necessary to understand the mechanisms leading to progressive glomerular diseases; this may be addressed using proteomics. Until now, however, analysis of the glomeruli proteome using 2-DE has been technically hampered by low protein yields from scarce samples. To circumvent this problem, we developed a procedure which allows the human and mouse glomeruli proteome to be analysed. In this study, two different approaches were used to isolate mouse and human glomerular protein from kidney cortex. Mouse glomeruli were extracted by embolisation magnetic beads into the glomerular capillaries. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was utilised to harvest glomeruli from human biopsy material. Human and murine samples were analysed using a fluorescence saturation labelling technique. Using 3 microg mouse glomerular protein a total of 2900 spots were resolved for differential proteome analysis. Moreover, it was also demonstrated for the first time that only ten glomeruli (0.5 microg) picked by LCM from a slide of a human kidney biopsy material were sufficient to visualise 900 spots. This novel strategy paves the way for future experiments aimed at investigating functional proteomics of glomerular diseases in humans and in mice.",

Here, we report the first high-throughput proteomics analysis of E. ictaluri using 2-D LC ESI MS/MS and 2-DE MALDI TOF/TOF MS. Proteins identified in this study and predicted from the whole E. ictaluri genome were clustered into functional groups using clusters of orthologous groups (COG), and their subcellular locations were predicted. Possible functional relationships among proteins were determined using pathway analysis. The total number of unique E. ictaluri proteins identified using both 2-D LC and 2-DE approaches was 788, of which 15.48% (122) were identified by both methods while 78.43% (618) and 6.09% (48) were unique in 2-D LC and 2-DE, respectively. COG groupings and subcellular localizations were quite similar between our data set and proteins predicted from the whole genome. Twelve pathways were significantly represented in our dataset (p <0.05). Results from this study provided experimental evidence for many proteins that were predicted from the E. ictaluri genome annotation, and they should accelerate future functional and comparative studies aimed at understanding virulence mechanisms of this important pathogen.",

This study demonstrated that pomegranate fruit juice could effectively hinder the proliferation of human prostate cancer DU145 cell. The results of apoptotic analyses implicated that fruit juice might trigger the apoptosis in DU145 cells via death receptor signaling and mitochondrial damage pathway. In this study, we exploited 2DE-based proteomics to compare nine pairs of the proteome maps collected from untreated and treated DU145 cells to identify the differentially expressed proteins. Comparative proteomics indicated that 11 proteins were deregulated in affected DU145 cells with three upregulated and eight downregulated proteins. These dys-regulated proteins participated in cytoskeletal functions, antiapoptosis, proteasome activity, NF-\u03baB signaling, cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. Western immunoblotting were implemented to confirm the deregulated proteins and the downstream signaling proteins. The analytical results of this study help to provide insight into the molecular mechanism of inducing prostate cancer cell apoptosis by pomegranate fruit juice and to develop a novel mechanism-based chemopreventive strategy for prostate cancer.",

Based on a combination of cross-species sequence homology searches and the corresponding literature, our approach facilitated the direct association between sequence data and information from biological texts describing function. Comparison of our automated functional assignment to manual annotation demonstrated our method to be highly effective. To establish the sensitivity, we defined the functional subtleties within a family containing a highly conserved sequence. Clustering of the DEAD-box protein family of RNA helicases confirmed that these proteins shared similar morphology although functional subfamilies were accurately identified by our approach. We visualized the nucleolar proteome in terms of protein functions using multi-dimensional scaling, showing functional associations between nucleolar proteins that were not previously realized. Finally, by clustering the functional properties of the established nucleolar proteins, we predicted novel nucleolar proteins. Subsequently, nonproteomics studies confirmed the predictions of previously unidentified nucleolar proteins.",

We present a novel spot detection and quantification methodology which draws heavily from unsupervised machine-learning methods. Using the proposed hierarchical machine learning-based segmentation methodology reduces both the number of faint spots missed (improves sensitivity) and the number of extraneous spots introduced (improves precision). The detection and quantification performance has been thoroughly evaluated and is shown to compare favorably (higher F-measure) to a commercially available software package (PDQuest). The whole image analysis pipeline that we have developed is fully automated and can be used for high-throughput proteomics analysis since it does not require any manual intervention for recalibration every time a new 2-DE gel image is to be analyzed. Furthermore, it can be easily parallelized for high performance and also applied without any modification to prealigned group average gels.",

This report describes the efficiency and effectiveness of IgY microbeads in separating 12 abundant proteins from plasma with an immunoaffinity spin column or LC column. The protein separation and sample preparation process was monitored via SDS-PAGE, 2-DE, LC-MS/MS, or clinical protein assays. The data demonstrate the high specificity of the protein separation, with removal of 95-99.5% of the abundant proteins. IgY microbeads against human proteins can also selectively remove orthologous proteins of other mammals such as mouse, rat, etc. Besides the specificity and reproducibility of the IgY microbeads, the report discusses the factors that may cause potential variations in protein separation such as protein-protein interactions (known as \"Interactome\"), binding and washing conditions of immunoaffinity reagents, etc. A novel concept of Seppromics is introduced to address methodologies and science of protein separation in a context of proteomics.",

Using a targeted proteomics approach, we show that fibroblasts induced into senescence by expression of oncogenic Ras exhibit a decrease of global acetylation on all core histones, consistent with formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci. We also detected clear increases in repressive markers (e.g. >50% elevation of H3K27me2/3) along with decreases in histone marks associated with increased transcriptional expression/elongation (e.g. H3K36me2/3). Despite the increases in repressive marks of chromatin, 179 loci (of 2206 total) were found to be upregulated by global quantitative proteomics. The changes in the cytosolic proteome indicated an upregulation of mitochondrial proteins and downregulation of proteins involved in glycolysis. These alterations in primary metabolism are opposite to the well-known Warburg effect observed in cancer cells. This study significantly improves our understanding of stress-induced senescence and provides a potential application for triggering it in antiproliferative strategies that target the primary metabolism in cancer cells.",

Briefly, we have designed a novel nanostructured substrate using electron beam lithography. Vials, ranging in volume/size from 6 (200 nm in diameter) to 4000 aL (5 microm in diameter), were fabricated. Human recombinant single-chain Fv antibody fragments, microarray adopted by design, were used as probes. The set-up was interfaced with planar wave-guide technology for evanescant field fluorescence detection. The results showed that protein analytes could be specifically detected in the subzeptomole range for pure systems, using vials down to 57 aL. Further, low-abundant (pg/mL) protein analytes could be detected in directly labeled complex proteomes, such as human whole serum, using 157 aL-vials. Taken together, these results outline the potential of the atto-vial array set-up for miniaturized affinity proteomics-based approaches.",

We have optimised conditions for labelling of nonreduced, denatured samples and report increased sensitivity for a subset of thiol-containing proteins, allowing accurate monitoring of redox-dependent thiol modifications and expression changes. Cysteine labelling was then combined with lysine labelling in a multiplex 2-D DIGE proteomic study of redox-dependent and ErbB2-dependent changes in epithelial cells exposed to oxidative stress. This study identifies differentially modified proteins involved in cellular redox regulation, protein folding, proliferative suppression, glycolysis and cytoskeletal organisation, revealing the complexity of the response to oxidative stress and the impact that overexpression of ErbB2 has on this response.",

Sample subpooling is a strategy that can be used to reduce the variance but still allow studies to encompass biological variation. Underlying sample pooling strategies is the biological averaging assumption that the measurements taken on the pool are equal to the average of the measurements taken on the individuals. This study finds no evidence of a systematic bias triggered by sample pooling for DIGE and that pooling can be useful in reducing biological variation. For the first time in quantitative proteomics, the two sources of variance were decoupled and it was found that technical variance predominates for mouse brain, while biological variance predominates for human brain. A power analysis found that as the number of individuals pooled increased, then the number of replicates needed declined but the number of biological samples increased. Repeat measures of biological samples decreased the numbers of samples required but increased the number of gels needed. An example cost benefit analysis demonstrates how researchers can optimise their experiments while taking into account the available resources.",

In addition, quercetin enhanced expression of tumor suppressor genes, including Pten, Tp53, and Msh2, and of cell cycle inhibitors, including Mutyh. Furthermore, dietary quercetin enhanced genes involved in phase I and II metabolism, including Fmo5, Ephx1, Ephx2, and Gpx2. Quercetin increased PPARalpha target genes, and concomitantly enhanced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) degradation. Proteomics performed in the same samples revealed 33 affected proteins, of which four glycolysis enzymes and three heat shock proteins were decreased. A proteome-transcriptome comparison showed a low correlation, but both pointed out toward altered energy metabolism. In conclusion, transcriptomics combined with proteomics showed that dietary quercetin evoked changes contrary to those found in colorectal carcinogenesis. These tumor-protective mechanisms were associated with a shift in energy production pathways, pointing at decreased cytoplasmic glycolysis and toward increased mitochondrial FA degradation.",

In the present study we aimed to identify Estrogen Receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) interacting proteins in Tamoxifen treated MCF7 cells. Using in-vitro GST-Pull down assay with ER\u03b1 ligand binding domain (ER\u03b1-LBD) and mass spectrometry based proteomics approach we identified Profilin1 as a novel ER\u03b1 interacting protein. Profilin1 contains I/LXX/L/H/I amino acid signature motif required for co-repressor interaction with ER\u03b1. We show that these two proteins physically interact with each other both in-vitro as well as in-vivo by GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation respectively. We further show that these two proteins also co-localize together in the nucleus. Previous studies have reported reduced expression of Profilin1 in breast cancer; and here we found that Tamoxifen increases Profilin1 expression in MCF7 cells. Our data demonstrates that over expression of Profilin1 inhibits ER\u03b1 mediated transcriptional activation as well as its downstream target genes in ER\u03b1 positive breast cancer cells MCF7. In addition, Profilin1 over expression in MCF7 cells leads to inhibition of cell proliferation which apparently is due to enhanced apoptosis. In nutshell, these data indicate that mass spectrometry based proteomics approach identifies a novel ER\u03b1 interacting protein Profilin1 which serves as a putative co-repressor of ER\u03b1 functions.",

Protein identification from complex biological samples or experimental setups is often a manual and subjective task which lacks profound statistical evaluation. This is not feasible for high-throughput proteomic experiments which result in large datasets of thousands of peptides and proteins and their corresponding mass spectra. To improve the quality, reliability and comparability of scientific results, an estimation of the rate of erroneously identified proteins is advisable. Moreover, scientific journals increasingly stipulate that articles containing considerable MS data should be subject to stringent statistical evaluation. We present a newly developed easy-to-use software tool enabling quality evaluation by generating composite target-decoy databases usable with all relevant protein search engines. This tool, when used in conjunction with relevant statistical quality criteria, enables to reliably determine peptides and proteins of high quality, even for nonexperienced users (e.g. laboratory staff, researchers without programming knowledge). Different strategies for building decoy databases are implemented and the resulting databases are characterized and compared. The quality of protein identification in high-throughput proteomics is usually measured by the false positive rate (FPR), but it is shown that the false discovery rate (FDR) delivers a more meaningful, robust and comparable value.",

This phenomenon is called behavioral sensitization. Sensitization is an enduring phenomenon, and suggests chronic alterations in neuronal plasticity. MAP-induced sensitization has been proposed and widely investigated as an animal model of MAP psychosis and schizophrenia. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying MAP-induced sensitization. 2-DE-based proteomics allows us to examine global changes in protein expression in complex biological systems and to propose hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying various pathological conditions. In the present study, we examined protein expression profiles in the striatum of MAP-sensitized rats using 2-DE-based proteomics. Repeated administration of MAP (4.0 mg/kg, once a day, intraperitoneal (i.p.)) for 10 days significantly augmented the locomotor response to an MAP challenge injection (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) on day 11. This enhanced activity was maintained even after a week of drug abstinence. 2-DE analysis revealed 42 protein spots were differentially regulated in the striatum of MAP-sensitized rats compared to control. Thirty-one protein spots were identified using MALDI-TOF, including synapsin II, synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), and dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP2). These proteins can be related to underlying mechanisms of MAP-induced behavioral sensitization, indicating cytoskeletal modification, and altered synaptic function.",

However, these test mixtures have generally consisted of few proteins at near equal concentration or of a single protein at varied concentrations. Such mixtures are too simple to effectively assess the validity of error rates for protein identification and differential expression in HTP MS/MS studies. This work aimed at overcoming these limitations and simulating studies of complex biological samples. We introduced a pair of 54-protein standard mixtures of variable concentrations with up to a 1000-fold dynamic range in concentration and up to ten-fold expression ratios with additional negative controls (infinite expression ratios). These test mixtures comprised 16 off-the-shelf Sigma-Aldrich proteins and 38 Shewanella oneidensis proteins produced in-house. The standard proteins were systematically distributed into three main concentration groups (high, medium, and low) and then the concentrations were varied differently for each mixture within the groups to generate different expression ratios. The mixtures were analyzed with both low mass accuracy LCQ and high mass accuracy FT-LTQ instruments. In addition, these 54 standard proteins closely follow the molecular weight distributions of both bacterial and human proteomes. As a result, these new standard mixtures allow for a much more realistic assessment of approaches for protein identification and label-free differential expression than previous mixtures. Finally, methodology and experimental design developed in this work can be readily applied in future to development of more complex standard mixtures for HTP proteomics studies.",

In order to provide brain banks as well as scientists working in the proteomics field with measures for tissue quality, the critical factors after death, the effect of post-mortem interval (PMI) and storage temperature on the human brain proteome were investigated. This study was focused on the gray matter of the frontal cortex. The PMI was artificially prolonged from the time of autopsy (2 h after death) by storing samples at 4 degrees C or room temperature over 18, 24, and 48 h. The samples were analyzed by 2-D DIGE using a pH 4-7 gradient, revealing a time course of quantitative protein changes. The degradation of three proteins, peroxiredoxin-1, stathmin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were further confirmed by Western-blot analysis. Proteins vulnerable to PMI were analyzed by the 2-D DIGE analysis of cortex samples from three donors, and were derived from a variety of functional groups, including metabolic, structural, stress response, antioxidants, synaptosomal, and neuronal proteins.",

Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate whether feature-based predictions by the SecretomeP (SecP) algorithm will aid the proteomics-based analysis of protein export in Bacillus subtilis. The SecP algorithm is trained to recognize features such as secondary structure and disordered regions, which are generally present in secreted proteins. The results showed that membrane-retained proteins receive, in general, high SecP scores, similar to the scores of secretory proteins. Importantly, the SecP algorithm aided in the re-evaluation of a class of previously identified proteins that remain attached to the membrane despite the presence of an apparent Sec-type signal peptide. These so-called 'Sec-attached' proteins receive on average a lower SecP score, and several of these proteins could be unmasked as transmembrane proteins by combined SecP and signal peptide analyses. Finally, the present study suggests that feature-based outlier analysis may provide leads towards the discovery of novel special-purpose pathways for bacterial protein export.",

In Lotus japonicus (Lotus), several genes involved in nodule development or nodule function have been defined using biochemistry, genetic approaches, and high-throughput transcriptomics. We have employed proteomics to further understand nodule development. Two developmental stages representing nodules prior to nitrogen fixation (white) and mature nitrogen fixing nodules (red) were compared with roots. In addition, the proteome of a spontaneous nodule formation mutant (snf1) was determined. From nodules and roots, 780 and 790 protein spots from 2D gels were identified and approximately 45% of the corresponding unique gene accessions were common. Including a previous proteomics set from Lotus pod and seed, the common gene accessions were decreased to 7%. Interestingly, an indication of more pronounced PTMs in nodules than in roots was determined. Between the two nodule developmental stages, higher levels of pathogen-related 10 proteins, HSPs, and proteins involved in redox processes were found in white nodules, suggesting a higher stress level at this developmental stage. In contrast, protein spots corresponding to nodulins such as leghemoglobin, asparagine synthetase, sucrose synthase, and glutamine synthetase were prevalent in red nodules. The distinct biochemical state of nodules was further highlighted by the conspicuous presence of several nitrilases, ascorbate metabolic enzymes, and putative rhizobial effectors.",

Here, we analyze the consequences of IPI's discontinuation for human and mouse data, and the effect of its substitution with UniProtKB on two levels: (i) data already produced and (ii) newly performed experiments. To estimate the effect on existing data, we investigated how well IPI identifiers map to UniProtKB accessions. We found that 21% of human and 10% of mouse identifiers do not map to UniProtKB and would thus be \"lost.\" To investigate the impact on new experiments, we compared the theoretical search space (i.e. the tryptic peptides) of both resources and found that it is decreased by 14.0% for human and 8.9% for mouse data through IPI's closure. An analysis on the experimental evidence for these \"lost\" peptides showed that the vast majority has not been identified in experiments available in the major proteomics repositories. It thus seems likely that the search space provided by UniProtKB is of higher quality than the one currently provided by IPI.",

This standard consists of 30 peptides between 8 and 37 amino acids long and each constructed to contain repetitive sequences of Pro, Ala and Ser as well as one C-terminal arginine residue. MALDI spectra thus cover a mass range between 750 and 3200 m/z in MS mode and between 100 and 3200 m/z in MS/MS mode. Our results show that multipoint calibration of MS spectra using PAS-cal peptides compares well to current commercial reagents for protein identification by PMF. Calibration of tandem mass spectra from LC-MALDI experiments using the longest peptide, PAS-cal37, resulted in smaller fragment ion mass errors, more matching fragment ions and more protein and peptide identifications compared to commercial standards, making the PAS-cal standard generically useful for bottom-up proteomics.",

In gel-based proteomics studies, the sequence coverage greatly depends on the protein detection method. It is shown here that ammoniacal silver detection methods offer improved sequence coverage over standard silver nitrate methods, while keeping the high sensitivity of silver staining. With the development of 2D-PAGE-based proteomics, another burden is placed on the detection methods used for protein detection on 2-D-gels. Besides the classical requirements of linearity, sensitivity, and homogeneity from one protein to another, detection methods must now take into account another aspect, namely their compatibility with MS. This compatibility is evidenced by two different and complementary aspects, which are (i) the absence of adducts and artefactual modifications on the peptides obtained after protease digestion of a protein detected and digested in - gel, and (ii) the quantitative yield of peptides recovered after digestion and analyzed by the mass spectrometer. While this quantitative yield is not very important per se, it is however a crucial parameter as it strongly influences the S/N of the mass spectrum and thus the number of peptides that can be detected from a given protein input, especially at low protein amounts. This influences in turn the sequence coverage and thus the detail of the analysis provided by the mass spectrometer.",

Therefore, a better understanding of dehydration response is the key to decipher the regulatory mechanism of better adaptation. In recent years, nuclear proteomics has become an attractive area of research, particularly to study the role of nucleus in stress response. In this study, a proteome of dehydration-sensitive chickpea cultivar (ICCV-2) was generated from nuclei-enriched fractions. The LC-MS/MS analysis led to the identification of 75 differentially expressed proteins presumably associated with different metabolic and regulatory pathways. Nuclear localisation of three candidate proteins was validated by transient expression assay. The ICCV-2 proteome was then compared with that of JG-62, a tolerant cultivar. The differential proteomics and in silico analysis revealed cultivar-specific differential expression of many proteins involved in various cellular functions. The differential tolerance could be attributed to altered expression of many structural proteins and the proteins involved in stress adaptation, notably the ROS catabolising enzymes. Further, a comprehensive comparison on the abiotic stress-responsive nuclear proteome was performed using the datasets published thus far. These findings might expedite the functional determination of the dehydration-responsive proteins and their prioritisation as potential molecular targets for better adaptation.",

Eighty-one healthy volunteers entered a double blind randomised trial to receive 3.5 g of fish oil or 3.5 g of high oleic sunflower oil daily. Serum was collected before and after 6 wk of intervention. Serum was analysed by proteomics using 2-DE. Proteins that were differentially regulated were identified by MS.

Fish oil supplementation caused a significant shift towards the larger, more cholesterol-rich HDL(2) particle.

Within the past decade, proteomic methods became increasingly accessible to microbiologists mainly due to the robustness of analytical methods (e.g. two-dimensional gel electrophoresis), and affordability of mass spectrometers and their relative ease of use. This review provides an overview on the complex portfolio of state-of-the-art proteomics and highlights the basic principles of key methods, ranging from sample preparation of laboratory or environmental samples, via protein/peptide separation (gel-based or gel-free) and different types of mass spectrometric protein/peptide analyses, to protein identification and abundance determination.

        "abstract": "Glycosylation is a widespread PTM of proteins; the carbohydrate moieties provide various functional, immunological and structural aspects of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic glycoproteins. Traditional strategies used to analyse glycoprotein O-glycans involve glycoprotein isolation, followed by glycan release using solution-phase base-catalysed beta-elimination. However, in a proteomics context, mixtures of proteins and glycoproteins are routinely separated using SDS-PAGE. We have therefore developed a method to enable the profiling of O-linked glycans directly from glycoproteins on gels. This is achieved using in-gel reductive beta-elimination followed by mass spectrometric analysis of the released glycans. Here we describe our demonstration of the feasibility of this approach, our development and optimisation of the procedure using bovine submaxillary gland glycoproteins as a standard, and then show its usefulness by applying the developed procedure to the analysis of the O-glycans from a glycoprotein band from a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE separation of a mixture of Mycobacterium avium capsular proteins and glycoproteins. The procedure has been shown to be applicable to both CBB- and silver-stained gels. The method offers a quick and easy way to identify the O-glycans from gel-separated glycoproteins within gel-based proteomics workflows.",

        "abstract": "The identification of (plasma) membrane proteins in cells can provide valuable insights into the regulation of their biological processes. Pluripotent cells such as human embryonic stem cells and embryonal carcinoma cells are capable of unlimited self-renewal and share many of the biological mechanisms that regulate proliferation and differentiation. The comparison of their membrane proteomes will help unravel the biological principles of pluripotency, and the identification of biomarker proteins in their plasma membranes is considered a crucial step to fully exploit pluripotent cells for therapeutic purposes. For these tasks, membrane proteomics is the method of choice, but as indicated by the scarce identification of membrane and plasma membrane proteins in global proteomic surveys it is not an easy task. In this minireview, we first describe the general challenges of membrane proteomics. We then review current sample preparation steps and discuss protocols that we found particularly beneficial for the identification of large numbers of (plasma) membrane proteins in human tumour- and embryo-derived stem cells. Our optimized assembled protocol led to the identification of a large number of membrane proteins. However, as the composition of cells and membranes is highly variable we still recommend adapting the sample preparation protocol for each individual system. \u00a9 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here we present a large scale proteogenomics study of two important apicomplexan pathogens: Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum. We queried proteomics data against a panel of official and alternate gene models generated directly from RNASeq data, using several newly generated and some previously published MS data sets for this meta-analysis. We identified a total of 201996 and 39953 peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) for T. gondii and N. caninum respectively at a 1% peptide false discovery rate threshold. This equated to the identification of 30494 distinct peptide sequences and 2921 proteins (matches to official gene models) for T. gondii, and 8911 peptides / 1273 proteins for N. caninum following stringent protein-level thresholding. We have also identified 289 and 140 loci for T. gondii and N. caninum respectively which mapped to RNA-Seq derived gene models used in our analysis and apparently absent from the official annotation (release 10 from EuPathDB) of these species. We present several examples in our study where the RNA-Seq evidence can help in correction of the current gene model and can help in discovery of potential new genes. The findings of this study have been integrated into the EuPathDB. The data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD000297and PXD000298. This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "A major challenge in cell biology is to identify the subcellular distribution of proteins within cells and to characterize how protein localization changes under different cell growth conditions and in response to stress and other external signals. Protein localization is usually determined either by microscopy or by using cell fractionation combined with protein blotting techniques. Both these approaches are intrinsically low throughput and limited to the analysis of known components. Here we use mass spectrometry-based proteomics to provide an unbiased, quantitative, and high throughput approach for measuring the subcellular distribution of the proteome, termed \"spatial proteomics.\" The spatial proteomics method analyzes a whole cell extract created by recombining differentially labeled subcellular fractions derived from cells in which proteins have been mass-labeled with heavy isotopes. This was used here to measure the relative distribution between cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus of over 2,000 proteins in HCT116 cells. The data show that, at steady state, the proteome is predominantly partitioned into specific subcellular locations with only a minor subset of proteins equally distributed between two or more compartments. Spatial proteomics also facilitates a proteome-wide comparison of changes in protein localization in response to a wide range of physiological and experimental perturbations, shown here by characterizing dynamic changes in protein localization elicited during the cellular response to DNA damage following treatment of HCT116 cells with etoposide. DNA damage was found to cause dissociation of the proteasome from inhibitory proteins and assembly chaperones in the cytoplasm and relocation to associate with proteasome activators in the nucleus",

        "abstract": "Determining global proteome changes is important for advancing a systems biology view of cellular processes and for discovering biomarkers. Liquid chromatography, coupled to mass spectrometry, has been widely used as a proteomics technique for discovering differentially expressed proteins in biological samples. However, although a large number of high-throughput studies have identified differentially regulated proteins, only a small fraction of these results have been reproduced and independently verified. The use of different approaches to data processing and analyses is among the factors which contribute to inconsistent conclusions. This perspective provides a comprehensive and critical overview of bioinformatics methods for commonly used mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics, employing both stable isotope labeling and label-free approaches. We evaluate the challenges associated with current quantitative proteomics techniques, placing particular emphasis on data analyses. The complexity of processing and interpreting proteomics datasets has become a central issue as sensitivity, mass resolution, mass accuracy and throughput of mass spectrometers have improved. A number of computer programs are available to address these challenges, and are reviewed here. We focus on approaches for signal processing, noise reduction, and methods for protein abundance estimation.",

Information on the components of these matrices will aid in the development of a fully defined growth surface for hESCs. These matrices typically consist of mixture of proteins present in a wide range of abundance making their characterization challenging. In this study, we performed the proteomic analysis of five previously uncharacterized matrices: CellStart, Human Basement Membrane Extract (Human BME), StemXVivo, Bridge Human Extracellular Matrix (BridgeECM), and mouse embryonic fibroblast conditioned matrix (MEF-CMTX). Based on a proteomics protocol optimized using lysates from HeLa cells, we undertook the analysis of the five complex extracellular matrix (ECM) samples using a combination of strong anion and cation exchange chromatography and SDS-PAGE. For each of these matrices, we identify numerous proteins, indicating their complex nature. We also compared these results with a similar proteomics analysis of the growth matrix, Matrigel\u2122. From these analyses, we observed that fibronectin is a primary component of nearly all hESC supportive matrices. This observation led to the investigation of the suitability of fibronectin as a defined ECM for the growth of hESCs. We found that fibronectin promotes the maintenance of pluripotent H9 and CA1 hESCs in an undifferentiated state using mTeSR1 medium. This finding validates the utility of characterizing matrices used for hESC growth in revealing ECM components required for culturing hESCs in a universally applicable defined system.",

Cell walls also contain 5-10% of proteins, which could be used to tailor them for agroindustrial uses. Here we present cell wall proteomics data of Brachypodium distachyon, a model plant for temperate grasses. Leaves and culms were analyzed during active growth and at mature stage. Altogether, 559 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS and bioinformatics, among which 314 have predicted signal peptides. Sixty-three proteins were shared by two organs at two developmental stages where they could play housekeeping functions. Differences were observed between organs and stages of development, especially at the level of glycoside hydrolases and oxidoreductases. Differences were also found between the known cell wall proteomes of B. distachyon, Oryza sativa, and the Arabidopsis thaliana dicot. Three glycoside hydrolases could be immunolocalized in cell walls using polyclonal antibodies against proteotypic peptides. Organ-specific expression consistent with proteomics results could be observed as well as cell-specific localization. Moreover, the high number of proteins of unknown function in B. distachyon cell wall proteomes opens new fields of research for monocot cell walls.",

        "abstract": "dasHPPboard is a novel proteomics-based dashboard that collects and reports the experiments produced by the Spanish Human Proteome Project consortium (SpHPP), and aims to help HPP to map the entire human proteome. We have followed the strategy of analog genomics projects like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), which provides a vast amount of data on human cell lines experiments. The dashboard includes results of Shotgun and Selected Reaction Monitoring proteomics experiments, post-translational modifications information as well as proteogenomics studies. We have also processed the transcriptomics data from the ENCODE and Human Body Map (HBM) projects for the identification of specific gene expression patterns in different cell lines and tissues, taking special interest on those genes having little proteomic evidence available (missing proteins). Peptide databases have been built using single nucleotide variants and novel junctions derived from RNA-Seq data that can be used in search engines for sample-specific protein identifications on the same cell lines or tissues. The dasHPPboard has been designed as a tool that can be used to share and visualize a combination of proteomic and transcriptomic data, providing at the same time easy access to resources for proteogenomics analyses. The dasHPPboard can be freely accessed at: http://sphppdashboard.cnb.csic.es.",

        "abstract": "Aplysia californica (AC) is a widely used model for testing learning and memory. Although ESTs have been generated, proteomics studies on AC proteins are limited. Studies at the protein level, however, are mandatory, not only due to the fact that studies at the nucleic acid level are not allowing conclusions about PTMs. A gel-based proteomics method was therefore applied to carry out protein profiling in abdominal ganglia from AC. Abdominal ganglia were extirpated, proteins extracted and run on 2DE with subsequent in-gel digestion with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and partially by subtilisin. Peptides were identified using a nano-LC-ESI-LTQ-FT-mass spectrometer. MS/MS data were analyzed by searching the NCBI nonredundant public AC EST database and the NCBI nonredundant public AC protein database. A total of 477 different proteins represented by 363 protein spots were detected and were assigned to different protein pathways as for instance signaling (receptors, protein kinases, and phosphatases), metabolism, protein synthesis, handling and degradation, cytoskeleton and structural, oxido-redox, heat shock and chaperone, hypothetical, predicted and unnamed proteins. The generation of a protein map of soluble proteins shows the existence of so far hypothetical and predicted proteins and is allowing and challenging further work at the protein level, in particular in the field of neuroscience.",

        "abstract": "Halophyte, like Salicornia europaea, could make full use of marginal saline land for carbon fixation. How the photosynthesis of S. europaea is regulated under high salinity implicates a significant aspect to exploit this pioneer plant in future. Measurement of photosynthesis parameters demonstrated the reduction of photosynthesis for the 0 and 800 mM NaCl treated plants are more likely due to non-stomatal limitation, which might be caused by changes in the enzymes associated with photosynthesis. Different salinity induced ultrastructure changes other than photosynthetic apparatus damage, suggesting the photosynthesis of S. europaea might be affected via biochemical regulation. Comparative proteomics analysis of chloroplast proteins by 2-D gel electrophoresis reproducibly detected 90 differentially expressed proteins, among which 66 proteins were identified by nanoLC MS/MS. Further study of thylakoid membrane proteins by Blue-Native PAGE proved the increase in abundance of light reaction proteins under salinity. Analysis of gene expression patterns of 12 selected proteins provides evidence for the correlations between transcription and proteomics data. Based on our results, a putative model of photosynthesis regulatory network figured out proper coordination of carbon fixation and nitrogen metabolism in chloroplast of S. europaea under salinity, which provided subcellular level insight into salt tolerance mechanism in S. europaea.",

        "abstract": "Various enzyme reactors and online enzyme digestion strategies have been developed in recent years. These reactors greatly enhanced the detection sensitivity and proteome coverage in qualitative proteomics. However, these devices have higher rates of miscleavage in protein digestion. Therefore, we investigated the effect of online enzyme digestion on the quantification accuracy of quantitative proteomics using chemical or metabolic isotope labeling approaches. The incomplete digestion would introduce some unexpected variations in comparative quantification when the samples are digested and then chemically isotope labeled in different aliquots. Even when identical protein aliquots are processed on these devices using post-digestion chemical isotope labeling and the CVs of the ratios controlled to less than 50% in replicate analyses, about 10% of the quantified proteins have a ratio greater than two-fold, whereas in theory the ratio is 1:1. Interestingly, the incomplete digestion with enzyme reactor is not a problem when metabolic isotope labeling samples were processed because the proteins are isotopically labeled in vivo prior to their simultaneous digestion within the reactor. Our results also demonstrated that both high quantification accuracy and high proteome coverage can be achieved in comparative proteome quantification using online enzyme digestion even when a limited amount of metabolic isotope labeling samples is used (1683 proteins comparatively quantified from 10(5) Hela cells).",

A more precise and efficient method, in which previously observed and identified peptide MS/MS spectra are catalogued and condensed into searchable spectral libraries to allow new identifications by spectral matching, is seen as a promising alternative. To that end, an open-source, functionally complete, high-throughput and readily extensible MS/MS spectral searching tool, SpectraST, was developed. A high-quality spectral library was constructed by combining the high-confidence identifications of millions of spectra taken from various data repositories and searched using four sequence search engines. The resulting library consists of over 30,000 spectra for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using this library, SpectraST vastly outperforms the sequence search engine SEQUEST in terms of speed and the ability to discriminate good and bad hits. A unique advantage of SpectraST is its full integration into the popular Trans Proteomic Pipeline suite of software, which facilitates user adoption and provides important functionalities such as peptide and protein probability assignment, quantification, and data visualization. This method of spectral library searching is especially suited for targeted proteomics applications, offering superior performance to traditional sequence searching.",

Screening key proteins, which play a critical role in metastasis, using high-throughput proteomics approach help discover valuable biomarkers and elucidate the mechanism of metastasis. This study was to find out some metastasis candidate proteins among HCC cell lines with various metastatic potential by comparative proteomics, and then further validate the biological function of these proteins in metastasis in vitro. The protein profiles of metastatic HCC cell lines (MHCC97H and MHCC97L) displayed obvious differences compared with nonmetastatic ones (Hep3B). Twenty-six metastasis candidate proteins, which were identified by on-line LC-ESI-MS/MS, such as S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4), annexin 1, etc., might have much application in diagnostic procedures and prognosis evaluation. S100A4, as a leading different metastasis candidate protein, which overexpressed only in the metastatic cells, was selected for further investigation. A series of assays related to invasion and metastasis in vitro, including cell motility, invasion, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secretion, were performed in MHCC97H/antisense recombinant plasmid to S100A4 (pcDNA3.1(+) AS S100A4) and the mock controls. All the data in the present study suggested that S100A4 might contribute to HCC invasion and metastasis through two paths of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9) secretion regulation and strengthened motility and invasion properties.",

This study identifies 260 differentially expressed protein isoforms from 2-D-DIGE gels using MALDI MS and reveals the complexity of the cellular response to oxidative stress and the dependency on the Sty1p stress-activated protein kinase. We show the relationship between these protein changes and mRNA expression levels identified in a parallel whole genome study, and discuss the regulatory mechanisms involved in protecting cells against hydrogen peroxide and the involvement of Sty1p-dependent stress-activated protein kinase signalling. Metabolomic profiling of 29 intermediates using 1H NMR was also conducted alongside the protein analysis using the same sample sets, allowing examination of how the protein changes might affect the metabolic pathways and biological processes involved in the oxidative stress response. This combined analysis identifies a number of interlinked metabolic pathways that exhibit stress- and Sty1-dependent patterns of regulation.",

Protein profiles of Golgi-enriched fractions isolated from S. typhimurium-infected cells were compared with those of mock-infected cells, revealing significant depletion or enrichment of 105 proteins. Proteins annotated to play a role in membrane traffic were overrepresented among the depleted proteins whereas proteins annotated to the cytoskeleton showed a diverse behavior with some proteins being enriched, others being depleted from the Golgi fraction upon Salmonella infection. To study the functional relevance of identified proteins in the Salmonella infection cycle, small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments were performed. siRNA-mediated depletion of a selection of affected proteins identified five host factors involved in Salmonella infection. Depletion of peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6), isoform \u03b2-4c of integrin \u03b2-4 (ITGB4), isoform 1 of protein lap2 (erbin interacting protein; ERBB2IP), stomatin (STOM) or TBC domain containing protein 10b (TBC1D10B) resulted in increased Salmonella replication. Surprisingly, in addition to the effect on Salmonella replication, depletion of STOM or ITGB4 resulted in a dispersal of intracellular Salmonella microcolonies. It can be concluded that by using SILAC-based quantitative proteomics we were able to identify novel host cell proteins involved in the complex interplay between Salmonella and epithelial cells.",

Using antibody-antigen interactions as a proof-of-concept system, the targeted plasma proteins, serum amyloid P (SAP), serum amyloid A (SAA), and C-reactive protein (CRP), could be selectively isolated and enriched from human plasma by antibody-immobilized PVDF membrane and directly identified by MALDI-TOF MS without additional elution step. The approach was successfully applied to human plasma for rapid quantitation and variant screening of SAP, SAA, and CRP in healthy individuals and patients with gastric cancer. The triplexed on-probe quantitative analysis revealed significant overexpression of CRP and SAA in gastric cancer group, consistent with parallel ELISA measurements and pathological progression and prognostic significance reported in previous literatures. Furthermore, the variant mass profiling of the post-translationally modified forms revealed a high occurrence of de-sialic acid SAP in patients with gastric cancer. Due to the versatile assay design, ease of probe preparation without chemical synthesis, and compatibility with MALDI-TOF MS analysis, the methodology may be useful for target protein characterization, functional proteomics, and screening in clinical proteomics.",

Strains of increased virulence have emerged (e.g. USA300) that can infect healthy individuals in the community and are difficult to treat. To add to the knowledge about the pathophysiology of S. aureus, the adaption to iron restriction, an important in vivo stressor, was studied and the corresponding immune response of the human host characterized. Using a combination of 1D and 2D immune proteomics, the human antibody response to the exoproteomes of S. aureus USA300\u0394spa grown under iron restriction or with excess iron was compared. Human antibody binding to the altered exoproteome under iron restriction showed a 2.7- to 6.2-fold increase in overall signal intensity, and new antibody specificities appeared. Quantification of the secreted bacterial proteins by gel-free proteomics showed the expected strong increase in level of proteins involved in iron acquisition during iron-restricted growth compared to iron access. This was accompanied by decreased levels of superantigens and hemolysins. The latter was corroborated by functional peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation assays. The present data provide a comprehensive view of S.\u00a0aureus exoproteome adaptation to iron restriction. Adults have high concentrations of serum antibodies specific for some of the newly induced proteins. We conclude that iron restriction is a common feature of the microenvironment, where S. aureus interacts with the immune system of its human host.",

Confocal laser microscopy showed co-localization of LIMP-2 with IgG along the glomerular basement membrane. Serum antibodies against LIMP-2 could not be detected.

Using FunRich, users can perform functional enrichment analysis on background databases that are integrated from heterogeneous genomic and proteomic resources (>1.5 million annotations). Besides default human specific FunRich database, users can download data from the UniProt database, which currently supports 20 different taxonomies against which enrichment analysis can be performed. Moreover, the users can build their own custom databases and perform the enrichment analysis irrespective of organism. In addition to proteomics datasets, the custom database allows for the tool to be used for genomics, lipidomics and metabolomics datasets. Thus, FunRich allows for complete database customization and thereby permits for the tool to be exploited as a skeleton for enrichment analysis irrespective of the data type or organism used. FunRich (http://www.funrich.org) is user-friendly and provides graphical representation (Venn, pie charts, bar graphs, column, heatmap and doughnuts) of the data with customizable font, scale and color (publication quality).",

The fungicide mancozeb, widely used in agriculture, is an ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate complex with manganese and zinc. Exposure to this pesticide has been linked to the development of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and cancer. Given that many signalling pathways and their molecular components are substantially conserved among eukaryotic organisms, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to get insights into the molecular mechanisms of mancozeb toxicity and adaptation based on expression proteomics. The early global response to mancozeb was analysed by quantitative proteomics using 2-DE. The target genes (e.g. TSA1, TSA2, SOD1, SOD2, AHP1, GRE2, GRX1, CYS3, PRE3, PRE6, PRE8, PRE9, EFT1, RPS5, TIF11, HSP31, HSP26, HSP104, HSP60, HSP70-family) and the putative main transcription activators (e.g. Yap1, Msn2/Msn4, Met4, Hsf1, Aft1, Pdr1, Skn7, Rpn4p, Gcn4) of the complex mancozeb-induced expression changes are related with yeast response to stress, in particular to oxidative stress, protein translation initiation and protein folding, disassembling of protein aggregates and degradation of damaged proteins. Our results also suggest that this study provided powerful indications that may be useful to expand the knowledge obtained in yeast not only to the global response to mancozeb toxicity in phytopathogenic fungi but also to humans.",

To demonstrate the accuracy of this strategy, light and heavy TMPP-labeled peptides were combined at different ratios and subsequently analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The MS spectra and scatter plots show that peptide and protein ratios were both consistentwith the mixed ratios.We observed a linear correlation between protein ratios and the predicted ratios. In comparison with SILAC method, the TMPP labeling method produced similarly accurate quantitative results with low CVs. In conclusion, our results suggest that this isotope-coded TMPPmethod achieved accurate quantification andcompatibility with IEF-based separation.

Loading capacity for optimal peptide focusing is below 100 microg and--similar to 2-D gels--IEF is more efficient in the acidic than the basic pH region.

Compared to in-gel digestion, peptide IEF consistently identified a third more proteins with equal number of fractions. Low protein starting amounts (10 microg) still resulted in deep proteome coverage. Advantages of the in-gel format include better reliability and robustness. Considering its superior performance, diminished sample and work-up requirements, peptide IEF will become a method of choice for sample preparation in proteomics.",

Using recently developed gel-free proteomics technology, we explored the membrane proteome of the important human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus in the presence or absence of the cationic phospholipid lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG). We were able to detect almost half of all theoretical integral membrane proteins and could reliably quantify more than 35% of them. It is worth noting that the deletion of the Lys-PG synthase MprF did not lead to a massive alteration but a very distinct up- or down-regulation of only 1.5 or 3.5% of the quantified proteins. Lys-PG deficiency had no major impact on the abundance of lipid-biosynthetic enzymes but significantly affected the amounts of the cell envelope stress-sensing regulatory proteins such as SaeS and MsrR, and of the SaeS-regulated proteins Sbi, Efb, and SaeP. These data indicate very critical interactions of membrane-sensory proteins with phospholipids and they demonstrate the power of membrane proteomics for the characterization of bacterial physiology and pathogenicity",

Physiological proteomics requires 2-D reference maps, on which most of the main proteins are identified. We present a reference map for the bacterial plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens proteins, which contains more than 300 entries with an isoelectric point (pI) between 4 and 7. The quantitative study of the proteins in the analytical window of the master gel demonstrated unique features, in comparison with other bacteria. In addition, a theoretical analysis of several protein parameters was performed and compared with the experimental results. A comparison of the theoretical molecular weight (MW) of the proteins and their theoretical pI with their vertical and horizontal migration distances, respectively, pointed out the existence of several proteins that strongly diverted from the graph trend-line. These proteins were clearly subjected to post-translational modifications, which changed their pI and/or MW. Additional support for post-translational modifications comes from the identification of multiple spots of the same gene products. Post-translational modifications appear to be more common than expected, at least for soluble proteins, as more than 10% of the proteins were associated with multiple spots.",

Inhibitors of HDACs are used in cancer therapy based on the role HDACs play in transcription by regulating chromatin compaction and non-histone proteins such as transcription factors. Profiling of HDAC expression is of interest in the functional proteomics analysis of cancer. Also, non-HDAC proteins may interact with HDAC inhibitor drugs and contribute to the drug mode of action. We here present a tool for the unbiased chemical proteomic profiling of proteins that specifically interact with SAHA. We designed and synthesized a trifunctional Capture Compound containing SAHA as selectivity and identified HDACs1, 2, 3 and 6, known and predicted HDAC interactors from human-derived HepG2 cell lysate, as well as a set of new potential non-HDAC targets of SAHA. One of these non-HDAC targets, isochorismatase domain-containing protein 2 (ISOC2) is putative hydrolase associated with the negative regulation of the tumor-suppressor p16(INK4a). We demonstrated the direct and dose-dependent interaction of SAHA to the purified recombinant ISOC2 protein. Using SAHA Capture Compound mass spectrometry, we thus identified potential new SAHA target proteins in an entirely unbiased chemical proteomics approach.",

Functional genomics technologies can provide new insights into the adaptational network of this bacterium and its response to environmental challenges. While functional genomics technologies, including proteomics, have been extensively used to study these phenomena in shake flask cultures, studies of bacteria from in vivo settings lack behind. Particularly for proteomics studies, the major bottleneck is the lack of sufficient proteomic coverage for low numbers of cells. In this study, we introduce a workflow that combines a pulse-chase stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture approach with high capacity cell sorting, on-membrane digestion, and high-sensitivity MS to detect and quantitatively monitor several hundred S. aureus proteins from a few million internalised bacteria. This workflow has been used in a proof-of-principle experiment to reveal changes in levels of proteins with a function in protection against oxidative damage and adaptation of cell wall synthesis in strain RN1HG upon internalisation by S9 human bronchial epithelial cells",

At the downside, the overall low protein content of urine as well as the presence of low- and high-abundance proteins underscores the need for protein enrichment. As a continuation of previous efforts towards the comprehensive characterization of the urine proteome, the current study targeted the mining of urine proteins through the combined application of different protein separation methodologies, specifically, liquid chromatography and preparative electrophoresis along with 1D gel electrophoresis and protein identification by mass spectrometry. In order to enhance comparison and integration of different experimental data sets, the \"standard\" urine sample developed within the European Kidney and Urine Proteomics (EuroKUP) COST Action, was employed. As a contribution to the existing knowledge, we focused on maintaining and providing information about experimental mass of the identified proteins as well as information pertaining to their relative abundance--as allowed by technical limitations--thus providing an initial view of different isoforms representation and facilitating their future characterization. The difficulties in comparing proteome mining data sets become once more evident, underscoring the need for adopting standardized ways for data reporting as well as for potential new approaches for data analysis involving a thorough investigation of received information at the peptide level.",

Out of 945 proteins reproducibly detected on gels, the expression of 96 spots changed during differentiation. Using MS, 87 ESC-associated proteins were identified including several proteins involved in cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, transcription, translation, mRNA processing, and protein folding. Transcriptional changes accompanying differentiation of Royan H5 were also analyzed using microarrays. We developed a comprehensive data set that shows the use of human ESC lines in vitro to mimic gastrulation and organogenesis. Our results showed that proteomics and transcriptomics data are complementary rather than duplicative. Although regulation of many genes during differentiation were observed only at transcript level, modulation of several proteins was revealed only by proteome analysis.",

Publicly available data repositories play a fundamental role for all biological sciences, and protein data repositories are in particular essential for the successful development of new proteomic methods. Cumulative proteome data repositories, including the PeptideAtlas, provide the means for targeted proteomics, system wide observations, and cross species observational studies, but pigs have so far been underrepresented in existing repositories. We here present a significantly improved build of the Pig PeptideAtlas, which includes pig proteome data from 25 tissues and three body fluid types mapped to 7139 canonical proteins. The content of the Pig PeptideAtlas reflects actively ongoing research within the veterinary proteomics domain, and this manuscript demonstrates how the expression of isoform-unique peptides can be observed across distinct tissues and body fluids. The Pig PeptideAtlas is a unique resource for use in animal proteome research, particularly biomarker discovery and for preliminary design of SRM assays, which are equally important for progress in research that supports farm animal production and veterinary health, as for developing pig models with relevance to human health research.

As such, proteomics has long been taxonomically restricted, with limited inroads being made into the proteomes of \"non-model\" organisms. However, next generation sequencing (NGS), and particularly RNA-Seq, now allows deep coverage detection of expressed genes at low cost, which in turn potentially facilitates the matching of peptide mass spectra with cognate gene sequence. To test this, we performed a quantitative analysis of the proteomes of pollen from domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and two wild relatives that exhibit differences in mating systems and in interspecific reproductive barriers. Using a custom tomato RNA-Seq database created through 454 pyrosequencing, more than 1200 proteins were identified, with subsets showing expression differences between genotypes or in the accumulation of the corresponding transcripts. Importantly, no major qualitative or quantitative differences were observed in the characterized proteomes when mass spectra were used to interrogate either a highly curated community database of tomato sequences generated through traditional sequencing technologies, or the RNA-Seq database. We conclude that RNA-Seq provides a cost-effective and robust platform for protein identification and will be increasingly valuable to the field of proteomics.",

Through the design of ad hoc analytical methods, MS has contributed significantly in the dissection of hPTMs, exhibiting specific strengths in identifying novel marks and assessing their combinatorial interplay. However, the comprehensive analysis of all individual isoforms of some hypermodified histone regions remains highly challenging with conventional proteomics platforms. Since complex hPTM patterns have unique functional outcomes on the genes, the implementation of new MS-proteomics solutions can boost epigenetic research. Here, we assessed the effectiveness of a new analytical platform-which combines ultra high-performance LC (UHPLC) with high-resolution MS/MS analysis-in dissecting hypermodified regions from macrophage core histones. We compared the resolving power of this configuration with a standard setup based on HPLC-MS/MS and focused on two case-study peptides, H3 (27-40) and H4 (4-17). We observed that the novel platform resolves a much larger set of distinct peptide isoforms; among them some were resolved for the first time. A comprehensive analysis of hPTMs from macrophages was then carried out at basal state and upon lipopolysaccharide induction, to profile their temporal change in bulk chromatin during the inflammatory response.",

Infection of the muscle cell leads to the formation of a host-parasite complex that results in profound alterations to the host cell and a re-alignment of muscle-specific gene expression. The role of parasite excretory-secretory (ES) proteins in mediating these effects is currently unknown, largely due to the difficulty in identifying and assigning function to individual proteins. In this study, a global proteomics approach was used to analyse the ES proteins from T. spiralis muscle larvae. Following 2-DE of ES proteins,MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-MS/MS were used to identify the peptide spots. Specific Trichinella EST databases were assembled and used to analyse the data. Despite the current absence of a Trichinella genome-sequencing project, 43 out of 52 protein spots analysed were identified and included the major secreted glycoproteins. Other novel proteins were identified from matches with sequences in the T. spiralis database. Our results demonstrate the value of proteomics as a tool for the identification of Trichinella ES proteins and in the study of the molecular mechanism underpinning the formation of the host-parasite complex during Trichinella infections.",

Interestingly, a-enolase (ENO1), an overexpressed gene in NPC, was confirmed as a NESG1-regulated protein in NPC cells. Overexpressed ENO1 not only restored cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression, but also antagonized the regulation of NESG1 to cell-cycle regulators p21 and CCNA1 expression as well as induced the expression of C-Myc, pRB, and E2F1 in NESG1-ovexpressed NPC cells. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that NESG1 expression is negatively correlated with ENO1 expression in NPC tissues. Our observations suggest that ENO1 downregulation plays an important role in NESG1-induced growth inhibition of NPC cancer cells.",

Secreted plasma proteins involved in lipid transport, blood coagulation, proteolysis, plasminogen activating cascades, extracellular stimulus responses, and immunity are most abundant in this species. Globulins and albumins are much less abundant than in mammalian plasma. Unbiased quantitative proteome profiling identified 45 highly population-specific plasma proteins. Population-specific abundance differences were validated by targeted proteomics based on data-independent acquisition. Gene ontology enrichment analyses and known functions of population-specific plasma proteins indicate enrichment of processes controlling cell adhesion, tissue remodeling, proteolytic processing, and defense signaling in marine sticklebacks. Moreover, fetuin B and leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2, are much more abundant in marine fish. These proteins promote bone morphogenesis and likely contribute to population-specific body armor differences. Plasma proteins enriched in FW fish promote translation, heme biosynthesis, and lipid transport, suggesting a greater presence of plasma microparticles. Many prominent population-specific plasma proteins (e.g. apoptosis associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) lack any homolog of known function or adequate functional characterization. Their functional characterization and the identification of population-specific environmental contexts and selective pressures that cause plasma proteome diversification are future directions emerging from this study.

Protein extracts were first passed through a phosphoprotein affinity column, and the phosphoprotein-enriched eluate fractions were then separated on 2D gels and visualized by staining with SYPRO Ruby. Proteins were excised from the gels and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting; 11/13 protein spots identified from a gel of the phosphoprotein-enriched fraction had prior published evidence indicating that they were phosphoproteins. Additional experiments using a specific stain for phosphoproteins, prior incubation of the protein extract with alkaline phosphatase and blotting with monoclonal antibodies to phosphothreonine, phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine demonstrated that the phosphoprotein affinity column was an effective method for enriching phosphoproteins. Further validating the method, growth of yeast in the presence of sorbic acid resulted in altered phosphorylation of 17 proteins, 13 of which had prior published evidence that they were phosphoproteins or had ATP binding activity.",

Their dysfunction has also been linked to cellular aging. Additionally, mechanisms leading to the preservation of mitochondrial function promote longevity. In this study we investigated the proteomic and functional alterations in brain mitochondria isolated from mature (5 months old), old (12 months old), and aged (24 months old) mice as determinants of normal \u201chealthy\u201d aging. Here the global changes concomitant with aging in the mitochondrial proteome of mouse brain analyzed by quantitative mass-spectrometry based super-SILAC identified differentially expressed proteins involved in several metabolic pathways including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Despite these changes, the bioenergetic function of these mitochondria was preserved. Overall, this data indicates that proteomic changes during aging may compensate for functional defects aiding in preservation of mitochondrial function.

In the halophyte Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, specialized trichomes called epidermal bladder cells (EBC) line the surface of leaves and stems, and increase dramatically in size and volume upon plant salt-treatment. These cells have been proposed to have roles in plant defense and UV protection, but primarily in sodium sequestration and as water reservoirs. To gain further understanding into the roles of EBC, a cell-type-specific proteomics approach was taken in which precision single-cell sampling of cell sap from individual EBC was combined with shotgun peptide sequencing (LC-MS/MS). Identified proteins showed diverse biological functions and cellular locations, with a high representation of proteins involved in H(+)-transport, carbohydrate metabolism, and photosynthesis. The proteome of EBC provides insight into the roles of these cells in ion and water homeostasis and raises the possibility that they are photosynthetically active and functioning in Crassulacean acid metabolism.",

After 2-DE gel scanning, images with a plethora of spot features emerge that are usually contaminated by inherent noise. The objective of the denoising process is to remove noise to the extent that the true spots are recovered correctly and accurately i.e. without introducing distortions leading to the detection of false-spot features. In this paper we propose and justify the use of the contourlet transform as a tool for 2-DE gel images denoising. We compare its effectiveness with state-of-the-art methods such as wavelets-based multiresolution image analysis and spatial filtering. We show that contourlets not only achieve better average S/N performance than wavelets and spatial filters, but also preserve better spot boundaries and faint spots and alter less the intensities of informative spot features, leading to more accurate spot volume estimation and more reliable spot detection, operations that are essential to differential expression proteomics for biomarkers discovery.",

Many proteins are trafficked to these in order to be able to carry out their correct physiological function. Assigning the sub-cellular location of a protein is of paramount importance to biologists in the elucidation of its role and in the refinement of knowledge of cellular processes by tracing certain activities to specific organelles. Membrane proteins are a key set of proteins as these form part of the boundary of the organelles and represent many important functions such as transporters, receptors, and trafficking. They are, however, some of the most challenging proteins to work with due to poor solubility, a wide concentration range within the cell and inaccessibility to many of the tools employed in proteomics studies. This review focuses on membrane proteins with particular emphasis on sub-cellular localization in terms of methodologies that can be used to determine the accurate location of membrane proteins to organelles. We also discuss what is known about the membrane protein cohorts of major organelles.",

On average, two constructs have been made for each of the approximately 1700 protein targets selected by SPINE for protein production. Overall, HTP expression screening in E. coli has yielded 32% soluble constructs, with at least one for 70% of the targets. In addition to the implementation of HTP cloning and expression screening, the development of two novel technologies is described, namely library-based screening for soluble constructs and parallel small-scale high-density fermentation.",

The latter ones were reconstituted retrovirally from p14\u207b/\u207b mouse embryonic fibroblasts by reexpression of pEGFP-p14 at equimolar ratios with its physiological binding partner MP1, as shown here by absolute quantification of MP1 and p14 proteins on endosomes by quantitative MS using the Equimolarity through Equalizer Peptide strategy. A combination of subcellular fractionation, 2-D DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS revealed 31 proteins differentially regulated in p14\u207b/\u207b organelles, which were rescued by reexpression of pEGFP-p14 in p14\u207b/\u207b endosomes. Regulated proteins are known to be involved in actin remodeling, endosomal signal transduction and trafficking. Identified proteins and their in silico interaction networks suggested that endosomal signaling might regulate such major cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival.",

Several years ago, a technique to selectively enrich the relative concentration of low-abundant proteins was introduced by Boschetti and co-workers. It is based on a specific and saturable interaction of proteins to a high diversity of binding sites, realized by a hexapeptide library coupled to beads. This technology was commercialized as Equalizer beads or ProteoMiner. However, during application of ProteoMiner beads to plasma samples unexpected results questioned the proposed mode of action. Therefore, ProteoMiner beads were compared with chromatographic beads exhibiting completely different surface chemistry. Sepabeads FP-OD400 octadecyl, FP-DA400 diethylamine, FP-BU400 butyl, FP-HG400 hydroxyl and EXE056 epoxy were used. The results show that ProteoMiner or the different Sepabeads behave surprisingly similarly in the separation of complex protein mixtures. ProteoMiner beads interact with protein mixtures according to a general hydrophobic binding mechanism, where diversity in surface ligands plays only a negligible role.",

An unbiased quality control of identification parameters will be conducted using target/decoy searches providing significant improvement over identification standards. MASCOT identifications were for instance increased by 13% at a constant level of confidence. The target/decoy approach can however not be universally applied. We therefore also quality control the application of this strategy itself, providing useful and intuitive metrics for evaluating the precision and robustness of the obtained false discovery rate.",

Using the seven helical transmembrane-spanning proton pump bacteriorhodopsin as model protein, we demonstrate here that SDS removal from hydrophobic proteins by ion-pair extraction prior to in-gel tryptic proteolysis leads to a tenfold higher sensitivity in mass spectrometric identification via PMF, with respect to initial protein load on SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, parallel sequencing of the generated peptides by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was possible without further sample cleanup.

Taking advantage of this unique spectral property, we developed an algorithm, LysNDeNovo, to facilitate de novo sequencing of these peptides. LysNDeNovo contains simple and naive heuristics to demonstrate a proof of concept, i.e. that Lys-N peptide electron transfer dissociation spectra are perfectly suited for de novo interpretation. A stringent \"golden\" dataset of peptides identified by conventional database search algorithms was taken to validate the performance of LysNDeNovo. The results on this dataset indicate that LysNDeNovo was able to confidently identify a considerable proportion (42%), without requiring any prior genome or protein sequences. Results of similar quantity and quality could also be obtained on a much more extensive experimental dataset, illustrating the potential for higher throughput de novo sequencing using these methods.",

OLAV scoring schemes are based on signal detection theory, and exploit mass spectrometry information more extensively than previously existing schemes. We also introduce a new concept of structural matching that uses pattern detection methods to better separate true from false positives. We show the superiority of OLAV scoring schemes compared to MASCOT, a widely used identification program.

Both are affected by frequent and often overwhelming losses of phosphoric acid in ion trap CID fragmentation spectra. These losses are thought to translate into reduced intensities of sequence informative ions and a general decline in the quality of MS/MS spectra. To address this issue, several methods have been proposed, which rely on extended fragmentation schemes including collecting MS3 scans from neutral loss-containing ions and multi-stage activation to further fragment these same ions. Here, we have evaluated the utility of these methods in the context of a large-scale phosphopeptide analysis strategy with current instrumentation capable of accurate precursor mass determination. Remarkably, we found that MS3-based schemes did not increase the overall number of confidently identified peptides and had only limited value in site localization. We conclude that the collection of MS3 or pseudo-MS3 scans in large-scale proteomics studies is not worthwhile when high-mass accuracy instrumentation is used.",

The cellular consequences of OXPHOS defects and the pathophysiological mechanisms in related disorders are incompletely understood. Using a quantitative proteomics approach we provide evidence that a genetic defect of complex-I of the OXPHOS system may associate with transcriptional derangements of mitochondrial biogenesis through stabilization of the master transcriptional regulator PPARgamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) protein. Chronic oxidative stress suppresses the gene expression of PGC-1alpha but concomitant inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) can stabilize this co-activator protein, thereby inducing its downstream metabolic gene expression programs. Thus, mitochondrial biogenesis, which lays at the heart of the homeostatic control of energy metabolism, can be deregulated by secondary impairments of the protein turnover machinery.",

One strategy is the enrichment of phosphorylated proteins or peptides by immunoprecipitation or chromatography, e.g. immobilised metal affinity chromatography, prior to analysis. 2-DE gels are powerful tools for the analysis of phosphoproteins when combined with new multiplexing techniques like DIGE, phosphospecific stains, autoradiography or immunoblotting.

A two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis map of the C. glabrata proteome was constructed. We identified a total of 123 proteins, 61 of which displayed reproducible and statistically significant alterations in their levels following inactivation of ACE2. Of these, the levels of 32 proteins were elevated, and 29 were reduced in ace2 cells. These data show that Ace2 influences metabolism, protein synthesis, folding and targeting, and aspects of cell growth and polarisation. Some of these functions are likely to contribute to the effects of Ace2 upon the virulence of C. glabrata.",

This reproducibility study is a necessary component for our long-term research program that uses comparative proteomics to analyze lumbar CSF samples in a study of human idiopathic low back pain. A Protein-Plus Dodeca Cell electrophoresis apparatus and PDQuest software were used to measure the level of between-gel reproducibility of the CSF proteome. One pooled CSF sample was used to evaluate the level of within-sample, between-gel reproducibility, and a set of seven different CSF samples (CSF-1 to 7) was used to test the level of within-group and between-group variability. Differentially expressed proteins (six CSF samples versus the designated control, CSF-3) were characterized with mass spectrometry. The number of spots found in the pooled CSF sample was 490 +/- 30 (n = 10 gels); the percentage of protein spots found in those 10 gels was 92 +/- 6%, with a coefficient of variation of 6%; and a positive coefficient of correlation (r = 0.82) was found. In order to test the proof-of-principle, that set of seven CSF samples served as a test of our ability to perform reproducibility comparative proteomics, and to detect differentially expressed proteins within that set of test samples. One sample (CSF-3) served as the control for the other six to locate the differentially expressed proteins. A comparison of fifteen differentially expressed proteins found in that set of test CSF samples correlated with pathology. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight and electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry were used to characterize thirteen of those fifteen differentially expressed proteins. These results (reproducibility, protein characterization, set of test samples, and proof-of-principle) suggest that the analysis of human CSF two-dimensional gels can achieve a high level of within-sample and between-sample reproducibility, and that PDQuest software can measure the relative protein abundance in the human CSF proteome.",

However, the study of this complex process is often hampered by the lack of a suitable cell-based model and the tools to study the biochemical events that lead to new blood vessel growth. The most widely accepted model for angiogenesis is the in vivo rat corneal model. In this model, the cornea, which is normally an avascular tissue, is stimulated to undergo angiogenesis in response to silver nitrate cauterization or to the implantation of an exogenous angiogenic agent. The physical changes associated with the new vessel growth can be readily monitored visually, but the regulated biochemical events that result in the growth and remodeling of the new vessels are much more challenging to decipher. In this report, a proteomics approach is evaluated for its utility in deciphering the biochemical events during a time course of angiogenic stimulation. At various time points post-silver nitrate cautery, corneas were harvested, solubilized, and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Protein expression profiles at the various stages of angiogenesis were compared to those of control corneas. One hundred and eleven differentially-expressed proteins were identified by either matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-coupled electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Many of the proteins up-regulated during the angiogenesis process were identified as blood-related proteins, thus validating the development of functional blood vessels in the normally avascular tissue of the cornea. Furthermore, detection of differentially-regulated proteins in cauterized versus control tissue clearly validated the utility of a proteomics approach to study this model of angiogenesis. However, in order to get at the key regulatory proteins in the angiogenesis process, it is clear that additional scale-up and enrichment approaches will be required.",

However, the relationship between gene expressions and onset of diseases often remains obscure. The great advances in protein microarrays allow us to investigate this unclear question through protein profiles, which are regarded as more reliable than gene expressions to serve as the harbinger of disease onset or as the biomarker of disease treatment monitoring. We review two relatively new platforms of protein arrays, along with an introduction to the common basis of protein array technologies. Immobilization of proteins on the surface of arrays and neutralizing reactive areas after the immobilization are key practical issues in the field of protein array. One of the emerging protein array technologies is the magneto-nanosensor array where giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors are used to quantitatively measure analyte of interest which are labeled with magnetic nanoparticles (MNP). Similar to GMR, several different ways of utilizing magnetic properties for biomolecular detection have been developed and are reviewed here. Another emerging protein array technology is Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Arrays (NAPPA), which have thousands of protein features directly expressed by nucleic acids on array surface. We anticipate these two emerging protein array platforms can be combined to produce synergistic benefits and open new applications in proteomics and clinical diagnostics.",

MS-based approaches employing targeted proteomic strategies provide not only a sensitive, but in addition a precise quantification tool, which is versatile, systematic, and scalable. Its capability of multiplexing hundreds of targets facilitate a cost-effective and rapid evaluation and is especially useful during the early stage of the process where a large list of candidate biomarkers must be triaged before entering validation studies. The robustness requirement for the methods also mandates a high degree of selectivity to analyze complex clinical samples. Improvement in the selectivity of LC-MS methods has been achieved by adopting high-resolution and high-accuracy mass analyzers to perform quantitative analyses with a novel method called parallel reaction monitoring.

Previously, differential - antibody-based - serum analysis has yielded information on the proteins released from platelets upon stimulation. A promising alternative strategy is formed by identifying the proteins released by freshly isolated platelets from blood using proteomics. Here we report on the analysis of the thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP)-induced releasate from 3 different volunteers using high resolution, high mass accuracy hybrid LTQ-FT mass spectrometry in a GeLC-MS/MS workflow. We obtained an activated platelet releasate proteome comprising a total of 716 identified proteins with 225 proteins present in the releasate of 3/3 volunteers. This core dataset is characterized by gene ontology mining and signal peptide analysis. Meta-analysis of our dataset and two published datasets of platelet a-granules and microparticles reveals that 55% of our platelet releasate proteins can be annotated using these previous platelet subproteome data, of the remaining releasate proteome 5% overlaps with a published platelet secretome while 40% of our data consists of novel releasate proteins. This high-accuracy activated platelet releasate proteome represents the largest and most comprehensive analysis to date. This approach offers unique possibilities to analyse the role of platelet-secreted proteins in physiology and in diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However a survey of proteomics journals shows that such tests are not widely implemented in one commonly used technique, quantitative proteomics using two-dimensional electrophoresis. We outline a selection of multiple hypothesis testing methods, including some that are well known and some lesser known, and present a simple strategy for their use by the experimental scientist in quantitative proteomics work generally. The strategy focuses on the desirability of simultaneous use of several different methods, the choice and emphasis dependent on research priorities and the results in hand.

The principal aim of this study was to find differences in protein expression between patients with NAFLD and healthy controls. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Changes in protein expression of liver samples from each of the three groups of subjects, controls, non-alcoholic steatosis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), were analyzed by DIGE combined with MALDI TOF/TOF analysis, a proteomic approach that allows to compare hundreds of proteins simultaneously. RESULTS: Forty-three proteins exhibiting significant changes (ratio >/=1.5, p<0.05) were characterized, 22 comparing steatosis samples versus control samples and 21 comparing NASH versus control samples. Ten of these proteins were further analyzed by Western blot in tissue samples to confirm the observed changes of protein expression using DIGE. The proteins validated were further tested in serum samples of different cohorts of patients. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Following this approach we identified two candidate markers, carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1 and 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, differentially expressed between control and NASH. This proteomics approach demonstrates that DIGE combined with MALDI TOF/TOF and Western blot analysis of tissue and serum samples is a useful approach to identify candidate markers associated with NAFLD, resulting in proteins whose level of expression can be correlated to a disease state.",

The technology merges a tissue-specific polyclonal antiserum with a cDNA library expression cloning system. The tissue-specific antiserum is subtracted with protein extracts from control tissues to remove those antibodies that recognize common antigenic proteins. Then, the depleted antiserum is used to expression clone tissue-specific proteins from a cDNA library expressed in mammalian cells. The methodology was evaluated with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum prepared against purified bovine brain capillaries. The antiserum was absorbed with acetone powders of liver and kidney and then used to screen a bovine brain capillary cDNA library in COS cells. The initial clone detected with this expression methodology was the Lutheran membrane glycoprotein, which is specifically expressed at the brain microvasculature compared with liver and kidney tissues.

In this study, we could identify CypA as a protein undergoing glutathionylation in vivo. Using MALDI-MS we identified Cys52 and Cys62 as targets of glutathionylation in T lymphocytes, and, using bioinformatic tools, we defined the reasons for the susceptibility of these residues to the modification. In addition, we found by circular dichroism spectroscopy that glutathionylation has an important impact on the secondary structure of CypA. Finally, we suggest that glutathionylation of CypA may have biological implications and that CypA may play a key role in redox regulation of immunity.",

Proteome analysis has already become a routine task in biomedical research with the emergence of proteomics core facilities in most research institutions. Post-translational modifications (PTM) represent a mechanism by which complex biological processes are orchestrated dynamically at the systems level. MS is rapidly becoming popular to discover new modifications and novel sites of known PTMs, revolutionizing the current understanding of diverse signaling pathways and biological processes. However, MS-based analysis of PTMs has its own caveats and pitfalls that can lead to erroneous conclusions. Here, we review the most common errors in MS-based PTM analyses with the goal of adopting strategies that maximize correct interpretation in the context of biological questions that are being addressed. Finally, we provide suggestions that should help mass spectrometrists, bioinformaticians and biologists to perform and interpret MS-based PTM analyses more accurately.

Furthermore, the quantification is simultaneously performed and 100% quantification coverage is achieved by PISA since each of the identified PSMs has several pairs of fragment ions which could be used for quantification. Then the PISA was applied to the relative quantification of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with high and low metastatic potentials prepared by an IPTL strat This article is protected by copyright.

The inclusion of a stable isotope label allows the samples to be combined before sample preparation and analysis, thus avoiding many of the sources of variability that can plague spectral counting. To validate the SPeCtRA method, we have analyzed samples constructed with known ratios of protein abundance. Finally, we used SPeCtRA to compare endothelial cell protein abundances between high (20 mM) and low (11 mM) glucose culture conditions. Our results demonstrate that SPeCtRA is a protein quantification technique that is accurate and sensitive as well as easy to automate and apply to high-throughput analysis of complex biological samples.",

It combines the features of blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) and continuous elution electrophoresis (CEE), generating liquid-phase fractions of protein complexes of up to 800 kDa. The resulting complexes can be further analysed by BN-PAGE, by SDS-PAGE and/or by MS. This can help define the constituent proteins of many complexes and their stoichiometry. As BN-CEE is also micropreparative, with a capacity to separate milligram quantities of protein complexes, it will assist the study of proteins of lower abundance. In this regard, the acrylamide concentration and elution rate during separation can be controlled to help 'zoom in' on particular high mass regions and thus complexes of interest.

With the increased mass accuracy it becomes much easier to match mass chromatograms in replicates and different sample types, even if compounds are detected at very low intensities. The proposed method exploits the ubiquitous presence of background ions in LC-MS profiles for accurate alignment and internal mass calibration, making it applicable for all types of MS equipment.

The rate and extent of this reaction depends on the sugar content of the sample, the efficiency of lyophilization process, the residual water content of the material and the storage temperature. Lyophilization is a cheap, practical and safe alternative for the storage and transportation of samples prior to protein extraction, separation and quantification via 2DE, when care is taken (i) to dry the samples to the lowest practicable moisture content, (ii) to transport and store them under water- and airtight conditions and (iii) to avoid heating of the sample.",

This involved incorporation of two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis and protein identification by a combination of N-terminal sequencing, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis and cross species database matching. From these identifications a CHO 2-D reference map and annotated database have been established. Metabolic labelling and subsequent autoradiography showed the induction of a number of cellular proteins in response to the media additives butyrate and zinc sulphate. These were identified as GRP75, enolase and thioredoxin. The chaperone proteins GRP78, HSP90, GRP94 and HSP70 were not up-regulated under these conditions.",

We found that rainbow trout spermatozoa are equipped with functionally diverse proteins related to energetic metabolism, signal transduction, protein turnover, transport, cytoskeleton, oxidative injuries, and stress and reproduction. The availability of a catalog of rainbow trout sperm proteins provides a crucial tool for the understanding of fundamental molecular processes in fish spermatozoa, for the ongoing development of novel markers of sperm quality and for the optimization of short- and long-term sperm preservation procedures.

The examination of several of these theoretical proteome plots has revealed a multimodal pI distribution, however, no conclusive explanation for this unusual distribution has so far been presented.

The proteins were separated by large (30 cm) sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after digestion of 100 gel slices with trypsin. The molecular masses of the individual gel slices were calculated through the known theoretical masses of the identified proteins. Proteins were defined as degradation candidates if either the empirical determined molecular mass was at most 80% of the theoretical value, or if proteins were identified in clearly different gel slices. In this manner, the degradation of 11 already identified apoptosis-modified proteins was confirmed and nine until now unknown degradation candidate proteins identified. Degradation during apoptosis must be verified by additional techniques such as in vitro caspase assays as shown for nucleolin and Rho GDI 2.

In this concept paper, we focus on some critical issues arising from basic proteomics investigation in order to highlight some key elements of CSF quality control. Furthermore we propose a direct assessment of sample quality (DASQ) by applying a fast MALDI-TOF-MS methodology to evaluate molecular features of sample degradation and oxidation. We propose DASQ as a fast and simple initial step to be included in large-scale projects for neurological biomarkers studies. In fact, such a procedure will improved the development of standardized protocols in order to have well-characterized CSF biobanks. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved",

The different treatments caused distinct changes to the rat liver proteome. Many of the protein changes could be associated with the known pharmacological and toxicological mechanisms of action of these drugs, whereas for other proteins, the rationale behind the alterations was less obvious. Furthermore, these changes can be used to classify the treatments with a view to utilising them as 'molecular signatures' to further our understanding of less well studied drugs such as SKF-106686 (an adrenoreceptor agonist). This approach has the potential for opening up new avenues for the exploration of molecular mechanisms of toxicity.

To correlate behavioral alterations with changes on the molecular level, we explored the (15)N isotope effect on the brain proteome by comparing protein expression levels between (15)N-labeled and (14)N HAB mouse brains using quantitative MS. By implementing two complementary in silico pathway analysis approaches, we were able to identify altered networks in (15)N-labeled HAB mice, including major metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.

Here, we describe a novel methodology for the on resin deglycosylation and cysteine modification of proteins after in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo biotinylation. Biotinylated proteins are captured on streptavidin resin and all subsequent modifications, as well as the proteolytic digestion, which yields peptides for MS analysis, are performed on resin. Using biotinylated bovine fetuin-A as a test protein, an improvement in sequence coverage from 7.9 to 58.7% could be shown, including the identification of all three glycosylation sites. Furthermore, a complex mixture derived from the ex vivo biotinylation of vascular structures in human kidney with cancer obtained by perfusion after surgical resection revealed almost a doubling of sequence coverage for all checked proteins when analyzed by LC-MALDI TOF/TOF.",

        "abstract": "Peptide and peptidomimetic molecule arrays are emerging powerful tools for parallel screening of binding in proteomics and pharmaceutical discovery research. Up to now the common method of preparing peptide arrays was based on spotting on glass using a library of presynthesized peptides. However, due to the large number of monomers (amino acids) it is not possible to have combinatorial libraries which include all combinations of natural and synthetic amino acids. We describe a very flexible on-chip oligopeptide synthesis method which uses the well developed t-Boc based solid state synthesis chemistry. A very high degree of flexibility is achieved by using light photo generated acids and maskless projection lithography for spatially directed deprotection. Use of microfluidic chips enables moderately high densities, short reaction times and off-the-shelf chemicals. Examples are given from synthesis of metal ion binding peptides and epitope binding assays.",

        "abstract": "The term \"proteomics\" encompasses the large-scale detection and analysis of proteins and their post-translational modifications. Driven by major improvements in mass spectrometric instrumentation, methodology, and data analysis, the proteomics field has burgeoned in recent years. It now provides a range of sensitive and quantitative approaches for measuring protein structures and dynamics that promise to revolutionize our understanding of cell biology and molecular mechanisms in both human cells and model organisms. The Proteomics Specification in Time and Space (PROSPECTS) Network is a unique EU-funded project that brings together leading European research groups, spanning from instrumentation to biomedicine, in a collaborative five year initiative to develop new methods and applications for the functional analysis of cellular proteins. This special issue of Molecular and Cellular Proteomics presents 16 research papers reporting major recent progress by the PROSPECTS groups, including improvements to the resolution and sensitivity of the Orbitrap family of mass spectrometers, systematic detection of proteins using highly characterized antibody collections, and new methods for absolute as well as relative quantification of protein levels. Manuscripts in this issue exemplify approaches for performing quantitative measurements of cell proteomes and for studying their dynamic responses to perturbation, both during normal cellular responses and in disease mechanisms. Here we present a perspective on how the proteomics field is moving beyond simply identifying proteins with high sensitivity toward providing a powerful and versatile set of assay systems for characterizing proteome dynamics and thereby creating a new \"third generation\" proteomics strategy that offers an indispensible tool for cell biology and molecular medicine.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Urinary proteomics has become a key discipline within clinical proteomics for noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of disease, and biomarker discovery. In order to decipher complex proteomes, high demands will, however, be placed upon the methodology applied. The purpose of this study was to develop a recombinant antibody microarray platform for urinary proteomics. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We adopted our previously in-house developed recombinant antibody microarray set-up and redesigned the platform for urinary proteomics. In this process, the key antibody array assay parameters, such as sample handling, sample labeling protocol, and assay conditions, etc, reflecting the unique properties of urine as sample format, were addressed and reoptimized in a step-by-step procedure. RESULTS: In this proof-of-concept study, we have designed the first generation of a recombinant antibody microarray technology platform for urinary proteomics. The results showed that multiplexed, sensitive (pg/mL range), and reproducible urine protein expression profiling could be performed targeting directly labeled, nonfractionated urine. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We have demonstrated that crude, directly labeled urine samples could be profiled in a rapid, reproducible, sensitive, and multiplexed manner after minimal sample prehandling. These findings could potentially pave the way for enhanced urinary proteomics and understanding of renal physiology with implications in both health and disease.",
