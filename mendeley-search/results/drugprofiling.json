The great increase in the number of samples screened has been accompanied by increases in costs and in the data required for the investigated compounds. High throughput profiling addresses the issues of compound selectivity and specificity. It combines conventional screening with data mining technologies to give a full set of data, enabling development candidates to be more fully compared."

Statistical approach to compare illicit drug seizures is also presented with the introduction of different scenarios dealing with different data pre-treatment or transformation of variables.The main aim consists to demonstrate the influence of data pre-treatment on the statistical outputs. A thorough study of the evolution of the true positive rate (TP) and the false positive rate (FP) in heroin and cocaine comparison is then proposed to investigate this specific topic and to demonstrate that there is no universal approach available and that the calculations have to be revaluate for each new specific application. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: The recent development of high-throughput drug profiling (high content screening or HCS) provides a large amount of quantitative multidimensional data. Despite its potentials, it poses several challenges for academia and industry analysts alike. This is especially true for ranking the effectiveness of several drugs from many thousands of images directly. This paper introduces, for the first time, a new framework for automatically ordering the performance of drugs, called fractional adjusted bi-partitional score (FABS). This general strategy takes advantage of graph-based formulations and solutions and avoids many shortfalls of traditionally used methods in practice. We experimented with FABS framework by implementing it with a specific algorithm, a variant of normalized cut-normalized cut prime (FABS-NC(')), producing a ranking of drugs. This algorithm is known to run in polynomial time and therefore can scale well in high-throughput applications.\\n\\nRESULTS: We compare the performance of FABS-NC(') to other methods that could be used for drugs ranking. We devise two variants of the FABS algorithm: FABS-SVM that utilizes support vector machine (SVM) as black box, and FABS-Spectral that utilizes the eigenvector technique (spectral) as black box. We compare the performance of FABS-NC(') also to three other methods that have been previously considered: center ranking (Center), PCA ranking (PCA), and graph transition energy method (GTEM). The conclusion is encouraging: FABS-NC(') consistently outperforms all these five alternatives. FABS-SVM has the second best performance among these six methods, but is far behind FABS-NC('): In some cases FABS-NC(') produces over half correctly predicted ranking experiment trials than FABS-SVM.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY: The system and data for the evaluation reported here will be made available upon request to the authors after this manuscript is accepted for publication."

        "abstract": "Drug screening and profiling is an important phase in drug discovery, development, and marketing. However, some profiling tests are not routinely done because of the needed additional technical skills and costly maintenance, which leads to cases of unexpected side effects or adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This study presents the design and operation of a microfluidic chip for single-cell level drug screening and profiling as an alternative platform for this purpose. Centrifugation was utilized to trap isolated single and groups of primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in the same chip. In the off-spin operation of the chip, the cells can be observed under a microscope and movies of the beat motion can be recorded. The beat profiles of the cells were generated by image correlation analysis of the recorded video to study the contractile characteristics (beating rate, beating strength, and inter-beat duration). By utilizing this non-invasive tool, long term continuous monitoring, right after trapping, was made possible and cell growth and dynamics were successfully observed in the chip. Media and liquid replacement does not require further centrifugation but instead utilizes capillary flow only. The effect of carbachol (100 \u03bcM) and isoproterenol (4 \u03bcg mL\u22121) on single cells and groups of cells was demonstrated and the feature for immunostaining (\u03b2-actin) applicability of the chip was revealed. Furthermore, these findings can be helpful for the headway of non-invasive profiling of cardiomyocytes and for future chip design and operation of high-throughput lab-on-a-chip devices."

        "abstract": "Acquired drug resistance is a key factor in the failure of chemotherapy. Due to intratumoral heterogeneity, cancer cells depict variations in intracellular drug uptake and efflux at the single cell level, which may not be detectable in bulk assays. In this study we present a droplet microfluidics-based approach to assess the dynamics of drug uptake, efflux and cytotoxicity in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant breast cancer cells. An integrated droplet generation and docking microarray was utilized to encapsulate single cells as well as homotypic cell aggregates. Drug-sensitive cells showed greater death in the presence or absence of Doxorubicin (Dox) compared to the drug-resistant cells. We observed heterogeneous Dox uptake in individual drug-sensitive cells while the drug-resistant cells showed uniformly low uptake and retention. Dox-resistant cells were classified into distinct subsets based on their efflux properties. Cells that showed longer retention of extracellular reagents also demonstrated maximal death. We further observed homotypic fusion of both cell types in droplets, which resulted in increased cell survival in the presence of high doses of Dox. Our results establish the applicability of this microfluidic platform for quantitative drug screening in single cells and multicellular interactions."

        "abstract": "We investigated the molecular effects of glucosamine supplements, a popular and safe alternative to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for decreasing pain, inflammation, and maintaining healthy joints. Numerous studies have reported an array of molecular effects after glucosamine treatment. We questioned whether the differences in the effects observed in previous studies were associated with the focus on a specific subproteome or with the use of specific cell lines or tissues. To address this question, global mass spectrometry- and transcription array-based glucosamine drug profiling was performed on malignant cell lines from different stages of lymphocyte development. We combined global label-free MS-based protein quantitation with an open search for modifications to obtain the best possible proteome coverage. Our data were largely consistent with previous studies in a variety of cellular models. We mainly observed glucosamine induced O-GlcNAcylation/O-GalNAcylation (O-HexNAcylation); however, we also observed global and local changes in acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation. For example, our data provides two additional examples of \"yin-yang\" between phosphorylation and O-HexNAcylation. Furthermore, we mapped novel O-HexNAc sites on GLU2B and calnexin. GLU2B and calnexin are known to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in protein folding and quality control. The O-HexNAc sites were regulated by glucosamine treatment and correlated with the up-regulation of the ER stress marker GRP78. The occupancy of O-HexNAc on GLU2B and calnexin sites differed between the cytosolic and nuclear fractions with a higher occupancy in the cytosolic fraction. Based on our data we propose the hypothesis that O-HexNAc either inactivates calnexin and/or targets it to the cytosolic fraction. Further, we hypothesize that O-HexNAcylation induced by glucosamine treatment enhances protein trafficking."

Comparison of the 5 position-specific D/H values of l-ephedrine/HCl and d-pseudoephedrine/HCl prepared by three methods (chemical synthesis, semichemical synthesis, and biosynthesis) showed that chemically synthesized ephedrines and semi-synthetic ephedrines have highly specific distributions of deuterium at the methine position and at the benzyl position, compared with the other positions. The classification of several methamphetamine samples seized in Japan in terms of the D/H values at these two positions clearly showed that the methamphetamine samples had been synthesized from ephedrines extracted from Ephedra plants or semisynthetic ephedrines but not from synthetic ephedrine.

The identification of effective drug combinations for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was achieved by integrating high-content screening, computational analysis, and experimental biology. The approach was based on altered cellular phenotypes induced by 55 FDA-approved drugs and biologically active compounds, acquired using fluorescence microscopy and retained in multivariate compound profiles. Dissimilarities between compound profiles guided the identification of 5 combinations, which were assessed for qualitative interaction on TNBC cell growth. The combination of the microtubule-targeting drug vinblastine with KSP/Eg5 motor protein inhibitors monastrol or ispinesib showed potent synergism in 3 independent TNBC cell lines, which was not substantiated in normal fibroblasts. The synergistic interaction was mediated by an increase in mitotic arrest with cells demonstrating typical ispinesib-induced monopolar mitotic spindles, which translated into enhanced apoptosis induction. The antitumour activity of the combination vinblastine/ispinesib was confirmed in an orthotopic mouse model of TNBC. Compared to single drug treatment, combination treatment significantly reduced tumour growth without causing increased toxicity. Image-based profiling and analysis led to the rapid discovery of a drug combination effective against TNBC invitro and invivo, and has the potential to lead to the development of new therapeutic options in other hard-to-treat cancers."

Using a fluorescence assay of ASP+ uptake in cells stably expressing MATE1, over 900 prescription drugs were screened and 84 potential MATE1 inhibitors were found. We identified several MATE1 selective inhibitors including four FDA-approved medications that may be clinically relevant MATE1 inhibitors and could cause a clinical DDI.

This work introduces a computational screening approach which provides a tool for extensive screening that uses experimentally obtained small-scale profiles as input data and makes predictions for a larger kinase set. These predictions result from a propagation of the reduced profile, exploiting a structural comparison of kinases based on a feature-similarity matrix. The comparison focuses on a molecular marker for specificity and promiscuity of kinase inhibitors. Our approach enables the computational high-throughput screening of entire libraries of compounds to search for suitable leads, mapping their inhibitory impact on a sizable sample of the human kinome. Our in silico tool is validated by contrasting predictions against reported high-throughput screening experiments."

        "abstract": "In the present study, we successfully downscaled, for the first time, the in situ intestinal perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling from rat to mouse. To evaluate the feasibility of this approach, we assessed the apparent permeability (P(app)) of mouse intestine for a set of marker compounds [atenolol, paracellular transport; metoprolol, transcellular transport; talinolol, P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux] in both wild-type and P-gp-deficient mice. In wild-type mice, the observed P(app) values for atenolol (1.8 +/- 0.3 x 10(-6) cm/s) and metoprolol (50.2 +/- 20.1 x 10(-6) cm/s) were not significantly affected by inclusion of the P-gp inhibitor verapamil. In contrast, the P(app) value for talinolol (0.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(-6) cm/s) increased 5-fold in the presence of verapamil. The similarity between these values and previously determined P(app) values in rats indicates comparable passive barrier functions and P-gp-mediated efflux transport between mice and rats. In comparison with wild-type mice, the apparent permeability in P-gp-deficient mdr1a/1b(-/-) mice was significantly altered for talinolol (7-fold increase) but not for atenolol or metoprolol. Because of the availability of knockout mice, the intestinal perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling in mice may become an important tool to elucidate the role of intestinal metabolism and active transport in drug absorption during preclinical drug evaluation."

Using an integrated approach, we uncovered distinct mutation, gene expression and drug response profiles in TCF3-HLF-positive and treatment-responsive TCF3-PBX1-positive ALL. We identified recurrent intragenic deletions of PAX5 or VPREB1 in constellation with the fusion of TCF3 and HLF. Moreover somatic mutations in the non-translocated allele of TCF3 and a reduction of PAX5 gene dosage in TCF3-HLF ALL suggest cooperation within a restricted genetic context. The enrichment for stem cell and myeloid features in the TCF3-HLF signature may reflect reprogramming by TCF3-HLF of a lymphoid-committed cell of origin toward a hybrid, drug-resistant hematopoietic state. Drug response profiling of matched patient-derived xenografts revealed a distinct profile for TCF3-HLF ALL with resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics but sensitivity to glucocorticoids, anthracyclines and agents in clinical development. Striking on-target sensitivity was achieved with the BCL2-specific inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199). This integrated approach thus provides alternative treatment options for this deadly disease."

        "abstract": "A liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric strategy for systematic toxicological analysis (STA) is presented using the automatic 'on-the-fly' single mass spectrometry mode to tandem mass spectrometry mode (MS to MS/MS) switching abilities of a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) instrument. During the chromatographic run, the quadrupole is initially set to transmit all masses until (an) ion(s) reaches a certain set threshold. Thereupon, the quadrupole automatically switches to the MS/MS mode, selecting the ion(s), which are subsequently fragmented in the high-efficiency hexapole collision cell, thus generating product ions that are further mass analyzed by the TOF. By limiting the TOF spectral accumulation time in the MS/MS mode to a statistically acceptable minimum, the quadrupole almost instantly switches back to the MS mode. Qualitative information, comprising the complementary MS ([M + H](+) ion mass) and MS/MS (informative product ion profile) data, as well as quantitative information obtained by integration of the MS extracted ion chromatogram(s), can be obtained in one single acquisition. Optimization of the automatic switching parameters, such as threshold, TOF spectral accumulation time, detection window and collision energy, was carried out by injection of a mix of 17 common drugs which were not necessarily baseline separated in the chromatographic system used. Indeed, the complete separation of the drugs is not deemed necessary since up to 8 different ions can 'simultaneously' be selected for MS/MS if they reach the preset criteria. In addition, the quantitative performance of the method was defined. In a second phase, the developed method was field-tested. To that end, the resulting data from extracts of urine samples were compared with and found to be in close concordance with those obtained by a standard toxicological analysis. This innovative approach clearly holds the potential for a substantial advance in the introduction of LC/MS in STA."

Structural analysis exam- ines the coherence of the combination of behaviours in the account based against the co- occurrence of behaviours in genuine accounts. Three analyses compared 142 genuine rape with 30 simulated statements in terms of the base rates of behaviours reported within the statements, and in terms of the behavioural coherence of each statement to an established behavioural structure. Results suggest that genuine statements tend to report a larger total number of behaviours than simulated statements; that pseudo-intimate behaviours are significantly more often reported in genuine statements while some violent behaviours are more frequently reported in simulated statements; and that simulated statements are less behaviourally coherent than genuine statements. We concede the many limitations of the study but argue that results provide tentative evidence that false claimants, not fully appreciating the phenomenological experience of rape, overemphasise the significance of violent and demeaning behaviour whilst underplaying the significance of pseudo-intimate behaviour."

        "abstract": "The issue of 'criminal profiling' is one with which most of us are familiar. Its recent appearances inthe media have certainly raised the profile of criminal psychology and a number of students are keento work in this area. \"Numerous TV programmes and documentaries have also in recent timesfocused around the assertion of criminal profiling, including Millennium, profiler and even TheX-Files\" (Muller, 2000:234). Unfortunately, the media portrayal of criminal profiling has often beenfar from accurate. The basic reason for this is because they have a tendency to imply that profiling isa perfect skill to some extent comparable to a precognitive clairvoyant capability (Muller, 2000). As aresult of the general popularity of criminal profiling, much has been written on this topic and acomprehensive review of the literature is beyond the scope of this paper (Muller, 2000). Profiling hasits proponents among those who understand the process and have had successful experiences withit (Ault et al., 1994; Douglas and Burgess 1986; Douglas et al., 1986; Geberth, 1996). Theunderstanding of profiling as an investigative technique is still not well known by many lawenforcement professionals including criminologists, and behavioural scientist (Cook and Hinman,1999). According to different authors including forensic psychologist and FBI-trained profiler,criminal profiling can be a very useful tool in the investigation of very violent crime. The presentdevelopment of criminal profiling has been said to be more art than science. \"Most criminal profilinguses information drawn from forensic and behavioural science, but the scientific merit of profilinghas not yet been demonstrated in a systematic fashion\" (Cook and Hanman, 1999: 231)."

Greater benefits can be expected from the application of these technologies on a significantly larger scale; by simultaneously collecting diverse measurements from the same subjects or cell cultures; by exploiting the steadily improving quantitative accuracy of the technologies; and by interpreting the emerging data in the context of underlying biological models of increasing sophistication. The benefits of applying molecular profiling to drug discovery and development will include much lower failure rates at all stages of the drug development pipeline, faster progression from discovery through to clinical trials and more successful therapies for patient subgroups. Upheavals in existing organizational structures in the current 'conveyor belt' models of drug discovery might be required to take full advantage of these methods."

        "abstract": "Drug metabolism studies, together with pathologic and histologic evaluation, provide critical data sets to help understand mechanisms underlying drug-related hepatotoxicity. A common practice is to trace morphologic changes resulting from liver injury back to perturbation of biochemical processes and to identify drug metabolites that affect those processes as possible culprits. This strategy can be illustrated in efforts of elucidating the cause of acetaminophen-, troglitazone- and valproic acid-induced hepatic necrosis, microvesicular steatosis and cholestasis with the aid of information from qualitative and quantitative analysis of metabolites. From a pharmaceutical research perspective, metabolite profiling represents an important function because a structure-activity relationship is essential to rational drug design. In addition, drugs are known to induce idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity, which usually escapes the detection by preclinical safety assessment and clinical trials. This issue is addressed, at present, by eliminating those molecules that are prone to metabolic bioactivation, based on the concept that formation of electrophilic metabolites triggers covalent protein modification and subsequent organ toxicity. Although pragmatic, such an approach has its limitations as a linear correlation does not exist between toxicity and the extent of bioactivation. It may be possible in the future that the advance of proteomics, metabonomics and genomics would pave the way leading to personalized medication in which beneficial effect of a drug is maximized, whereas toxicity risk is minimized."

Although fundamental to the initiation and progression of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis and malaria, in many cases their precise role remains unknown. Activity-based chemical proteomics-an emerging field involving a combination of organic synthesis, biochemistry, cell biology, biophysics and bioinformatics-allows the detection, visualisation and activity quantification of whole families or selected sub-sets of proteases based upon their substrate specificity. This approach can be applied for drug target/lead identification and validation, the fundamentals of drug discovery. The activity-based probes discussed in this review contain three key features; a 'warhead' (binds irreversibly but selectively to the active site), a 'tag' (allowing enzyme 'handling', with a combination of fluorescent, affinity and/or radio labels), and a linker region between warhead and tag. From the design and synthesis of the linker arise some of the latest developments discussed here; not only can the physical properties (e.g., solubility, localisation) of the probe be tuned, but the inclusion of a cleavable moiety allows selective removal of tagged enzyme from affinity beads etc. The design and synthesis of recently reported probes is discussed, including modular assembly of highly versatile probes via solid phase synthesis. Recent applications of activity-based protein profiling to specific proteases (serine, threonine, cysteine and metalloproteases) are reviewed as are demonstrations of their use in the study of disease function in cancer and malaria."

In combination with an assessment of physicochemical and in vitro properties, the in vivo PK protocol described provides better mechanistic understanding of the PK behaviour of a compound or class of compounds. The higher level of interpretation and use of in vitro and in vivo data better describe the disposition properties and give an estimation of the biophase concentration of the drug, providing a clear guidance for the design of higher quality molecules. Moreover, the collection of a broader set of in vivo and in vitro PK data improves the predictability of the DMPK science and it can allow an integrated safety risk assessment."

While this has been a fruitful approach for the past 50 years, the great majority of receptors have now been identified and targeted. Drug discovery is moving into a different phase which will involve a much greater range of potential targets. These new approaches bring their own challenges for drug developers. The impact of these changes on the traditional scheme of drug development is discussed. The UK and EU regulatory framework for the licensing of drugs has changed substantially in recent years. The key concepts and interplay of regulatory bodies and advisory committees is explained.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug repositioning is a current strategy to find new uses for existing drugs, patented or not, and for late-stage candidates that failed for lack of efficacy. RESULTS: In silico profiling of several marketed drugs (methadone, rapamycin, saquinavir and telmisartan) was performed, exploiting a vast amount of published information. Similar compounds were assessed in terms of target-activity profiles for major drug-target families. In silico profiles were visualized within an interactive heat map and detailed analysis was performed associated with the accessible current knowledge. CONCLUSION: Based on a basic principle assuming that similar molecules share similar target activity, new potential targets and, therefore, opportunities of potential new indications have been identified and discussed."

        "abstract": "Measuring target coverage of small molecule inhibitors is paramount-first, for selection of molecules to progress through the drug development process and second, once a candidate drug moves to clinical testing, for guiding dose/schedule selection. Single cell network profiling (SCNP) using multiparameter flow cytometry can measure compound effects on multiple signaling cascades in a cell-type-specific manner. We applied SCNP to a panel of compounds with reported inhibitory effects on Jak/Stat signaling using a novel system where modulation of multiple signaling cascades are simultaneously measured in discrete cell subsets in whole (ie, unfractionated) blood. Jak2 vs. Jak3 selectivity as well as \"off-target\" effects on other cell signaling pathways were measured using a combination of cytokines that target different white blood cell subsets, namely GM-CSF (monocytes/granulocytes), IL-2 (T cells), and CD40L (B cells). The compounds were then rank-ordered by potency and selectivity against the different pathways tested. Notably, SCNP performed in whole unfractionated blood compared to fractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the same donors revealed potency loss for all compounds, with one exception. These studies show that SCNP can be used to efficiently measure a drug candidate's potency and selectivity in a physiologically relevant environment (eg, whole blood) and that robust IC(50) are attainable from rare subpopulations (<100 cells). The ability to generate in vitro IC(50) measurements in whole blood can be used not only for the preclinical selection of lead molecules, but also to determine the target plasma concentration for clinical studies and to measure target coverage after drug administration in early phase clinical trials. Knowledge of the compound plasma concentration necessary to achieve biochemical coverage permits rational design of clinical trials based on biologically active dose vs. the traditional maximum tolerated dose (MTD) design, which is better suited for cytotoxic, nontargeted drugs."

These issues are still unresolved; current clinical practice is hampered by the complexity and heterogeneity of anti-tumor drug resistance where multiple cellular, tumor microenvironment and host factors operate simultaneously. The rapid accumulation of genomic and proteomic databases for complex biological systems, such as cancer, together with advances in technology platforms, have paved the way to an increased molecular understanding and prediction of antitumor drug response. The complex phenotype of drug resistance can now be dissected and specific, clinically relevant markers pinpointed. Several microarray studies of genetic patterns from untreated and pre-treated cancers have provided \"fingerprints\" that can predict response to therapeutics. Nevertheless, such approaches require further validation in experimental models and in large clinical trials before their routine clinical use. Moreover, comparative transcriptional profiling alone is unlikely to predict drug sensitivity/resistance, a dynamic process where protein phosphorylation, protein trafficking, and protein-protein interactions with secondary effectors play key roles in the fate of cancer cells following therapeutic stress. Functional proteomics is potentially more predictive, but still faces technical challenges with regards to sampling, tumor heterogeneity, and lack of standardized methodologies. These obstacles are surmountable with current concerted research efforts and availability of powerful high-throughput genomic and proteomic instrumentations, and thus approaches to predict and overcome drug resistance could be rationalized."

Biopartitioning chromatography (BPC) introduces biomembrane-mimetic structures (such as liposome, phospholipid monolayer, micelle, microemulsion, vesicle and bicelle, etc) into chromatographic system, i.e. liquid system or capillary electrophoresis, and thereby emulates drug-membrane interactions difficult to study in the liquid state by well reproducible, rapid, sensitive and adequately designed chromatographic technique. And recently BPC has been becoming a high-throughput screening platform for drug membrane permeability and biological activity. The theoretical basis, classification and application of BPC were summarized based on the latest advances and our recent works.

Both drug and side effects are often governed by interaction of the drug molecule with many, often unrelated, targets. Accordingly, arrays of protein-ligand interaction data from numerous in vitro profiling assays today provide growing evidence of polypharmacological drug interactions, even for marketed drugs. In vitro off-target profiling has therefore become an important tool in early drug discovery to learn about potential off-target liabilities, which are sometimes beneficial, but more often safety relevant. The rapidly developing field of in silico profiling approaches is complementing in vitro profiling. These approaches capitalize from large amounts of biochemical data from multiple sources to be exploited for optimizing undesirable side effects in pharmaceutical research. Therefore, current in silico profiling models are nowadays perceived as valuable tools in drug discovery, and promise a platform to support optimally informed decisions."

The development of drugs that can discriminate between tumor cells and non-malignant cells would improve efficacy and reduce general side effects. Phage display allows identification of specific supramolecular complexes that can target therapeutic compounds or imaging agents, both in vitro and in vivo. The use of phage display to identify molecules expressed on the surface of human cancer cells without bias, as well as to provide initial steps toward identification of a ligand/receptor-based map of the human microvasculature, has broad implications for drug discovery in general, especially for cancer therapy. Objective/method: In this review, we discuss the use of phage display technology as a ligand-directed targeting strategy and its applications to drug discovery. Conclusion: Compared to other existing drug discovery platforms, phage display technology has the advantage to provide valuable clues pointing to target proteins in an unbiased biological context. The result from various display library screenings indicates that in many cases the selected peptide motifs mimic biological ligands. Analysis of peptide motifs targeting a receptor provides a basis for rational drug design of targeted peptidomimetics."

Several aspects of the property-profiling program that should be carefully considered are discussed in this chapter. The conditions of property assays need to be relevant to the environment faced by the compound. It is important to decide which properties are of greatest importance to the organization. Data used for decision-making should be generated using assays that have been well developed. The assay conditions can greatly affect the results. It is important that scientists generating the data fully validate the method against the known properties of well-characterized compounds, and that scientists using the data know how they were generated and discuss with the data generator how particular characteristics of the compounds in their series might affect the assay."

Protein methyltransferases are one of the target classes which have gained attention as potential therapeutic targets after promising results of inhibitors for EZH2 and DOT1L in clinical trials. There are many technologies developed in order to find small molecule inhibitors for protein methyltransferases. However, in contrast to high throughput screening, profiling against different methyltransferases is challenging since each enzyme has a different substrate preference so that it is hard to profile in one assay format. Here, different technologies for methyltransferase assays will be overviewed, and the advantages and disadvantages of each will be discussed."

Areas covered: The author reviews the progress of label-free cell phenotypic and computational approaches in early drug discovery since 2004 and pro- poses a novel paradigm, which combines both approaches. Expert opinion: Label-free cell phenotypic profiling techniques offer an unprecedented and integrated approach to comprehend drug--target inter- actions in their native environments. However, these approaches have disad- vantages associated with the lack of molecular details. Computational approaches, including ligand-, structure- and phenotype-based virtual screens, have become versatile tools in the early drug discovery process. However, these approaches mostly predict the binding of drug molecules to targets of interest and are limited to targets that are either well annotated for ligands or that are structurally resolved. Thus, combining label-free cell phenotypic profiling with computational approaches can provide a potential paradigm to accelerate novel drug discovery by taking advantages of the best of both approaches.

The spread of such advice to police enquiries across the United States in the early 1970s, culminating in its uptake by Special Agents of the FBI in the mid-1970s and the widespread promotion of their ser- vices through the fictional writings of Thomas Harris and others is noted. The development beyond the early application to serial killer investigations, and the focus on psychopathological explanations, to cover the full gamut of crime from, for instance, arson and burglary to terrorism, is briefly reviewed. The consideration of the social psychological processes inherent in criminality as well as the characteristics of indi- vidual offenders also broadens out the concerns of the field. The linking of crimes to a common offender as well as predicting their future actions further widens the range of issues to be dealt with. The many psychological and practical questions raised by these \u2018profiling\u2019activities are summarised. These include questions of inference and prediction, about criminals and their crimes, both about their characteristics and about the spatial patterns of their activ- ities. Related topics concerning the sources of information for both investigators and research are also summarised. These cover the full range from interviewing witnesses to the management of informants. The complexity of information management and inference derivation points to the need to understand investigative decision-making and how it can be supported."

The discovery of safe, effective medications depends critically upon experimental approaches capable of providing high-impact information on the biological effects of drug candidates early in the discovery pipeline. This information can enable reliable lead identification, pharmacological compound differentiation and successful translation of research output into clinically useful therapeutics. The shallow preclinical profiling of candidate compounds promulgates a minimalistic understanding of their biological effects and undermines the level of value creation necessary for finding quality leads worth moving forward within the development pipeline with efficiency and prognostic reliability sufficient to help remediate the current pharma-industry productivity drought. Three specific technologies discussed herein, in addition to experimental areas intimately associated with contemporary drug discovery, appear to hold particular promise for strengthening the preclinical valuation of drug candidates by deepening lead characterization. These are: i) hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry for characterizing structural and ligand-interaction dynamics of disease-relevant proteins; ii) activity-based chemoproteomics for profiling the functional diversity of mammalian proteomes; and iii) nuclease-mediated precision gene editing for developing more translatable cellular and in vivo models of human diseases. When applied in an informed manner congruent with the clinical understanding of disease processes, technologies such as these that span levels of biological organization can serve as valuable enablers of drug discovery and potentially contribute to reducing the current, unacceptably high rates of compound clinical failure."

        "abstract": "Tissue engineering is a newly emerging biomedical form to create a local environment which enables cells to promote the proliferation and differentiation for regeneration induction. The cell-induced regeneration of tissues and organs is achieved by making use of the tissue engineering technology or methodology. Several genetic approaches with virus and non-viral vectors or genetically engineered cells have been attempted to enhance tissue regeneration. The basic idea is to promote the cell proliferation and differentiation as well as the secretion of biological signal molecules for tissue regeneration from cells by gene transfection. For successful gene transfection and expression, it is important to develop drug delivery system (DDS) which allows a therapeutic gene to be delivered specifically to the target cell at an appropriate timing for a certain time period. This paper overviews the recent development of gene-modified tissue engineering, briefly explaining delivery technologies necessary to modulate the efficiency of gene transfection.

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early prediction and accurate characterization of risk for serious liver injury associated with newly marketed drugs remains an important challenge for clinicians, the pharmaceutical industry, and regulators. To date, a biomarker that specifically indicates exposure to a drug as the etiologic cause of liver injury has not been identified.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES: Using cumulative proportional reporting ratios (PRRs), we investigated 'real-time' profiles of a set of pharmaceuticals, over the first 3\u00a0years of US marketing, for the signaling of clinically serious drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in a large spontaneous-reporting database.\\n\\nMETHODS: Using report counts of hepatic failure or clinically serious liver injury obtained from the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) database, PRRs of adverse drug event terms were calculated by division of counts of domestic reports of these events by counts of all serious adverse events for each of 13 selected drugs associated with a broad range of hepatotoxic risk (including three linked to only rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury) with reference to all other drugs in the database. Drug-specific cumulative PRRs were measured at successive intervals (calendar quarters) using cumulative tallies of FAERS reports to generate time-based profiles over the initial 3\u00a0years of US marketing.\\n\\nRESULTS: In the set of drugs analyzed, those with no known hepatotoxic risk demonstrated time-based cumulative PRR profiles that approximate the background rates of hepatic failure and serious liver injury reported in the entire FAERS database. In contrast, those that were removed from marketing or subjected to marketing restrictions due to their potential to cause liver injury were associated with profiles of rapidly rising cumulative PRRs that were greater than 5 within the first 10\u00a0million domestic prescriptions or the first four quarters of US marketing. The systematic tracking and identification of rising PRRs for DILI associated with newly marketed pharmaceutical and biological agents is a valuable tool for identification of safety signals within the FAERS database.\\n\\nLIMITATIONS: Disproportionality profiling of spontaneous reports in FAERS (e.g., cumulative PRR measurements), which signals an association between a recently marketed drug and liver injury, is not a method to quantitatively measure drug-related risk. Regulatory actions in response to emerging drug safety concerns often depend on an accurate assessment of risks using multiple sources of data and the consideration of overall benefits and risks of the agent. Causality must be determined through analysis of individual cases to exclude other etiologies of liver injury.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The FAERS database can be used to advance empiric hepatotoxicity time-trending reporting levels for newly marketed agents in order to rapidly identify recently launched potential hepatotoxic agents and initiate further evaluation."

Although features with rich information can be extracted from fluorescence microscopy images, most current profiling methods build profiles from the extracted features using either univariate or non-automated methods. We propose a new multivariate, automated and scalable method for building drug profiles by using a decision hyperplane. The method was evaluated by using 23 compounds belonging to four groups of known mechanisms. We produced quantitative profiles that group drugs with similar mechanisms together, and separate drugs with dissimilar mechanisms from each other. These profiles resulted in better characterizations of the drug effects than profiles obtained from a previous univariate method"

The critical implication of permeability and solubility is discussed along with the efficient dose of the drug. The concept of dose-solubility number is introduced as a tool for chemists to assess the develop-ability of different molecules very early during discovery stage. Based on this understanding, a rational formulation strategy for preclinical and early clinical phases is provided. The technical considerations and limitations of different formulation technologies are discussed and illustrated via concrete examples. This approach has the advantage of streamlining the formulation process in order to avoid delaying the development of new drugs due to formulation related issues."

        "abstract": "We developed 3 liquid chromatography (LC) methods coupled to tandem mass spectrometry for comprehensive high-throughput profiling of drug metabolism, employing different columns with gradient systems of aqueous 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate and acetonitrile. The methods were established using testosterone (TST), imipramine (IMP), acetaminophen (APAP) and salbutamol (SBM), which have markedly different values of partition coefficient, P. Method I, using an octadecylized silica (ODS) column (ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18) with a steep gradient, was suitable for analyzing TST and its metabolites, and IMP and its metabolites. These substrates could not be analyzed by Method II, using another ODS column (Atlantis dC18), or Method III, using an Atlantis HILIC silica column. APAP and its metabolites could be analyzed simultaneously by Method II, but not Method I or III. SBM and its metabolites could be detected simultaneously only by Method III. The developed analytical methods were further evaluated with a panel of 18 additional drugs. Based on the retention times and peak shapes, we propose general criteria, in terms of calculated LogP (cLogP) value, for method selection. Broadly speaking, drugs with high cLogP, those with intermediate cLogP and those with low cLogP were best analyzed by Methods I, II and III, respectively, although drugs with borderline values of cLogP could be evaluated by both the relevant methods. The injection cycle for each method was within 10 min, including up to 3 min conditioning time. These methods are expected be useful in high-throughput screening assays to examine biotransformations of candidate drugs."

This study focused on micelle binding and solubilization considering bile micelles in the intestinal fluid. Profiling using about 40 launched drugs demonstrated that those in a high solubilization area (area 1) tended to have a positive food effect, and that drugs exhibiting negative/no food effect tended to coexist in a no/low solubilization area (area 2). In area 1, the solubilization effect by bile micelles was demonstrated quantitatively as an important factor that indicates a positive food effect. In area 2, the relative and quantitative relationships among the membrane permeation rate, dissolution rate, micelle binding and food effect could be clarified by simulation. The improvement of membrane permeability and the suppression of micelle binding are considered to be required to avoid a negative food effect. In conclusion, important factors contributing to the food effect were clarified relatively and quantitatively. Data generated from this profiling may be beneficial to find a solution for negative food effects. Furthermore, this risk assessment of food effects is considered to be a useful tool in rational drug design for drug discovery."

        "abstract": "The identification of drug metabolites in biofluids such as urine, plasma and bile is an important step in drug discovery and development. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy can provide detailed information regarding the structural transformation of a compound as a consequence of metabolism. However, successful identification of drug metabolites by (1)H-NMR spectroscopy is generally compromised by the presence of endogenous metabolites, which can obscure the signals of the drug metabolites in question. Hence, sample clean-up and separation of the metabolites from the biofluid matrix is crucial. This is generally achieved by extraction of the biofluid, solid-phase extraction (SPE), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or any combination of these. Apart from (1)H, other NMR-active nuclei, such as (19)F, can provide a useful handle for metabolite profiling, provided they are not naturally present in the biofluid. Successful studies have shown that the presence of a fluorine-handle on the drug and its metabolites can provide additional qualitative and quantitative data by (19)F-NMR spectroscopy. This chapter provides guidelines and examples of NMR-based drug metabolite profiling."

Providing the right drug for the right patient is an important problem in the treatment of cancer. This is mainly due to the lack of information about the sensitivity of the tumor for a specific treatment modality, such as either chemotherapy or radiation treatment. This presentation highlights two approaches to identify responsiveness to treatment. Both approaches are based on the identification of expression profiles. The first approach concentrates on drug resistance and the second on the signaling pathways leading up to the death of the cell. Both approaches provide expression profiles; however, the more dynamic expression profiling as used to determine the signaling in damage cells promises to be a better determinant for the pharmacogenomic changes in expression profiles and, consequently, a potential better determinant for drug efficacy."

A single offender made obscene phone calls to 86 children during the years 1999-2000 in the south of Sweden. The locations in which obscene phone calls were received were analysed in a geographical profiling system (Dragnet) to see whether it could provide a map that showed the most likely area the offender would reside in. The purpose of this study was to explore whether geographical software such as Dragnet can be used by investigators of crimes with no physical crime locations. The result showed that the offender in this case had his home close to the region assigned the highest probability of containing home or base, which indicates that Dragnet can provide maps that can narrow down the search areas for the police in cases without physical crime locations."

Implants are dosage forms that are subcutaneously placed with the aid of surgery or a hypodermic needle, and are designed to release drugs over a prolonged period of time. In most cases, the objective of a release test is to identify sufficiently discriminatory procedures that in turn would provide data to set meaningful specifications. Additional information obtained from successful in vitro-in vivo correlations (IVIVC) and accelerated drug release tests are extremely useful during drug product development. Although several workers have employed different methods to monitor drug release from these dosage forms, the use of the compendial Apparatus 4 (flow-through) device has been recommended in a publication on FIP/AAPS Guidelines for drug release testing of modified release dosage forms. However, most of method development with this device has focused on oral immediate or controlled release dosage forms and little published information is available on implants. Two recent reports on workshops provide useful information on methods to evaluate drug release from controlled-release parenterals such as implants, including IVIVC and accelerated release testing. Details on such studies, however, are generally not found in the literature; possibly because of the high proprietary value of methodologies for establishing release specifications of implant dosage forms. This article reviews the current status of methodologies used in the investigation of drug release from subcutaneous implants with an emphasis on mechanistic, product development and regulatory perspectives."

The present article proposed a novel model of module network rewiring to characterize functional reorganization of a complex biological system, and described a new framework named as module network rewiring-analysis (MNR) for systematically studying dynamical drug sensitivity and resistance during drug treatment. MNR was used to investigate functional reorganization or rewiring on the module network, rather than molecular network or individual molecules. Our experiments on expression data of patients with Hepatitis C virus infection receiving Interferon therapy demonstrated that consistent module genes derived by MNR could be directly used to reveal new genotypes relevant to drug sensitivity, unlike the other differential analyses of gene expressions. Our results showed that functional connections and reconnections among consistent modules bridged by biological paths were necessary for achieving effective responses of a drug. The hierarchical structures of the temporal module network can be considered as spatio-temporal biomarkers to monitor the efficacy, efficiency, toxicity, and resistance of the therapy. Our study indicates that MNR is a useful tool to identify module biomarkers and further predict dynamical drug sensitivity and resistance, characterize complex dynamic processes for therapy response, and provide biologically systematic clues for pharmacogenomic applications."

Nearly half (n = 269) had experienced at least one violent incident in the past year, and 91% had used one or more substances prior to the most recent episode. The classifi cation of the explicitly drug-related violent events (n = 176), based on Goldstein\u2019s tripartite model, is its fi rst application in an adult drug treatment sample. Although respondents were not criminal offenders, and interpersonal violence related to psychopharmacological effects predominated, economic or systemic linkages related to drug scarcity and the drug market were implicated in one fi fth of all occurrences. Alcohol and cocaine were the substances most implicated in all three aspects of the model. Since a drug treatment sample is a high-risk group for violence, interventions that raise awareness of potential for violence linked to not only intoxication but also scarcity confl icts and illicit drug market involvement are warranted. Since most violence occurs in the community, such initiatives may benefi t those in treatment and serve as an important public health strategy."

        "abstract": "Microorganisms and in particular actinomycetes and microfungi are known to produce a vast number of bioactive secondary metabolites. For industrially important fungal genera such as Penicillium and Aspergillus the production of these compounds has been demonstrated to be very consistent at the species level. This means that direct metabolite profiling techniques such as direct injection mass spectrometry or NMR can easily be used for chemotyping/metabolomics of strains from both culture collections and natural samples using modern informatics tools. In this review we discuss chemotyping/metabolomics as part of intelligent screening and highlight how it can be used for identification and classification of filamentous fungi and for the discovery of novel compounds when used in combination with modern methods for dereplication. In our opinion such approaches will be important for future effective drug discovery strategies, especially for dereplication of culture collections in order to avoid redundancy in the selection of species. This will maximize the chemical diversity of the microbial natural product libraries that can be generated from fungal collections."

        "abstract": "A variety of analytical methodologies to investigate gene expression patterns in cells or tissues have been developed. For screening purposes, a large number of target mRNAs have to be interrogated simultaneously. These requirements have been met more or less comprehensively by Differential Display (DD) RT-PCR, Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH), Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE), and DNA chips. The ultimate goal to cover any gene transcript potentially expressed by a given cell is on the way to be achieved by microbead arrays and by Affymetrix gene chips. Once targets of interest are identified, techniques employing low degrees of multiplexing, such as RNAse protection assays or some bead-based techniques (Luminex) eventually provide extremely fast results on the diagnostic level. With the aid of powerful computer programs, expression profiling technologies have opened intriguing new insights into the complex world of gene regulation. These new techniques have also been applied in drug abuse research recently and some examples of such approaches are described."

        "abstract": "Quantitative analysis of cellular responses to drugs is of major interest in pharmaceutical research. Microarray technologies have been widely used for monitoring genome-wide expression changes. However, this approach has several limitations in terms of coverage of targeted RNAs, sensitivity, and quantitativeness, which are crucial for accurate monitoring of cellular responses. In this article, we report an application of genome-wide and quantitative profiling of cellular responses to drugs. We monitored promoter activities in MCF-7 cells by Cap Analysis of Gene Expression using a single-molecule sequencer. We identified a distinct set of promoters affected even by subtle inhibition of the Ras-ERK and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-Akt signal-transduction pathways. Furthermore, we succeeded in explaining the majority of promoter responses to inhibition of the upstream epidermal growth factor receptor kinase quantitatively based on the promoter profiles upon inhibition of the two individual downstream signaling pathways. Our results demonstrate unexplored utility of highly quantitative promoter activity profiling in drug research.CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology (2013) 2, e77; doi:10.1038/psp.2013.53; published online 25 September 2013."

Hydrocodone/ acetaminophen HYD/ACET compounds are both widely prescribed and abused prescription painkillers in the United States. In the present study, we profiled the subjective, psychomotor, and physiological effects of the compound. It was of particular interest to determine if HYD/ACET had abuse liability-related subjective effects in a population of recreational drug users. Methods: Eighteen volunteers participated in a crossover, randomized, double-blind study in which they received, all p.o., placebo; 5 mg HYD/500 mg ACET; 10 mg HYD/500 mg ACET; 20 mg HYD/1000 mg ACET; 40 mg morphine (MOR) sulfate; and 1000 mg ACET. Measures were assessed before and for 300 min after drug administration. Results: HYD/ACET produced effects that were dose-related, and the highest dose produced a similar magnitude of effect to that of MOR. There were some abuse liability-related subjective effects produced by 20 mg HYD/ACET and MOR, but there were also unpleasant effects. Some unpleasant subjective effects were experienced only by females. Overall liking and \"take again\" ratings assessed 24 h post-session were not significant, but several subjects had elevated liking and \"take again\" ratings at this time in one or more of the HYD/ACET conditions and/or in the MOR condition. Both 20 mg HYD/1000 mg ACET and MOR impaired psychomotor performance. HYD/ACET and MOR produced miosis. Conclusions: HYD/ACET produced some abuse liability-related subjective effects in recreational drug users, which is consistent with the widespread non-medical use and abuse of this product. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Because non-medical use of prescription opioids, including tramadol, has increased in the U.S. over the last several years, we sought to profile its subjective, psychomotor, and physiological effects in recreational drug users. Twenty-two subjects received placebo, 50 or 100 mg tramadol, morphine, or 2 mg lorazepam in a randomized, crossover, double-blind design. The last 12 subjects in the study received 25 mg morphine, a dose that is putatively equianalgesic to 100 mg tramadol. In these subjects, morphine induced miosis and several other mu agonist subjective effects; 100 mg tramadol increased \"feel drug effect\" and drug liking ratings, and decreased pupil size, but the miotic effect was not statistically significant. Lorazepam, but neither tramadol nor morphine, impaired psychomotor performance. When the placebo, tramadol, and lorazepam data from all 22 subjects were analyzed, 100 mg tramadol induced miosis, and several subjective effects were increased significantly, including ratings of drug liking and \"want to take again.\" The present results indicating that a clinically-prescribed dose of oral tramadol has abuse liability-related effects in recreational drug users suggest the need for further abuse liability testing of the oral formulation in opioid abusers. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "This guidance describes how the FDA evaluates patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments used as effectiveness endpoints in clinical trials. It also describes our current thinking on how sponsors can develop and use study results measured by PRO instruments to support claims in approved product labeling (see appendix point 1). It does not address the use of PRO instruments for purposes beyond evaluation of claims made about a drug or medical product in its labeling. By explicitly addressing the review issues identified in this guidance, sponsors can increase the efficiency of their endpoint discussions with the FDA during the product development process, streamline the FDA's review of PRO endpoint adequacy, and provide optimal information about the patient's perspective of treatment benefit at the time of product approval. A PRO is a measurement of any aspect of a patient's health status that comes directly from the patient (i.e., without the interpretation of the patient's responses by a physician or anyone else). In clinical trials, a PRO instrument can be used to measure the impact of an intervention on one or more aspects of patients' health status, hereafter referred to as PRO concepts, ranging from the purely symptomatic (response of a headache) to more complex concepts (e.g., ability to carry out activities of daily living), to extremely complex concepts such as quality of life, which is widely understood to be a multidomain concept with physical, psychological, and social components. Data generated by a PRO instrument can provide evidence of a treatment benefit from the patient perspective. For this data to be meaningful, however, there should be evidence that the PRO instrument effectively measures the particular concept that is studied. Generally, findings measured by PRO instruments may be used to support claims in approved product labeling if the claims are derived from adequate and well-controlled investigations that use PRO instruments that reliably and validly measure the specific concepts at issue. The glossary defines many of the terms used in this guidance. In particular, the term instrument refers to the actual questions or items contained in a questionnaire or interview schedule along with all the additional information and documentation that supports the use of these items in producing a PRO measure (e.g., interviewer training and instructions, scoring and interpretation manual). The term conceptual framework refers to how items are grouped according to subconcepts or domains (e.g., the item walking without help may be grouped with another item, walking with difficulty, within the domain of ambulation, and ambulation may be further grouped into the concept of physical ability). FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended but not required.

The study of the UGTs is a growing field of research, with constantly accumulated and updated information regarding UGT structure, purification, substrate specificity and inhibition, including clinically relevant drug interactions. Development of reliable UGT assays for the assessment of individual isoform substrate specificity and for the discovery of novel isoform-specific substrates and inhibitors is crucial for understanding the function and regulation of the UGT enzyme family and its clinical and pharmacological relevance. High-throughput screening (HTS) is a powerful technology used to search for novel substrates and inhibitors for a wide variety of targets. However, application of HTS in the context of UGTs is complicated because of the poor stability, low levels of expression, low affinity and broad substrate specificity of the enzymes, combined with difficulties in obtaining individual UGT isoforms in purified format, and insufficient information regarding isoform-specific substrates and inhibitors. This review examines the current status of HTS assays used in the search for novel UGT substrates and inhibitors, emphasizing advancements and challenges in HTS technologies for drug glucuronidation profiling, and discusses possible avenues for future advancement of the field."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Liquid extraction surface analysis mass spectrometry (LESA-MS) is a novel surface profiling technique that combines micro-liquid extraction from a solid surface with nano-electrospray mass spectrometry. One potential application is the examination of the distribution of drugs and their metabolites by analyzing ex vivo tissue sections, an area where quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA) is traditionally employed. However, QWBA relies on the use of radiolabeled drugs and is limited to total radioactivity measured whereas LESA-MS can provide drug- and metabolite-specific distribution information. Here, we evaluate LESA-MS, examining the distribution and biotransformation of unlabeled terfenadine in mice and compare our findings to QWBA, whole tissue LC/MS/MS and MALDI-MSI. The spatial resolution of LESA-MS can be optimized to ca. 1 mm on tissues such as brain, liver and kidney, also enabling drug profiling within a single organ. LESA-MS can readily identify the biotransformation of terfenadine to its major, active metabolite fexofenadine. Relative quantification can confirm the rapid absorption of terfendine after oral dosage, its extensive first pass metabolism and the distribution of both compounds into systemic tissues such as muscle, spleen and kidney. The elimination appears to be consistent with biliary excretion and only trace levels of fexofenadine could be confirmed in brain. We found LESA-MS to be more informative in terms of drug distribution than a comparable MALDI-MS imaging study, likely due to its favorable overall sensitivity due to the larger surface area sampled. LESA-MS appears to be a useful new profiling tool for examining the distribution of drugs and their metabolites in tissue sections."

        "abstract": "Herein, we report proteome and transcriptome profiles of the human adult liver and present an initial analysis. Overall, the human liver proteome (HLP) data set comprises 6788 identified proteins with at least two peptides matches at 95% confidence, including 3721 proteins newly identified in liver. The human liver transcriptome (HLT) data set consists of 11 205 expressed genes. The HLP is the largest proteome data set for a human organ and is the first direct association between a proteome and its transcriptome derived from the same sample. Although it is hard to approach complete coverage of the HLP currently, several conclusions based on this data set are clearly reached: (1) The 5816 protein-encoding genes (PEGs) represented by the HLP and the 11 104 PEGs represented in the HLT have been identified from 20 070 PEGs in IPI Human v3.07 and 19 478 PEGs in the integrated human transcriptome database, respectively. (2) The patterns of chromosomal distribution of the genes corresponding to the HLP are highly consistent with those of the HLT. Some chromosomal regions, such as 16p13.3, 19q13.31, 19q13.42, and Xq28, exhibit particularly high densities of liver-specific genes, which perform the important functions related to normal physiology or/and pathology in this organ. (3) The HLP spans 6 orders of magnitude in relative protein abundance and 78% of the proteins fall in the middle of this range. Of newly identified liver proteins, 82.5% are of low abundance. (4) Proteins involving in metabolism, transport, and coagulation and those containing active domains for metabolism, transport, and biosynthesis are significantly enriched in liver. (5) All 94 metabolic pathways in KEGG are touched to different extent. Of which, for 48 pathways, particularly those involved in metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids, more than 80% of the component proteins have been detected. The liver-specific pathways, such as those participating in metabolism of bile acid and bilirubin and in biotransformation, are identified with remarkably high coverage. A total of 31 members of the cytochrome P450 family are identified, four of which have been observed for the first time in human liver. (6) Transport proteins involved in energy metabolism and secretion of both protein and bile acid are highly abundant. Three ion channels are described for the first time in liver. (7) The 800 proteins related to signal transduction and primarily involved in cellular recognition, localization, communication, and inflammation are present in the HLP data set. Insulin and adipocytokine pathways, which are involved in the regulation of glucose and fatty acids, are highly covered. (8) Transcription factors (309 in total) have been recognized at relatively low detection rates and abundance; however, transcription factors regulating gene expression related to transport, metabolism, and biosynthesis are detected at relatively higher coverage and the protein products of their target genes (100 in total), such as metabolic enzymes and plasma proteins, are also identified. (9) The overlap between the human liver and plasma proteomes is particularly noteworthy in the coagulation/anticoagulation/fibrinolysis and complement system. There is a significantly positive linear correlation between the abundance of coagulator proteins in liver and plasma."

The network of immunoregulatory signals ruling the course of such disorders is highly complex and does not only involve the cells of the immune system, but also those of the diseased organs. This makes it rather difficult to model such regulatory processes in vitro. Most existing cell culture systems suffer from a serious lack of complexity. This is one of the major reasons why the majority of drug candidates fail in patients. Drugs that are meant to mono-specifically counter-regulate a disease process tend to develop unpredictable responses, due to unknown crosslinks in signalling pathways that are not available in simple culture models. Thus, the candidate selection as it is used at present, can be improved substantially by using more elaborate, in-vivo-like human cell culture models. Such test systems will accelerate the drug development process and decrease the risk of candidate failure. This review describes a new set of human organotypic, reproducible routine cell culture models, developed to optimise the drug candidate selection process and to increase clinical success rates. It is expected that models like these will accelerate drug development in the future substantially. \u00a9 2007 Informa UK Ltd."

        "abstract": "Earlier studies in Western countries have shown remarkably consistent spatial patterns in serial offenders, mainly for serious crimes notably serial killing and rape, but also (although with less clear patterns) for burglary. The universality of such spatial patterns are of theoretical interest in contributing to our understanding of criminal spatial behaviour and have practical significance for the possibility of using geographic profiling in developing countries. As such, burglars in India provide a particularly interesting test of the generality of the observed spatial consistencies. Information was therefore obtained on the offence location choices of 30 burglars, committing 150 offences in the Rourkela and Keonjhar districts of India. The home to crime distances were compared with those from developed countries, revealing similar but slightly shorter distances. In addition, the domocentricity of criminal spatial activity, reflected in the \u2018marauder\u2019 model (Canter & Gregory 1994) was tested through examination of the Canter Circle hypothesis, the mean interpoint distances (as they related to average distances from home), and the home base \u2018search costs\u2019 using a geographical profiling system (Dragnet). Overall the study found that the spatial patterns of the sample of Indian Burglars were not very different from their counterparts in the UK, North America and Australia, showing that the areas in which an offender is active tend to be shaped by, and, relatedly, close to, where he or she lives, irrespective of the part of the world in which this is. These results suggest that geographical profiling systems such as Dragnet would be productively used on the Indian sub-continent. The results also contribute to our understanding of possible universalities in offender spatial behaviour. Copyright \u00a9 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "The premise for this study is that the physical and cultural landscape has a deterministic effect on the location and distribution of serial crime. As a consequence, the distribution of linked crime scenes should exhibit a shape and orientation that is consistent with the underlying landscape. Geographic Profiling models that are able to account for these effects will provide more accurate results than those models that do not. Utilizing basic geographic principles of central tendency and spatial diffusion, this research first analyzed the output of circular and elliptical profile models generated for 30 serial burglaries (n = 164) and 67 serial robberies (n = 370) in Baltimore, Maryland between 1994 and 1997. A comparative analysis of the model output reveals that the Standard Deviational Ellipse is significantly (p = 0.000) better able to predict the home location of a serial offender than profiles generated from circles. Next, the relationship between the orientation of elliptical profiles and the mean linear orientation of the corresponding landscape was assessed to reveal a moderate but significant correlation (r = 0.511, p < 0.001). Together, these findings demonstrate that landscape does impact the locations of crime, and is a measurable parameter that can improve the efficacy of geographic profiling.

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Expert bodies have long advised that use of hypnotic drugs should be limited to short courses for acutely distressed patients and should generally be avoided in elderly people. Despite this, more than 10 million prescriptions for hypnotics continue to be dispensed each year in England alone, mostly for benzodiazepines and drugs with similar actions such as zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone (so called 'Z-drugs'). Around 80% of all such prescriptions are for people aged 65 years or over, and many patients remain on the drugs for months or years. Such prescribing carries many potential hazards for patients, including risk of dependence, accidents and other adverse effects on heath. Here to review how the risks from hypnotic drugs can be minimised."

        "abstract": "Around 800,000 people in the UK have dementia, about 80% of whom will have behavioural changes or psychological symptoms in the course of the illness. Such features lower quality of life for both patients and carers, and often result in transfer to residential care and higher costs. Currently, no drugs are licensed in the UK specifically for behavioural changes and psychological symptoms in patients with dementia. Nevertheless, antipsychotic medications have been used in people with dementia, both for psychotic symptoms and also for less specific problems such as agitation and aggression. There have been long-standing concerns about the inappropriate use of these drugs in such settings. In 2004, following worries over an increased likelihood of stroke with risperidone and olanzapine, the former UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) advised that these drugs \"should not be used for the treatment of behavioural symptoms of dementia\". However, this led to reports of unsuitable interpretation of the guidance, with groups of patients having their medication withdrawn inappropriately or being switched to other, potentially more harmful, drugs. Here we assess the safety of antipsychotic medication in people with dementia.;"

Previous research has predominantly used smallest space analysis (SSA) to conceptualise and classify offences into thematic groups based on crime scene behaviour data. This paper introduces a combined approach utilising multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), cluster analysis (CA), and discriminant function analysis (DFA) to define and differentiate crime scenes into expressive or instrumental and impersonal or personal crimes. MCA is used to derive the latent structural dimensions in the crime data and produce quantitative scores for each offence along these dimensions. Two\u2010step CA was then utilised to classify offences. Offence dimensional scores were then used to predict cluster membership under DFA, producing cluster centroids corresponding to MCA dimensions. Centroids were plotted on the MCA correspondence map to simultaneously conceptualise crime classification and the latent structure of the Serbian crime data. Classification of offences based on MCA dimensional scores were 91.5% accurate. This MCA\u2013CA\u2013DFA approach may reduce some of the more subjective aspects of SSA methodology used in classification, whilst producing a product more amenable to objective and cumulative review. Implications for offender profiling research utilising SSA and this approach are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

The focus of this article is the therapy monitoring and the interpretation of the gene expression profiles in respect to physiological differences of drug action. As an example, we will discuss changes in gene expression in blood samples from CML patients treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib mesylate) and compare the observed effects on gene expression with the effects of IFNalpha treatment. In comparison with other examples of therapy monitoring the potential of this application of gene expression profiling for optimizing individual therapy will be discussed."

High-content profiling was developed to unravel the complexity of these interactions by providing multiparameter measurements of target activity at the cellular and subcellular levels. Two microtubule drugs, vinblastine and curacin A, were shown to modulate multiple cellular processes, including nuclear condensation, the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway as measured by RSK90 phosphorylation, and the regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton as measured in detergent-extracted cells. The heterogeneity of the response, addressed through population analysis and multiparameter comparisons within single cells, was consistent with vinblastine and curacin A having similar effects on nuclear morphology and 90 kDa ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK90) phosphorylation despite having distinct effects on the microtubule cytoskeleton. Ketoconazole, originally developed as an antifungal agent, exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitory and potentiating effects on both drugs in HeLa and PC-3 cells at concentration ranges near the plasma levels of ketoconazole attained in human subjects. Thus, high-content profiling was used to dissect the cellular and molecular responses to interacting drugs and is therefore a potentially important tool in the selection, characterization, and optimization of lead therapeutic compounds."

The metaphysical nature, if appreciated, provides grounds for further scientific hypotheses that can be validated by logic and observation. Thus, both forensic science and metaphysics adopt an important role in forensic drug intelligence. Hence, it is worth examining the underlying metaphysical nature that governs the intelligence work through forensic science in the effort to counteract drug trafficking.

        "abstract": "Tumor derived cell lines have been in use for cancer drug profiling as evidenced by the establishment of NCI-60 panel as a drug discovery tool in early 1990s. In recent years, due to the advancement of targeted therapies in cancer, screening of larger cell panels with greater genetic heterogeneity has become very important not only to measure efficacy of the compounds but also for identifying the biomarkers that are responsible for the efficacy. Here we present data from OncoPredictorSM, a cellular screening and bioinformatics platform able to (1) evaluate multiple types of genomic biomarkers for association with in vitro drug response and (2) analyze identified biomarkers in clinical tumor populations, thereby suggesting potential drug development strategies. The cellular screening component, OncoPanelTM, is comprised of a large panel of human tumor-derived cell lines from different origins with broad genetic heterogeneity providing a sensitive method of comparing proliferation or cytotoxicity (resistance or sensitivity) across genotypes. Our cell line panel consists of 240 cell lines that span a wide variety tumor tissue types including lung, breast, stomach, colon, ovary, liver, skin, kidney, bladder, prostate, pancreas, head and neck, brain, hematopoetic, and lymphoid tumors. We have mRNA expression, SNP and mutation data to characterize these cell lines. The media and culture conditions are standardized and optimized so that the genetic heterogeneity of the cell line will be responsible for the phenotypic responses obtained. We generate simultaneous data for each compound at 10 concentrations (in triplicates) resulting in precise IC50/EC50 values for analysis and comparison. Results from a case study will be presented to depict the very robust data quality including the doubling time for the cell lines. Also, sensitive and resistance data with 11 known anticancer agents including inhibitors of mTorr, ABL, MEK, PDGF, VEGF, FLT3, Aurora kinases, HSP90, EGFR, Topo II, and microtubulin disassembly will be presented using the robust high content data from these cell lines. As expected, the most sensitive cell lines against a clinical ABL inhibitor were the CML-derived cell lines. On the other hand, many of the colon, melanoma and pancreatic cell lines were sensitive to MEK inhibitor. Sensitive and resistant cells were further profiled against, mutation, expression, and SNP data to identify genes involved in the sensitive/resistant phenotypes using sophisticated bioinformatic analysis tools to identify genomic biomarker profiles and to estimate their frequency in clinical populations (data presented separately). OncoPredictor is ideally suited for prioritization of the leads, positioning of the leads against cancer types, repositioning of clinical candidates or drugs for supplemental indication, combination therapies, and for biomarker identification and characterization in clinical populations."

Patients' demographic information, past history, presenting features, investigations, management and missed diagnoses of organic pathology were collected. Recurrent presentations of drug seeking, self-harming, psychiatric, chronic pain and drug dependency complaints were documented.\\n\\nRESULTS: Thirty-seven presentations (31 patients) of 10,958 total attendances were analysed. All patients were less than 65 years. Twenty-one patients (68%, 95% confidence interval [CI 49.7-85.8]) were on unemployment or disability pension. Twenty-six presentations (70% [95% CI 54.2-86.3]) described psychiatric problems, whereas three presentations (8% [95% CI 0.0-18.3]) had chronic pain and 10 presentations (27% [95% CI 11.4-42.7]) had drug dependency problems. Twenty-six patients (84% [95% CI 69.3-98.4]) recurrently presented with self-harming and drug-seeking behaviour at 3 years. The risk of missing organic pathology was 8/37 (22% [95% CI 7.0-36.2]).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Further characterization of this population would help accurate diagnosis of this aberrant behaviour and decrease the risk of missing organic pathology. The management of frequently presenting patients should prompt formulation of departmental plans to effectively assess and manage these people."

        "abstract": "The present study explored the feasibility of a differential setup for the in situ perfusion technique with mesenteric cannulation in rats to assess drug interactions at the level of intestinal absorption. In contrast to the classic, parallel in situ perfusion setup, the differential approach aims to identify intestinal drug interactions in individual animals by exposing the perfused segment to a sequence of multiple conditions. First, the setup was validated by assessing the interaction between the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor verapamil and the transport probes atenolol (paracellular transport), propranolol (transcellular) and talinolol (P-gp mediated efflux). While transport of atenolol and propranolol remained constant for the total perfusion time (2 h), a verapamil-induced increase in talinolol transport was observed within individual rats (between 3.2- and 5.2-fold). In comparison with the parallel setup, the differential in situ perfusion approach enhances the power to detect drug interactions with compounds that exhibit strong subject-dependent permeability. This was demonstrated by identifying an interaction between amprenavir and ketoconazole (P-gp and CYP3A inhibitor) in five out of seven rats (permeability increase between 1.9- and 4.2-fold), despite high inter-individual differences in intrinsic permeability for amprenavir. In combination with an increased throughput (up to 300%) and a reduced animal use (up to 50%), the enhanced power of the differential approach improves the utility of the biorelevant in situ perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling to elucidate the intestinal interaction profile of drugs and drug candidates.

        "abstract": "Reporter mice associated to molecular imaging represent a major asset for the study of the spatio-temporal effects of drugs in living animals. The field is still relatively young and so far the number of animals genetically modified to express a given reporter gene ubiquitously and under the control of specific drugs is still limited. For a reporter animal the indispensable elements for the application to drug research and development are (i) the short life of the reporter enabling to have a clear view of the onset as well as the termination of drug effects, (ii) the generalized, drug-dependent activation of the reporter, and (iii) imaging modality suitable for high-throughput analysis. Because of its relative cheapness and ease to perform, in addition to all the above considerations, bioluminescence-based imaging is now regarded as the best imaging technology to be applied to the field of drug research. We show here the application of reporter mouse systems for drug screening in living animals in order to compare drug potency on target and specificity of action."

        "abstract": "Two studies explored the validity of dichotomous classification of organised/disorganised serial killers and the four typologies (visionary, mission, hedonistic, and power/control) adopted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Tables documenting crime scene criteria were devised consisting of 50 typifying different crime scenes (Study 1) and 48 crime scenes (taken from the 50 crime scene criteria) with a further 10 motive-based crime scene criteria (Study 2). Adopting content analysis, crime scenes depicted for 40 (Study 1) and 40 (Study 2) serial killers using secondary sources of data were dichotomously coded for the presence or absence of the crime scene criteria. These data were inputted for agglomerative hierarchical cluster using Ward's method as the clustering algorithm. Differences in the nature of clusters were found for male and female serial killers; however, there was no empirical support for the organised/disorganised classifications or the four typologies. The 'bottom-up' approach resulted in clusters from the different crime scene criteria that helped to understand how these criteria were associated within the serial killer cohort considered. It is concluded that the resulting clusters in both studies support the notion of there being an underlying organised element to most serial murder and that serial murders differ according to the nature of disorganised crime scene criteria present.

        "abstract": "Although it is now well established across diverse samples that the frequency of offending \u2018decays\u2019 as distance from the home/base increases, it remains unclear what form of decay function best characterises this relationship. Different forms of decay function refl ect dif- ferent patterns and rates of decrease in the likelihood of offending as distance from the home/base increases. These different patterns imply rather different underlying psycho- logical processes. Therefore, considerations of the particular function characterising distance decay elucidate explanations of offender spatial behaviour. To bring to light the possible psychological and behavioural processes inherent in offending distance decay, the present study examined the fi t of logarithmic, negative exponential, and quadratic decay functions to the distribution of the distances travelled to offend by a sample of 70 prolifi c burglars from the UK. It is argued that these functions are consistent with the operation of perceptual processes of magnitude estimation, friction or effort effects, and the infl uences of cost-benefi t assessments, respectively. The results indicate that offending distance decay patterns most closely fi t the logarithmic function, consistent with Stevens\u2019 perceptual processes of distortion in magnitude estimation, whilst not ruling out additional processes relating to the increased effort required in travelling greater distances to offend. Because most geographical profi ling systems are built upon the distance decay function, the impact of utilising the different forms of function on the accuracy of geographic pro- fi les was also assessed utilising \u2018search cost\u2019 calculations. The results showed little impact of applying different decay functions. Thus, whilst the decay function does have important theoretical implications for understanding offender spatial behaviour, it is noted that the particular variant used does not signifi cantly impact on the effectiveness of geographical profi ling systems as they currently exist."

However, the current scientifi c knowledge on these offenders and their crimes is, in many aspects, of great importance to criminal investigations. Consequently, there is a need to build bridges between investigative psychology and the research being conducted on sex offenders. Four areas of research on sex offenders that have clear implications to investigative psychology can be identifi ed: (1) the consistency or \u2018crimeswitching\u2019 patterns of sex offenders; (2) the recidivism patterns of different types of sex offenders; (3) the police response to specifi c victim characteristics; and (4) the A \u2192 C equation of sexual assaults.

        "abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is an important process in development and disease, as it allows the body to rid itself of unwanted or damaged cells. However, PCD pathways can also be activated in otherwise healthy cells. One such case occurs in sensory hair cells of the inner ear following exposure to ototoxic drugs, resulting in hearing loss and/or balance disorders. The intracellular pathways that determine if hair cells die or survive following this or other ototoxic challenges are incompletely understood. We use the larval zebrafish lateral line, an external hair cell-bearing sensory system, as a platform for profiling cell death pathways activated in response to ototoxic stimuli. In this report the importance of each pathway was assessed by screening a custom cell death inhibitor library for instances when pathway inhibition protected hair cells from the aminoglycosides neomycin or gentamicin, or the chemotherapy agent cisplatin. This screen revealed that each ototoxin likely activated a distinct subset of possible cell death pathways. For example, the proteasome inhibitor Z-LLF-CHO protected hair cells from either aminoglycoside or from cisplatin, while D-methionine, an antioxidant, protected hair cells from gentamicin or cisplatin but not from neomycin toxicity. The calpain inhibitor leupeptin primarily protected hair cells from neomycin, as did a Bax channel blocker. Neither caspase inhibition nor protein synthesis inhibition altered the progression of hair cell death. Taken together, these results suggest that ototoxin-treated hair cells die via multiple processes that form an interactive network of cell death signaling cascades."

        "abstract": "Tumor cells respond to growth signals by the activation of protein kinases, altered gene expression and significant modifications in substrate flow and re-distribution among biosynthetic pathways. This results in a proliferating phenotype with altered cellular function. These transformed cells exhibit unique anabolic characteristics, which includes increased and preferential utilization of glucose through the non-oxidative steps of the pentose cycle for nucleic acid synthesis but limited de novo fatty acid synthesis and TCA cycle glucose oxidation. This primarily non-oxidative anabolic profile reflects an undifferentiated highly proliferative aneuploid cell phenotype and serves as a reliable metabolic biomarker to determine cell proliferation rate and the level of cell transformation/differentiation in response to drug treatment. Novel drugs effective in particular cancers exert their anti-proliferative effects by inducing significant reversions of a few specific non-oxidative anabolic pathways. Here we present evidence that cell transformation of various mechanisms is sustained by a unique disproportional substrate distribution between the two branches of the pentose cycle for nucleic acid synthesis, glycolysis and the TCA cycle for fatty acid synthesis and glucose oxidation. This can be demonstrated by the broad labeling and unique specificity of [1,2-(13)C(2)]glucose to trace a large number of metabolites in the metabolome. Stable isotope-based dynamic metabolic profiles (SIDMAP) serve the drug discovery process by providing a powerful new tool that integrates the metabolome into a functional genomics approach to developing new drugs. It can be used in screening kinases and their metabolic targets, which can therefore be more efficiently characterized, speeding up and improving drug testing, approval and labeling processes by saving trial and error type study costs in drug testing."

In this work, thermodynamic constraints on non-equilibrium metabolite concentrations are used to reveal the biochemical interactions between the metabolic pathways of ethanol and acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol), two drugs known to interact unfavorably. It is known that many reactions of these pathways are coupled to the central energy metabolic reactions through a number of metabolites and the cellular redox potential. Based on these observations, a metabolic network model has been constructed and a database of thermodynamic properties for all participating metabolites and reactions has been compiled. Constraint-based computational analysis of the feasible metabolite concentrations reveals that the non-toxic pathways for APAP metabolism and the pathway for detoxifying N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) are inhibited by network interactions with ethanol metabolism. These results point to the potential utility of thermodynamically based profiling of metabolic network interactions in screening of drug candidates and analysis of potential toxicity. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

It is different from earlier approaches in dealing directly with large local data sets of solved crimes to develop statistical models as compared with attempts to derive more generic ways of conceptualising an offender\u2019s geographical crime pattern. The two approaches can thus be seen to enshrine different epistemologies; the Bayesian being about a process for deriving patterns in geographi- cally specifi c data sets, the earlier centre-of-gravity-oriented approaches seeking to estab- lish general theories and principles that are broadly independent of any given locality. They are consequently sensitive to different types of bias in the data available. However, the interesting results achieved through the analysis of Bayesian patterns within crime data does further the consideration of the similarities across offenders in their use of locations for crime and thus has theoretical as well as practical implications. Therefore, these two approaches need to build on each other. This complementarity provides a useful example for other areas of Investigative Psychology. Copyright"

These two quantities were used to characterize compound activities and identify dose-dependent multiphasic responses. A systematic survey of profiles extracted from a 100-compound compendium of image data revealed that only 10-15% of the original features were required to detect a compound effect. We report the most informative image features for each compound and fluorescence marker set using a method that will be useful for determining minimal collections of readouts for drug screens.

A novel computational method that uses a curated metabolic network was also developed, and it was used to identify the genes that are likely to be responsible for the metabolomic differences found.\\n\\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The combination of metabolomic and chemogenomic profiling, along with data analyses carried out using a novel computational method, could robustly identify the enzymes targeted by five drugs.

Structural data and registered effect profiles of all small-molecule drugs were collected, and interactions to a series of nontarget protein binding sites of each drug were calculated. Statistical analyses confirmed a close relationship between the studied 177 major effect categories and interaction profiles of ca. 1200 FDA-approved small-molecule drugs. On the basis of this relationship, the effect profiles of drugs were revealed in their entirety, and hitherto uncovered effects could be predicted in a systematic manner. Our results show that the prediction power is independent of the composition of the protein set used for interaction profile generation."

Therefore, it is anticipated that studies of disease will discover biomarkers that can also be used to identify drug-induced injury and vice versa. This article describes transcriptomic blood-borne biomarkers that have been reported to be connected with disease and drug toxicity.

The K(M) values are found to be in good agreement and correctly ranked with respect to the published literature on human liver microsomes and baculosomes: [ondansetron \u2248 alosetron > nifedipine > quinidine]. The results presented in this paper represent a step forward for a rapid evaluation of the interaction of P450 and drug, requiring small volumes of new chemical entities to be tested."

        "abstract": "Despite the wide use of the oral route to deliver systemic drugs to humans, the intestinal absorption process is still not fully understood. Especially for complex absorption-enabling strategies (e.g. solubilization, supersaturation, etc.), the in vivo performance is difficult to predict. Considering the current share of drug candidates that suffer from a non-favorable absorption potential and therefore rely on these strategies, there is a growing interest in approaches that aim to resolve the multitude of interactions between drugs, formulation factors and the gastrointestinal environment. In this respect, gastrointestinal concentration profiling following drug administration to humans is a recent but promising strategy that complements more established techniques including gastrointestinal imaging. In the present review, a number of case studies will be discussed to demonstrate the added value of gastrointestinal concentration profiling to gain in-depth knowledge of intraluminal drug and formulation behavior and to identify those processes key for drug absorption. Examples include a better understanding of intestinal precipitation of weakly basic drugs, clarifying inter-individual or food-induced variability in absorption, and an improved insight into the solubility-permeability interplay. As manifested in a recently initiated European project on oral biopharmaceutics tools (OrBiTo), intraluminal concentration profiling will contribute to the development of relevant simulation models that are built upon a solid understanding of human drug and formulation behavior, and allow for a more predictive in vitro and in silico evaluation of absorption. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "For much of the past century, scientists studying drug abuse labored in the shadows of powerful myths and misconceptions about the nature of addiction. When scientists began to study addictive behavior in the 1930s, people addicted to drugs were thought to be morally flawed and lacking in willpower. Those views shaped society\u2019s responses to drug abuse, treating it as a moral failing rather than a health problem, which led to an emphasis on punishment rather than prevention and treatment. Today, thanks to science, our views and our responses to addiction and other substance use disorders have changed dramatically. Groundbreaking discoveries about the brain have revolutionized our understanding of compulsive drug use, enabling us to respond effectively to the problem. As a result of scientific research, we know that addiction is a disease that affects both the brain and behavior. We have identified many of the biological and environmental factors and are beginning to search for the genetic variations that contribute to the development and progression of the disease. Scientists use this knowledge to develop effective prevention and treatment approaches that reduce the toll drug abuse takes on individuals, families, and communities. Despite these advances, many people today do not understand why people become addicted to drugs or how drugs change the brain to foster compulsive drug use. This booklet aims to fill that knowledge gap by providing scientific information about the disease of drug addiction, including the many harmful consequences of drug abuse and the basic approaches that have been developed to prevent and treat substance use disorders. At the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), we believe that increased understanding of the basics of addiction will empower people to make informed choices in their own lives, adopt science-based policies and programs that reduce drug abuse and addiction in their communities, and support scientific research that improves the Nation\u2019s well-being."

        "abstract": "The availability of sequenced genomes of human and many experimental animals necessitated the development of new technologies and powerful computational tools that are capable of exploiting these genomic data and ask intriguing questions about complex nature of biological processes. This gave impetus for developing whole genome approaches that can produce functional information of genes in the form of expression profiles and unscramble the relationships between variation in gene expression and the resulting physiological outcome. These profiles represent genetic fingerprints or catalogue of genes that characterize the cell or tissue being studied and provide a basis from which to begin an investigation of the underlying biology. Among the most powerful and versatile tools are high-density DNA microarrays to analyze the expression patterns of large numbers of genes across different tissues or within the same tissue under a variety of experimental conditions or even between species. The wide spread use of microarray technologies is generating large sets of data that is stimulating the development of better analytical tools so that functions can be predicted for novel genes. In this review, the authors discuss how these profiles are being used at various stages of the drug discovery process and help in the identification of new drug targets, predict the function of novel genes, and understand individual variability in response to drugs."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a complex disorder  that is difficult to predict, diagnose and treat. AIM: To describe the global serum proteome of patients with DILI and controls. METHODS: A label-free, mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic approach was used to explore protein expression in serum samples from 74 DILI patients (collected within 14 days of DILI onset) and 40 controls. A longitudinal analysis was conducted in a subset of 21 DILI patients with available 6-month follow-up serum samples. RESULTS: Comparison of DILI patients based on pattern, severity and causality assessment of liver injury revealed many differentially expressed priority 1 proteins among groups. Expression of fumarylacetoacetase was correlated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT; r = 0.237; P = 0.047), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; r = 0.389; P = 0.001) and alkaline phosphatase (r = -0.240; P = 0.043), and this was the only protein with significant differential expression when comparing patients with hepatocellular vs. cholestatic or mixed injury. In the longitudinal analysis, expression of 53 priority 1 proteins changed significantly from onset of DILI to 6-month follow-up, and nearly all proteins returned to expression levels comparable to control subjects. Ninety-two serum priority 1 proteins with significant differential expression were identified when comparing the DILI and control groups. Pattern analysis revealed proteins that are components of inflammation, immune system activation and several hepatotoxicity-specific pathways. Apolipoprotein E expression had the greatest power to differentiate DILI patients from controls (89% correct classification; AUROC = 0.97). CONCLUSION: This proteomic analysis identified differentially expressed proteins that are components of pathways previously implicated in the pathogenesis of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury."

Drug-response clustering is achieved through multidimensional scaling with simulated annealing to construct phenotypic drug profiles that cluster drugs with similar responses. Hypoxic vs. normoxic tissue responses present two distinct phenotypes with differentiated responses to environmental perturbations and to pharmacological doses."

In the past decade, microarray technology has become a routine tool for monitoring genome-wide expression changes and has been widely adopted for exploring drug response in the pharmaceutical field. However, how to predict the synergistic effect of drug combinations using microarray data is a challenging task. In this article, we report a simple prediction framework based on the genome-wide and quantitative profiling of cellular responses to individual drugs. By exploring the differential expression profiles, our correlation-based strategy can reveal the synergistic effects of drug combinations. The comparison with gold-standard experimental results demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses in relation to prediction based only on cellular response to individual drugs. Specifically, the prediction strategy may work for a drug combination whose individual drugs show related transcriptomic mechanisms but not for others."

Unfortunately, lack of experimentally validated functional information about most P. falciparum genes remains a strategic hurdle. Chemogenomic profiling is an established tool for classification of drugs with similar mechanisms of action by comparing drug fitness profiles in a collection of mutants. Inferences of drug mechanisms of action and targets can be obtained by associations between shifts in drug fitness and specific genetic changes in the mutants. In this screen, P. falciparum, piggyBac single insertion mutants were profiled for altered responses to antimalarial drugs and metabolic inhibitors to create chemogenomic profiles. Drugs targeting the same pathway shared similar response profiles and multiple pairwise correlations of the chemogenomic profiles revealed novel insights into drugs' mechanisms of action. A mutant of the artemisinin resistance candidate gene - \"K13-propeller\" gene (PF3D7_1343700) exhibited increased susceptibility to artemisinin drugs and identified a cluster of 7 mutants based on similar enhanced responses to the drugs tested. Our approach of chemogenomic profiling reveals artemisinin functional activity, linked by the unexpected drug-gene relationships of these mutants, to signal transduction and cell cycle regulation pathways."

Method - The study involved a cross-sectional survey during a sub-regional pharmacovigilance training course in Zimbabwe. Eighteen participants from 10 African countries attended and were asked to complete self-administered pre-course and post-course questionnaires. A follow-up questionnaire was also posted to each participant 2 months after the workshop. Results - After the course, there was a marked difference in the perceived factors discouraging a participant from reporting an ADR with only a few respondents unsure how to report ADRs or worried about confidentiality and legal issues. Only 5.4% of responses were inappropriate after the training when asked what should be reported to a voluntary ADR reporting scheme compared to 19.8% before the course. Half of the respondents to the follow-up questionnaire expected a pharmacovigilance centre to be established in their countries as a result of the training. Conclusion - The training course had a positive effect on attitudes and knowledge of pharmacovigilance and may lead to establishment of pharmacovigilance centres in some of the participating countries.

        "abstract": "The dose response curve is the gold standard for measuring the effect of a drug treatment, but is rarely used in genomic scale transcriptional profiling due to perceived obstacles of cost and analysis. One barrier to examining transcriptional dose responses is that existing methods for microarray data analysis can identify patterns, but provide no quantitative pharmacological information. We developed analytical methods that identify transcripts responsive to dose, calculate classical pharmacological parameters such as the EC50, and enable an in-depth analysis of coordinated dose-dependent treatment effects. The approach was applied to a transcriptional profiling study that evaluated four kinase inhibitors (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib and PD0325901) across a six-logarithm dose range, using 12 arrays per compound. The transcript responses proved a powerful means to characterize and compare the compounds: the distribution of EC50 values for the transcriptome was linked to specific targets, dose-dependent effects on cellular processes were identified using automated pathway analysis, and a connection was seen between EC50s in standard cellular assays and transcriptional EC50s. Our approach greatly enriches the information that can be obtained from standard transcriptional profiling technology. Moreover, these methods are automated, robust to non-optimized assays, and could be applied to other sources of quantitative data."

The utility of the approach was illustrated by investigating the metabolism of the drugs diclofenac (DCF), troglitazone (TGZ), and raloxifene, for which we observed known metabolic oxidation and bioconjugation pathways and turnover rates. A broad range of enzymes was included by utilizing human liver (HLM), rat liver (RLM) and bicistronic human-cyt P450 3A4 (bicis.-3A4) microsomes as enzyme sources. This parallel approach significantly shortens sample preparation steps compared to an earlier manual processing with nanoparticle bioreactors, allowing a range of significant enzyme reactions to be processed simultaneously. Enzyme turnover rates using the microsomal bioreactors were 2-3 fold larger compared to using conventional microsomal dispersions, most likely because of better accessibility of the enzymes. Ketoconazole (KET) and quinidine (QIN), substrates specific to cyt P450 3A enzymes, were used to demonstrate applicability to establish potentially toxic drug-drug interactions involving enzyme inhibition and acceleration."

The seminal work in this field, which includes a large database and computational algorithms for pattern matching, is known as the \"Connectivity Map\" (CMap). The potential of similar exercises at the metabolite level is, however, still largely unexplored. Only recently the first high throughput metabolomic assay pilot study was published, involving screening of metabolic response to a set of 56 kinase inhibitors in a 96-well format. Here we report results from a separately developed metabolic profiling assay, which leverages 1H NMR spectroscopy to the quantification of metabolic changes in the HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line, in response to each of 26 compounds. These agents are distributed across 12 different pharmacological classes covering a broad spectrum of bioactivity. Differential metabolic profiles, inferred from multivariate spectral analysis of 18 spectral bins, allowed clustering of most tested drugs according to their respective pharmacological class. A more advanced supervised analysis, involving one multivariate scattering matrix per pharmacological class and using only 3 spectral bins (three metabolites), showed even more distinct pharmacology-related cluster formations. In conclusion, this kind of relatively fast and inexpensive profiling seems to provide a promising alternative to that afforded by mRNA expression analysis, which is relatively slow and costly. As also indicated by the present pilot study, the resulting metabolic profiles do not seem to provide as information rich signatures as those obtained using systemic mRNA profiling, but the methodology holds strong promise for significant refinement."

The process of identifying discovery compounds with desirable \"druglike\" properties has consequently become increasingly data-driven.

A Caco-2 cell model, automated on a Tecan Genesis workstation, evaluates the intestinal absorption of drug candidates. Distribution properties are determined with a high-throughput equilibrium dialysis technique for measuring plasma protein binding. Drug metabolism can be evaluated on a Genesis workstation via measurements of metabolic stability in liver microsomes. Drug-drug interactions can be predicted with HTS techniques using human recombinant hepatic CYP450 isoforms.

DNA microarray technology enables the simultaneous determination of the expression levels for thousands of genes (gene expression profile; GEP) and provides a powerful approach for investigating lymphoma biology and improving disease classification. Distinct molecular signatures for many lymphomas, as well as novel lymphoma subtypes have been identified. Molecular prognosticators have also been constructed. Many of the molecular subgroups of lymphoma also show distinct patterns of genetic abnormalities. We also briefly review the application of other genome-wide techniques to the study of lymphomas, such as high resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and next-generation sequencing, and how these technologies will complement each other in improving our understanding of the pathobiology of lymphoma. Specific therapeutic targets will likely emerge from the increased insight into the molecular pathogenesis of the different lymphomas, thus illustrating the utility of these global studies in advancing disease management strategies."

Part I was dedicated to the analysis of organic impurities formed during synthesis in order to investigate traffic tendencies and highlight potential links between samples, whereas this part focuses on physical characteristics of the MDMA tablets. Diameter, thickness, weight and score were demonstrated to be reliable and relevant features in this drug intelligence perspective. Distributions of samples coming from the same post-tabletting batch (post-TB) and samples coming from different post-TB were very well discriminated by using the squared Euclidean or the Manhattan distance on standardised data. Our findings demonstrated the possibility to discriminate between MDMA samples issued from different post-TB and to find out links between samples coming from a same post-TB. Furthermore, the hypothesis that most of the MDMA samples found on the international market come from the same countries was supported. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

However, high-throughput methodology for the quantitative analysis of platelet signaling events is still lacking.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: To develop a high-throughput assay for the analysis of platelet signaling events in whole blood.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a fluorescent barcoding protocol to facilitate multiplexing and enable large-scale signaling profiling in platelets in whole blood. The methodology allowed simultaneous staining and acquisition of 24-96 samples in a single analysis tube with a standard flow cytometer. This approach significantly reduced experimental numbers, data acquisition time, and antibody consumption, while providing automated statistically rich quantitative data on signaling events. Using vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), an established marker of platelet inhibition and antiplatelet drug therapy, we demonstrated that the assay could detect subtle changes in phosphoVASP-Ser157/239 in response to cAMP-elevating agents of varying potency and known modulators of the cAMP signaling cascade. The assay could be used with washed platelets or whole blood, analyzed immediately or frozen, without any significant change in assay performance. To demonstrate the usefulness of the assay as a drug discovery platform, we examined a prostaglandin screening library. Our screen of 70 prostaglandin derivatives revealed three previously uncharacterized lipids that stimulated phosphorylation of VASP-Ser157. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these agents elevated intraplatelet cAMP and inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This novel method enables rapid, large-scale quantitative signaling profiling and compound screening in human platelets present in whole blood."

Within this postgenomics era in science, proteomic technologies are positioned to play a major role in discovery of new biomarkers for early detection of diseases and drug-induced toxicity, new molecular targets for therapy, and new end points for therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. Objective: Development of patient-specific targeted therapeutics with reduced toxicity and increased efficacy using cells or sera from patients with disease. Methods: New proteomic technologies such as laser capture microscopy are providing rapid, easy access to the purified, diseased human cells from tissue specimens that previously has not been possible. Due to limited availability of patient material, highly sensitive mass spectrometric techniques such as surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) are used to complement 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis for multiparametric protein characterization. Results: The use of high-throughput SELDI-TOF protein pattern generation techniques should prove valuable for new molecular classification of human tumors, disease stages, and drug-induced toxicity. The use of newly developed high-density protein arrays, antibody arrays, and small molecular arrays in conjunction with laser capture microscopy could have a substantial impact on proteomic profiling of human tumors and human tissues affected in response to drug treatments. SELDI-TOF and laser capture microscopy technologies in conjunction with new bioinformatic software will be powerful tools in the near future for identifying protein fingerprints in cells or sera of patients to predict the outcomes of therapies for any diagnosed disease. Conclusions: The application of all new proteomic technologies should enhance our efforts in designing rational drug therapy strategies that are based on an individual patient's molecular profiling of cellular proteins in the disease state and can identify proteomic fingerprints associated with drug-induced toxicity directly in sera samples. This should provide us with the detailed knowledge necessary to develop novel therapeutics for the treatment of diseases and/or detection of diseases and toxicity at an early stage."

A novel data gathering method, the multiple sorting task, was adopted to explore lay understanding of DAR. Participants (N = 8) were drawn from the general public. Each of the 21 stimulus cards used had the name of one sexual or romantic encounter printed on it. Participants completed one fixed sort in terms of the motivation of the male involved in the encounter. Data were analysed by means of multiple scalogram analysis (MSA). Findings show that the key factors for distinguishing sexual and romantic encounters are whether the behaviour is: consensual, contracted or forced; planned or impulsive; motivated primarily by the desire for sex or for a relationship. When motivation of the offender is considered, drug-assisted rape and sexual assault is distinguishable from other consensual sexual behaviours but not from other types of rape. Findings are discussed in terms of the limitations of the present study, the need for further research and practical applications for assisting police enquiries.

        "abstract": "The rising rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the lack of effective medications to treat its core symptoms have led to an increased sense of urgency to identify therapies for this group of neurodevelopmental conditions. Developing drugs for ASD, however, has been challenging because of a limited understanding of its pathophysiology, difficulties in modelling the disease in vitro and in vivo, the heterogeneity of symptoms, and the dearth of prior experience in clinical development. In the past few years these challenges have been mitigated by considerable advances in our understanding of forms of ASD caused by single-gene alterations, such as fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. In these cases we have gained insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions. In addition, they have aided in the development of animal models and compounds with the potential for disease modification in clinical development. Moreover, genetic studies are illuminating the molecular pathophysiology of ASD, and new tools such as induced pluripotent stem cells offer novel possibilities for drug screening and disease diagnostics. Finally, large-scale collaborations between academia and industry are starting to address some of the key barriers to developing drugs for ASD. Here, we propose a conceptual framework for drug discovery in ASD encompassing target identification, drug profiling and considerations for clinical trials in this novel area."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The goal of personalized medicine is to provide patients optimal drug screening and treatment based on individual genomic or proteomic profiles. Reverse-Phase Protein Array (RPPA) technology offers proteomic information of cancer patients which may be directly related to drug sensitivity. For cancer patients with different drug sensitivity, the proteomic profiling reveals important pathophysiologic information which can be used to predict chemotherapy responses.\\n\\nRESULTS: The goal of this paper is to present a framework for personalized medicine using both RPPA and drug sensitivity (drug resistance or intolerance). In the proposed personalized medicine system, the prediction of drug sensitivity is obtained by a proposed augmented naive Bayesian classifier (ANBC) whose edges between attributes are augmented in the network structure of naive Bayesian classifier. For discriminative structure learning of ANBC, local classification rate (LCR) is used to score augmented edges, and greedy search algorithm is used to find the discriminative structure that maximizes classification rate (CR). Once a classifier is trained by RPPA and drug sensitivity using cancer patient samples, the classifier is able to predict the drug sensitivity given RPPA information from a patient.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: In this paper we proposed a framework for personalized medicine where a patient is profiled by RPPA and drug sensitivity is predicted by ANBC and LCR. Experimental results with lung cancer data demonstrate that RPPA can be used to profile patients for drug sensitivity prediction by Bayesian network classifier, and the proposed ANBC for personalized cancer medicine achieves better prediction accuracy than naive Bayes classifier in small sample size data on average and outperforms other the state-of-the-art classifier methods in terms of classification accuracy."

In this review, we summarize state of the art high throughput assays for screening of key physicochemical properties such as solubility, lipophilicity, pKa, drug-plasma protein binding and brain tissue binding as well as in vitro ADME profiling. We discuss two primary approaches for high throughput screening of solubility, i.e. an automated 96-well plate assay integrated with LC-MS and a rapid multi-wavelength UV plate reader. We address the advantages of newly developed miniaturized techniques for high throughput pKa screening by capillary electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry (CE-MS) with automated data analysis flow. Several new lipophilicity approaches other than octanol-water partitioning are critically reviewed, including rapid liquid chromatographic retention based approach, immobilized artificial membrane (IAM) partitioning and liposome, and potential microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEEKC) for accurate screening of LogP. We highlight the sample pooling (namely cassette dosing, all-in-one, cocktail) as an efficient approach for high throughput screening of physicochemical properties and in vitro ADME profiling with emphasis on the benefit of on-line quality control. This cassette dosing approach has been widely adapted in drug discovery for rapid screening of in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters with significantly increased capacity and dramatically reduced animal usage."

        "abstract": "Biomarker-stratified cancer pharmacotherapy was pioneered in the care of breast cancer patients. The utility of agents modulating hormone receptors, synthesis of steroid hormones, or HER2-targeting agents has been greatly enhanced by the detection of predictive biomarkers in diagnostic tumor samples. Based on deeper understanding of breast cancer biology multiple drug candidates have been developed to modulate additional molecular targets which may associate with specific biomarker profiles. Accordingly, exploratory biomarkers are increasingly incorporated in early clinical trials, thus demanding a new process of patient selection. Here, we describe the implementation of preemptive, multiplexed biomarker profiling linked to standard diagnostic algorithms for metastatic breast cancer patients treated at the West German Cancer Center. Profiling for experimental biomarkers was prospectively offered to patients with metastatic breast cancer who met generic clinical trial inclusion criteria. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples were retrieved and studied for potentially \"actionable\" biomarkers related to active clinical trials by immunohistochemistry, amplicon sequencing, and in situ hybridization. The clinical course of those \"profiled\" patients was closely monitored to offer trial participation whenever applicable. Here, we report results from the first 131 patients enrolled in this program. PIK3CA mutations (23 %) and amplifications (2 %), loss of PTEN expression (13 %), and FGFR1 amplifications (8 %) were detected next to established biomarkers such as estrogen (67 %) and progesterone receptor expression (52 %), and HER2 overexpression or amplification (23 %). So far 16 \"profiled\" patients (12 %) have been enrolled in biomarker-stratified early clinical trials. Preemptive profiling of investigational biomarkers can be integrated into the diagnostic algorithm of a large Comprehensive Cancer Center. Extensive administrative efforts are required to successfully enroll \"profiled\" patients with metastatic breast cancer in early clinical trials stratified by exploratory biomarkers."

In the present study we have carried out a time-dependent hippocampal metabolite profiling analysis of mice treated with Ketamine. After a single injection of Ketamine, our metabolomics data indicate time-dependent metabolite level alterations starting already after 2\u2009h reflecting the fast antidepressant effect of the drug. In silico pathway analyses revealed that several hippocampal pathways including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway and citrate cycle are affected, apparent by changes not only in metabolite levels but also connected metabolite level ratios.

        "abstract": "Molecular and pharmacologic profiling of the NCI-60 cell panel offers the possibility of identifying pathways involved in drug resistance or sensitivity. Of these, decreased uptake of anticancer drugs mediated by efflux transporters represents one of the best studied mechanisms. Previous studies have also shown that uptake transporters can influence cytotoxicity by altering the cellular uptake of anticancer drugs. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we measured the mRNA expression of two solute carrier (SLC) families, the organic cation/zwitterion transporters (SLC22 family) and the organic anion transporters (SLCO family), totaling 23 genes in normal tissues and the NCI-60 cell panel. By correlating the mRNA expression pattern of the SLCO and SLC22 family member gene products with the growth-inhibitory profiles of 1,429 anticancer drugs and drug candidate compounds tested on the NCI-60 cell lines, we identified SLC proteins that are likely to play a dominant role in drug sensitivity. To substantiate some of the SLC-drug pairs for which the SLC member was predicted to be sensitizing, follow-up experiments were performed using engineered and characterized cell lines overexpressing SLC22A4 (OCTN1). As predicted by the statistical correlations, expression of SLC22A4 resulted in increased cellular uptake and heightened sensitivity to mitoxantrone and doxorubicin. Our results indicate that the gene expression database can be used to identify SLCO and SLC22 family members that confer sensitivity to cancer cells."

This study provides an in-depth evaluation of the method in close comparison to Caco-2, LogD, LogP, polar surface area (PSA), and quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) predictions using a large and diverse compound set. It showed that the accuracy of using artificial membrane permeability in assessing drug absorption is comparable to Caco-2, but significantly better than LogP, LogD, PSA, and QSPR predictions. This study also explored the artificial membrane composition by adopting a hydrophilic filter membrane for artificial membrane (lecithin-dodecane) support. The use of hydrophilic filter membrane increased the rate of permeation significantly and reduced the transport time to 2 h or less as compared with over 10 h when a hydrophobic filter membrane is used. \u00a9 2002 \u00c9ditions scientifiques et m\u00e9dicales Elsevier SAS.

Here, we screened a prescription drug library against the renal organic cation transporter OCT2/SLC22A2, which mediates the first step in the renal secretion of many cationic drugs. Of the 910 compounds screened, 244 inhibited OCT2. Computational analyses revealed key properties of inhibitors versus noninhibitors, which included overall molecular charge. Four of six potential clinical inhibitors were transporter-selective in follow-up screens against additional transporters: OCT1/SLC22A1, MATE1/SLC47A1, and MATE2-K/SLC47A2. Two compounds showed different kinetics of interaction with the common polymorphism OCT2-A270S, suggesting a role of genetics in modulating renal DDIs."

We demonstrate here how our network-based deconvolution approach, named target addiction score (TAS), provides insights into the functional importance of druggable protein targets in cell-based drug sensitivity testing experiments. Using cancer cell line profiling data sets, we constructed a functional classification across 107 cancer cell models, based on their common and unique target addiction signatures. The pan-cancer addiction correlations could not be explained by the tissue of origin, and only correlated in part with molecular and genomic signatures of the heterogeneous cancer cells. The TAS-based cancer cell classification was also shown to be robust to drug response data resampling, as well as predictive of the transcriptomic patterns in an independent set of cancer cells that shared similar addiction signatures with the 107 cancers. The critical protein targets identified by the integrated approach were also shown to have clinically relevant mutation frequencies in patients with various cancer subtypes, including not only well-established pan-cancer genes, such as PTEN tumor suppressor, but also a number of targets that are less frequently mutated in specific cancer types, including ABL1 oncoprotein in acute myeloid leukemia. An application to leukemia patient primary cell models demonstrated how the target deconvolution approach offers functional insights into patient-specific addiction patterns, such as those indicative of their receptor-type tyrosine-protein kinase FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) status and co-addiction partners, which may lead to clinically actionable, personalized drug treatment developments. To promote its application to the future drug testing studies, we have made available an open-source implementation of the TAS calculation in the form of a stand-alone R package."

        "abstract": "The identification of drug metabolites in biofluids such as urine, plasma, and bile, as well as in in vitro systems, is an important step in drug discovery and development. Mass spectrometry, particularly when combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-MS), can enable detailed structural information to be obtained on the metabolites of a drug or xenobiotic as a result of metabolism. The successful identification of drug metabolites by HPLC-MS-based techniques requires careful optimisation of a number of factors. First, the chromatographic separation should provide good resolution of the individual xenobiotic metabolites present in the sample. There is also the need to minimise the interference caused by the presence of endogenous metabolites, which may interfere with MS detection. Ideally, untreated samples should be profiled to reduce the likelihood of missing important metabolites due to losses during sample processing, but, depending upon the matrix, some degree of sample cleanup/extraction and concentration of the metabolites may be required using liquid-liquid or liquid-solid extraction. Second, the MS conditions must be carefully selected in order to maximise the potential of detecting the separated metabolites, which may have a very different character to the parent compound. The use of radiolabelled drugs in metabolism experiments greatly aids in the detection (and quantification) of metabolites, directing the investigator towards peaks that need to be characterised by MS. The presence of characteristic isotope patterns from either the incorporation of stable isotopes (e.g. (13)C, (15)N) or naturally occurring isotope patterns from substituents on the molecule (e.g. (35/37)Cl, (79/81)Br) can also provide a useful handle on the drug and its metabolites for the purposes of detection and spectrometric interpretation. This chapter provides guidelines for, and examples of, HPLC-MS-based drug metabolite profiling."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Combined bezafibrate (BEZ) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) exert unexpected antileukaemic activities against acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and these activities are associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the tumor cells. Although the generation of ROS by these drugs is supported by preceding studies including our own, the interrelationship between the cellular effects of the drugs and ROS generation is not well understood. Here we report the use of NMR metabolomic profiling to further study the effect of BEZ and MPA on three AML cell lines and to shed light on the underlying mechanism of action. For this we focused on drug effects induced during the initial 24 hours of treatment prior to the onset of overt cellular responses and examined these in the context of basal differences in metabolic profiles between the cell lines. Despite their ultimately profound cellular effects, the early changes in metabolic profiles engendered by these drugs were less pronounced than the constitutive metabolic differences between cell types. Nonetheless, drug treatments engendered common metabolic changes, most markedly in the response to the combination of BEZ and MPA. These responses included changes to TCA cycle intermediates consistent with recently identified chemical actions of ROS. Notable amongst these was the conversion of a-ketoglutarate to succinate which was recapitulated by the treatment of cell extracts with exogenous hydrogen peroxide. These findings indicate that the actions of combined BEZ and MPA against AML cells are indeed mediated downstream of the generation of ROS rather than some hitherto unsuspected mechanism. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that metabolite profiles represent highly sensitive markers for genomic differences between cells and their responses to external stimuli. This opens new perspectives to use metabolic profiling as a tool to study the rational redeployment of drugs in new disease settings."

They identify significant features of cell phenotypes for unsupervised learning based on maximum relevancy and minimum redundancy criteria. A 2-stage clustering approach annotates, clusters cells, and then merges them together to form super-clusters. An interpretable cell profile consisting of super-cluster proportions profiled at each drug treatment, concentration, or duration is obtained. Differential changes in super-cluster profiles are the basis for understanding the drug's differential effect and biology. The authors' method is validated by significant chi-squared statistics obtained from similar drug-treated super-cluster profiles from a 5-fold cross-validation. In addition, drug profiles of 2 microtubule drugs with equivalent mechanisms of action are statistically similar. Several distinct trends are identified for the 5 cytoskeletal drugs profiled under different conditions."

The selection of viable drug candidates among biologically active compounds requires the assessment of their transporter interaction profiles. METHODS: Using public sources, we have assembled and curated the largest, to our knowledge, human intestinal transporter database (>5,000 interaction entries for >3,700 molecules). This data was used to develop thoroughly validated classification Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models of transport and/or inhibition of several major transporters including MDR1, BCRP, MRP1-4, PEPT1, ASBT, OATP2B1, OCT1, and MCT1. RESULTS: QSAR models have been developed with advanced machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and k Nearest Neighbors using Dragon and MOE chemical descriptors. These models afforded high external prediction accuracies of 71-100% estimated by 5-fold external validation, and showed hit retrieval rates with up to 20-fold enrichment in the virtual screening of DrugBank compounds. CONCLUSIONS: The compendium of predictive QSAR models developed in this study can be used for virtual profiling of drug candidates and/or environmental agents with the optimal transporter profiles."

        "abstract": "The direct detection of drug-protein interactions in living cells is a major challenge in drug discovery research. Recently, we introduced an approach termed thermal proteome profiling (TPP), which enables the monitoring of changes in protein thermal stability across the proteome using quantitative mass spectrometry. We determined the intracellular thermal profiles for up to 7,000 proteins, and by comparing profiles derived from cultured mammalian cells in the presence or absence of a drug we showed that it was possible to identify direct and indirect targets of drugs in living cells in an unbiased manner. Here we demonstrate the complete workflow using the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. The key to this approach is the use of isobaric tandem mass tag 10-plex (TMT10) reagents to label digested protein samples corresponding to each temperature point in the melting curve so that the samples can be analyzed by multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry. Important steps in the bioinformatic analysis include data normalization, melting curve fitting and statistical significance determination of compound concentration-dependent changes in protein stability. All analysis tools are made freely available as R and Python packages. The workflow can be completed in 2 weeks."

A significant number of genes and a limited subset of miRNAs were commonly dysregulated, which were further validated using qRT-PCR. GO and KEGG pathway analyses of the commonly dysregulated genes indicated that the MAPK signalling pathway may be involved in multidrug resistance, which was further validated using immunoblotting and MTT assay. Finally a primary multidrug resistance network in gastric cancer, consisting of the commonly dysregulated genes and miRNAs, was established and functional miRNA-mRNA pairs were identified. The commonly dysregulated genes and miRNAs identified in this study may represent good therapeutic targets and further study of these targets may increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying multidrug resistance. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

Using three FCB fluorophores, we were able to barcode and combine entire 96-well plates, reducing antibody consumption 100-fold and acquisition time to 5-15 min per plate. Using FCB and phospho-specific flow cytometry, we screened a small-molecule library for inhibitors of T cell-receptor and cytokine signaling, simultaneously determining compound efficacy and selectivity.

In this work, we compare (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) profiling for obtaining the mutual-diffusion coefficient (D(m)(gel)) of a drug in hydrogel with results obtained from conventional source/sink experiments. Despite the fact that NMR profiling is a powerful approach for measuring transport properties, it is rarely used for characterizing drug diffusion in gel matrices in pharmaceutical sciences. This work provides an illustration of the applicability of this technique and highlights its advantages for studying drug release systems. The comparison with results obtained from the source/sink experiment clearly establishes the validity of the NMR profiling approach. Alendronate was used as a model drug while curdlan, a gel-forming bacterial polysaccharide, served as a model biomaterial. The determined (D(m)(gel)) value (5.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10(-10) m(2)/s) agrees with the one obtained from a conventional source/sink experiment (5.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 10(-10) m(2)/s).

However, such practical examples of phenotypic profiling of drug response published to date have largely been restricted to cell lines and phenotypic response markers that are amenable to basic cellular imaging. As such, these approaches preclude the analysis of both complex heterogeneous phenotypic responses and subtle changes in cell morphology across physiologically relevant cell panels. Here, we describe the application of a cell-based assay and custom designed image analysis algorithms designed to monitor morphologic phenotypic response in detail across distinct cancer cell types. We further describe the integration of these methods with automated data analysis workflows incorporating principal component analysis, Kohonen neural networking, and kNN classification to enable rapid and robust interrogation of such data sets. We show the utility of these approaches by providing novel insight into pharmacologic response across four cancer cell types, Ovcar3, MiaPaCa2, and MCF7 cells wild-type and mutant for p53. These methods have the potential to drive the development of a new generation of novel therapeutic classes encompassing pharmacologic compositions or polypharmacology in appropriate disease context."

        "abstract": "The rate at which a drug or other small solute interacts with a protein is important in understanding the biological and pharmacokinetic behavior of these agents. One approach that has been developed for examining these rates involves the use of high-performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) and estimates of band-broadening through peak profiling. Previous work with this method has been based on a comparison of the statistical moments for a retained analyte versus nonretained species at a single, high flow rate to obtain information on stationary phase mass transfer. In this study an alternative approach was created that allows a broad range of flow rates to be used for examining solute-protein dissociation rates. Chromatographic theory was employed to derive equations that could be used with this approach on a single column, as well as with multiple columns to evaluate and correct for the impact of stagnant mobile phase mass transfer. The interaction of L-tryptophan with human serum albumin was used as a model system to test this method. A dissociation rate constant of 2.7 (+/-0.2) s(-1) was obtained by this approach at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C, which was in good agreement with previous values determined by other methods. The techniques described in this report can be applied to other biomolecular systems and should be valuable for the determination of drug-protein dissociation rates."

        "abstract": "The use of dissimilar chromatographic systems in drug impurity profiling can be very advantageous. Screening a new-drug impurity mixture on those systems not only enhances the chance that all impurities are revealed, but also allows choosing a suited system for further method development. In this paper several strategies were evaluated to predict the optimal pH (of the buffer used in the mobile phase) from the screening results. Four or five dissimilar stationary phases were screened at four pH values (between 2.5 and 9.4), in order to obtain maximal information about the composition of the sample and to select one column for the subsequent optimization. Different linear models (straight lines, 2nd and 3rd degree polynomials) based on these experiments were tested for their ability to predict the retention times (tR) of the impurities at intermediate pH values. The predicted tR values were then used to calculate minimal resolutions and eventually to select an optimal pH at which the highest minimal resolution is predicted. None of the applied models is accurate enough to predict correctly which peaks are worst separated at the indicated optimal pH. However, the best strategy (applying a second degree polynomial describing the tR measured at 3 consecutive screening pH values) did succeed in indicating an optimal pH at which a good separation of the impurities is obtained. Unfortunately, the resulting separation quality is not or only slightly better than the best separation obtained during screening. Therefore, it can be concluded that the most (time-) efficient approach to develop an impurity profile of a new drug is to screen it on four or five dissimilar columns at four different pH values and to retain the best screening conditions (without making predictions for intermediate conditions) for further optimization of the organic modifier composition of the mobile phase, and occasionally the temperature and the gradient. This is at least the case when the profiles have a complexity similar to those studied. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However, patients receiving oral therapy are at high risk for drug-drug interactions (DDIs). OBJECTIVE: To create a drug profile for each clinically significant DDI involving selected oral anticancer agents and evaluate the agreement between 2 commonly used DDI compendia: Drug Interaction Facts (DIF) 2008 and Micromedex DRUGDEX. METHODS: DDI profiles were developed based on primary and tertiary literature reviews. DIF 2008 and Micromedex DRUGDEX were compared to assess the consistency of listings, severity, and scientific evidence ratings of DDIs involving the oral anticancer agents that were selected. The Spearman correlation test was used to assess the correlation of the severity ratings between the 2 compendia. RESULTS: A total of 184 DDIs were identified. A DDI profile was created for 40 of these that met the predetermined criteria for clinically significant interactions. The comparative assessment showed inconsistency in DDI listings (15.2% of those identified were listed in DIF only and 46.7% were listed in Micromedex only), severity ratings (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.49), and scientific evidence ratings (disagreement 25.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The discrepancies in DDI listing and rating systems between the compendia evaluated here reflect the need for more studies to standardize the definitions and classifications of DDIs."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Recent 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) molecular profiling of the stomach mucosa revealed a surprising complexity of microbiota. Helicobacter pylori infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use are two main contributors to gastritis and peptic ulcer. However, little is known about the association between other members of the stomach microbiota and gastric diseases. In this study, cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA was used to profile the stomach microbiota from normal and gastritis patients. One hundred and thirty three phylotypes from eight bacterial phyla were identified. The stomach microbiota was found to be closely adhered to the mucosa. Eleven Streptococcus phylotypes were successfully cultivated from the biopsies. One to two genera represented a majority of clones within any of the identified phyla. We further developed two real-time quantitative PCR assays to quantify the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum and the Streptococcus genus. Significantly higher abundance of the Firmicutes phylum and the Streptococcus genus within the Firmicutes phylum was observed in patients with antral gastritis, compared with normal controls. This study suggests that the genus taxon level can largely represent much higher taxa such as the phylum. The clinical relevance and the mechanism underlying the altered microbiota composition in gastritis require further functional studies."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Despite great progress in antipsychotic drug research, the molecular mechanisms by which these drugs work have remained elusive. High-throughput gene profiling methods have advanced this field by allowing the simultaneous investigation of hundreds to thousands of genes. However, different methodologies, choice of brain region, and drugs studied have made comparisons across different studies difficult. Because of the complexity of gene expression changes caused by drugs, teasing out the most relevant expression differences is a challenging task. One approach is to focus on gene expression changes that converge on the same systems that were previously deemed important to the pathology of psychiatric disorders. From the microarray studies performed on human postmortem brain samples from schizophrenics, the systems most implicated to be dysfunctional are synaptic machinery, oligodendrocyte/myelin function, and mitochondrial/ubiquitin metabolism. Drugs may act directly or indirectly to compensate for underlying pathological deficits in schizophrenia or via other mechanisms that converge on these pathways. Side effects, consisting of motor and metabolic dysfunction (which occur with typical and atypical drugs, respectively), also may be mediated by gene expression changes that have been reported in these studies. This article surveys both the convergent antipsychotic mechanisms and the genes that may be responsible for other effects elicited by antipsychotic drugs."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) induces a pathological complete response (pCR) in ~30% of patients with breast cancer. However, many patients have residual cancer after chemotherapy, which correlates with a higher risk of metastatic recurrence and poorer outcome than those who achieve a pCR. We hypothesized that molecular profiling of tumors after NAC would identify genes associated with drug resistance. Digital transcript counting was used to profile surgically resected breast cancers after NAC. Low concentrations of dual specificity protein phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), an ERK phosphatase, correlated with high post-NAC tumor cell proliferation and with basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) status. BLBC had higher DUSP4 promoter methylation and gene expression patterns of Ras-ERK pathway activation relative to other breast cancer subtypes. DUSP4 overexpression increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, whereas DUSP4 depletion dampened the response to chemotherapy. Reduced DUSP4 expression in primary tumors after NAC was associated with treatment-refractory high Ki-67 scores and shorter recurrence-free survival. Finally, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) synergized with docetaxel treatment in BLBC xenografts. Thus, DUSP4 downregulation activates the Ras-ERK pathway in BLBC, resulting in an attenuated response to anti-cancer chemotherapy."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Capillary electrophoresis/mass spectrometry (CE/MS) is predominantly carried out using electrospray ionization (ESI). Recently, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) have become available for CE/MS. With the VUV lamp turned off, the APPI source may also be used for CE/MS by thermospray ionization (TSI). In the present study the suitability of ESI, APCI, APPI and TSI for drug impurity profiling by CE/MS in the positive ion mode is evaluated. The drugs carbachol, lidocaine and proguanil and their potential impurities were used as test compounds, representing different molecular polarities. A background electrolyte of 100mM acetic acid (pH 4.5) provided baseline separation of nearly all impurities from the respective drugs. APPI yielded both even-and odd-electron ions, whereas the other ionization techniques produced even-electron ions only. In-source fragmentation was more pronounced with APCI and APPI than with ESI and TSI, which was most obvious for proguanil and its impurities. Ingeneral, ESI and TSI appeared the most efficient ionization techniques for impurities that are charged in solution achieving detection limits of 100 ng/mL (full-scan mode). APPI and APCI showed a lower efficiency, but allowed ionization of low and high polarity analytes, although quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g. carbachol) could not be detected. Largely neutral compounds, such as the lidocaine impurity 2,6-dimethylaniline, could not be detected by TSI, and yielded similar detection limits (500ng/mL) for ESI, APPI and APCI. In many cases, impurity detection at the 0.1% (w/w) level was possible when 1mg/mL of parent drug was injected with at least one of the CE/MS systems. Overall, the tested CE/MS systems provide complementary information as illustrated by the detection and identification of an unknown impurity in carbachol.

We describe an evaluation method for\\nlinking methamphetamine (MA) seizures using stable carbon and nitrogen\\nisotopic compositions concurrently with gas chromatographic impurity\\nprofiling, which is one of the major methods of drug profiling. Several\\nsets of MA seized in Japan, whose investigative information indicated\\nlinkages, were analyzed.

The stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of the\\nMA seizures varied between -29.40 and -24.90 (delta(13)C) and -2.29 and\\n5.94 (delta(15)N), respectively. In the delta(13)C-delta(15)N graph, MA\\nseizures were classified into seven groups, probably reflecting\\ndifferent origins. The size of the cluster in the isotopic-composition\\ngraph was determined by pooled standard deviations (s(p)), the pooled\\nestimates of measurement uncertainty. The sizes of the clusters were\\nless than 6s(p) and the linkages between the MA seizures from the\\nisotopic compositions were consistent with the impurity profiling and\\ninvestigative information.

        "abstract": "Expression pharmacogenomics includes differential gene expression (DGE) profiling of drug responses in model systems to generate a set of differentially modulated drug-responsive genes which can serve as a surrogate measure for drug action. In this manner, expression pharmacogenomics bridges the fields of genomics and medicinal chemistry. Additionally, modulated genes can be organized into metabolic and signaling pathways that highlight the mechanism of drug activity in a selected tissue. Here, we describe the application of expression pharmacogenomics to characterize a drug response in the clinically relevant in vivo model, the Sprague-Dawley rat. Following oral dosing of rats with GW9578, a novel synthetic peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) ligand indicated for lipid disorders, we applied GeneCalling, a differential mRNA transcript profiling technique, to rat liver cDNA. Following GW9578 treatment, 2.4% of the rat liver genes were differentially expressed. We confirmed the sequence identity of 50 distinctly modulated genes. DGE was observed among genes representative of at least six discrete metabolic pathways. Furthermore, we observed up-regulation of 20 genes involved in mitochondrial, peroxisomal and microsomal fatty acid oxidation, consistent with molecular biological and clinical data indicating PPAR alpha ligand principal efficacy to be through increasing fatty acid metabolism. Those pathways regulated in our study that are potentially contributory to target effect, non-target adverse effects, or of unknown consequence include xenobiotic detoxification and steroid modification. Finally, comprehensive drug response profiling can lead to the serendipitous discovery of novel disease indications. In this case, these results suggest a potential novel indication for GW9578 in the treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. We have shown, therefore, that the organization of DGE results into metabolic and signaling pathways can elucidate mechanisms of pharmacologically desired (i.e., efficacious) and, where appropriate, undesired (i.e., potentially deleterious) effects."

We used logistic regression models that accounted for the clustered survey design to identify the determinants of care seeking outside the home and antibiotic use for 2914 cases of recent acute illness.\\n\\nRESULTS: Overall, 95% of individuals with acute illness took medicines, 90% sought care outside their homes and 36% took antibiotics. In multivariate analyses, illness severity was a strong predictor of seeking care outside the home. Among those who sought outside care, the strongest predictor of antibiotic use was the presence of upper respiratory symptoms (OR: 3.02, CI: 2.36-3.86, P<0.001), followed by gastrointestinal symptoms or difficulty breathing, and antibiotics use was less likely if they had fever. The odds of receiving antibiotics were higher when visiting a public hospital or more than one healthcare facility.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The nature and severity of symptoms and patterns of care seeking had the greatest influence on decisions to take antibiotics. Antibiotics were widely available and inappropriately used in all settings. Policies to regulate antibiotics distribution as well as interventions to educate prescribers, dispensers and consumers are needed to improve antibiotic use."

        "abstract": "Multidimensional gas chromatography (MDGC), and especially its latest incarnation-comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC \u00d7 GC)-have proved advantageous over and above classic one-dimensional gas chromatography (1D GC) in many areas of analysis by offering improved peak capacity, often enhanced sensitivity and, especially in the case of GC \u00d7 GC, the unique feature of 'structured' chromatograms. This article reviews recent advances in MDGC and GC \u00d7 GC in drug analysis with special focus on ecstasy, heroin and cocaine profiling. Although 1D GC is still the method of choice for drug profiling in most laboratories because of its simplicity and instrument availability, GC \u00d7 GC is a tempting proposition for this purpose because of its ability to generate a higher net information content. Effluent refocusing due to the modulation (compression) process, combined with the separation on two 'orthogonal' columns, results in more components being well resolved and therefore being analytically and statistically useful to the profile. The spread of the components in the two-dimensional plots is strongly dependent on the extent of retention 'orthogonality' (i.e. the extent to which the two phases possess different or independent retention mechanisms towards sample constituents) between the two columns. The benefits of 'information-driven' drug profiling, where more points of reference are usually required for sample differentiation, are discussed. In addition, several limitations in application of MDGC in drug profiling, including data acquisition rate, column temperature limit, column phase orthogonality and chiral separation, are considered and discussed. Although the review focuses on the articles published in the last decade, a brief chronological preview of the profiling methods used throughout the last three decades is given. \u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag."

It therefore deserves more attention at an early step in the drug discovery pipeline. Here, we summarize the technologies that are currently in use for phenotypic profiling--including mRNA-, protein- and imaging-based multi-parameter profiling--in the drug discovery context. We think that an earlier integration of phenotypic profiling technologies, combined with effective experimental and in silico target identification approaches, can improve success rates of lead selection and optimization in the drug discovery process."

We have used multi-electrode array (MEA) analysis of hESC-CM to generate multi-parameter data to profile drug impact on cardiomyocyte electrophysiology using a panel of 21 compounds active against key cardiac ion channels. Our study is the first to apply multi-parameter phenotypic profiling and clustering techniques commonly used for high-content imaging and microarray data to the analysis of electrophysiology data obtained by MEA analysis. Our data show good correlations with previous studies in stem cell derived cardiomyocytes and demonstrate improved specificity in compound risk assignment over convention single-parametric approaches. These analyses indicate great potential for multi-parameter MEA data acquired from hESC-CM to enable drug electrophysiological liabilities to be assessed in pre-clinical cardiotoxicity assays, facilitating informed decision making and liability management at the optimum point in drug development."

Chagas disease is the result of long-term, persistent infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The current therapies for treating T. cruzi infection and thus preventing Chagas disease often have adverse effects, unpredictable efficacy and require long courses of treatment. Development of new therapies has been very limited, in part due to lack of interest but also as a result of poor support and inappropriate models for discovering and evaluating candidate drugs. The Chagas Drug Discovery Consortium (CDDC) was created with funding from the US National Institutes of Health to help address some of these issues. The goals of the CDDC are to discover and evaluate new candidate drugs and develop rigorous assays of drug efficacy. This report summarizes the second meeting of the CDDC in November 2010."

        "abstract": "Kinases are involved in the regulation of many cellular processes and aberrant kinase signaling has been implicated in human disease. As a consequence, kinases are attractive drug targets. Assessing kinase function and drug selectivity in a more physiological context is challenging and often hampered by the generally low expression level of kinases and the extensive post-translation modification in vivo. Kinase drug selectivity screens by chemical proteomics have gained attention because they allow the profiling of hundreds of kinases against one drug at the same time. Here, we directly compared two such methods, notably, immobilized broad spectrum kinase inhibitors (kinobeads) and active site labeling using desthiobiotin-ATP and -ADP probes. Affinity purification of ?100 kinases by either kinobeads or ATP/ADP probes was readily achieved using 1 mg of cellular protein. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a high degree of complementarity of the two techniques. Kinobeads covered the Tyrosine Kinase family particularly well and ATP probes enriched higher numbers of STE family kinases. A consecutive combination of both enrichment strategies therefore allowed for the coverage of a larger part of the kinome than any one technique alone. While kinobeads are very selective for kinases, the ATP/ADP probes also enriched a large number of other nucleotide binding proteins. Both methods were applied to the selectivity profiling of the small molecular Aurora kinase inhibitor tozasertib in K562 cells. Our data confirmed Aurora A, B, and BCR-ABL as the main targets of tozasertib and identified TNK1, STK2, RPS6KA1, and RPS6KA3 as submicromolar off targets."

There is an urgent need for the development of new drugs against African trypanosomiasis due to the lack of vaccines and effective drugs. Orlistat (also called tetrahydrolipstatin or THL) is an FDA-approved antiobesity drug targeting primarily the pancreatic and gastric lipases within the gastrointestinal tract. It shows potential activities against tumors, mycobacteria, and parasites. Herein, we report the synthesis and evaluation of an expanded set of orlistat-like compounds, some of which showed highly potent trypanocidal activities in both the bloodstream form (BSF) and the procyclic form (PCF) of T. brucei. Subsequent in situ parasite-based proteome profiling was carried out to elucidate potential cellular targets of the drug in both forms. Some newly identified targets were further validated by the labeling of recombinantly expressed enzymes in Escherichia coli lysates. Bioimaging experiments with a selected compound were carried out to study the cellular uptake of the drug in T. brucei. Results indicated that orlistat is much more efficiently taken up by the BSF than the PCF of T. brucei and has clear effects on the morphology of mitochondria, glycosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum in both BSF and PCF cells. These results support specific effects of orlistat on these organelles and correlate well with our in situ proteome profiling. Given the economic challenges of de novo drug development for neglected diseases, we hope that our findings will stimulate further research towards the conversion of orlistat-like compounds into new trypanocidal drugs."

This demands a new process of patient selection for clinical trials.\\n\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Starting January 1, 2012, preemptive biomarker profiling was offered at the West German Cancer Center to all patients with advanced non-small-cell lung (NSCLC) or colorectal cancer (CRC), who met generic study inclusion criteria. Tumour specimens were subjected to prespecified profiling algorithms to detect 'actionable biomarkers' by amplicon sequencing, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. The clinical course was closely monitored to offer trial participation whenever applicable.\\n\\nRESULTS: Within 12 months, 267 patients (188 NSCLC, 79 CRC) were profiled. Estimated additional cost for biomarker profiling was 219615.51 EUR excluding histopathology workup and administration. The most prevalent biomarkers in pulmonary adenocarcinoma were KRAS mutations (29%), loss of PTEN expression (18%), EGFR mutations (9%), HER2 amplification (5%) and BRAF mutations (3%), while the prevalence of ALK translocations and PIK3CA mutations was extremely low. In pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma FGFR1 amplifications were found in 15%, PTEN expression was lost in 20% and DDR2 was mutated in a single case. KRAS mutations (41%) predominated in CRC, followed by loss of PTEN expression (16%), PIK3CA (5%) and BRAF (5%) mutations. So far 13 patients (5%) have entered biomarker-stratified clinical trials. Therapeutic decisions for approved drugs were guided in another 45 patients (17%).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Preemptive biomarker profiling can be implemented into the diagnostic algorithm of a large Comprehensive Cancer Center. Substantial investments in diagnostics and administration are required."

An optimization study of one of the most important tablet properties, disintegration time, revealed that excipients with Principal Properties (PP's) that were predicted as suitable by the model were not represented within the studied material. The feasibility of using mixtures of excipients in the multivariate approach to tablet formulation to solve this problem has been investigated in the present study. By mixing different excipients of the same excipient class, it should be possible to obtain mixtures with the predicted PP's, which in turn should give a formulation with the desired properties. In order to investigate the utility of this approach, separate mixture designs were applied to both binders and fillers (diluents). As reported here, the Partial Least Squares Projections to Latent Structures (PLS) model developed in the previously published screening study has been validated in the sense that the interesting region of the PP space identified in it has been shown to contain excipients, pure or mixed, that give the formulation suitable properties. Formulations with suitable properties were found with the mixture experiments. The local models also offer several alternatives for the composition of the formulation that yield the desired disintegration time."

Alemtuzumab is also investigated in previously untreated patients with this leukemia. The results of a prospective randomized Phase III study (CAM307 trial) comparing chlorambucil with alemtuzumab in the first-line treatment of progressive B-CLL were recently published. The overall response rate, complete remission rate, and progression-free survival were all superior for alemtuzumab. Moreover, elimination of minimal residual disease occurred in one third of complete responders to alemtuzumab and none to chlorambucil. Adverse events were similar in both arms with the exception of infusion-related reactions and cytomegalovirus infections. In 2001, alemtuzumab was approved in the USA and Europe as a third-line therapy for patients with B-CLL who had been treated with alkylating agents and failed fludarabine therapy. In September 2007, the US FDA, on the basis of CAM307 results, approved alemtuzumab for the treatment of previously untreated patients with B-CLL. Moreover, the European Commission recently granted marketing authorization to alemtuzumab for the treatment of patients with B-CLL for whom fludarabine combination monotherapy is not appropriate."

However, in order to address these aims it was important to, first, assess whether the test of delayed self-recognition (DSR) is a valid measure for the development of the TES, and, second, to propose and evaluate a theoretical model that describes what factors influence the development of the TES. The validity of the DSR test was verified by comparing the performance of 57 children on the DSR test to their performance on a meta-representational task (modified false belief task) and to a task that was essentially the same as the DSR test but was specifically designed to rely on the capacity to entertain secondary representations (i.e., surprise body task). Longitudinal testing of the children showed that at the mental age (MA) of 2.5 years they failed the DSR test, despite training them to understand the intended functions of the medium used in the DSR test; whereas, with training, children at the MA of 3.0 and 3.5 years exhibited DSR. Children at the MA of 4 years exhibited DSR without any training. Finally, results suggest that children's meta-representational ability was the only factor that contributed to the prediction of successful performance on the DSR test, and thus to the emergence of the TES. Furthermore, prospective longitudinal data revealed that caregiver conversational style was the only factor that contributed to the prediction of level of training required to pass the DSR test. That is, children of low-elaborative caregivers required significantly more training to pass the DSR test than children of high-elaborative caregivers, indicating that children who received more elaborative conversational input from their caregivers had a more advanced understanding of their TES."

A significant barrier in mass profiling is the inability of existing methods to handle pleomorphic cellular clusters and clumps, which are more commonly present in patient-derived samples or tissue cultures than are isolated single cells. Here we demonstrate automated Live Cell Interferometry (LCI) as a rapid and accurate quantifier of the sensitivity of single cell and colony-forming human breast cancer cell lines to the HER2-directed monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin). The relative sensitivities of small samples (<500 cells) of four breast cancer cell lines were determined tens-to-hundreds of times faster than is possible with traditional proliferation assays. These LCI advances in clustered sample assessment and speed open up the possibility for therapeutic response testing of patient-derived solid tumor samples, which are viable only for short periods ex vivo and likely to be in the form of cell aggregates and clusters."

        "abstract": "Profiling of putative lead compounds against a representative panel of relevant enzymes, receptors, ion channels, and transporters is a pragmatic approach to establish a preliminary view of potential issues that might later hamper development. An early idea of which off-target activities must be minimized can save valuable time and money during the preclinical lead optimization phase if pivotal questions are asked beyond the usual profiling at hERG. The best data for critical evaluation of activity at ion channels is obtained using functional assays, since binding assays cannot detect all interactions and do not provide information on whether the interaction is that of an agonist, antagonist, or allosteric modulator. For ion channels present in human cardiac muscle, depending on the required throughput, manual-, or automated-patch-clamp methodologies can be easily used to evaluate compounds individually to accurately reveal any potential liabilities. The issue of expanding screening capacity against a cardiac panel has recently been addressed by developing a series of robust, high-throughput, cell-based counter-screening assays employing fluorescence-based readouts. Similar assay development approaches can be used to configure panels of efficacy assays that can be used to assess selectivity within a family of related ion channels, such as Nav1.X channels. This overview discusses the benefits of in vitro assays, specific decision points where profiling can be of immediate benefit, and highlights the development and validation of patch-clamp and fluorescence-based profiling assays for ion channels (for examples of fluorescence-based assays, see Bhave et al., 2010; and for high-throughput patch-clamp assays see Mathes, 2006; Schr\u00f8der et al., 2008)."

The monolithic capillary affinity columns were prepared through a single-step copolymerization of the drug derivatives with glycidyl methacrylate and ethylene dimethacrylate. The capillary chromatography with the affinity monolithic column facilitates the purification of the drug binding proteins from the cell lysate. By combining the capillary affinity column purification and the shot-gun proteomic analysis, totally 33 FK506- and 32 CsA-binding proteins including all the literature reported target proteins of these two drugs were identified. Among them, two proteins, namely voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 and serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PGAM5 were verified by using the recombinant proteins. The result supports that the monolithic capillary affinity chromatography is likely to become a valuable tool for profiling of binding proteins of small molecular drugs as well as bioactive compounds. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V."

As part of the Oral Biopharmaceutical Tools (OrBiTo) project, this review provides a summary of the pharmaceutical profiling methods available, with focus on in silico and in vitro models typically used to forecast active pharmaceutical ingredient's (APIs) in vivo performance after oral administration. An overview of the composition of human, animal and simulated gastrointestinal (GI) fluids is provided and state-of-the art methodologies to study API properties impacting on oral absorption are reviewed. Assays performed during early development, i.e. physicochemical characterization, dissolution profiles under physiological conditions, permeability assays and the impact of excipients on these properties are discussed in detail and future demands on pharmaceutical profiling are identified. It is expected that innovative computational and experimental methods that better describe molecular processes involved in vivo during dissolution and absorption of APIs will be developed in the OrBiTo. These methods will provide early insights into successful pathways (medicinal chemistry or formulation strategy) and are anticipated to increase the number of new APIs with good oral absorption being discovered. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Systematic, efficient, and simultaneous evaluation of drug-metabolizing gene expression in response to chemicals has a wide variety of implications in drug development, disease prevention, and personalized medicine and nutrition. In the current study, the authors have systematically and simultaneously evaluated the hepatic expression profile of drug-metabolizing enzymes in cultured human hepatocytes exposed to the xenobiotics rifampicin, omeprazole, and 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) using the Drug Metabolism RT(2)Profiler PCR Arrays. This new high-throughput tool allowed the authors to evaluate the expression of genes coding for 84 drug-metabolizing enzymes (including phase 1 and phase 2 drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters) simultaneously, in a 96-well format using a small amount of experimental materials. To validate the quality of the Drug Metabolism RT(2)Profiler PCR Arrays, the PCR Array was compared with the well-documented platform TaqMan assay, and a high concordance was shown between these 2 methods, indicating the high reliability of the Drug Metabolism RT(2)Profiler PCR Arrays. In addition, increasing or decreasing the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes by these 3 compounds was observed, and underlying mechanisms are discussed."

        "abstract": "PG2 is a botanical drug that is mostly composed of Astragalus polysaccharides (APS). Its role in hematopoiesis and relieving cancer-related fatigue has recently been clinically investigated in cancer patients. However, systematic analyses of its functions are still limited. The aim of this study was to use microarray-based expression profiling to evaluate the quality and consistency of PG2 from three different product batches and to study biological mechanisms of PG2. An integrative molecular analysis approach has been designed to examine significant PG2-induced signatures in HL-60 leukemia cells. A quantitative analysis of gene expression signatures was conducted for PG2 by hierarchical clustering of correlation coefficients. The results showed that PG2 product batches were consistent and of high quality. These batches were also functionally equivalent to each other with regard to how they modulated the immune and hematopoietic systems. Within the PG2 signature, there were five genes associated with doxorubicin: IL-8, MDM4, BCL2, PRODH2, and BIRC5. Moreover, the combination of PG2 and doxorubicin had a synergistic effect on induced cell death in HL-60 cells. Together with the bioinformatics-based approach, gene expression profiling provided a quantitative measurement for the quality and consistency of herbal medicines and revealed new roles (e.g., immune modulation) for PG2 in cancer treatment."

        "abstract": "We profiled the expression of the 48 human nuclear receptors (NRs) by quantitative RT-PCR in 51 human cancer cell lines of the NCI60 collection derived from nine different tissues. NR mRNA expression accurately classified melanoma, colon, and renal cancers, whereas lung, breast, prostate, central nervous system, and leukemia cell lines exhibited heterogeneous receptor expression. Importantly, receptor mRNA levels faithfully predicted the growth-inhibitory qualities of receptor ligands in nonendocrine tumors. Correlation analysis using NR expression profiles and drug response information across the cell line panel uncovered a number of new potential receptor-drug interactions, suggesting that in these cases, individual receptor levels may predict response to chemotherapeutic interventions. Similarly, by cross-comparing receptor levels within our expression dataset and relating these profiles to existing microarray gene expression data, we defined interactions among receptors and between receptors and other genes that can now be mechanistically queried. This work supports the strategy of using NR expression profiling to classify various types of cancer, define NR-drug interactions and receptor-gene networks, predict cancer-drug sensitivity, and identify druggable targets that may be pharmacologically manipulated for potential therapeutic intervention."

Three models were then explored that test for consistency across these themes.

The implications of these results for offender profiling and further study of serial homicide are discussed."

The Bayesian approach is appropriate as the second part is conditional on the first part. The introduction gives the background behind the methodology and suggests how future improvements can be made by integrating new information. Finally, the papers in the special issue are introduced.

Monitoring global cellular responses to perturbation due to disease, drug treatment or toxicity is achieved using molecular profiling methods such as DNA microarrays, proteomics and metabonomics. Unique fingerprints composed of molecular changes are captured and subjected to interpretation with the goal of class discovery, comparison or prediction. Each fingerprint reflects a cumulative response of complex molecular interactions, and if these interactions can be significantly correlated to an end point, the molecular fingerprint may be qualified as a predictive biomarker. Furthermore, in cases where the predictive power of any single response or set of responses is statistically significant, a molecular fingerprint can provide novel information related to the underlying disease biology or mechanism of toxicity. There is an acute need for effective biomarkers in every phase of drug development, from discovery, to preclinical studies, through to clinical trials. The context in which these molecular biomarkers are used will depend upon the nature of the biological problem being addressed. This review will summarise experimental and computational efforts in the field of molecular profiling and discuss the significant challenges in interpreting molecular profiling data and qualifying novel transcriptional biomarkers."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Proapoptotic drugs are a mainstay of cancer drug treatment. These drugs stress cells and ultimately trigger the activation of caspases, cysteine-class proteases that cleave after aspartic acid and deconstruct the cell. It is well known that cells respond differently to proapoptotic cancer drug treatments. Here, using a global and unbiased quantitative N-terminomics technology, we show that ~500 products of caspase cleavage and their kinetics vary dramatically between cell type and cytotoxic drug treatment. It is likely that variations arise from differences in baseline proteome composition of the cell type and the alterations induced by drug treatments to yield a unique cohort of proteins that caspases finally target. Many targets are specific to both drug treatment and cell type, providing candidate-specific biomarkers for apoptosis. For example, in multiple myeloma cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, levels of activating transcription factor-4 increase dramatically early in drug treatment and then decrease upon cleavage by activated caspases. Thus, caspase-derived cleavage products are a sensitive reflection of cell-type and drug-induced stress, and provide useful fingerprints for mechanisms of drug action and response."

Since drug development is lengthy and expensive, a drug repurposing strategy offers an attractive fast-track approach to speed up the process. A set of 100 registered drugs with drug repositioning potential for neglected diseases was assembled and tested in vitro against four protozoan parasites associated with the aforementioned diseases. Several drugs and drug classes showed in vitro activity in those screening assays. The results are critically reviewed and discussed in the perspective of a follow-up drug repositioning strategy where R&D has to be addressed with limited resources."

These metastases have genetically evolved from primary tumors. Furthermore, their interaction with the tissue microenvironment plays an important role in all phases of disease development. These facts have only partially been taken into consideration when profiling anti-cancer compounds foreseen to treat patients with disseminated metastatic disease. In this perspective, we discuss the unique features of metastatic disease and review the model systems available for drug profiling. Based on an analysis of how compounds are profiled today in pre-clinical models of metastatic disease and what would be desirable and possible with the present know-how, we recommend a refined profiling process to validate drugs with potential to treat patients with overt metastatic disease."

In this work, the ability of TopCount, a microplate scintillation counter, to act as a suitable radiodetection system for ultra-performance liquid chromatography methods is tested. TopCount, has innumerable benefits over more traditional on-line radioactivity flow detection methods, when dealing with the narrow peak widths and small peak volumes associated with the enhanced efficiency of sub-2 \u03bcm columns.

To this end, first the UHPLC system volume and variance were evaluated. Then, a mixture of 17 drugs and various metabolites (molecular mass of 151-749. Da, log. P of -1.04 to 6.7), was injected on six sub-2. ??m particle columns. Five newest generation core shell technology columns were compared and tested against one column packed with porous particles. Two aqueous (pH 2.7 and 6.8) and two organic mobile phases were evaluated, first with the same flow and temperature and subsequently at each column's individual limit of temperature and pressure. The results demonstrated that pre-column dead volume had negligible influence on the peak capacity and shape. In contrast, a decrease in post-column volume of 57% resulted in a substantial (47%) increase in median peak capacity and significantly improved peak shape. When the various combinations of stationary and mobile phases were used at the same flow rate (0.5. mL/min) and temperature (45. ??C), limited differences were observed between the median peak capacities, with a maximum of 26%. At higher flow though (up to 0.9. mL/min), a maximum difference of almost 40% in median peak capacity was found between columns. The finally selected combination of solid-core particle column and mobile phase composition was chosen for its selectivity, peak capacity, wide applicability and peak shape. The developed method was applied to rat hepatocyte samples incubated with the drug buspirone and demonstrated to provide a similar chromatographic resolution, but a 6 times higher signal-to-noise ratio than a more traditional UHPLC metabolite profiling method using a fully porous particle packed column, within one third of the analysis time. In conclusion, a widely applicable, selective and fast chromatographic method was developed that can be applied to perform drug metabolite profiling in the timeframe of a quantitative analysis. It is envisioned that this method will in future be used for simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis and can therefore be considered a first important step in the Quan/Qual workflow."

It is argued that MHA was formed as a result of the addition of mannitol, as diluent, before the acetylating step in the process of the heroin preparation. This early dilution in the production and distribution chain of the illicit drug is deemed as peculiar, nonetheless it may be highly indicative of a specific production process of heroin in a trafficking organization. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "The direct detection of drug-protein interactions in living cells is a major challenge in drug discovery research. Recently, we introduced an approach termed thermal proteome profiling (TPP), which enables the monitoring of changes in protein thermal stability across the proteome using quantitative mass spectrometry. We determined the intracellular thermal profiles for up to 7,000 proteins, and by comparing profiles derived from cultured mammalian cells in the presence or absence of a drug we showed that it was possible to identify direct and indirect targets of drugs in living cells in an unbiased manner. Here we demonstrate the complete workflow using the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. The key to this approach is the use of isobaric tandem mass tag 10-plex (TMT10) reagents to label digested protein samples corresponding to each temperature point in the melting curve so that the samples can be analyzed by multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry. Important steps in the bioinformatic analysis include data normalization, melting curve fitting and statistical significance determination of compound concentration-dependent changes in protein stability. All analysis tools are made freely available as R and Python packages. The workflow can be completed in 2 weeks."

In the present study, the profiling of sulfate and glucuronide derivatives of 19-norandrosterone together with 19-noretiocholanolone (19-NE) were assessed in the spot urines of 8 male subjects, collected after administration of 19-nor-4-androstenedione (100 mg). An LC/MS/MS assay was employed for the direct quantification of sulfoconjugates, whereas a standard GC/MS method was applied for the assessment of glucuroconjugates in urine specimens. Although the 19-NA glucuronide derivative was always the most prominent at the excretion peak, inter-individual variability of the excretion patterns was observed for both conjugate forms of 19-NA and 19-NE. The ratio between the glucuro- and sulfoconjugate derivatives of 19-NA and 19-NE could not discriminate the endogenous versus the exogenous origin of the parent compound. However, after ingestion of 100 mg 19-nor-4-androstenedione, it was observed in the urine specimens that the sulfate conjugates of 19-NA was detectable over a longer period of time with respect to the other metabolites. These findings indicate that more interest shall be given to this type of conjugation to deter a potential doping with norsteroids. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

We present a fully automated image-based centrosome-duplication assay that is accurate and robust enough for both careful cell-biology studies and high-throughput screening, and employ this assay in a series of chemical-genetic studies. We observe that a simple cytometric profiling strategy, which is based on organelle size, groups compounds with similar mechanisms of action; this suggests a simple strategy for excluding compounds that undesirably target such activities as protein synthesis and microtubule dynamics. Screening a library of compounds of known activity, we found unexpected effects on centrosome duplication by a number of drugs, most notably isoform-specific protein kinase C inhibitors and retinoic acid receptor agonists. From a 16 320-member library of uncharacterized small molecules, we identified five potent centrosome-duplication inhibitors that do not target microtubule dynamics or protein synthesis. The analysis methodology reported here is directly relevant to studies of centrosome regulation in a variety of systems and is adaptable to a wide range of other biological problems."

In this review paper, excipient impurities are categorized into six major classes, including reducing sugars, aldehydes, peroxides, metals, nitrate/nitrite, and organic acids. The sources of generation, the analytical method for detection, the stability of impurities upon storage and processing, and the potential reactions with drug candidates of these impurities are reviewed.

The current study aimed at explaining the rapid expression of MDR in Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) compliant patients, represents the first study comparing global transcriptional profiles of 3 pairs of clinical Mtb isolates, collected longitudinally at initiation and completion of DOTS. While the isolates were drug susceptible (DS) at onset and MDR at completion of DOTS, they exhibited identical DNA fingerprints at both points of collection. The whole genome transcriptional analysis was performed using total RNA from H37Rv and 3 locally predominant spoligotypes viz. MANU1, CAS and Beijing, hybridized on MTBv3 (BuG@S) microarray, and yielded 36, 98 and 45 differentially expressed genes respectively. Genes encoding transcription factors (sig, rpoB), cell wall biosynthesis (emb genes), protein synthesis (rpl) and additional central metabolic pathways (ppdK, pknH, pfkB) were found to be down regulated in the MDR isolates as compared to the DS isolate of the same genotype. Up regulation of drug efflux pumps, ABC transporters, trans-membrane proteins and stress response transcriptional factors (whiB) in the MDR isolates was observed. The data indicated that Mtb, without specific mutations in drug target genes may persist in the host due to additional mechanisms like drug efflux pumps and lowered rate of metabolism. Furthermore this population of Mtb, which also showed reduced DNA repair activity, would result in selection and stabilization of spontaneous mutations in drug target genes, causing selection of a MDR strain in the presence of drug pressures. Efflux pump such as drrA may play a significant role in increasing fitness of low level drug resistant cells and assist in survival of Mtb till acquisition of drug resistant mutations with least fitness cost."

The availability of ligand libraries has facilitated the search for novel drug targets using chemogenomics approaches, compared with the traditional method of drug discovery, which is time consuming and yields few leads with little intracellular information for guiding target selection. Recent subtractive genomics studies have revealed the putative drug targets in peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathways in Leptospira interrogans. Aligand library for the murD ligase enzyme in the peptidoglycan pathway has also been identified. Our approach in this research involves screening of the pre-existing ligand library of murD with related protein family members in the putative drug target assembly in the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway. A chemogenomics approach has been implemented here, which involves screening of known ligands of a protein family having analogous domain architecture for identification of leads for existing druggable protein family members. By means of this approach, one murC and one murF inhibitor were identified, providing a platform for developing an antileptospirosis drug targeting the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway. Given that the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway is exclusive to bacteria, the in silico identified mur ligase inhibitors are expected to be broad-spectrum Gram-negative inhibitors if synthesized and tested in in vitro and in vivo assays."

        "abstract": "Antibody drug conjugates enable the targeted delivery of potent chemotherapeutic agents directly to cancerous cells. They are made by the chemical conjugation of cytotoxins to monoclonal antibodies, which can be achieved by first reducing interchain disulfide bonds followed by conjugation of the resulting free thiols with drugs. This process yields a controlled, but heterogeneous, population of conjugated products that contains species with various numbers of drugs linked to different former interchain disulfide cysteine residues on the antibodies. We have developed a mathematical approach using inputs from capillary electrophoresis and hydrophobic interaction chromatography to determine the positional isomer distribution within a population of antibody drug conjugates. The results are confirmed by analyzing isolated samples of specific drug-to-antibody ratio species. The procedure is amenable to rapid determination of positional isomer distributions and features low material requirements. A survey of several antibody drug conjugates based on the same IgG framework and small molecule drug combination has shown a very similar distribution of isomers among all of the molecules using this technique, suggesting a robust conjugation process."

Numerous methods have been proposed towards this end, most of them focusing on novel statistical methods and model selection techniques that attempt to uncover groups of genes, whose expression profiles are directly and robustly correlated with drug response. However, biological systems process information through the crosstalk of multiple signaling networks, whose ultimate phenotypic consequences may only be determined by the combined input of relevant interacting systems. By restricting predictive signatures to direct gene-drug correlations, biologically meaningful interactions that may serve as superior predictors are ignored. Here we demonstrate that predictive signatures, which incorporate the interaction between background gene expression patterns and individual predictive probes, can provide superior models than those that directly relate gene expression levels to pharmacological response, and thus should be more widely utilized in pharmacogenetic studies."

However, PN is effective against several multidrug-resistant lines of Plasmodium falciparum, including CQ resistant lines, suggestive of important operational differences between the two drugs. METHODS: Synchronized trophozoite stage cultures of P. falciparum strain K1 (CQ resistant) were exposed to 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of PN and CQ, and parasites were harvested from culture after 4 and 24 hours exposure. Global transcriptional changes effected by drug treatment were investigated using DNA microarrays. RESULTS: After a 4 h drug exposure, PN induced a greater degree of transcriptional perturbation (61 differentially expressed features) than CQ (10 features). More genes were found to respond to 24 h treatments with both drugs, and 461 features were found to be significantly responsive to one or both drugs across all treatment conditions. Filtering was employed to remove features unrelated to primary drug action, specifically features representing genes developmentally regulated, secondary stress/death related processes and sexual stage development. The only significant gene ontologies represented among the 46 remaining features after filtering relate to host exported proteins from multi-gene families. CONCLUSIONS: The malaria parasite's molecular responses to PN and CQ treatment are similar in terms of the genes and pathways affected. However, PN appears to exert a more rapid response than CQ. The faster action of PN may explain why PN is more efficacious than CQ, particularly against CQ resistant isolates. In agreement with several other microarray studies of drug action on the parasite, it is not possible, however, to discern mechanism of drug action from the drug-responsive genes."

These analysis platforms can be selectively used for different types of protein drugs, which ranged from a very specific for a particular drug (antibody enrichment) to a less specific for any antibody drugs with an Fc domain (protein A enrichment), and to a very generic method that can be used for any protein drugs (albumin depletion method). In this manner, the three platforms will be applicable to a wide range of antibody therapeutic studies for different species. The analysis using an albumin depletion method (with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)) achieved the detection of the drug (to 1 ng) in an aliquot of serum (30 microL) with a 5-order magnitude of linearity. The analysis using protein A enrichment (with SDS-PAGE) achieved the detection of the drug at a 50-fold lower level (to 0.02 ng). Without the use of SDS-PAGE for separation, the use of protein A enrichment achieved the detection to 10 ng and using the antidrug antibody enrichment achieved the detection to 0.1 ng, with a similar linear dynamic range. These three analysis platforms produced good agreement with a mimic PK study of the drug in monkey serum, as compared to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approach. In addition, these analysis platforms can be selectively applied for PK studies of drugs with different requirements of development time and resources. Such as, the antibody enrichment method can be used in a high-throughput manner but limited to a specific protein drug only. On the other hand, the albumin depletion method can be applied to many types of protein drugs but with the laborious sample preparation steps (SDS-PAGE and the subsequent in-gel digestion). When antidrug antibodies are not available for antibody drugs or the sensitivity requirement is not stringent (e.g., >10 ng), using protein A enrichment (without using SDS-PAGE) seems to be a good choice for PK studies which require fast throughput."

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that calcium stressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae, challenged with immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and Cyclosporin A, responds with comprehensive gene expression changes and attenuation of the generalized calcium stress response. Here, we describe a global metabolomics workflow for investigating the utility of tracking corresponding phenotypic changes. This was achieved by efficiently analyzing relative abundance differences between intracellular metabolite pools from wild-type and calcium stressed cultures, with and without prior immunosuppressant drugs exposure. We used pathway database content from WikiPathways and YeastCyc to facilitate the projection of our metabolomics profiling results onto biological pathways. A key challenge was to increase the coverage of the detected metabolites. This was achieved by applying both reverse phase (RP) and aqueous normal phase (ANP) chromatographic separations, as well as electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources for detection in both ion polarities. Unsupervised principle component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA results revealed differentiation between wild-type controls, calcium stressed and immunosuppressant/calcium challenged cells. Untargeted data mining resulted in 247 differentially expressed, annotated metabolites, across at least one pair of conditions. A separate, targeted data mining strategy identified 187 differential, annotated metabolites. All annotated metabolites were subsequently mapped onto curated pathways from YeastCyc and WikiPathways for interactive pathway analysis and visualization. Dozens of pathways showed differential responses to stress conditions based on one or more matches to the list of annotated metabolites or to metabolites that had been identified further by MS/MS. The purine salvage, pantothenate and sulfur amino acid pathways were flagged as being enriched, which is consistent with previously published literature for transcriptomics analysis. Thus, broad discovery-based data mining combined with targeted pathway projections can be an important asset for rapidly distilling, testing and evaluating a large amount of information for further investigation."

        "abstract": "Over the past two decades, a wealth of information on the human cytochrome P450 enzymes and their role in drug metabolism both in vitro and in vivo has been gathered. Our understanding of this area has progressed greatly, but our confidence in the development of quantitative projections of drug interactions, made from in vitro data, is somehow still shaky. There are therefore no doubts in the necessity for reliable and fast methodologies for P450 drug metabolism analysis, capable of providing accurate and precise in vitro data. This paper reports on the first integration of a P450-electrode into a microtiter plate format for the rapid determination of the affinity parameters (K(M)) for a set of known drugs. The most relevant human drug metabolizing cytochromes P450, isoforms 3A4, 2D6, and 2C9, have been covalently bound to a gold electrode via a 10-carboxydecanethiol and 8-hydroxyoctanethiol (1:1) self-assembled monolayer at the bottom of an eight-well microtiter plate. The electrochemical response of the P450-electrode and the performance of the platform have been validated using a set of 30 known drugs with K(M) values spanning from less than 1 to more than 100 \u03bcM. The K(M) values obtained using this platform show an excellent error, and their ranking is within the range of those present in the literature determined from conventional incubation experiments with cytochrome P450s 3A4, 2D6, and 2C9."

Different styles of offending behaviour were identified with a Smallest Space Analysis (SSA-I) of co-occurrence among the 45 criminal and deviant behaviours in the D45. This revealed differentiation between Person and Property offences and between Expressive and Instrumental aspects of these styles. Examination of the Element B measures as external variables on the SSA-I plot revealed a number of relationships between interpersonal personality and offence style. Overall variations in offence style related more clearly to aspects of Control than to inter- personal elements of Inclusion. Property offences, especially acts of vandalism, tended to be committed by individuals who reported higher levels of control from others (Received Control) than did Person offences. Expressive Person style crimes, typically behaviours incorporating violence, or threats thereof, especially where a weapon was involved, reported higher levels of the need for power and dominance (Expressed Control) in their interpersonal relationships. Offenders involved in Expressive Property crimes tended to be individuals for whom other people were felt to be more emotionally open and intimate (Received Openness) than other offenders.

        "abstract": "This study tested the Bayesian journey-to-crime (JTC) model by gender and age for serial offenders from Manchester, England. The data were 4056 crimes committed by 171 serial offenders between 2003 and 2006. The data were subdivided by gender and age group to examine whether accuracy and precision varied by these subgroups. In general, the centre of minimum distance was found to be the most accurate measure, but the Bayesian risk and product measures were found to be the most precise measurements. The traditional 'distance decay' type of JTC function did not produce estimates that are as accurate nor as precise as the Bayesian approach. Tests were conducted on whether specific gender and age group JTC functions and origin-destination matrices improved predictability. With the exception of juvenile male offenders, the general functions were more accurate and precise. In terms of building an accurate and precise geographical profiling methodology, the results point to the need to include information on the likely predisposition of neighbourhoods to produce offenders as well as information on the crime opportunities available to offenders.

        "abstract": "Only a few approaches are available to address the mechanisms of cell death in vivo which are induced by anticancer treatment in patients with malignancies. In this study in vitro chemosensitivity testing of primary peripheral blood leukemic cells of five patients suffering from different leukemic non-Hodgkin's lymphomas was combined with the analysis of the in vivo rate of apoptosis by flow-cytometry (Annexin V and depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by JC-1). Furthermore, changes in expression patterns of apoptosis related proteins during chemotherapeutic treatment were detected by Western Blot. Gene expression profiling (HG-U133A, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was employed to identify common marker genes of in vivo drug response. In vitro chemosensitivity was tested using the cytotoxic agents which the patients were scheduled to receive and was strongly correlated with effective reduction of leukemic lymphoma cells in patients resulting in complete remissions in all five cases. Due to the rapid clearance of apoptotic tumor cells in vivo neither the analysis of the in vivo rate of apoptosis and depolarisation of MMP nor the assessment of expression of regulators of apoptosis showed concordant results concerning the drug response. However, assessment of gene expression during therapy could identify a set of 30 genes to significantly discriminate between samples from patients before treatment compared to samples from the same patients after receiving cytotoxic therapy. Among these 30 genes we found a high proportion of genes associated with apoptotic cell death, cell proliferation and cell cycle signalling including complement lysis inhibitor (clusterin/CLU), beta-catenin interacting protein (ICAT), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1), TNF alpha converting enzyme (ADAM17/TACE), homeo box A3 (HOX1), inositol polyphosphatase 5-phosphatase type IV (PPI5PIV) and inhibitor of p53 induced apoptosis alpha (IPIA-Alpha/NM23-H6). These results indicate that in vitro chemosensitivity testing and gene expression profiling can successfully be utilised to analyse in vivo drug response in patients with leukemic NHL's and can be used to explore new pathway models of drug-induced cell death in vivo which are independent of different lymphoma subtypes and different treatment regimens. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Internet and social networking sites play a significant role in the marketing and distribution of recreational/prescription drugs without restrictions. We aimed here at reviewing data relating to the profile of the online drug customer and at describing drug vending websites. METHODS: The PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases were searched here in order to elicit data on the socio-demographic characteristics of the recreational marketplaces/online pharmacies' customers and the determinants relating to online drug purchasing activities. RESULTS: Typical online recreational drugs' customers seem to be Caucasian, men, in their 20s, highly educated, and using the web to impact as minimally as possible on their existing work/professional status. Conversely, people without any health insurance seemed to look at the web as a source of more affordable prescription medicines. Drug vending websites are typically presented here with a \"no prescription required\" approach, together with aggressive marketing strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The online availability of recreational/prescriptions drugs remains a public health concern. A more precise understanding of online vending sites' customers may well facilitate the drafting and implementation of proper prevention campaigns aimed at counteracting the increasing levels of online drug acquisition and hence intake activities."

These methods are alternating least-squares (ALS) with either random or iterative key-set factor analysis (IKSFA) initialisation, iterative target transformation factor analysis (ITTFA), evolving factor analysis (EFA), and heuristic evolving latent projections (HELP). Real and simulated high-performance liquid chromatography diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) data were obtained for drug mixtures containing one main compound and two impurities. The elution order of the main compound and the impurities was varied. Furthermore, resolutions were varied from 0.56 to 3.36 and impurity levels from 30% down to 0.1%. For simulated data, ALS with IKSFA initialisation and HELP perform better than ITTFA and EFA, which perform better than ALS with random initialisation. ITTFA works better than EFA for almost completely separated data, while the opposite is true for moderately or strongly overlapping data. Only ALS with IKSFA initialisation and HELP were found to resolve the required 0.1% level for moderately overlapping data. For real data, comparison of the methods provides similar results. ITTFA performs clearly better than EFA. However, none of the curve resolution methods can identify or quantify impurities at the required 0.1% level. The results for real data are worse than for simulated data because of heteroscedasticity, nonlinearity, and the acquisition resolution of the A/D-converter. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the present study, we validated this approach and focused on prediction of novel drugs for lung adenocarcinoma (AC), for which there is a pressing need to find novel therapeutic compounds. Firstly, connectivity map (CMap) analysis computationally predicted bezafibrate as a putative compound against lung AC. Then this hypothesis was verified by in vitro assays of anti-proliferation and cell cycle arrest. In silico docking evidence indicated that bezafibrate could target cyclin dependent kinase 2(CDK2), which regulates progression through the cell cycle. Furthermore, we found that bezafibrate can significantly down-regulate the expression of CDK2 mRNA and p-CDK2. Using a nude mice xenograft model, we also found that bezafibrate could inhibit tumor growth of lung AC in vivo. In conclusion, this study proposed bezafibrate as a potential therapeutic option for lung AC patients, illustrating the potential of in silico drug screening."

We used primary malignant mesothelioma cells and an ex vivo chemosensitivity assay with future purpose to predict best choice of treatment. The clinical outcome of these patients might be predicted by measuring drug sensitivity.\\n\\nMETHODS: Pleural effusions containing primary malignant mesothelioma cells were received from the diagnostic routine. We characterized and tested the chemosensitivity of 18 malignant samples and four benign samples from 16 different patients with pleural effusions. Cells were seeded in a 384-well plate for a robotized ex vivo testing of drug sensitivity to 32 different drugs. The primary cells were further characterized by immunocytochemistry to evaluate the proportion of malignant cells and to study the RRM1 and ERCC1 reactivity, two proteins associated with drug resistance.\\n\\nRESULTS: We observed great individual variability in the drug sensitivity. Primary cell isolates were affected by between one and ten drugs, and resistant to the remaining tested drugs. Actinomycin D and daunorubicin were the two drugs effective in most cases. Adjusting efficiency of individual drugs for varying proportion of tumor cells and to the average effect on benign cells correlated with effect of pemetrexed, cisplatin and survival time. General drug sensitivity, proportion of malignant cells and reactivity to RRM1 correlated to each other and to survival time of the patients.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The proportion of malignant cells and RRM1 reactivity in the pleural effusions correlate to drug sensitivity and survival time. The variability in response to the commonly used chemotherapies emphasizes the need for tests that indicate best individual choice of cytotoxic drugs. The efficiency of the obtained results should preferably be corrected for admixture of benign cells and effects of given drugs on benign cells."

None the less, the reform of this mode of policing within the UK was already underway with a strong emphasis upon policing through consent and the need to facilitate peaceful protest through dialogue and communication. This paper reports upon a critical 'test case' for this 'new approach' by analysing the policing of a series of protests against Government policy across 3 days that surrounded a Government party conference in Sheffield, a large city in the north of England. This paper draws out lessons to be learned from what proved to be a highly successful dialogue-based approach to policing protests. We contend that dialogue and liaison were effective because they allowed for an ongoing dynamic risk assessment that improved command-level decision making and enhanced police proportionality. The subsequent impact upon crowd dynamics allowed for an improved capacity for proactive public order management, encouraged 'self-regulation' in the crowd, and avoided the unnecessary police use of force at moments of tension. The implications of the analysis for theory and practice are discussed. Copyright \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

        "abstract": "The present issue of JIP-OP brings together an intriguing range of papers that cover a wide range of aspects of testimony and aspects of investigative interviewing. They show how the considerations of how testimony is obtained is broadening out from the memory improvement strategies that once dominated this area with attempts to detect deception, to cover many aspects of how testimony is obtained. This draws attention to the need for more careful examination of the variations in testimony eliciting processes that will be responsive to differences in context and crime. A research agenda is therefore proposed that draws on developments in the understanding of psychological differences between crimes. This research would study the relationship between the psychological processes underpinning offence actions and the interview behaviour of suspects or witnesses. With regard to suspects, recent developments in the modelling of offence style have indicated a narrative basis (narrative action system model) for understanding the patterns of offence actions and the perpetrator's psychological background and characteristics that can be inferred from these. It is therefore suggested that the Hero's Quest, Professional's Adventure, Revenger's Tragedy, and Victim's Irony offending narratives and the Object, Vehicle, and Person victim roles assigned within these, may provide a fruitful link to different patterns of interview behaviour, with consequent implications for approaches to interviewing.

More specifically, the hypothesis was that there would be intraseries consistency in the distances travelled (spatial consistency) and the characteristics of the crime sites selected (environmental consistency) by serial sexual offenders. For spatial consistency to be tested, the distances travelled from home to offend and the criminal range for each offence series were analysed. Support was found for spatial consistency, and, in line with much overseas research, it was also found that the offenders typically did not travel very far from home to offend (median distance of 3 km). The environmental consistency measure was made up of various physical, temporal, and contextual variables that described the environmental characteristics of an offence. As hypothesised, it was found that offenders displayed intraseries environmental consistency in offence site selection beyond the level of that expected by chance.

The signature characteristics observed in these infamous Jack the Ripper murders were compared to a 1981\u20131995 cohort of 3359 homicide cases from Washington State's HITS database. The analysis revealed that the signature displayed in six of the Whitechapel murders was extremely rare. There were only six records of female victims, one a prostitute, with probed, explored, or mutilated body cavities. There were only two cases, both females who were not prostitutes, where the body was left in an unusual position and body cavities were explored, probed, or mutilated.

        "abstract": "This paper reviews a body of work published by the authors over a number of years aimed at providing a complementary \"signature\" to conventional chemical profiling of methylamphetamine. The work, beginning in 2009, was undertaken because of the changing nature of clandestine methylamphetamine manufacture which has seen a dramatic rise in production and a major shift to a higher quality product. As manufacturing methods changed and methylamphetamine purity increased some conventional drug profiling techniques became less useful as an intelligence tool. For instance, the value of the organic impurity profile, a mainstay of conventional profiling, decreases as there are fewer impurities present in seized samples. However, whilst many seizures may contain less conventional chemical intelligence another property of the methylamphetamine molecule is always available, i.e. the light element stable isotope ratios. The stable isotope ratios of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen are an integral part of the methylamphetamine molecule itself. This review describes previous work by the authors and by researchers in other national laboratories to investigate and implement the use of stable isotope ratios as an everyday methylamphetamine profiling tool. It also looks at how powerful this technique can be when used to compare samples from different seizures."

        "abstract": "The individualized medicine aims to identify the molecular basis of the individual's response to different therapeutic treatments. Individualized medicine is very relevant for human diseases such as cancer and it has become a major task to accomplish more efficient and specific therapeutics. An individualized response to treatment could underline therapeutic success or failure and, even more, could support the rationale for good or bad prognosis. The use of up to date genomic approaches is changing the way we understand modern medicine in terms of drug efficacy, toxicity and diagnosis. Results from genetic polymorphism studies, gene expression profiling and epigenetics illustrate how pharmacogenomic testing will contribute to the goal of individualized medicine. Antineoplastic drugs are designed to block the anomalous activity of specific molecules (therapeutic targets) that regulate cellular processes such as cell cycle. Understanding the relationship between molecular changes in therapeutic targets and enhanced antitumoral response or chemotherapeutic resistance is crucial to establish the clinical relevance of genomic approaches. The goal of this review is to discuss the basic and the clinical significance of genomic research on drug targets and its impact on the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. We will also assess how these methodologies could contribute to individualized medicine in oncology. A special focus will be put on oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Aspects such as drug efficacy, side effects and the diagnostic value of antineoplastic pharmacogenomic research will be also considered."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Resistance of clinical isolates of Candida albicans to the echinocandin drug caspofungin is slowly emerging and is linked to mutations in short conserved regions in the FKS1 gene. The most prominent changes occurred at the serine 645 position in Fks1p with substitutions of proline, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. An allele-specific real-time PCR molecular-beacon assay was developed for rapid identification of drug resistance by targeting FKS1 mutations. Mutations altering serine 645 were reliably identified in both heterozygous and homozygous states. The molecular-beacon assay was used to evaluate two large collections of spontaneous mutants from separate strains of C. albicans with resistance (MICs, >16 microg/ml) to caspofungin with the goal of understanding the relationship between FKS1 mutations and echinocandin resistance. Of 85 resistant isolates recovered, all were identified with mutations in FKS1; 93% showed changes at Ser645, with 62% displaying a characteristic S645P substitution expressed as either a homozygous or a heterozygous mutation in FKS1. Two other prominent amino acid substitutions, S645Y and S645F, were found at frequencies of 22% and 8%, respectively. Three new mutations were also identified: T1922C, G1932T, and C1934G, encoding F641S, L644F, and S645C substitutions, respectively. One strain had the double amino acid substitution L644F and S645C. Allele-specific probes were combined in a multiplex assay for reliable screening of known FKS1 mutations. These data support the importance of FKS1p substitutions in echinocandin resistance and demonstrate the feasibility of applying molecular screening for routine resistance assessment."

Methods: Trained dogs, Rhesus monkeys, Cynomolgus monkeys and mini-pigs (Goettinger) were equipped with radiotelemetry transmitters (ITS). Aortic pressure (AP), left ventricular pressure (LVP), a lead II ECG and body temperature could be continuously monitored. The contractility index LVdP/dtmax was derived from the LVP signal. Notocord HEM 4.1 software was used for data acquisition. For each species an LVdP/dt-heart rate relationship was evaluated using spontaneous heart rates (HR) throughout the observation period. A validation compound with positive inotropic effects (pimobendan) was then used to investigate the LVdP/dt-heart rate relationship. Results: There was a clear LVdP/dt-HR relationship in the animals tested. The inotropic agent pimobendan demonstrated the expected shift in this relationship. Discussion: Contractility of the myocardium is regulated by autonomic input activating primarily myocardial ??1-adrenoceptors, but it is also affected by the \"force-frequency\" relationship. Compounds can therefore either directly or indirectly affect the contractility of the heart. The chronotropic effects are routinely measured in preclinical studies; however, the inotropic effects are not routinely analysed in cardiovascular safety studies. Our experience strongly recommends including this evaluation for drug candidate selection. The evaluation of LVdP/dtmax, as an index of myocardial contractile state must, however, take into account its HR-dependency. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Currently, the development of miRNAs as clinical biomarkers has been hindered by the lack of standardization. Therefore, extracellular miRNA-based biomarkers have not been embraced as diagnostic tools. Each platform has its strengths and weaknesses when working with low-input-amount RNA samples from body fluids; the selection of a miRNA quantification approach should be based on the study design. The following review provides a summary of the extracellular miRNA release and stability in body fluids, performances of different miRNA quantification platforms, existing clinical gold standards for drug-induced tissue damage and translation of the miRNA biomarkers from the nonclinical to clinical setting."

We are on the way to be able to comprehensively assess disease-related proteome alterations, which may become an essential source of information for knowledge-based drug design. This review will provide an overview of current techniques in proteome analysis, focusing on screening technologies for biomedical research.

        "abstract": "Drug mode of action (MOA) of novel compounds has been predicted using phenotypic features or, more recently, comparing side effect similarities. Attempts to use gene expression data in mammalian systems have so far met limited success. Here, we built a drug similarity network starting from a public reference dataset containing genome-wide gene expression profiles (GEPs) following treatments with more than a thousand compounds. In this network, drugs sharing a subset of molecular targets are connected by an edge or lie in the same community. Our approach is based on a novel similarity distance between two compounds. The distance is computed by combining GEPs via an original rank-aggregation method, followed by a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to compute similarity between pair of drugs. The network is obtained by considering each compound as a node, and adding an edge between two compounds if their similarity distance is below a given significance threshold. We show that, despite the complexity and the variety of the experimental conditions, our approach is able to identify similarities in drug mode of action from GEPs. Our approach can also be used for the identification of the MOA of new compounds."

There is an ever-accelerating need for new, efficacious combination therapies active against drug resistant malaria. Proven drugs already in the treatment pipeline, such as the quinolines, are important components of current combination therapy and also present an attractive test bank for rapid development of new concepts.\\n\\nMETHODS: The efficacy of several drug combinations versus chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains was measured using both cytostatic and cytocidal potency assays.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These screens identify quinoline and non-quinoline pairs that exhibit synergy, additivity, or antagonism using the fixed-ratio isobologram method and find tafenoquine - methylene blue combination to be the most synergistic. Also, interestingly, for selected pairs, additivity, synergy, or antagonism defined by quantifying IC50 (cytostatic potency) does not necessarily predict similar behaviour when potency is defined by LD50 (cytocidal potency). These data further support an evolving new model for quinoline anti-malarials, wherein haem and haemozoin are the principle target for cytostatic activity, but may not be the only target relevant for cytocidal activity."

Several human ABC transporters, such as ABCB1 and ABCC1, have been attributed to cause multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer treatment when over-expressed. In the past, an MDR cancer cell line MCF7/AdVp3000 has been selected, and overexpression of ABCG2 was thought to cause MDR in this cell line. However, ectopic overexpression of ABCG2 in MCF7 cells could not explain the high drug resistance level observed with the selected cell line. In this study, we designed an AmpArray analysis to profile whether other ABC transporters were also selected to contribute to the increased drug resistance in MCF7/AdVp3000 cells. We found that 16 ABC transporters, including ABCG2, had >/=1.5-fold altered expression in MCF7/AdVp3000 compared with the parental MCF7 cells. In particular, the expression of ABCA4 and ABCC3 was increased by 132- and 459-fold, respectively, whereas ABCG2 was increased by approximately 3000-fold. Furthermore, the elevated expression of these three transporters reversed with the reversed drug resistance phenotype, and silencing ABCC3 expression in MCF7/AdVp3000 cells significantly reduced doxorubicin resistance. Thus, other ABC transporters in addition to ABCG2 are likely to contribute to the MDR selected in MCF7/AdVp3000 cells.

        "abstract": "There is an increased trend towards the use of drug and enteric coated sugar spheres for controlled oral delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). This trend is driven by increased efficacy and ease of formulation of different dosage levels. However, difficulties exist in determining the thickness of drug and enteric coatings in a time efficient manner during manufacture, quality assurance and stability testing. The thickness of the coating determines the dosage of the API and the thickness of the enteric coating determines the release rate of the drug in the gastro-intestinal tract. Broadband Acoustic Resonance Dissolution Spectroscopy (BARDS) offers a rapid new approach to characterising the enteric coating thickness and the raw materials used in their manufacture. BARDS applications are based on reproducible changes in the compressibility of a solvent during dissolution which is monitored acoustically due to associated changes in the speed of sound in solution. It is demonstrated how core delivery sugar spheres have unique acoustic spectra attributable to the mean size distribution of the spheres. A steady state acoustic lag time is associated with the disintegration of the enteric coating, in basic solution. This lag time can be manipulated by varying the concentration of the base which affects the rate at which the coating dissolves. It is anticipated that the thickness/loading of the spheres can be estimated from the lag time."

This later rise was mainly a result of increases in resistance to nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (from 5.4% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2009, P=0.24) and protease inhibitors (1.5% to 2.1%, P=0.12). Thymidine analogue mutations, including T215 revertants, remained the most frequent mutations associated with nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, despite a considerable fall in stavudine and zidovudine use between 2002 and 2009 (from 29.4% of drug regimens in 2002 to 0.8% in 2009, from 47.9% to 8.8%, respectively).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The previously observed decline in the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in HIV-1 infections probably acquired in the UK seems to have stabilised. The continued high prevalence of thymidine analogue mutations suggests that the source of this resistance may be increasingly from patients who have not undergone antiretroviral therapy and who harbour resistant viruses. Testing of all newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive people should be continued."

However, it has become clear that analyzing genome sequences alone will not lead to new therapies to fight human disease. Rather, an understanding of protein function within the context of complex cellular networks will be required to facilitate the discovery of novel drug targets and, subsequently, new therapies directed against them. The past ten years has seen a dramatic increase in technologies that allow large-scale, systems-based methods for analysis of global biological processes and disease states. In the field of proteomics, several well-established methods persist as a means to resolve and analyze complex mixtures of proteins derived from cells and tissues. However, the resolving power of these methods is often challenged by the diverse and dynamic nature of the proteome. The field of activity-based proteomics, or chemical proteomics, has been established in an attempt to focus proteomic efforts on subsets of physiologically important protein targets. This new approach to proteomics is centered around the use of small molecules termed activity-based probes (ABPs) as a means to tag, enrich, and isolate, distinct sets of proteins based on their enzymatic activity. Chemical probes can be 'tuned' to react with defined enzymatic targets through the use of chemically reactive warhead groups, fused to selective binding elements that control their overall specificity. As a result, ABPs function as highly specific, mechanism-based reagents that provide a direct readout of enzymatic activity within complex proteomes. Modification of protein targets by an ABP facilitates their purification and isolation, thereby eliminating many of the confounding issues of dynamic range in protein abundance. In this review, we outline recent advances in the field of chemical proteomics. Specifically, we highlight how this technology can be applied to advance the fields of biomarker discovery, in vivo imaging, and small molecule screening and drug target discovery."

In results of MDR development during chemotherapy cancer cells become resistant to further treatment. Microarray techniques can provide information about MDR development at gene expression level. ABC and SLC transporters are most important proteins responsible for this phenomenon. In this study changes of ABC and SLC genes expression pattern in drugs resistant sublines of the A2780 ovarian cancer cell line were demonstrated. The cytostatic resistant sublines were generated by culture of A2780 cell line with an increasing concentration of the indicated drugs. As screening methods, we used Affymetrix U219 Human Genome microarrays. Independent t-tests were used to determinate statistical significances of results. Genes that expression levels were higher than assumed threshold (upregulated above threefold and downregulated under -3 fold) were visualized using scatter plot method, selected and listed in table. Between the ABC genes increased expression of seven genes and decreased expression of three genes were observed. Expression of two genes was increased or decreased depending on the cell line. We observed significant (more than tenfold) increase in expression of four ABC genes: ABCA8, ABCB1, ABCB4 and ABCG2 and decreased expression of ABCA3 gene. We also observed changes in expression of 32 SLC genes. Between them we observe increased expression of 17 genes and decreased expression of 15 genes. Expression of four genes was increased or decreased dependent on cell line. The expression of nine SLC genes increased or decreased very significantly (more than tenfold). Five genes were significantly upregulated: SLC2A9, SLC16A3, SLC16A14, SLC38A4 and SLC39A8. Four additional genes were significantly downregulated: SLC2A14, SLC6A15, SLC8A1 and SLC27A2. Expression profiles of these genes give strong arguments for assumption of correlation between expression of ABC and SLC genes and drug resistance phenomenon. Identifying correlations between specific drug transporters and cytostatic drug resistance will require further investigation. ?? 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS."

To date, there are no STS-135 clinical or in vitro studies identifying STS-135 metabolites. However, characterizing STS-135 metabolism is critical because synthetic cannabinoid metabolites can possess pharmacological activity and parent compounds are rarely detectable in urine. To characterize the metabolite profile, human hepatocytes were incubated with 10 micromol/L STS-135 for up to 3 h. High-resolution mass spectrometry with software-assisted data mining identified 29 STS-135 metabolites. Less than 25% of STS-135 parent compound remained after 3 h incubation. Primary metabolites were generated by mono-, di- or trihydroxylation with and without ketone formation, dealkylation, and oxidative defluorination of N-fluoropentyl side chain or possible oxidation to carboxylic acid, some of them further glucuronidated. Hydroxylations occurred mainly on the aliphatic adamantane ring and less commonly on the N-pentyl side chain. At 1 h, phase I metabolites predominated, while at 3 h, phase II metabolites were present in higher amounts. The major metabolites were monohydroxy STS-135 (M25) and dihydroxy STS-135 (M21), both hydroxylated on the adamantane system. Moreover, metabolic stability of STS-135 (1 micromol/L) was assessed in human liver microsomes experiments. The in vitro half-life of STS-135 was 3.1 +/- 0.2 min and intrinsic clearance (CLint ) was 208.8 mL . min(-1) . kg(-1) . This is the first report characterizing STS-135 hepatic metabolic pathways. These data provide potential urinary targets to document STS-135 intake in clinical and forensic settings and potential candidates for pharmacological testing.

This polymer/drug system has direct application in the cardiac stent arena, where it has been used to treat restenosis or renarrowing of arterial walls after stent or angioplasty procedures. Overall, the results illustrate the successful use of a cluster ion beam for greatly enhancing the high-mass fragment ion and molecular ion intensities from the surface and bulk of the polymer system. The use of C60+ also established the ability to remove common overlayers like poly(dimethylsiloxane), which was not possible using a Ga+ ion source. Furthermore, the use of C60+ allowed depth profiles to be obtained using primary ion dose densities in excess of 6 x 1014 C60+/cm2. Resultant sputter craters reached depths of approximately 2 microm and possessed relatively flat bottoms without the need for sample rotation. AFM and profilometry studies support the relatively gentile removal of surface species via phase contrast and topographic imaging. In addition, the findings suggest that relatively high ion doses do not significantly alter the phase distribution or surface topography of the polymer surface; however, a slight increase in surface roughness was detected."

High-throughput screening (HTS) laboratories have supported a wide array of molecularly targeted and chemical genomic approaches for anticancer lead generation, and the number of hits emerging from such campaigns has increased dramatically. Although automation of HTS processes has eliminated primary screening as a bottleneck, the demands on secondary screening in appropriate cell-based assays have increased concomitantly with the numbers of hits delivered to therapeutic area laboratories. The authors describe herein the implementation of a novel platform using off-the-shelf solutions that have allowed them to efficiently characterize hundreds of HTS hits using a palette of Western blot-based pharmacodynamic assays. The platform employs a combination of a flatbed bufferless SDS-PAGE system, a dry ultra-rapid electroblotting apparatus, and a highly sensitive and quantitative infrared imaging system. Cumulatively, this platform has significantly reduced the cycle time for HTS hit evaluation. In addition, the routine use of this platform has resulted in higher quality data that have allowed the development of structure-activity databases that have tangibly improved lead optimization. The authors describe in detail the application of this platform, designated the Accelerated Pharmaco-Dynamic Profiler (APDP), to the annotation of inhibitors of 2 attractive oncology targets, BRAF kinase and Hsp90."

Among those genes represented on both platforms, the oligo array identified 26-53% more differentially expressed genes compared to the cDNA array in the three experiments, when identical fold change and t-test criteria were applied. The increased sensitivity was primarily the result of more robust fold changes measured by the oligonucleotide system. Essentially all gene changes overlapping between the two platforms were co-directional, and ranged from 4 to 19% depending upon the amount of biological variability within and between the comparison groups. Q-PCR validation rates were virtually identical for the two platforms, with 23-24% validation in the prefrontal cortex experiment, and 56% for both platforms in the cell culture experiment. Validated genes included dopa decarboxylase, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, and dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 3, which were decreased in NBFL cells exposed to valproate, and spinocerebellar ataxia 7, which was increased in bipolar disease. The modest overlap but similar validation rates show that each microarray system identifies a unique set of differentially expressed genes, and thus the greatest information is obtained from the use of both platforms. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To test these hypotheses they have consistently used traditional pharmacology tools such as in vivo and in vitro models. Increasingly over the last decade however we have seen that computational (in silico) methods have been developed and applied to pharmacology hypothesis development and testing. These in silico methods include databases, quantitative structure-activity relationships, pharmacophores, homology models and other molecular modeling approaches, machine learning, data mining, network analysis tools and data analysis tools that use a computer. In silico methods are primarily used alongside the generation of in vitro data both to create the model and to test it. Such models have seen frequent use in the discovery and optimization of novel molecules with affinity to a target, the clarification of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties as well as physicochemical characterization. The aim of this review is to illustrate some of the in silico methods for pharmacology that are used in drug discovery. Further applications of these methods to specific targets and their limitations will be discussed in the second accompanying part of this review."

        "abstract": "Drug resistance is a global threat and one of the main contributing factors to tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks. The goal of this study was to analyse the molecular profile of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in the state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil. Fifty-three MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates were analysed by spoligotyping and a partial region of the rpoB gene, which is associated with rifampicin resistance (RMP-R), was sequenced. Some isolates were also distinguished by their mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU). S531L was the most prevalent mutation found within rpoB in RMP-R isolates (58.5%), followed by S531W (20.8%). Only two MDR isolates showed no mutations within rpoB. Isolates of the Latin American Mediterranean (LAM) family were the most prevalent (45.3%) found by spoligotyping, followed by Haarlem (9.4%) and T (7.5%) families. SIT106 was found in 26.4% of isolates and all SIT106 isolates typed by MIRU-12 (5 out of 14) belong to MIT251. There was a high correlation between the S531W mutation and the LAM family mainly because all SIT2263 (LAM9) isolates carry this mutation. Among isolates with the S531W mutation in rpoB MIRU demonstrates a cluster formed by four isolates (SIT2263 and MIT163) and very similar profiles were observed between eight of the nine isolates. Better characterisation of TB isolates may lead to new ways in which to control and treat TB in this region of Brazil."

This DNA microarray with 59 carefully selected genes could be used to study changes in gene expression levels due to a treatment with xenobiotic. These 59 genes (including 8 housekeeping genes) have been selected among potential toxic markers involved in basic cellular processes and drug metabolism related genes. Using the optimized conditions, the results were shown to be reproducible, with 6% variation between the duplicated spots and 10% between arrays. Conditions were optimized to allow quantification with a dynamic range of four log units. In order to demonstrate the major advantage of these tool for studying gene expression, samples of control rat liver were compared with those of animals dosed with phenobarbital (PB) or pregnenolone-16??-carbonitrile (PCN), two compounds well known to induce cytochrome P450 isoforms of 2B and 3A subfamilies, respectively. This microarray has shown that other genes apart from the corresponding CYP P450 genes have been changed due to PB and PCN treatment. Apoptosis-related genes have shown to be changed due to PB and PCN treatment, which confirms results from previous work. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved."

CS was used because it was swellable in acidic media and biocompatible. Losartan was incorporated into the optimized formulations for sustained release profiling. Results demonstrated that for those formulations at HEC:CS ratio of 5:5 containing CS, both the floating lag time and floating duration were optimal and reached the preferred swelling effect and sustain for 24 h. Adding SB improved the floating capabilities for all ratios of HEC:CS, but reduced the swelling ability for those formulations containing a higher portion of low viscosity grade CS. Sustained release profiles for losartan in those formulations were achievable, using all viscosity grades of CS at all examined HEC:CS ratios; however, it is more adjustable at different HEC:CS ratios when using a lower viscosity grade of CS. Optimized GRDDS formulations for losartan composed of an equivalent ratio of HEC to CS with 20 mg SB resulted in the tablets floating for more than 16 h and an adjustable sustained release profile. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Three to four compounds were grouped in cassettes for dosing and analysis. Compounds in the cassettes were selected to minimize possible analytical interference from each other, as well as from their potential metabolites. In order to improve the confidence of cassette administration, an analogue of the study compounds, with well-established brain penetration data, was included in each cassette as a \"biological internal standard\". Compounds were administered to rats by intraperitoneal injection and extracted from plasma or brain homogenate by simple protein precipitation. Fast chromatographic separation was achieved by using a short narrow-bore column at a flow rate of 1.0ml/min with a fast gradient. The brain penetration of the compounds was evaluated by comparing their Cmax and AUC values in brain and plasma. This approach rapidly provided early brain penetration and plasma exposure information, thus making more of this data available to teams. Comparing the brain exposures to the EC50 values (i.e. in vitro potency) of series compounds in the same discovery program provided another dimension of information to select lead compounds for future in vivo assessment. The method described here has been used for providing early brain penetration information in several CNS exploratory and discovery programs. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We have combined potent, selective kinase inhibition through chemical genetics with gene expression profiling to identify a \"fingerprint\" of transcriptional changes associated with selective Btk kinase inhibition. The Btk transcriptional fingerprint shows remarkable relevance for Btk's biological roles and was used for functional selectivity profiling of two kinase inhibitor compounds. The fingerprint was able to rank the compounds by relative selectivity for Btk, and revealed broader off-target effects than observed in a broad panel of biochemical kinase cross screens. In addition to being useful for functional selectivity profiling, the fingerprint genes are themselves potential preclinical and clinical biomarkers for developing Btk-directed therapies."

We screened a set of compounds of known and unknown mode of action (MoA) and derived quantitative drug scores (or D-scores), identifying mutants that are either sensitive or resistant to particular compounds. We found that compound-functional module relationships are more conserved than individual compound-gene interactions between these two species. Furthermore, we observed that combining data from both species allows for more accurate prediction of MoA. Finally, using this platform, we identified a novel small molecule that acts as a DNA damaging agent and demonstrate that its MoA is conserved in human cells."

        "abstract": "Cancer stem cells, with unlimited self-renewal potential and other stem cell characteristics, occur in several types of cancer, including ovarian cancer (OvC). Although CSCs can cause tumor initiation, malignant proliferation, relapse and multi-drug resistance, ways to eliminate them remain unknown. In the present study, we compared ovarian cancer stem cell (OVCSC) expression profiles in normal ovarian surface epithelium and ovarian cells from patients with advanced disease to identify key pathways and specific molecular signatures involved in OVC progression and to prescreen candidate small-molecule compounds with anti-OVCSC activity. Comparison of genome-wide expression profiles of OvC stemness groups with non-stemness controls revealed 6495, 1347 and 509 differentially expressed genes in SDC, SP1 and SP2 groups, respectively, with a cut-off of fold-change set at >1.5 and P<0.05. NAB1 and NPIPL1 were commonly upregulated whereas PROS1, GREB1, KLF9 and MTUS1 were commonly downregulated in all 3 groups. Most differentially expressed genes consistently clustered with molecular functions such as protein receptor binding, kinase activity and chemo-repellent activity. These genes regulate cellular components such as centrosome, plasma membrane receptors, and basal lamina, and may participate in biological processes such as cell cycle regulation, chemoresistance and stemness induction. Key Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways such as ECM receptor, ErbB signaling, endocytosis and adherens junction pathways were enriched. Gene co-expression extrapolation screening by the Connectivity Map revealed several small-molecule compounds (such as SC-560, disulfiram, thapsigargin, esculetin and cinchonine) with potential anti-OVCSC properties targeting OVCSC signature genes. We identified several key CSC features and specific regulation networks in OVCSCs and predicted several small molecules with potential anti-OVCSC pharmacological properties, which may aid the development of OVCSC-specific drugs."

These data were combined with other parameters (systemic C(max), estimated hepatic inlet C(max), fraction unbound, in vivo P450 enzyme degradation rate constants estimated from clinical pharmacokinetic data, and fraction of the affected drug cleared by the inhibited enzyme) to predict increases in exposure to drugs, and the predictions were compared with in vivo DDIs gathered from clinical studies reported in the scientific literature. In general, the use of unbound systemic C(max) as the inactivator concentration in vivo yielded the most accurate predictions of DDI with a mean -fold error of 1.64. Abbreviated in vitro approaches to identifying mechanism-based inactivators were developed. Testing potential inactivators at a single concentration (IC(25)) in a 30-min preincubation with human liver microsomes in the absence and presence of NADPH followed by assessment of P450 marker activities readily identified those compounds known to be mechanism-based inactivators and represents an approach that can be used with greater throughput. Measurement of decreases in IC(50) occurring with a 30-min preincubation with liver microsomes and NADPH was also useful in identifying mechanism-based inactivators, and the IC(50) measured after such a preincubation was highly correlated with the k(inact)/K(I) ratio measured after a full characterization of inactivation. Overall, these findings support the conclusion that P450 in vitro inactivation data are valuable in predicting clinical DDIs that can occur via this mechanism."

Methods: Multiple search strategies: (a) peer-reviewed literature searches (1990-2008) using methods recommended by the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group; (b) systematic searches of online databases; (c) Internet searches to find other published evidence of drug use; (d) repeated consultation and feedback from experts around the globe; (e) a viral email sent to lists of researchers in the illicit drug and HIV fields. Data were extracted and graded according to predefined variables reflecting quality of data source. Results: Qualitative evidence of illicit drug use and dependence was found for most countries, which hold over 98% of the world's population aged 15-64 years. Countries where use was identified but prevalence estimates had not been made (evidence of drug supply, trafficking, reports of use, treatment data) were mainly from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Oceania. Estimates of the prevalence of use were located in 77 countries for meth/amphetamine, 95 for cannabis, 86 for cocaine and 89 for opioids. Dependence prevalence estimates existed in very few countries; 9 meth/amphetamine dependence estimates, 7 cannabis dependence estimates, 5 cocaine dependence estimates, and 25 opioid dependence estimates were located. Conclusions: Data on the extent of meth/amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and opioid use and dependence must be improved in quality and coverage. Dependence estimates are lacking even in high income countries that have required resources. Responses to illicit drug dependence require better estimates of its scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "Paclitaxel (PTX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug effective against numerous cancers. To elucidate cellular pathways targeted by PTX and identify novel mechanisms of PTX resistance, we used a SILAC based quantitative proteomic approach to evaluate global changes of cellular protein abundance in HeLa cells. We identified 347 proteins involved in a number of biological processes including spindle assembly, mitotic exit, and extracellular adhesion whose abundance changes upon PTX treatment. Notably, the tumor suppressor PDCD4 involved in translation suppression was down-regulated by PTX. We demonstrated that PDCD4 is a cell-cycle regulated protein and that changes in its abundance are sufficient to alter PTX sensitivity in multiple human cancer cell lines. Immunoprecipitation of PDCD4-RNA complexes and RT-PCR revealed that PDCD4 mediated PTX sensitivity acts through its interaction with mRNA of UBE2S, a ubiquitin K11 linkage conjugating enzyme critical for mitotic exit. Lastly, high levels of PDCD4 in lung cancer tissues are positively correlated with the longer overall survival time of the examined lung cancer patients with PTX involved adjuvant therapy. Therefore, our proteomic screen for paclitaxel targets not only provided novel insight into the cellular resistance to paclitaxel via the PDCD4-mitotic exit regulation axis, but also offered a predictive biomarker for paclitaxel-based personalized chemotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer."

Genetic pre-selection, however, has been limited to Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Recently discovered polymorphisms in the CLU, CR1 and PICALM genes are also moderate risk factors for AD; each affects lifetime AD risk by ~ 10-20%. Here, we tested the hypothesis that pre-selecting subjects based on these variants along with ApoE genotype would further boost clinical trial power, relative to considering ApoE alone, using an MRI-derived 2-year atrophy rate as our outcome measure. We ranked subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) based on their cumulative risk from these four genes. We obtained sample size estimates in cohorts enriched in subjects with greater aggregate genetic risk. Enriching for additional genetic biomarkers reduced the required sample sizes by up to 50%, for MCI trials. Thus, AD drug trial enrichment with multiple genotypes may have potential implications for the timeliness, cost, and power of trials. \u00a9 2013 The Authors."

However, the extent and function of lysine succinylation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, especially extensively drug-resistant strain, remain elusive. Combining protein/peptide prefractionation, immunoaffinity enrichment, and LC-MS/MS analysis, a total of 686 succinylated proteins and 1739 succinylation sites of M. tuberculosis were identified, representing the first global profiling of M. tuberculosis lysine succinylation. The identified succinylated proteins are involved in a variety of cellular functions such as metabolic processes, transcription, translation, and stress responses and exhibit different subcellular localization via GO, protein interaction network, and other bioinformatic analysis. Notably, proteins involved in protein biosynthesis and carbon metabolism are preferred targets of lysine succinylation. Moreover, two prevalent sequence patterns: EK(suc) and K*****K(suc), can be found around the succinylation sites. There are 109 lysine-succinylated homologues in E. coli, suggesting highly conserved succinylated proteins. Succinylation was found to occur at the active sites predicted by Prosite signature including Rv0946c, indicating that lysine succinylation may affect their activities. There is extensive overlapping between acetylation sites and succinylation sites in M. tuberculosis. Many M. tuberculosis metabolic enzymes and antibiotic resistance proteins were succinylated. This study provides a basis for further characterization of the pathophysiological role of lysine succinylation in M. tuberculosis."

Many of the systems designed for this task have been incompletely analysed and have unknown frequency responses themselves. We analyse aspects of systems employed previously and show that substantial amplitude and phase errors may have occurred. We describe a plethysmograph-based system which operates in any available gas mixture. A mathematical model of the acoustic microphone used as reference transducer, the microphone preamplifier, and the thermal behaviour of the plethysmograph, is developed to quantify the frequency response of the system. Maximum deviation from a perfect response is less than 1% in amplitude and 1 degree in phase for both pressure and flow measurements over the range 1-100 Hz. Measurements using a pressure transducer mounted on the tip of a catheter indicate that the error due to amplitude and phase variation in the plethysmograph is less than 0.1 dB and 0.4 degrees at 100 Hz."

We used a microarray profiling strategy to identify novel genes that may regulate the secondary septation process. Rat lung fibroblasts were extemporaneously isolated on postnatal days 2, 7, and 21, i.e., before, during, and after septation, respectively. Total RNA was extracted, and cRNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix rat genome 230 2.0 microarrays. Expression levels of a selection of genes were confirmed by real-time PCR. In addition to genes already known to be upregulated during alveolarization including drebrin, midkine, Fgfr3, and Fgfr4, the study allowed us to identify two remarkable groups of genes with opposite profiles, i.e., gathering genes either transiently up- or downregulated on day 7. The former group includes the transcription factors retinoic acid receptor (RXR)-gamma and homeobox (Hox) a2, a4, and a5 and genes involved in Wnt signaling (Wnt5a, Fzd1, and Ndp); the latter group includes the extracellular matrix components Comp and Opn and the signal molecule Slfn4. Profiling in whole lung from fetal life to adulthood confirmed that changes were specific for alveolarization. Two treatments that arrest septation, hyperoxia and dexamethasone, inhibited the expression of genes that are upregulated during alveolarization and conversely enhanced that of genes weakly expressed during alveolarization and upregulated thereafter. The possible roles of these genes in secondary septation are discussed. Gene expression profiling analysis on freshly isolated cells represents a powerful approach to provide new information about differential regulation of genes during alveolarization and pathways potentially involved in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia."

To simplify the genetic and phenotypic complexity of the alcoholic phenotype, alcohol-preferring (P) and -non-preferring (NP) rats were developed on the basis of alcohol preference and consumption as an animal model of alcoholism. Total gene expression analysis (TOGA) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis were applied to selectively bred, inbred P and NP rats as complementary studies to identify genetic factors that contribute to alcohol preference and consumption. TOGA analysis was utilized to screen for differential expression in several brain regions involved in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system. Genes exhibiting differences in expression were then screened for an association to the alcohol preference phenotype, the quantitative trait of a previously identified QTL. By evaluating differences in gene expression for linkage to a quantitative trait, this combined approach was implemented to identify alpha-synuclein, a candidate gene for alcohol preference."

Leaves and pods from two geographically different sources were distinguished from each other via proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) and ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analysis. Under optimized conditions, we were able to simultaneously quantify and identify 107 metabolites including 21 anthraquinones, 24 bianthrones (including sennosides), 5 acetophenones, 25 C/O-flavonoid conjugates, 5 xanthones, 3 naphthalenes, 2 further phenolics, and 9 fatty acids. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) were used to define both similarities and differences among samples. For sample classification based on tissue type (leaf and pod), both UPLC-MS and NMR were found to be more effective in separation than on geographical origin. Results reveal that the amounts of the major classes of bioactives in Senna, i.e., flavonoids and sennosides, varied significantly among organs. Leaves contained more flavonoids and omega-3 fatty acids but fewer benzophenone derivatives than pods. In contrast, pods were more enriched in bianthrones (sennosides). PCA analysis was found to be equally effective in predicting the origin of the commercial Senna preparation using NMR and/or UPLC-MS datasets. Furthermore, a selection of six so far uninvestigated Senna species were analyzed by UPLC-MS. Results revealed that the Senna alata leaf in terms of secondary metabolite composition is the most closely related species to S. alexandrina Mill, showing the highest levels of the anthraquinone \"rhein\" and flavonoid conjugates. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first approach utilizing both UPLC-MS and NMR to reveal secondary metabolite compositional differences among Senna species."

The particles were applied alone, 30 minutes previous to the protease application and simultaneously with the protease onto porcine skin. Subsequently, biopsies were removed and the penetration depths of the particles were analysed using laser scanning microscopy. The obtained results demonstrate that the particles alone achieved a penetration depth of around 900 \u03bcm. Similar results were obtained for the successive application of particles and protease, whereas a release of the fluorescent dye was only observed in the upper 250 \u03bcm corresponding to the penetration depth of the protease. In the case of the simultaneous application, the particles were partly dissolved before application, leading to a reduced particle size and diminished penetration depth. The results revealed that degradable particles are a promising tool for drug delivery into the skin."

To date, no biomarkers have been validated clinically to guide subsequent therapy in these patients. In this study, we mapped the genome-wide chromatin-binding profiles of estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1), along with the epigenetic modifications H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, that are responsible for determining gene transcription (n = 12). Differential binding patterns of ER\u03b1, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 were enriched between patients with good or poor outcomes after aromatase inhibition. ER\u03b1 and H3K27me3 patterns were validated in an additional independent set of breast cancer cases (n = 10). We coupled these patterns to array-based proximal gene expression and progression-free survival data derived from a further independent cohort of 72 aromatase inhibitor-treated patients. Through this approach, we determined that the ER\u03b1 and H3K27me3 profiles predicted the treatment outcomes for first-line aromatase inhibitors. In contrast, the H3K4me3 pattern identified was not similarly informative. The classification potential of these genes was only partially preserved in a cohort of 101 patients who received first-line tamoxifen treatment, suggesting some treatment selectivity in patient classification."

A panel of 74 SNPs in 25 genes involved in blood pressure regulation was selected from the SNP databases, and genotyped in DNA samples of 97 hypertensive patients. The patients had been randomized to double-blind treatment with either the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker irbesartan or the beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol. Genotyping was performed using a microarray based DNA polymerase assisted 'minisequencing' single nucleotide primer extension assay with fluorescence detection. The observed genotypes were related to the blood pressure reduction using stepwise multiple regression analysis. The allele frequencies of the selected SNPs were determined in the Swedish population. The established microarray-based genotyping system was validated and allowed unequivocal multiplex genotyping of the panel of 74 SNPs in every patient. Almost 7200 SNP genotypes were generated in the study. Profiles of four or five SNP-genotypes that may be useful as predictors of blood pressure reduction after antihypertensive treatment were identified. Our results highlight the potential of microarray-based technology for SNP genotyping in pharmacogenetics."

        "abstract": "Tetracycline is one of a group of drugs known to induce microvesicular steatosis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of tetracycline on gene expression in mouse liver, using Applied Biosystems Mouse Genome Survey Microarrays. A single oral dose of 0.1 or 1 g/kg tetracycline was administered to male ICR mice, and liver samples were obtained after 6, 24, or 72 h. Histopathological evaluation showed microvesicular steatosis in the high-dose group at 24 h. In total, 96 genes were identified as tetracycline responsive. Their level of expression differed significantly from controls (two-way analysis of variance; p < 0.05), after adjustment by the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction, and displayed a twofold or greater induction or repression. The largest groups of gene products affected by tetracycline exposure were those involved in signal transduction, nucleic acid metabolism, developmental processes, and protein metabolism. The expression of genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism was examined, using two-sample Student's t-test for each treatment group versus a corresponding control group. The overall net effects on expression of lipid metabolism genes indicated an increase in cholesterol and triglyceride biosynthesis and a decrease in beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Our data support a proposed mechanism for tetracycline-induced steatogenic hepatotoxicity that involves these processes. Moreover, we demonstrated global changes in hepatic gene expression following tetracycline exposure; many of these genes have the potential to be used as biomarkers of exposure to steatogenic hepatotoxic agents."

Because of the widespread use of SMZ, a considerable amount is indeed expected to be introduced into the environment. The cytotoxicity of SMZ relies mainly on arylhydroxylamine metabolites (S-NOH) of SMZ and it is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). There is limited information about the toxic potential of SMZ at the cellular and molecular levels, especially in aquatic and/or non-target organisms. In the present study, the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), being tolerant to extreme environmental conditions and resistant to disease, was used as a model organism to profile the molecular and physiological response to SMZ. Haemolymphatic-immunological parameters such as glucose serum levels and total haemocyte counts were altered; moreover, a significant increase in Hsp70 plasma levels was detected for the first time. Variations at the transcriptional level of proinflammatory genes (cyclooxygenase-1, COX 1, and cyclooxygenase-2, COX 2), antioxidant enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase, GST and manganese superoxide dismutase MnSOD), stress response and Fenton reaction inhibitor genes (heat-shock protein 70 HSP70, metallothionein, MT and ferritin, FT) were evaluated, and alterations in the canonical gene expression patterns emerged. Considering these results, specific mechanisms involved in maintaining physiological homeostasis and adaptation in response to perturbations are suggested. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc."

Surface tension data were generated by the \"Du Nouy maximum pull force method\" using an automated, small volume Kibron Delta 8 Multi-channel tensiometer. Using the surface pressure/concentration profiles, parameters such as the maximum surface pressure, cross-sectional area and the air-water partitioning coefficient were calculated for the individual compounds and correlated with their in vivo logbb values. A good linear correlation (R(2)=0.8669) between logbb and cross-sectional area was observed, suggesting a morphological analogy between the molecular orientation at the air-water interface and the anisotropic cellular bilayer of the blood-brain barrier."

We reported that the intracellular protein profile in HepG2 cells incubated with S(-) and R(+) warfarin, using iTRAQ-coupled 2-D LC-MS/MS. In samples incubated with S(-) and R(+) warfarin alone, the multi-task protein Protein SET showed significant elevation in cells incubated with S(-) warfarin but not in those incubated with R(+) warfarin. In cells incubated with individual enantiomers of warfarin in the presence of vitamin K, protein disulfide isomerase A3 which is known as a glucose-regulated protein, in cells incubated with S(-) warfarin was found to be down-regulated compared to those incubated with R(+) warfarin. In addition, Protein DJ-1 and 14-3-3 Proteinsigma were down-regulated in cells incubated with either S(-) or R(+) warfarin regardless of the presence of vitamin K. Our results indicated that Protein DJ-1 may act as an enzyme for expression of essential enzymes in vitamin K cycle.

Building on previous research, the current study compares the relative ability of logistic regression analysis and classification tree analysis to construct predictive models for the purposes of case linkage. Two samples are utilised in this study: a sample of 376 serial car thefts committed in the UK and a sample of 160 serial residential burglaries committed in Finland. In both datasets, logistic regression and classification tree models achieve comparable levels of discrimination accuracy, but the classification tree models demonstrate problems in terms of reliability or usability that the logistic regression models do not. These findings suggest that future research is needed before classification tree analysis can be considered a viable alternative to logistic regression in behavioural case linkage.Copyright\u00a92012 JohnWiley&Sons, Ltd.

From these, 80 linked crime pairs (committed by the same serial offender) and 80 unlinked crime pairs (com- mitted by two different serial offenders) were created. Following the methodology used by previous researchers, the behavioural similarity, geographical proximity, and temporal proximity of linked crime pairs were compared with those of unlinked crime pairs. Geo- graphical and temporal proximity possessed a high degree of predictive accuracy in distinguishing linked from unlinked pairs as assessed by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Comparatively, other traditional modus operandi behaviours showed less potential for linkage. Whilst personality psychology literature has suggested we might expect to fi nd a relationship between temporal proximity and behavioural consistency, such a relationship was not observed."

Data on serial burglars, arsonists and sex offenders were extracted from the criminal records maintained by the NSW Police Service. The offence style of each offender\u2019s crime series was identified in order to relate the offence style to the demographic variables, and to examine the offender\u2019s first and last offences in a series. A commuter offence style was more likely to be adopted by burglars and generally by adult males. A marauding offence style was apparent in sex offenders and metropolitan based offenders. There was a progression in the distance travelled to offend across all crime types, as the last offence was located further from the home base by comparison with the first. These findings serve to validate the conceptual distinction between commuter and marauder offence styles. Several implications for further research are addressed."

        "abstract": "Linkage analysis is a crucial part of the investigative process when faced with a possible series of related offences. Establishing behavioural consistency (i.e., offender's behaviours consistently present across the series) is at the core of linkage. Recent empirical studies have found little evidence of consistency looking at either individual or groups of behaviours in serial homicide. It is argued that behavioural changes are rooted in the changing cognitive strategies that offenders use to reach their ultimate goal (i.e. the commission of multiple homicides). Factors that could account for these changes include learning, situational factors, loss of control, and changes in the offender's fantasy. Patterns of behavioural change have been identified in serial crimes, such as rape. However, no empirical studies have looked at patterns of behavioural change in serial homicide. The present study examined patterns of consistency and change using a combination of thematic and behavioural subgroup approaches that use Multidimensional Scaling. Thematic differentiation indicative of behavioural manifestations of cognitive strategies was found in all three examined subgroups: planning, wounding, and offender\u2013victim interaction, and patterns of change within these subgroups provided support for the above theories. Looking at behavioural patterns rather than individual behaviours, may be a more fruitful way of examining consistency in serial homicide, and could have significant implications for linkage analysis.

        "abstract": "We present two lie detection approaches based on cognitive theory. The first approach, \u2018measuring cognitive load\u2019, assumes that the mere act of lying generates observable signs of cognitive load. This is the traditional cognitive lie detection approach formulated by Zuckerman, DePaulo, & Rosenthal (1981). The second approach, \u2018imposing cognitive load\u2019, was developed by us (Vrij, Fisher, Mann, & Leal, 2006) and goes one step further. Here, the lie detector attempts to actively increase the differences between lying and truth telling by introducing mentally taxing interventions. We assume that people require more cognitive resources when they lie than when they tell the truth to produce their statements, and therefore will have fewer cognitive resources left over to address these mentally taxing interventions when they lie than when they tell the truth. This should result in more pronounced differences between lying and truth telling in terms of displaying stronger signs of cognitive load. We provide empirical support for this approach: Observers can discriminate better between lying and truth telling when interviewers actively impose mentally taxing interventions.

It was hypothesised that the game would stimulate rapport building and would ultimately result in an increased performance during the line-up procedure.

Participants responded to a range of case-related questions after reading a judges summary' of a hypothetical action alleging sexual discrimination in the workplace by means of sexual stereotyping. Expert witness' sex, plaintiff's (i.e. employee's) sex, and workplace type were manipulated in the summary. Evidence for the greater effectiveness of a female social science expert in the 'gender domain congruent' area of sexual stereotyping was found; however, plaintiff's sex and occupation type did not influence the participants' judgements except that experts supporting female plaintiffs were viewed positively. The participants' attitudes towards the case, and to other personnel involved, were negative. Analysis of the participants' comments indicated considerable distrust of and scepticism about social science. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

Using predictions based on cognitive experiential self-theory, we explored the infl uence of testimony type (clinical versus actuarial) and diagnostic label (psychopath versus paraphilia) on jurors motivated to adopt either an experiential pro- cessing mode (PM; in which heuristic cues may be strongly relied upon) or an analytic rational PM. Consistent with previous research, our results indicated that when given a psychopathic diagnostic label, mock jurors motivated to process information experien- tially were more infl uenced by clinical testimony, whereas mock jurors induced into a rational mode were more infl uenced by actuarial testimony. However, experientially oriented jurors given a paraphilia diagnostic label did not show the expected infl uence of clinical expert testimony, and instead were more persuaded by actuarial testimony. These fi ndings are discussed from a judgement and heuristics cues framework. The implications of several procedural suggestions are examined. Copyright"

This paper tests the underlying assumptions of case linkage (behavioural consistency and behavioural distinctiveness) by comparing the behavioural similarity of linked pairs of offences (i.e. two offences committed by the same offender) with the behavioural similarity of unlinked pairs of offences (i.e. two offences committed by different offenders). It is hypothesised that linked pairs will be more behaviourally similar than unlinked pairs thereby providing evidence for the two assumptions. The current research uses logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses to explore which behaviours can be used to reliably link personal robbery offences using a sample of 166 solved offences committed by 83 offenders. Themethod of generating unlinked pairs is then refinedtoreflect how the policework at a local level, and the success of predictive factors re-tested. Both phases of the research provide evidence of behavioural consistency and behavioural distinctiveness with linked pairs display- ing more similarity than unlinked pairs across a range of behavioural domains. Inter-crime distance and target selection emerge as the most useful linkage factors with promising results also found for temporal proximity and control. No evidence was found to indicate that the property stolen is useful for linkage."

Such threats occur despite professional standards in forensic psychology and other mental health disciplines that require ethical expert testimony. The result is expert testimony that, in many instances, is at best incompetent and at worst biased. The paper details threats to competent expert testimony in a comparative law context\u2014in both the common law (involuntary civil commitment laws and risk assessment criminal laws) and, more briefly, civil law. We conclude that teleology, pretextuality, and sanism have an impact upon judicial decision making in both the common law and civil law.

Witness confidence, opportunity to view, and type of information proffered were examined in relation to detective inferences about witness reliability, accuracy, and probable cause to arrest. Experiment 1 involved 39 sworn law enforcement officers, and experiment 2 involved 43 sworn law enforcement officers and 86 mock detectives. Participants viewed a digital recording depicting a witness describing a gas station robbery (Experiment 1) or a campus mugging (Experiment 2). Witness confidence and detectives' inferences about culprit information influenced the vetting process and lent credibility to a confident witness whose accuracy was objectively unknown. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that sworn law enforcement are comparable with untrained observers in their use of social inference cues (i.e. confidence) in determining witness credibility; however, social inference can be assuaged by the rational, rule-governed, decision framework established for witness vetting. Social inference processes inherent in the detective-witness dyad is influenced by legal procedures in vetting witness information. Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We compared a more theory-based, dimensional behavioural approachwith a rather pragmatic,multivariate behavioural approachwith regard to their accuracy in linking serial sexual assaults in a UK sample of serial sexual assaults (n=90) and one-off sexual assaults (n=129). Their respective linkage accuracy was assessed by (1) using seven dimensions derived by non-parametric Mokken scale analysis (MSA) as predictors in discriminant function analysis (DFA) and (2) 46 crime scene characteristics simultaneously in a naive Bayesian classifier (NBC). The dimensional scales predicted 28.9% of the series correctly, whereas the NBC correctly identified 34.5% of the series. However, a subsequent inclusion of non-serial offences in the target group decreased the amount of correct links in the dimensional approach (MSA\u2013DFA: 8.9%; NBC: 32.2%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used as a more objective comparison of the twomethods under both conditions, confirming that each achieved good accuracies (AUCs=.74\u2013.89), but the NBC performed significantly better than the dimensional approach. The consequences for the practical implementation in behavioural case linkage are discussed."

As a result, older adults are coming more frequently into contact with the Criminal Justice System as witnesses to and victims of crime. Older adults are also over-represented in crimes where conversation detail is of particular importance to an investigation (e.g. distraction burglary). The present study therefore examined the efficacy of cognitive interview (CI) compared with structured interview in improving the recall of an event by older witnesses, specifically conversational detail. Young adults (19-54 years old), young-old adults (60-74 years old), and old-old adults (75+ years old) were asked to watch a short film of a laptop theft and were then, after a 1.5 hour delay, randomly allocated to one of two interview conditions. It was found that the CI significantly increased recall of all age groups, without increasing the amount of incorrect or confabulated information reported. The individuals in the young adult and the young-old adult conditions were found to remember significantly more than the individuals from the old-old adult condition, without decreasing the accuracy of the information. The CI enhanced memory for conversation gist, person and action detail. Results will be discussed in relation to interviewing and investigating practices.

Conceptual inspection of the typology reveals that these proposed types may be hypothetically demarcated as the product of two latent dimensions: interaction (between the offender and the victim) and violence (used to threaten/harm the victim). The current paper utilises crime scene information from 72 incarcerated male offenders convicted of \u2018street\u2019 robbery to test this hypothesis. Convergent statistical analysis was utilised to test the structure of Smith\u2019s typology first using multidimensional scaling (MDS) and then principal component analysis (PCA). MDS and PCA analyses provided convergent support for the existence of the four robbery styles and the latent dimensions of interaction and violence. Implications of Smith\u2019s typological structure and latent behavioural dimensions on the conceptualisation and classification of robbery offences are discussed within the existing literature on \u2018street\u2019 robbery."

Data from five chart review studies of a combined total of 894 forensic CSA evaluations provided sufficient information to assess the validity of these assumptions. Corroborative evidence was present in 36% of the 894 evaluations and in 54% of evaluations in which MHPs judged the allegations likely to be true, contradicting the first assumption. In the evaluations in which corroborative evidence was present, the presence or absence of a child's report of sexual abuse was only weakly associated with MHPs' judgements about the validity of the allegations (allegations in almost all corroborated cases were judged likely to be true, even in the absence of a child's report), partially contradicting the second assumption.

Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that asked them to predict the type of offence that an individual with a specified prior record would most probably commit next. Participating police personnel substantially overstated the homogeneity of criminal careers, that is, the nature of prior offences determined their prediction of their next offence more than available official data would deem reasonable. An incidental finding was that officers who rated the probability of further offending highest were also those who thought criminal careers most specialised. The implications for operational police decision-making were discussed and held to be profound."

Additionally, the effect of explanatory backstory was examined in the same context; respondents were given prior information, which was either consistent or inconsistent with the presence of the flintlock in the scene, in order to gauge the influence of appropriate or inappropriate explanatory cognitive context. Finally, the effects of these variables on line-up identification of the \u2018suspect\u2019 holding the given weapon were addressed. The results showed that weapon type did not influence recall accuracy for given weapons, although explanatory backstory did have a significant effect here, as initially predicted. Both weapon type and explanatory backstory produced significant effects on weapon recall errors, with the exotic weapon and the more prosaic backstory producing larger numbers of mistakes. Neither of these variables was associated with significant differences in line-up performance. These results indicate the importance of prior cognitive context, as well as the physical appearance of weapons, in a full understanding of eyewitness processing of scenes involving firearms"

One hundred field investigative interviews of children were divided into two groups based on the interviewers' level of competence (training and experience). The police officers' questions were classified into groups of either open or closed. In all interviews, the mean numbers were 20 open and 217 closed questions, corresponding to an open-closed question ratio of 1:10. The most competent interviewers used 22 open questions and the less competent used 19 open questions, but the difference was not statistically significant. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant effect of question but no main effect of competence. ANOVA revealed a descending number of open questions during the interviews, whilst the distribution of closed questions showed an inverted U distribution with most frequent use of closed questions in the middle part of the interviews. Possible strategies of enhancing the use of open questions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)"

The user navigation sessions are modelled as a hypertext probabilistic grammar whose higher probability strings correspond to the user\u2019s preferred trails. An algorithm to efficiently mine such trails is given. We make use of the N gram model which assumes that the last N pages browsed affect the probability of the next page to be visited. The model is based on the theory of probabilistic grammars providing it with a sound theoretical foundation for future enhancements. Moreover, we propose the use of entropy as an estimator of the grammar\u2019s statistical properties. Extensive experiments were conducted and the results show that the algorithm runs in linear time, the grammar\u2019s entropy is a good estimator of the number of mined trails and the real data rules confirm the effectiveness of the model.

Transcripts of investigative interviews with 3-year-old to 16-year-old children who all reported on sexual abuse were assessed (n = 32). There were no effects found concerning the relationship between prosecution rate on the one hand, and interview quality, age, and the child's relationship with the suspected offender on the other. The interviews with older children were, on several aspects, scored as higher in quality. The relationships between these findings and child sexual abuse investigations and interviews are discussed"

        "abstract": "This paper explores the life story accounts of 12 left wing terrorists in India. Narrative interviews revealed that the accounts were broadly coherent and contained similar rhetorical structures with regard to: i) images of the self (imagoes); ii) significant others (interpersonal figures); and iii) visions of the future (generativity script). Specifically, it appeared that individuals developed imagoes of poverty and oppression, identified the state structure as corrupt, and terrorist leaders as heroes of the oppressed. Further, the accounts revealed a commitment to an exploitation-free society (generativity script) and an ideological devotion to a rhetoric that justifies extreme violence. The paper considers the possibility that such coherence is formulated around propaganda and indoctrination that is more sympathetic and harmonious with these individuals' worldview and hence has a powerful shaping process on their development. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of the findings and suggest major policy shifts in dealing with the left wing terrorist groups in India. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

The present study involved a narrative analysis of the details written within 147 sets of allegation statements across both short-term (~3months) and long-term (~6months) intervals. Overall results indicated that true allegations contained more consistent details, omissions and commissions, although the rates of change over time were variable. These changes appear to result from natural variations in memory and recall over time. However, direct contradictions (inconsistent details) were more prevalent in false allegations, and these claims were more stable over time, suggesting \u2018script-like\u2019 processing. These results have implications for our understand- ing of testimonial alterations and how determinations of veracity are influenced by statement details."

In interviews taking place in prisons, offenders (n=35) provided lie-telling strategies in a free narrative style. In an inductive content analysis, we coded both all strategies provided as well as one principal strategy for each participant. In total, 13 strategies were identified,which were grouped into three broader cat- egory groups: general verbal, general nonverbal, and specific interview strategies. The most often stated strategieswereClose to truth, Eye contact, and No strategy. The most often stated principal strategies were Close to truth, Not giving away information, and No strategy. Some participants provided strategies, such as not giving away information at all in interviews/ interrogations, which showed a sophisticated understanding of the police interview situation and the task of the police and prosecutor. Overall, the participants showed great diversity in preferred lie-telling strategy. The results are partly in line with previous research from student samples and provide new insights into the criminally experienced individuals\u2019 lie- telling strategies. The results are discussed with regard to impression and information management and police interrogation practice. Copyright"

Each participant was randomly assigned to one of four conditions; Early Weak, Early Strong, Late Weak, or Late Strong. Both late evidence disclosure, and strong evidence, produced higher confession rates than did early disclosure or weak evidence, and late disclosure of weak evidence resulted in the withdrawal of most of the confessions which had previously been made."

Each partici-pant produced a written statement and participated in an investigative interview; word usage in both was analyzed. Word usage differentiated truths from lies in both the written statement and the investigative interview, and the effect sizes associated with these findings were substantial. For the written statement, word usage predicted truths from lies at 68.90% classification accuracy; for the investigative interview, word usage predicted truths from lies at 71.10% accuracy. Ethnicity did not moderate these effects. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications to cross-cultural applicability of the psychological demands placed on liars and in terms of their practical field utility."

Rapport can play a facilitating role in supporting the goals of an investiga- tive interview, to include developing a working alliance between interviewer and source, exercising social influence, and educing information from a source. A better understanding of how rapport develops in these contexts and its impact on interview outcomes would enhance the effectiveness of investigative interviewing. Research on rapport in the investigative interview would enhance our understanding of the interpersonal dynamics in these situations. We identify several gaps that such research should address, including the relationship between rapport and social influence and the development of rapport in multiparty interactions."

That is, these parties may readily become convinced that the suspect is guilty, and may then no longer be open to alternative scenarios in which the suspect is actually innocent. This may be reflected in a preference for guilt-confirming investigation endeavours, as opposed to investigations that are aimed at confirming, or even excluding, alternative scenarios. In three studies, participants read a case file, and were subsequently instructed to select additional police investigations. Some of these additional endeavours were guilt-confirming (i.e. incriminating), whereas others were disconfirming (i.e. exonerating). Results suggest that additional investigation search was guided by an initial assessment of the suspect's guilt (Study 1). Furthermore, participants' tendency to select incriminating investigations"

Specific areas of the dialogue between Christopher Porco and law enforcement demonstrates that traditional methods of interviewing may not produce a confession or valuable information when it comes to psychopathic suspects. Although the traditional goal of an interview is to obtain a confession or valuable information, law enforcement will have to display flexibility in the interview process by implementing alternative interview strategies and redefining what a successful interview is composed of when these suspects are unwilling to confess to their crimes. Failure to remain flexible, as displayed in the Christopher Porco case, which yielded neither a confession nor valuable information, can jeopardise the strength of a homicide case that ultimately may go to trial.

A qualitative analysis was undertaken of the comments of 22 British detectives as they conducted a \u2018virtual investigation\u2019 of an allegation of attempted rape of an adult woman. Material was \u2018drip fed\u2019 to detectives in a simulation exercise, and officers were asked to express their thoughts as they processed each document in the \u2018investigation\u2019 to evaluate detective decision making. It was anticipated that this method would shed light both on the dynamic nature of detectives\u2019 thinking during an investigation and on variations in perception of the same material by different officers. It was found that the alleged rape victim was perceived primarily as a source of information to progress enquiries, with her welfare needs taking second place. Although some police officers revealed sceptical attitudes to rape allegations, the investigative approach that all took was professional and pragmatic, \u2018investigating\u2019 the report as true and focusing on corroborating the victim\u2019s account. The balance between the needs of the victim and the needs of the investigation is discussed, with implications for rape survivor support."

A sample of 24 female and 12 male rape victims aged from 13 to 39 years were analysed. The data were extracted from the US National Crime Survey, which contained 12 reported cases of male rape. It was hypothesised that the theme of power would be evident from the rapists' behaviour as illustrated by the crime scene actions and victim-offender interaction. Smallest Space Analysis, a multi-dimensional scaling technique, was employed to identify the themes present in the perpetration of rape. The crime scene actions illustrated several distinctions relating to the theme of power present in the offender's motives irrespective of the victim's gender. An additional finding was that victim resistance strategies differentiated between male and female rape victims. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

The consistency scores were calculated using the Jaccard\u2019s coefficient. The results of this study indicate that there are some crime features of a serial sexual assault that can be useful for the purpose of linkage. Another important finding is that consistency scores for different variables within the same category can differ substantially. Moreover, serial sex offenders are more likely to be consistent in their environmental crime features when they are also consistent in their behavioural features, and vice versa. Serial sex offenders are also more likely to be consistent in the behavioural features of their assaults as the crime series gets longer. The implications of the results are discussed in relation to both research and practise."

The present study addressed questions of eyewitness performance with reference to repeated questioning in an initial interview, in a format based on actual police procedures. This experiment focused on eyewitness accuracy, eyewitness confidence, and the addition of false details to eyewitness accounts. Ninety\u2010two adult respondents were asked to recall all the information they could from a single viewing of a scene depicting an assailant aiming a handgun at a victim. This initial question was followed by three additional questions, in which respondents were asked to report any additional details they could recall. On average, respondents provided several times as many correct as false details to the initial question. However, performance deteriorated significantly to the three subsequent questions; on average, across the three subsequent questions, witnesses recalled nearly as much false as accurate information. Witness confidence was positively related to amount of accurate information recalled. However, confidence was also positively related to the number of instances of erroneous recall. These results indicate that reconfigurative dynamics begin to operate, producing confabulated responses in response to questioning demands, as early as the initial interview. This work may also help to clarify the critical relationship between accuracy and confidence in eyewitness reportage, at least within the framework reflected by the present research.

        "abstract": "This study investigated whether high fantasy-prone individuals have superior storytelling abilities. It also explored whether this trait is related to specific linguistic features (i.e. self-references, cognitive complexity, and emotional words). Participants high (n = 30) and low (n = 30) on a fantasy proneness scale were instructed to write down a true and a fabricated story about an aversive situation in which they had been the victim. Stories were then examined using two verbal lie detection approaches: criteria-based content analysis ({CBCA)} and linguistic inquiry and word count ({LIWC).} Irrespective of the truth status of the stories, independent observers rated stories of high fantasy-prone individuals as being richer in all nine {CBCA} elements than those of low fantasy-prone individuals. Furthermore, overall, high fantasy-prone people used more self-references in their stories compared with low fantasy-prone individuals. High fantasy prones' fabricated stories scored higher on various truth indices than authentic stories of low fantasy prones. Thus, high fantasy-prone people are good in creating a sense of authenticity, even when they fabricate stories. Forensic experts should bear this in mind when they employ verbal lie detection tools.

        "abstract": "Limited research exists on the impact of contextual factors such as victim intoxication and victim attire on police processing of a case of sexual assault. The effects of these variables were examined in a simulated sexual assault case. Participants were 125 detectives from the New South Wales Police Department. Offi cers read controverted witness statements and viewed photographs pertaining to an investigation of a report of date rape. Contrary to fi ndings in earlier studies, complainant intoxication, \u2018provocative\u2019 dress, and gender of the offi cer had no infl uence on the likelihood of charging the alleged offender. Factors predictive of pressing charges were the perceived credibility of the complainant and cul- pability of the alleged offender. Credibility and guilt judgements were themselves infl u- enced by the level of rape myth acceptance endorsed by the offi cers. Rape myth acceptance also exerted a number of other effects on case evaluations. Implications for future studies and education and training programmes for police on sexual assault were discussed.

It is hypothesised that, in general, burglars are attracted to neighbourhoods that are nearby their homes, nearby the city centre, affluent, physically accessible, and characterised by social disorganisation. In addition, differences between solitary burglars and co-offending burglar groups regarding the strength of these criteria are assessed. The results support the postulated relevance of physical accessibility and proximity to the offenders\u2019 homes for both single offenders and co-offending groups. However, solitary burglars and burglar groups seem to agree on what constitutes an attractive target area, because no evidence for the postulated differences between them is found."

Journey-to- crime estimation is a tool that uses crime locations to tell us where to search for a serial offender\u2019s home. In this paper, we test a new method: empirical Bayes journey-to-crime estimation. It differs from previous methods because it utilises an \u2018origin\u2013destination\u2019 rule in addition to the \u2018distance decay\u2019 rule that prior methods have used. In the new method, the profi ler not only asks \u2018what distances did previous offenders travel between their home and the crime scenes?\u2019 but also \u2018where did previous offenders live who offended at the locations included in the crime series I investigate right now?\u2019. The new method could not only improve predictive accuracy, it could also reduce the traditional distinction between marauding and commuting offenders. Utilising the CrimeStat software, we apply the new method to 62 serial burglars in The Hague, The Netherlands, and show that the new method has higher predictive accuracy than methods that only exploit a distance decay rule. The new method not only improves the accuracy of predicting the homes of commuters\u2014offenders who live outside their offending area\u2014it also improves the search for marauders\u2014offenders who live inside their offending area. After presenting an example of the application of the technique for prediction of a specifi c burglar, we discuss the limitations of the method and offer some suggestions for its future development."

        "abstract": "Criminal history narrative studies reveal an escalation in sexual offender behaviour from non-contact to contact offending, with an ever-increasing likelihood of sexual violence and homicide. In particular, researchers have found that sexual offenders often have a history of committing burglaries prior to contact offences. Accordingly, researchers have suggested that burglaries may be associated with an increased likelihood of future sexual offending, particularly when they have a sexual element to them. However, to date, there has been little quantitative research focusing on the mechanisms of escalation in sexual of- fences. This paper seeks to study factors associated with sexual offence escalation in terms of changes in offence seriousness and frequency. Specifically, case evidence was gleaned from a series of fetish burglaries and subsequent sexual assaults and murders committed by the former Canadian Colonel David Russell Williams (RW). Cluster analysis, chi- square, ANOVA, and regression analyses were conducted on the crime scene information of RW\u2019s 82 cases of fetish burglary. Analyses revealed a significant escalation in the fre- quency and seriousness of RW\u2019s fetish burglary offences prior to committing acts of sexual violence and ultimately sexual homicide. Recommendations for future research predicting escalation of sexual offending by frequency and seriousness of offending behaviour are discussed"

A card sorting exercise consisting of 20 crime scene photographs showing homicide victims in situ was designed to examine how detectives categorise and conceptualise homicide crime scenes. Forty homicide detectives were asked to \u00e2\u0080\u0098think aloud\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whilst categorising the crime scenes. Qualitative content analysis of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098think aloud\u00e2\u0080\u0099 accounts revealed detectives' intuitive ability to automatically make detailed inferences regarding the circumstances surrounding each homicide on the basis of available crime scene information (victim's sex, location, and method of death). A cycle of cognition was evident whereby detectives drew upon the contextual information available to generate hypotheses regarding homicide type (domestic, male brawl, and crime-related) and derive inferences about victim\u00e2\u0080\u0093offender relationship, offender behaviour, motive, and whether the offence was spontaneous or planned. The detectives made 594 inferences of which 67% (N\u00e2\u0080\u0089=\u00e2\u0080\u0089398) were accurate. The sorting exercise proved to be ecologically valid, with detectives reporting that they assessed and interpreted the homicide crime scenes, as they would in an actual investigation.

Similar to what has been advised in the police literature, the truthful baseline behaviour was established prior to the interview through non-threatening questions. The investigative part of the interview then followed in which the interviewee was aware that they would be assessed on whether they were lying. During the investigative part, interviewees either discussed the job that they had (truth tellers, n=128) or pretended to have (liars, n=115). Findings revealed that both liars and truth tellers\u2019 behavioural patterns differed between the baseline behaviour and the investigative part of the interview. The findings suggest small talk should not be used as a baseline comparison with the investigative part of the interview when determining if the interviewee is being deceitful. An alternative way of using a baseline lie detection method, the comparable truth method, is discussed."

Some scholars have attempted to draw links between laboratory and correlational research on video game playing and school shooting incidents. This paper argues that such claims are faulty and fail to acknowledge the significant methodological and constructional divides between existing video game research and acts of serious aggression and violence. It is concluded that no significant relationship between violent video game exposure and school shooting incidents has been demonstrated in the existing scientific literature, and that data from real world violence call such a link into question."

Children in the uniform present conditions made significantly more choices than children in the uniform absent conditions. More importantly, in the presence of a uniform, children made significantly more false identifications in target-absent line-ups. Analysis of supplementary, identification-related variables (identification time and confidence, state anxiety) suggested that (1) the children experienced uncertainty if the target was absent from the line-up, but (2) this uncertainty was not expressed when the line-up administrator wore a uniform, leading to an increase in false identifications. Implications for line-up administration procedures for children are discussed."

There have however to date been very few studies aiming at identifying salient components of offending behaviour that can be used reliably for linking individual crimes as part of a single series. In addition, studies that have been conducted have all dealt with serial homicide in the Western world and have been based on small samples of cases from each country. Some of the recent literature has started to disentangle some of these salient features, notably the victim, violence levels, control, and planning. The current study focused on evaluating the consistency of these features across series, using a sample of serial homicides from South Africa consisting of 30 offenders with a total of 283 victims and 235 crime scenes. Results indicate that the level of interaction with the victim may be influential to the stability or instability of offending patterns across the series. How offenders approach planning in their offence also showed a certain degree of consistency, with patterns of violence being the least consistent across the series of all components tested. "

Multivariate statistical analyses were applied on the data- matrix of 22 variables and showed the co-occurrences of various aspects of computer se- curity incidents. A radex structure emerged where the high frequency variables were positioned in the centre of the data-plot. Based on a previously developed taxonomy of cyber intrusions, the results of the analysis showed that it was possible to draw inferences about the less informative category of Objective, from information about Attacker, Tools, Access, and Results. By applying the division-lines indicating the Objectives of Chal- lenge/Status, Destruction, Political Gain and Financial Gain on the SSA-plot, it was shown how the taxonomies could be further developed by taking into account the relationships between the categories."

The material was content analysed with regard to the occurrence of a number of dichotomous variables. The inter-relationships of the variables was studied using MDS. The analysis revealed two previously identified major modes of interaction with the victim: involvement and hostil- ity. Employing MDS and DFA, it was shown that the offences of different offenders were distinguishable in terms of variation between the offences of different offenders and con- sistency within the offences of a single offender. Using DFA, the classification accuracy clearly exceeds that expected by chance, and 25.6% of the cases were classified without any error.

However, interviewing officers are trained in an interviewing framework that includes the importance of evaluating interviews as a means of improving skills. In light of the scarcity of research concerning the evaluation task, this study examined perceptions of benefit fraud investigation personnel. A questionnaire was answered by 114 respondents including investigators, investigation managers, investigation trainers, and investigation inspectors. From their responses, it was evident that there was an understanding of the necessary skills required to conduct interviews. However, after comparing these responses with the actual interviewing practice of benefit fraud investigators, there was found to be a gap between these beliefs and practice. The findings suggest that although it is agreed what interviewing skills are required to conduct interviews, investigators and managers do not accurately reflect upon whether these skills are actually employed in interviews. This suggests that evaluation of interviews is being neglected and may well explain why research reveals interviewing performance to be often mediocre."

It is proposed that these suicides share similar pathways to other suicides but that the despair involved is not expressed so clearly, often being kept secret. In order to identify such suicides and potential suicides it is helpful to have an indicator of the dominant sub-sets of constituents that are precursors to suicide. A 14-item Suicide Precursors Scale (SPS) was therefore developed. This was applied to 128 cases of suicide that occurred between January 1997 and December 2000 in Stockport (South Manchester, UK). A very high alpha coefficient of 0.98 supported the reliability and homogeneity of the SPS. A Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) analysis of the SPS revealed three prototypical sub-sets of expressions of suicidal actions\u2014illness, life circumstances, and depressive history. These are offered as coherent themes in the life of potential suicides, which may be of assistance both in determining whether an equivocal death is suicide or not, and in alerting caring agencies to the potential for suicide even when the despair is kept secret."

In this research, Bayesian JTC models were being used to predict the home locations of the offenders. The sample group data included 133 assaults, 90 burglaries, 497 larcenies, 81 robberies, and 49 vehicle thefts. The main question this research aimed to answer was whether the addition of crimes of a different type to an existing crime series of a single type would result in more accurate and/or precise Bayesian JTC models. The standard practice by law enforcement has been to consider the same-type crime series only when modelling the anchor point of the offender. Similarly, in research, geographic profi les have been constructed exclusively with the same-type crime series. The results of this study clearly indicated that the inclusion of crimes of a different type into a single crime-type series will result in signifi cantly more accurate and more precise Bayesian JTC models. In contrast, crime series with predominantly assault and burglary showed results that were inconclusive or indicated no signifi cant differences. These results should encourage law enforcement agencies to re-evaluate their standard practice of constructing geo- graphic profi les with only the same-type crime series. Copyright"

One such preoccupation is concerned with whether or not the offender will escalate in the severity of his behaviours with subsequent victims. The current study uses transition matrices to address whether or not the offending patterns of 72 serial stranger sex offenders change from one victim to the next as it pertains to their sexual acts and level of physical force used during the crime. Findings indicate that stability, specifically the offender's intrusive sexual acts and use of physical force, and versatility are present in this sample's offending patterns.

We argue that these people are close to the classical picture of the white-collar criminal, which implies that they are more likely not to be suspected of crimes. They are older, richer, and more powerful than the regular criminals. They also commit crimes assuming the roles of leaders in the crime. Most importantly, it seems as if the combination of heroic status and executive positions induces people to commit large-scale opportunistic crimes late in their lives. The apparent onset of criminal behaviour late in life may be triggered by latent narcissistic traits.

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "The cognitive interview utilises mnemonics and other techniques to facilitate obtaining information from victims and witnesses. Research has indicated superior recall to standard police interviews. However, there has been minimal research regarding the role of individual differences. One area that has generated spirited theoretical debate is imagery ability, as guided imagery questioning is an important part of the enhanced cognitive interview. Imagery is also arguably an integral part of several mnemonics employed in the technique. The present study investigated the role of individual differences in imagery ability, as well as the effect of explicit instructions to image, on recall performance. Participants completed the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ), witnessed a film of a simulated crime, and were interviewed using the cognitive interview or a structured interview. While recall in the cognitive interview was superior, VVIQ scores had little relationship with recall of information. Further, recall elicited by guided imagery differed only minimally from that obtained using standard questioning in the structured interview. These results suggested that the relaxation and rapport building common to questioning in both interview conditions may evoke spontaneous imagery that is comparable to explicit instructions to image, regardless of individuals' inherent imagery ability. Future directions are discussed, including research focused on individual differences and a practical emphasis on context reinstatement and social facilitative techniques.ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR"

        "abstract": "Researchers have identified several threats to the validity of the use of the lineup as a test of true recognition. One concern is related to the structure of the simultaneous lineup. It is argued here that a simultaneous presentation of an array nonetheless requires the viewer to undertake sequential processing of the items in the array. This sequential pattern is unlikely to be random and therefore the position of a culprit in a lineup may have a significant effect on the accuracy of witness selection. A simulated crime (snatching of a handbag) was shown to a convenience sample of 84 undergraduates aged between 18-23 years. In 84 subsequent live lineups, the offender was placed with four foils. He was positioned on the far left (position I ) in 42 cases (50%), and in 14 cases respectively in positions 3 (centre), 4 (centre right) and 5 (extreme right). A very strong association was found between position and correct identification with position 1 placement leading to a significantly lower proportion of correct identification (7.1%) compared to position 3 (50.0%), position 4 (64.3%), and position 5 (21.4%). Steps to remedy possible positional biases are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

        "abstract": "BSTRACT Investigators often take notes during witness interviews, which may be used when reconstructing interviews and writing reports. Little research has evaluated the content of interviewers' notes and how (accurately) they are transferred to reports. Thirteen US police investigators' notes from a witness interview were evaluated and compared with their subsequent reports. Results indicate that although information contained in notes is accurate (98%), a high percentage of interview information (68%) is omitted. Notes focus mainly on witness responses while neglecting interviewer questions/utterances. Although 94% of information contained in notes is accurately transferred to reports, interviewers fail to account for 40% of crime-relevant information in their reports. On average, reports contained a larger percentage of witness information than the notes, but police officers failed to account for how information was originally elicited via their questions/utterances. Subsequent interview reports also contained a higher percentage of peripheral crime details than notes, contributing to a decreased omission rate (28%) from notes to reports. Taken together, results indicate that interviewer notes and reports provide a fairly accurate picture of witness responses. However, they present a skewed picture of the entire interview content by omitting a high percentage of interview content and their own questions/utterances.

Data are presented from a case where the suspect had confessed. A quarter of the children at the daycare centre had given information about other children's exposure. For more than half of the children, there were witness statements that reflected what these particular children might have been exposed to. Context and statement characteristics seemed to make an evaluation of some of these statements possible. Information about interaction between children and about disclosures between children was strikingly scarce which was probably due to the lack of questions from parents and investigators in these areas. Witness statements from children about other children's exposure to abuse stand out as an interesting complementary source of information in investigations of abuse at day-care centres and may also provide a basis for interpretations at a group level.

Yet, research shows that WCCs may display a pattern of criminal thinking that parallels street-level offenders coupled with the same behavioural traits that serve as risk factors for offences to occur. Furthermore, the belief that WCCs are non-violent is misguided, as there is a subgroup of WCCs who are willing to resort to violence, namely homicide, to prevent their fraud schemes from being discovered and revealed.

Logistic regression analysis is applied to examine the degree to which various linking features can be used to discriminate between linked and unlinked burglaries. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is then performed to calibrate the validity of these features and to identify optimal decision thresholds for linking purposes. Contrary to crime scene behaviours traditionally examined to link serial burglaries, the distance between crime site locations demonstrated significantly greater effectiveness as a linking feature for both commercial and residential burglaries. Specifically, shorter dis- tances between crimes signalled an increased likelihood that burglaries were linked. Thus, these results indicate that, if one examines suitable behavioural domains, high levels of stability and distinctiveness exist in the actions of serial burglars, and these actions can be used to accurately link crimes committed by the same offender."

This study was conducted to investigate the infl uence of these factors for recall of a video. Three conditions were used; the same questions were used in each. Participants in condition 1 (self-rate questionnaire condition, n = 20) were given a questionnaire that required them to answer questions and rate confi dence on a scale. Pairs of participants in condition 2 (self-rate interview condition, n = 40) were given the role of eyewitness or interviewer. Eyewitnesses were asked questions by an interviewer and responded orally with answers and confi dence judgements on a Likert scale. Participants in condition three (interviewer-rate interview condition, n = 40) were tested in the same way as condition two but provided confi dence judgements in their own words. Interviewers independently rated each confi dence judgement on the Likert scale. The experiment showed high C-A relationships, particularly for \u2018absolutely sure\u2019 responses. The main effect of the social interview condition was to increase confi dence in correct answers but not in incorrect answers. However, the advantage of this effect was tempered by the fact that, although observers can differentiate between confi dent and less confi dent answers, less extreme confi dence judgements were ascribed."

        "abstract": "A training workshop utilising recent research in cognitive lie detection was designed and evaluated. A unique future of the training was that a practitioner (retired police detective) instead of scientists (e.g. the training developers) introduced the techniques. To evaluate the training, 27 experienced police detectives each interviewed one mock suspect (a truth teller or liar) before training, and another group of 23 experienced police detectives interviewed one mock suspect (a truth teller or liar) after training. The police detectives were free to interview the mock suspect in any way they felt appropriate, but those who had received training were asked to try to incorporate (some of) the taught techniques in their interviews. The detectives made veracity judgements, and the interviews were transcribed and coded for the amount of detail elicited and the questions asked. Training had a modest effect on the ability to distinguish between truths and lies but resulted in a higher percentage of appropriate questions asked. Trainees did not implement the taught techniques to an equal extent, but when they did, the techniques enhanced the elicitation of information. The training study also revealed challenges, particularly difficulty in implementing the taught techniques into practice and asking the right questions to elicit differences in detail between truth tellers and liars.

In this paper, we report on an exploratory study on the use of coercion by the police and the use of the right to silence by suspects in 70 Dutch homicide cases and their relation to prior consultation and presence of a lawyer. Analysis of the data indicates that there is a relation between the presence of a lawyer in the interrogation room and the way in which police interrogators use coercion. To gain insight into whether the police use coercion and how this is achieved, we looked at the extent to which the interrogators make use of certain interrogation techniques and how the interrogation techniques are used to exert coercion.We found that legal advice froma lawyer before and during the interrogation corresponds with suspects more often using their right to silence. It also appears that the police are inclined to use \u2018hard coercion\u2019 when confronted with a silent suspect. The research thus raises the question as to whether the presence of a lawyer is an adequate way to prevent false confessions."

        "abstract": "Mathematical models and computational simulations have proved valuable in many areas of cell biology, including gene regulatory networks. When properly calibrated against experimental data, kinetic models can be used to describe how the concentrations of key species evolve over time. A reliable model allows 'what if' scenarios to be investigated quantitatively in silico, and also provides a means to compare competing hypotheses about the underlying biological mechanisms at work. Moreover, models at different scales of resolution can be merged into a bigger picture 'systems' level description. In the case where gene regulation is post-transcriptionally affected by microRNAs, biological understanding and experimental techniques have only recently matured to the extent that we can postulate and test kinetic models. In this chapter, we summarize some recent work that takes the first steps towards realistic modelling, focusing on the contributions of the authors. Using a deterministic ordinary differential equation framework, we derive models from first principles and test them for consistency with recent experimental data, including microarray and mass spectrometry measurements. We first consider typical mis-expression experiments, where the microRNA level is instantaneously boosted or depleted and thereafter remains at a fixed level. We then move on to a more general setting where the microRNA is simply treated as another species in the reaction network, with microRNA-mRNA binding forming the basis for the post-transcriptional repression. We include some speculative comments about the potential for kinetic modelling to contribute to the more widespread sequence and network based approaches in the qualitative investigation of microRNA based gene regulation. We also consider what new combinations of experimental data will be needed in order to make sense of the increased systems-level complexity introduced by microRNAs"

What characterises offenders who continue to escape arrest despite their continued involvement in crime? To be able to answer these questions, arrested (identified) offenders must be compared with never arrested (unidentified) offenders. In this paper, data from the Dutch DNA database are used to assess which characteristics of the criminal behaviour of unidentified offenders influence the probability that they will subsequently be arrested. DNA data offer a unique opportunity to compare crime series of identified offenders with crime series of yet unidentified offenders. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, we tested whether the number of crimes committed, offence specialization, and offence seriousness affect the probability of arrest of serial offenders. Results showed that as an offender commits more crimes, the probability that he will be arrested increases and that offence specialization decreases the probability of arrest. Another conclusion drawn is that DNA traces offer unique opportunities for criminological research. We discuss the limitations of this new data source and make suggestions for future research using DNA traces and for future research that might improve the current study.

The consensus between British and Norwegian detectives was very high, and the findings indicate that experienced detectives are aware of many of the risk factors and obstacles to optimal decision making that exist in criminal investigations.

Conceptual analysis revealed a number of similarities between the two constructs. This finding suggests the possible benefits of using the theoretical therapeutic construct and operationalisation of the working alliance in order to gain insight into the dynamics of investigative interviewing in a police context. The present study examines the perceptions of witnesses and suspects regarding the working alliance in actual interviews. It also considers their perceptions of interviewing style, which is another key element in investigative interviewing. In addition, the study investigates the relationship between the working alliance and the interview style. Self report questionnaires completed by investigators and interviewees showed significant differences between investigators and suspects and between witnesses and suspects with regard to perceptions of interview style and the working alliance during interviews. The results showed perceived interview style to be a predictor of the working alliance."

        "abstract": " Abstract Investigators often have to deal with small groups of suspects, and this is true both for criminal cases and for suspected terrorist cases. There is, however, very little research examining the effectiveness of different interview techniques when facing cells of suspects. In order to remedy this shortcoming, we examined the extent to which three interviewing techniques elicited cues to deception from small groups of suspects. In one technique, the evidence was disclosed early in the interview (early evidence); in another, the evidence was disclosed late using the Strategic use of evidence technique (SUE\u2010basic); and in the third technique, the evidence was disclosed late and with an increased strength and precision (SUE\u2010incremental). We used a mock\u2010theft scenario with 126 participants randomly allocated to one of six conditions: guilty or innocent suspects interrogated with one of the three disclosure tactics. The SUE\u2010incremental proved to be the most effective technique, resulting in significant differences between guilty and innocent suspects for all three cues examined: statement\u2010evidence inconsistency, within\u2010statement inconsistency, and within\u2010group inconsistency. Based on the findings, we argue that the SUE technique is effective also for eliciting cues to deception when used for small groups of suspects. Copyright \u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Using a sample of 58 healthcare serial killers located within North America, South America, and Europe between the years of 1970 and 2010, this study examines notable pre-offense and post-offense behaviours of healthcare serial killers. Patterns related to offender aetiology, victim cultivation, crime scene behaviour, and techniques of evasion were explored. The findings from this study suggest that the pre-offense and post-offense behaviours of healthcare serial killers can be conceptualised from the theoretical framework of confidence men or 'con men'. The findings from this study also suggest that healthcare serial killings and offenders who perpetrate them continue to be elusive and warrant additional scholarly attention to reduce their likelihood of engaging in homicide undetected for extended time.

        "abstract": "Drawing upon anthropological, legal and forensic publications, an interview with a South African Zulu traditional healer and direct information gained during homicide investigations, the nature of Muti murder is discussed. Muti murder is defined as a murder in which body parts are removed from a live victim for the sole purpose of using the victim's body parts medicinally. These body parts are then often mixed with other ingredients or used alone to make a medicine called muti. Muti is a Zulu (umuthi) word meaning medicine. The victim usually dies as a result of blood loss from the wounds. While muti murders have occurred throughout history in South African culture, little is known about them and little research exists on the phenomenon. The term muti murder has been used interchangeably with the term ritual or sacrificial murder, often adding to confusion in terminology and definitions regarding these types of cases. This paper provides an overview of muti murder, explains the context in which these types of murder occur, defines the offenders and victims involved, and provides guidelines for investigating these types of murders. Two cases where muti murder was suspected are discussed. Copyright \u00a9 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Crime scene behaviours representative of hostility, involvement, control, and offender penetration in rape were examined for 496 UK, police-recorded cases of stranger rape. Cases were grouped according to victim gender (male or female) and number of perpetrators (lone or multiple). This resulted in four groups (lone female, lone male, multiple female, and multiple male) with 124 cases in each. Binary logistic regression and one-way analysis of variance were used to investigate the relationships between the two predictor variables and 11 criterion variables. Significant direct effects of number of perpetrators were found whereby multiple perpetrator offences were more likely to involve violence and less likely to involve involvement interactions than lone perpetrator offences. Significant direct effects of victim gender were also found whereby male victims were more likely than female victims to experience hostile interactions and be threatened with a weapon and were less likely to experience offender penetration and involvement interactions. Significant crossover interactions were also found for four hostility variables. The utility of the findings are discussed in relation to crime prevention, victim support, and offender intervention.

This study was to evaluate the impact of PEACE interview training, workplace supervision and the presence of a legal advisor on the performance of police officers\u2019 interviewing suspects. One hundred seventy-four real-life interviews with suspects were obtained from six police forces in England and Wales. Officers trained and untrained in PEACE, and from police forces that did or did not have an interview supervision policy conducted the interviews. Interviews in this sample were generally of average standard. Whilst PEACE-trained officers conducted longer interviews, there were no other statistical differences dependent on training. Nor were there any statistical differences dependent on the presence of a legal advisor. A workplace supervision policy was found to be related to performance, particularly during the engage and explain phases of the interview. Supervision also appeared to provide some safeguards for suspects who did not have a legal advisor. Because the performance of PEACE-trained officers did not differ from those who had not received this training, further improvement in training is needed, especially regarding a number of communication skills. It is argued that such improvement would be facilitated by a more consistent approach to interviewer training and to the effective supervision of interviews."

The current first study replicated these findings in a mixed sample of police officers, district attorneys, and judges. In Study 2, this blindness to alternative scenarios did not emerge in a sample of university students. However, the estimation of the incriminating power of the evidence and the willingness to convict the primary suspect were predicted with the participants' confirmation proneness.

Both 11- to 13-year-olds (n = 160) and adults (n = 148) heard an unfamiliar voice for 40 s. The perpetrator either spoke in a normal tone at encoding and in the lineup (congruent), or in an angry tone at encoding and a normal tone in the lineup (incongruent). Witnesses were then interviewed about the voice with global questions or by rating voice characteristics. Half of the witnesses were presented with a lineup shortly after the interview (immediate) and the others after 2 weeks (delayed). Children tested immediately made significantly more correct identifications. This was not the case for adults. (In)congruency between tone of voice and interview type did not significantly affect voice recognition. Witnesses in the congruent\u2013immediate condition performed the best. However, only 25% of the children and 19% of the adults made correct identifications. Poor identification accuracy and the fact that the majority of witnesses believed they would recognise the voice later are reasons for treating voice identification evidence with great caution.

Five police officers were trained to use each of the three interview techniques, namely tactical, strategic and early. Post-training, each interviewed 30 mock suspects (five truth tellers and five liars in each interview condition) who had taken part in an immersive interactive computer game, competing as either a terrorist (deceiver) or a builder (truth tellers). Post-interview, officers completed a questionnaire designed to collect veracity judgments, confidence levels and the type of interviewee behaviour that had influenced their veracity decision. Results revealed a significant advantage for detecting both deceivers and truth tellers using our new tactical procedure (67% and 74% accuracy, respectively) versus the strategic (54% and 42%) and early (53% and 47%) interviews. Additionally, when interviewing tactically, not only were interviewers more confident in their judgments but they also reported using verbal behaviour more to inform their judgments. We introduce the new tactical approach to interviewing and discuss our findings, suggesting why tactical interviewing is effective for detecting verbal deception.

This article reports on a qualitative analysis of mock jurors\u2019 deliberations about expert linkage analysis evi- dence. Three groups of mock jurors (N = 20) were presented with the prosecution\u2019s linkage analysis evidence from the USA State v. Fortin I murder trial and expert evidence for the defence constructed for the purposes of the study. Each group was asked to deliberate and reach a verdict. Deliberations were video-recorded and subject to thematic content anal- ysis. The themes that emerged were varied. Analysis suggested that the mock jurors were cautious of the expert evidence of behavioural similarity. In some cases they were scepti- cal of the expert. They articulated a preference that expert opinion be supported using statistics. Additional themes included jurors having misconceptions concerning what is typical offender behaviour during rape which suggests there is a need for expert linkage analysis evidence regarding behavioural similarities and the relative frequencies of crime scene behaviours."

The second aim was to identify the risk factors involved in hostage incidents and examine the degree of concordance between the risk as assessed by the police officers and the figures obtained from the analysis of actual hostage barricade incidents. For the purpose of this study, a survey was carried out across Japan, and 45 police officers responsible for hostage negotiation responded to the questionnaires. Additionally, a sample of 116 actual hostage barricade incidents that occurred in Japan from 1970 to 2002 was utilised to examine the high risk factors involved in such cases. As per the results, a majority of the police offi- cers (73.3%), in response to an open-ended question, indicated that the highly excited state of the hostage takers was dangerous for the hostages. Moreover, it was demonstrated in all 116 incidents that several factors such as \u2018a long siege\u2019 tended to increase the risk of deaths, though this was very rare (n = 4). On the other hand, the proportion of injuries to the hostages was high in expressive situations such as domestic situations or suicide attempt scenarios. On the whole, the results obtained from the analyses of actual incidents were consistent with those obtained from the police officers\u2019 risk assessment in many respects. However, the correlation between the degree of risk as assessed by the police officers and the actual rate of deaths/injuries to the hostages was very low. Copyright"

Investigators\u2019 need for cognitive closure (NFC) moderated the effect of the hypothesis on perceptions of the strength of the evidence against the prime suspect; high (v low) NFC investigators were less likely to acknowledge inconsistencies in the material when pre- sented with a potential motive, but were more likely to do so when made aware of the pos- sibility of an alternative perpetrator. Interpretations are somewhat clouded by the fact that dispositional NFC did not seem to affect in a consistent manner participants\u2019 motivation toward the experimental task."

        "abstract": "There has been much debate about the use of certain public order policing tactics in Britain in response to the disorder seen in recent years. This paper explored the use of an indiscriminate public order tactic that has received comparatively less attention, that of crowd dispersal techniques. More specifically, the use of police charges (either by mounted police or on foot) and subsequent collective flight was investigated. An interview study was conducted with 20 participants who experienced such charges at protests in English cities. Thematic analysis of the data found that although participants reported fear and initial crowd scattering, these instinctive responses were quickly replaced by more socialised reactions, such as co-operation with others and an increased sense of collective unity. Furthermore, participants reported greater determination to resist what were considered as illegitimate attacks by the police. This increased collective unity was explained in terms of a shared sense of experience that was similar to that found in previous crowd behaviour research. It was concluded that rather than fragmenting crowds, the tactic of crowd dispersal can unite previously heterogeneous groups to resist further police charges and so may be counter-productive as a public order policing strategy. \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Third, we assessed if the presentation mode (audio versus video with audio) impacted deception detection accuracy. A sample of college students (n=282) evaluated eight previously recorded statements for veracity. True and false statements were elicited through a cheating paradigm (i.e. RTs) or a mock transgression paradigm. Participants either viewed and listened to these statements or only listened to an audio recording. Results of an analysis of variance indicated that working in dyads did not improve deception detection accuracy. Participants were significantly more accurate in detecting deception in situations where the speaker believes a RT has occurred. The highest accuracy rates were achieved in the real transgression audio condition. Implications of these results for the practice of detecting deceit are discussed. \u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

        "abstract": "Personality psychologists have suggested that the context of a behaviour should be con- sidered in studying behavioural consistency. They have operationalised this as studying \u2018if (situation)\u2013then (behaviour)\u2019 contingencies and have demonstrated an association between situational similarity and behavioural consistency. Previous research of behav- ioural consistency in the forensic setting has tended to focus exclusively on the \u2018then (behaviour)\u2019 part of the contingency\u2014the offender\u2019s behaviour. This paper considers methodological approaches that might be used to investigate whether situational similar- ity is associated with behavioural consistency, and to develop if\u2013then contingencies. Seventy-eight offences by stranger sex offenders were subjected to constant comparison framework analysis to develop an offender behaviour checklist and a victim behaviour checklist, and a combination of constant comparison framework analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to develop victim behavioural themes. Consistency in offender behaviour and similarity in victim behavioural themes (representing situational similarity) were measured using Jaccard\u2019s coeffi cient for offence pairs within 13 solved series of stranger sexual assaults. Correlational analyses were used to assess the relationship between situational similarity and behavioural consistency. Contrary to expectations, no relationship was found. The utility of linguistic computational programs in creating if(victim behaviour)\u2013then(offender behaviour) contingencies was tested with encouraging results. However, little evidence of consistency in if(victim behaviour)\u2013then(offender behaviour) contingencies was found within the offence series. Explanations are proposed for these novel fi ndings and avenues for future research are suggested."

However, research shows that interviewers have difficulty adhering to this recommendation. This paper aims to provide police officers who interview sex offender suspects with suggestions that may assist them in the application of a narrative framework. Our approach involved individual in\u2010depth interviews with experts (N = 16: police trainers, detectives, expert witnesses, defence barristers, and prosecutors) who were leaders in their relative fields, particularly in relation to interviews with sex offender suspects. Specifically, the experts were asked to talk about the process of interviewing and what constitutes a good interview with a sex offender suspect. Several strategies that may assist officers in adhering to a narrative framework were extracted through qualitative analysis of the data. These strategies are described under the following headings: letting the suspects answer the allegations put to them, transferring the locus of control to the suspect, adopting strategies to overcome emotional barriers to reporting, and focusing on the relationship between the suspect and the victim. Directions for future research and training intervention are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)"

        "abstract": "This study of Japanese female serial arsonists examined their crimes and background characteristics. The data were a sample from the national police register containing arson cases resulting in charges in Japan between 1982 and 2005. Serial arsonists were 6% of the arson offenders and 12% of these were female, resulting in 83 female serial arsonist data sets. The mean age was 37.6 years and 43% were unemployed. Nearly half were married. Only 28% had a documented history of mental problems and 22% had a prior arrest, usually for theft (19%). Female serial arsonists are characterised by going to a place near their home with a lighter and setting fire directly to combustible materials. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to analyse 33 variables related to the offences. The arsons could be differentiated in terms of either expressive or instrumental sources of action. Expressive arsons were opportunistic and impulsive acts, motivated by emotional distress. The fires were mostly set close to home. Expressive arsons were characteristic of 66% of the females. Instrumental arsons were often motivated by revenge and involved planned and goal-directed behaviours. They were committed by 13% of the females. Instrumental arsonists tended to travel further from home. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

        "abstract": "We explored (1) distances between home and offence in homicides and rapes; (2) whether these distances differed from each other; and (3) whether offence features were associ- ated with distances. The sample consisted of solved homicides (N = 40) and rapes (N = 37) from Finland with co-ordinates for offence and offender home locations and infor- mation on crime features. Empirical models of incident density as a function of distance were estimated using CrimeStat III (Levine, 2004). Most of the distances were short dis- playing distance decay. Homicide median distance was 0.85km (Inter Quartile Range (IQR) = 0.13\u20137.69km) and rape median distance 2.44km (IQR = 0.83\u20136.96km) from per- petrators\u2019home location. These distances differed significantly (Mann-Whitney U = 543.0, p < 0.045). It was possible to identify crime features that were correlated with distances in both offence types. Spatial Behaviour Indices combining crime feature information cor- related rs = 0.77 with distance in homicides and rs = 0.72 in rapes. Identifying theoretical constructs for understanding links between different crime features instead of looking at them in isolation is important."

For both adults and children, the FM and CR procedures enhanced performance on both open-ended and closed questions to levels above those achieved by controls, although those in the CR condition produced significantly more correct responses than those in the FM condition. However, only those in the CR group displayed elevated levels of confidence in relation to incorrect responses on closed questions. Implications for the possible use of such procedures are discussed."

Target selection, acquisition, and disposal behaviours, as well as geographical and temporal behaviours, were examined. The effects of temporal proximity and offender expertise were also investigated as moderating factors of behavioural consistency. As in previous case linkage research, geographical and some target selection behaviours were able to predict whether crime pairs are linked or unlinked at a statistically significant level. Crucially, it was also found that temporal behaviours demonstrate a significant capability to predict linkage status, a variable which has never before been applied to the prediction of linkage in serial car theft. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that changing the operationalisation of the behavioural domains can affect the results obtained. No support was found for the moderation of behavioural consistency on the basis of temporal proximity or expertise. Overall, the results support previous case linkage studies, furthering their practical applicability within the criminal justice system."

To examine these issues, the present study compared the level of linking accuracy achieved by using the simple matching index (S) to that of the commonly used Jaccard\u2019s coefficient (J) across themes of arson behaviour. The data consisted of 42 crime scene behaviours, separated into three behavioural themes, which were exhibited by 37 offenders across 114 solved arsons. The results of logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis indicate that, with the exception of one theme where S was more effective than J at discriminating between linked and unlinked crimes, no significant differences emerged between the two similarity measures. In addition, our results suggest that thematically unrelated behaviours can be used to link crimes with the same degree of accuracy as thematically related behaviours, potentially calling into the question the importance of theme-based approaches to behavioural linkage analysis.

        "abstract": "Most metropolitan areas are located over large-scale sedimentary basins. Since the sediments filling basins amplify ground motions and their velocity structures complicate the propagation of seismic waves, it is important for the prediction of strong ground motion and seismic hazard to determine the three-dimensional (3-D) velocity structures of these urban basins. This importance motivated various organizations to carry out extensive geophysical experiments and geological investigations, and velocity structure models are being constructed all over Japan. However, a study of a single dataset cannot completely define a 3-D velocity structure, so that we propose a standard procedure for modeling the 3-D velocity structure of an urban basin in Japan, by simultaneously and sequentially using various kinds of datasets such as those from refraction/reflection experiments, gravity surveys, surface geology, borehole logging, microtremor surveys, and earthquake records. We then apply the procedure to the Tokyo metropolitan area (TMA) over the Kanto basin with an area of about 17,000\u00a0km2 and the maximum thickness of about 4\u00a0km. As one of the steps in the procedure, a joint inversion of refraction and gravity data has been formulated to determine the 3-D topography of interfaces of the sedimentary layers as well and lateral distribution of the basement slowness. We validate the constructed velocity structure model by comparison of observed and synthetic waveforms, since this modeling is carried out mainly for strong ground motion prediction. The proposed procedure including the joint inversion and validation with ground motion simulations works well for TMA, and the applicability of the standard procedure has been confirmed for regions with substantial data of experiments and earthquake records in Japan."

Some significant patterns relating what is known about the offence at different stages of an investigation and inferences regarding the offender were found, indicating that certain offence information can lead to some reliable predictions and these can be refined as more information becomes available.

Expression of human OCT1 (SLC22A1) and OCT2 (SLC22A2) is highly restricted to the liver and kidney, respectively. By contrast, OCT3 (SLC22A3) is more widely distributed. MATEs (SLC47A1, SLC47A2) are predominantly expressed in human kidney. Data on in vitro studies reporting a large number of substrates and inhibitors of OCTs and MATEs are systematically summarized. Several genetic variants of human OCTs and in part of MATE1 have been reported, and some of them result in reduced in vitro transport activity corroborating data from studies with knockout mice. A comprehensive overview is given on currently known genotype-phenotype correlations for variants in OCTs and MATE1 related to protein expression, pharmacokinetics/-dynamics of transporter substrates, treatment outcome, and disease susceptibility."

        "abstract": "Rapid information on metabolic profiling is required to evaluate the structural liabilities of drug candidates in early drug discovery. In this study, a sensitive and rapid semi-quantitative method was developed to simultaneously monitor the drug candidate and metabolites as well as collect tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra for subsequent metabolite identification. The simultaneous semi-quantitation and identification of metabolites in fresh hepatocytes is achieved using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap. The survey experiment consists of monitoring multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions for the internal standard, the parent, and 48 MRM transitions designed to cover the most common phase I and II biotransformations. An information-dependent acquisition (IDA) method was employed to trigger product ion scans above the MRM signal threshold. Three biotransformations of a lead compound have been identified through enhanced product ion scans and the respective MRM transitions of those metabolites were selected for semi-quantitation. Parent disappearance and formation of the metabolites as a function of incubation time in five different species were monitored by their respective MRM responses. The method provides the necessary sensitivity to detect minor metabolites in a relevant therapeutic concentration range. Enzymatic turnover of the parent and the metabolites in different species are revealed based on the different initial concentrations of the parent. This methodology integrates the parent disappearance, metabolite identification, and the formation of the metabolites along the time course using a single rapid LC/MS/MS analysis. This method can be used as a complementary tool to the conventional method of metabolic profiling. It provides a rapid and sensitive initial profile of the metabolism of potential structural series at the lead selection stage. The method can also be incorporated into the overall metabolite profiling scheme to evaluate the drug candidates in drug discovery."

Electronic cigarettes, also called \u201ce-cigarettes,\u201d are battery-operated devices that generally contain cartridges filled with nicotine, flavor and other chemicals. The electronic cigarette turns nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. These products are marketed and sold to young people and are readily available online and in shopping malls. They are also available in different flavors, such as chocolate and mint, which may appeal to young people. The FDA\u2019s Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of electronic cigarettes. In one sample, the FDA\u2019s analyses detected diethylene glycol, a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans, and in several other samples, the FDA analyses detected carcinogens, including nitrosamines. These products do not contain any health warnings comparable to FDA-approved nicotine replacement products or conventional cigarettes. Because these products have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, at this time the agency has no way of knowing, except for the limited testing it has performed, the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. Health care professionals and consumers may report serious adverse events (side effects) or product quality problems with the use of e-cigarettes to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program either online, by regular mail, fax or phone."

Aliquots of brain homogenate with cysts were cultured in vitro with confluent Vero cells and the number of cysts and tachyzoites counted after 1week. Brain cysts but not tachyzoites were detected at week 2 post infection and reached a plateau by week 4. In vitro Vero cells culture showed similar pattern for cysts and tachyzoites and reactivation of cyst in vitro was not influenced by the age of the brain cysts."

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present investigation was aimed at optimizing of estradiol (E2) loaded l-amino acid derivatives organogel formulations resulting in improved the high initial release problems and sustained release of E2. METHODS: The visco-elastic properties of blank organogels were measured by rheometer. The E2 organogel formulations were optimized using a central composite design. Also, the effect of gelator structure and composition of the gel formulations on release behavior (in vitro and in vivo) had been studied. RESULTS: The change of the gelator structure could affect significantly the stiffness of the implants. The release behavior of gel without N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) was controlled by gel corrosion only. While the drug release of the gel with NMP was controlled by both corrosion and diffusion. The high initial release problems of the organogels were improved by optimizing the formulations. The system consisting by N-Lauroyl L-lysine methyl ester (LLM) derivative in the oil indicated the lowest initial drug release, showed a much lower blood drug level and maintained a steady state for nearly 1 month. CONCLUSION: Organogels based on L-lysine methyl ester derivative were ideal carriers for long-term parenteral administration of E2."

The role of functional genomics in modern drug discovery is to prioritize these targets and to translate that knowledge into rational and reliable drug discovery. Here, we describe the field of functional genomics and review approaches that have been applied to drug discovery, including RNA profiling, proteomics, antisense and RNA interference, model organisms and high-throughput, genome-wide overexpression or knockdowns, and outline the future directions that are likely to yield new drug targets from genomics."

        "abstract": "Drug profiling, or the ability to link batches of illicit drugs to a common source or synthetic route, has long been a goal of law enforcement agencies. Research in the past decade has explored drug profiling with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). This type of research can be limited by the use of substances seized by police, of which the provenance is unknown. Fortunately, however, some studies in recent years have been carried out on drugs synthesized in-house and therefore of known history. In this study, 18 MDMA samples were synthesized in-house from aliquots of the same precursor by three common reductive amination routes and analyzed for 13C, 15N, and 2H isotope abundance using IRMS. For these three preparative methods, results indicate that 2H isotope abundance data is necessary for discrimination by synthetic route. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analysis using 2H data on its own or combined with 13C and/or 15N provides a statistical means for accurate discrimination by synthetic route."

However, from a cardiologist perspective, some available data were not highlighted in the review, cardiovascular involvement in gastroesophageal reflux is less assessed. Hypertension, obesity or diabetes mellitus are substrate for left atrial remodeling that initiate and sustained atrial fibrillation development. One of the pathophysiologic mechanisms in atrial fibrillation is the presence of a trigger. Gastroesophageal reflux could be only a trigger for this arrhythmia. We believe that atrial fibrillation should be considered as possible extraesophageal syndrome in the gastroesophageal reflux classification."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Introduction: Computerised drug interaction surveillance systems (CIS) may be helpful in detecting clinically significant drug interactions. Experience with CIS reveals that they often yield alerts with questionable clinical significance, fail to provide relevant information on risk factors for the adverse reaction of the interaction and fail to detect all significant drug interactions. These problems highlight the importance of transparency and selectivity in choosing the drug interactions to be included in CIS. In The Netherlands, the Working Group on Pharmacotherapy and Drug Information is responsible for maintenance of the CIS of the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy (KNMP). Methods: The Working Group developed an evidence-based procedure for structured assessment of drug-drug interactions and revised all drug interactions in the CIS accordingly. Results: For every drug interaction four core parameters were assessed: (i) evidence on the interaction; (ii) clinical relevance of the potential adverse reaction resulting from the interaction; (iii) risk factors identifying patient, medication or disease characteristics for which the interaction is of special importance; and (iv) the incidence of the adverse reaction. On the basis of this assessment the drug-drug interactions for inclusion in the CIS were selected. After revision of the drug combinations in the KNMP-CIS, the Working Group judged 22% of the combinations to be not interacting and another 12% to be interacting but not requiring action. On the basis of this assessment the subset of drug combinations for which interaction alerts are generated and the information on management of a drug interaction alert for users of the CIS were adapted. When an alert is generated by the CIS, the user of the system is supplied with comprehensive information on the four core parameters, the mechanism of the interaction and critical information for management of the interaction for the individual patient. Discussion: This structured procedure offers the possibility for transparent and reproducible assessment of the clinical relevance of drug interactions. Conclusion: A CIS selectively generating interaction alerts based on this assessment may help in realising the goal of good clinical practice and may offer a methodology to further increase drug safety. 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

        "abstract": "Whooping cough (pertussis) caused by B. pertussis (B.p) is still serious public health threat. B. parapertussis (B.pp), closely related to B.p, also causes whooping cough. The incidence of B.pp infections has been increasing over the last decades, partly because pertussis vaccines have low efficiency against B.pp infections. Moreover, because the majority of pertussis patients are infants, common antimicrobial agents producing serious adverse reactions in infants are not fully satisfactory. Therefore, we try to identify potential vaccine candidates and alternative drug targets against both B.p and B.pp. This preliminary work integrates several different kinds of data from in silico analysis, comparative genomic hybridization, global transcriptional profiling, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to screen potential vaccine candidates and drug targets against the two species. Finally, 191 potential crossprotective vaccine candidates are identified. They have high transcriptional levels in both species, or are associated with virulence and pathogenesis. Moreover, these proteins are not only potentially surface-exposed in the bacteria, but also well conserved among the 165 B.p and B.pp strains. Among them, 22 candidates with high essentiality in the two PPI networks of B.p and B.pp are regarded as suitable drug targets against the two species. We just selected Bordetella as an example to develop a rapid and reliable approach for screening alternative drug targets that associated with novel protein pathways, complexes, and cellular functions against these antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Further researches focusing on the 191 vaccine candidates could accelerate the development of more effective vaccines and drug therapy against B.p and B.pp infection."

        "abstract": "The S100A8 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) proteins are proto-oncogenes that are strongly expressed in a number of cancer types. EGFR promotes cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival by activating molecular pathways. Involvement of proinflammatory S100A8 in tumor cell differentiation and progression is largely unclear and not studied in kidney cancer (KC). S100A8 and EGFR are potential therapeutic biomarkers and anticancer drug targets for KC. In this study, we explored molecular mechanisms of interaction profiles of both molecules with potential anticancer drugs. We undertook transcriptional profiling in Saudi KCs using Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 ST arrays. We identified 1478 significantly expressed genes, including S100A8 and EGFR overexpression, using cut-off p value <0.05 and fold change \u22652. Additionally, we compared and confirmed our findings with expression data available at NCBI's GEO database. A significant number of genes associated with cancer showed involvement in cell cycle progression, DNA repair, tumor morphology, tissue development, and cell survival. Atherosclerosis signaling, leukocyte extravasation signaling, notch signaling, and IL-12 signaling were the most significantly disrupted signaling pathways. The present study provides an initial transcriptional profiling of Saudi KC patients. Our analysis suggests distinct transcriptomic signatures and pathways underlying molecular mechanisms of KC progression. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the kinase inhibitor \"midostaurin\" has amongst the selected drug targets, the best ligand properties to S100A8 and EGFR, with the implication that its binding inhibits downstream signaling in KC. This is the first structure-based docking study for the selected protein targets and anticancer drug, and the results indicate S100A8 and EGFR as attractive anticancer targets and midostaurin with effective drug properties for therapeutic intervention in KC."

        "abstract": "Patients are usually exposed to multiple drugs, and metabolite profiling of each drug in complex biological matrices is a big challenge. This study presented a new application of an improved high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based data-mining tools in tandem to fast and comprehensive metabolite identification of combination drugs in human. The model drug combination was metronidazole-pantoprazole-clarithromycin (MET-PAN-CLAR), which is widely used in clinic to treat ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori. First, mass defect filter (MDF), as a targeted data processing tool, was able to recover all relevant metabolites of MET-PAN-CLAR in human plasma and urine from the full-scan MS dataset when appropriate MDF templates for each drug were defined. Second, the accurate mass-based background subtraction (BS), as an untargeted data-mining tool, worked effectively except for several trace metabolites, which were buried in the remaining background signals. Third, an integrated strategy, i.e., untargeted BS followed by improved MDF, was effective for metabolite identification of MET-PAN-CLAR. Most metabolites except for trace ones were found in the first step of BS-processed datasets, and the results led to the setup of appropriate metabolite MDF template for the subsequent MDF data processing. Trace metabolites were further recovered by MDF, which used both common MDF templates and the novel metabolite-based MDF templates. As a result, a total of 44 metabolites or related components were found for MET-PAN-CLAR in human plasma and urine using the integrated strategy. New metabolic pathways such as N-glucuronidation of PAN and dehydrogenation of CLAR were found. This study demonstrated that the combination of accurate mass-based multiple data-mining techniques in tandem, i.e., untargeted background subtraction followed by targeted mass defect filtering, can be a valuable tool for rapid metabolite profiling of combination drugs in vivo."

WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: This review offers readers a detailed overview on microarray analyses, taking into account their advantages and limitations. Our work can help readers, from many research areas, to design a suitable microarray experiment. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: So far, drugs acting on the pathways identified by microarray analysis have not been found to be effective in prion diseases therapy. An integration of gene expression profiling, proteomics and physiology should be applied to pursue this aim."

Samples of heroin and cannabis are extracted and analyzed with GC \u00d7 GC-TOF-MS (time-of-flight mass spectrometry) and GC \u00d7 GC-FID (flame ionization detection). The obtained second-order data are then used to identify possible marker compounds for the discrimination of the samples according to their chemical profile. The pixel-based chemometric process includes preprocessing steps (background correction, alignment of chromatograms and normalization) followed by an adaptation of hierarchical clustering to identify chemically similar samples, and finally a subsequent calculation of Fisher criterion based on the found clustering in order to identify promising marker compounds. The results of the pixel-based data analysis are compared to a limited peak-based study for cannabis and to a well-established standard method for the chemical profiling of heroin. \u00a9 2008."

        "abstract": "Different fusion oncogenes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have distinct clinical and laboratory features suggesting different modes of malignant transformation. Here we compare the in vitro effects of representatives of 4 major groups of AML fusion oncogenes on primary human CD34+ cells. As expected from their clinical similarities, MLL-AF9 and NUP98-HOXA9 had very similar effects in vitro. They both caused erythroid hyperplasia and a clear block in erythroid and myeloid maturation. On the other hand, AML1-ETO and PML-RARA had only modest effects on myeloid and erythroid differentiation. All oncogenes except PML-RARA caused a dramatic increase in long-term proliferation and self-renewal. Gene expression profiling revealed two distinct temporal patterns of gene deregulation. Gene deregulation by MLL-AF9 and NUP98-HOXA9 peaked 3 days after transduction. In contrast, the vast majority of gene deregulation by AML1-ETO and PML-RARA occurred within 6 hours, followed by a dramatic drop in the numbers of deregulated genes. Interestingly, the p53 inhibitor MDM2 was upregulated by AML1-ETO at 6 hours. Nutlin-3, an inhibitor of the interaction between MDM2 and p53, specifically inhibited the proliferation and self-renewal of primary human CD34+ cells transduced with AML1-ETO, suggesting that MDM2 upregulation plays a role in cell transformation by AML1-ETO. These data show that differences among AML fusion oncogenes can be recapitulated in vitro using primary human CD34+ cells and that early gene expression profiling in these cells can reveal potential drug targets in AML."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Fentanyl, sufentanil, and morphine are commonly used in the conduct of anesthesia. Medical staff working with these drugs are at high risk of addiction. To detect and prevent diversion, a method was developed to quantify these drugs in discard syringes using the BioRad REMEDi HS Drug Profiling System. For fentanyl, the lowest concentration detected is 0.1 microg/mL, and the assay is linear to 5.0 microg/mL; the within-run coefficient of variation (CV) is 0.9% (n = 5), and between-run CV is 2.5% (n = 20). For sufentanil, the lowest concentration detected is 0.5 microg/mL, and the assay is linear to 11.0 microg/mL; the within-run CV is 2.0% (n = 5), and the between-run CV is 2.4% (n = 20). For morphine, the lowest concentration detected is 0.5 microg/mL, and the assay is linear to 10.0 microg/mL; the within-run CV is 11.6% (n = 5), and between-run CV is 11.3% (n = 20). Other drugs commonly used in the operating room were checked for cross-reactivity on the REMEDi HS; none cross-reacted. The REMEDi HS can be used for rapid, accurate quantification of fentanyl, sufentanil, and morphine in discard syringes from anesthesia procedures or related medical applications."

        "abstract": "This double special issue of The International Journal of DrugPolicy brings together anumberof contributionsoncon- temporary social theory and its relevance for drug research, drug policy and harm reduction. Two aspects motivated us as Guest Co-Editors. Firstly,we think it important to provide opportunities for the dissemination of new social theory and for critical engagement with existing paradigms in drug re- search, drug policy and harm reduction (e.g., Moore, 1990, 2002a; Rhodes, 1995, 1997, 2002). Therefore, in the original call for papers, we invited contributions on topics that fea- ture rarely in \u2018drug\u2019 journals: social capital; governmentality; poststructuralism; embodiment; consumption; spatiality; cul- tural geography; discourse analysis; risk; and structure and agency. Secondly, we want to contribute to recent debates on the \u2018movement to technique\u2019 in qualitative research. Researchers have been critical of the increasing separation of qualitative methods from their theoretical frameworks in both health (e.g., Barbour, 2001; Caan, 2001; Carmona, 2002; Lambert & McKevitt, 2002; Meyrick, 2001; Popay & Williams, 1998; Power, 2001; Somerville, 2002; Van Teijlingen et al., 2001; Williams, 2001) and drug research."

Such &quot;expression fingerprints&quot; are used in drug discovery for drug target identification and validation and for elucidating the mode of action of novel compounds during lead identification and optimization. Moreover, during drug development, DNA microarrays help in the discovery of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as in the prediction of resistance and toxic side effects.

Early recognition of drug-drug interactions is important, but conflicts do exist among drug compendia on drug interaction information. We aimed to evaluate the consistencies of two drug information resources with regards to the severity rating and categorization of the potential interactions between antiretroviral and co-prescribed drugs.\\n\\nMETHODS: We reviewed the case files of human immunodeficiency virus-infected children who were receiving treatment at the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinic of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi Araba, between January 2005 and December 2010. All of the co-prescribed and antiretroviral drug pairs were screened for potential interactions using the Medscape Drug Interaction Checker and the Monthly Index of Medical Specialties Interaction Checker. Drug-drug interaction (DDI) severity and categorization were rated on a scale of A (no known interaction); B (minor/no action needed); C (moderate/monitor therapy); D (major/therapy modification); and X (contraindicated/avoid combination).\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 280 patients were at risk of 596 potential DDIs. The databases showed discrepancies, with Medscape database identifying 504 (84.6%) and USA MIMS database identifying 302 (50.7%) potential DDIs. Simultaneous identification of DDIs by both databases occurred for only 275 (46.1%) listed interactions. Both databases have a weak correlation on the severity rating (rs = 0.45; P < 0.001). The most common DDIs identified by the databases were nevirapine and artemisinin-based combination therapy (170; 28.5%), nevirapine and fluconazole (58; 9.7%), and zidovudine and fluconazole (55; 9.2%). There were 272 (45.6%) interaction severity agreements between the databases.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Discrepancies occurred in DDI listings between Medscape and USA MIMS databases. Health care professionals may need to consult more than one DDI information database to ensure safe concomitant prescribing for HIV patients."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are an important cause of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Many studies have recently considered this issue, but most of them focus only on potential interactions and are often related to the hospital setting. A spontaneous reporting database could be a valuable resource for detection of ADRs associated with DDIs; however, data in the literature are limited.\\n                To detect those patients treated with potentially interacting drugs and the cases where reported adverse reactions are a possible consequence of DDIs, using an Italian spontaneous reporting database.\\n                The data were obtained from a database containing all reports of suspected ADRs from five Italian regions (January 1990 to December 2007) that are the main contributors to the Italian spontaneous reporting system. All reports containing at least two drugs, reported as being suspected of causing the ADR or as concomitant medication, were selected and a list of drug pairs was drawn up. We performed a search to verify which drug pairs are considered a potential DDI, using the Internet version of the DRUGDEX(R) system. For each report containing a potential DDI, we verified whether the description of the adverse reaction corresponded to the interaction effect.\\n                The database contained 45 315 reports, of which 17 700 (39.1%) had at least two reported drugs. We identified 5345 (30.2%) reports with potential DDIs, and in 1159 (21.7%) of these reports a related ADR was reported. The percentage of reports with potential DDIs increased in relation to the number of concomitantly administered drugs, ranging from 9.8% for two drugs to 88.3% for eight or more drugs. The percentages of serious or fatal reports of ADRs associated with a DDI were significantly higher than other reports analysed. The mean age, percentage of male patients and the mean number of drugs were also significantly higher in reports with DDIs than in other reports. In 235 of 1159 reports (20.3%), both interacting drugs were recognized as suspect by the reporter. This percentage varies in relation to the drugs involved, ranging from 2% to about 65%. The most frequently reported interaction was digoxin and diuretics, but no fatal ADRs were reported with this combination. The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents was responsible for the greatest number of serious reactions and deaths.\\n                This study validates that spontaneous reporting, despite its limitations, can be an important resource for detecting ADRs associated with the concomitant use of interacting drugs. Moreover, our data confirm that DDIs could be a real problem in clinical practice, showing that more than one in five patients exposed to a potential DDI experienced a related ADR."

An evaluation of the capabilities of MS to improve the speed, specificity, sensitivity and cost per compound of method in development indicates when MS technologies have utility compared to other analytical techniques. MS has been used successfully for methods that profile the critical properties: permeability, lipophilicity, plasma and solution stability, solubility, plasma protein binding and integrity. In general, MS has utility in these methods using analytical strategies involving unique MS technologies (e.g., parallel multiplexed interfaces, trap-and-elute), orthogonal detection to UV, high sensitivity for low LOQs, low concentration studies, highly specific MS/MS SRM, combinatorial analysis, use of internal standards, providing initial structural data in addition to quantitative and facile integration with HPLC autosamplers and other hardware that allow enhanced on-line experiments. Ultimately, it is important to evaluate the appropriateness of any technique that is being considered for use in a method, to insure that it best meets all of the criteria for the organization's needs."

To uncover novel aspects in acclimation to Pi starvation, we investigated the correlation between Pi deficiency-induced changes in transcriptome and proteome profiles in Arabidopsis roots. Using exhaustive tandem mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics and whole-genome RNA sequencing to generate a nearly complete catalog of expressed mRNAs and proteins, we reliably identified 13,298 proteins and 24,591 transcripts, subsets of 356 proteins and 3106 mRNAs were differentially expressed during Pi deficiency. Most dramatic changes were noticed for genes involved in Pi acquisition and in processes that either liberate Pi or bypass Pi/ATP-consuming metabolic steps, for example during membrane lipid remodeling and glycolytic carbon flux. The concordance between the abundance of mRNA and its encoded protein was generally high for highly up-regulated genes, but the analysis also revealed numerous discordant changes in mRNA/protein pairs, indicative of divergent regulation of transcription and post-transcriptional processes. In particular, a decreased abundance of proteins upon Pi deficiency was not closely correlated with changes in the corresponding mRNAs. In several cases, up-regulation of gene activity was observed solely at the protein level, adding novel aspects to key processes in the adaptation to Pi deficiency. We conclude that integrated measurement and interpretation of changes in protein and transcript abundance are mandatory for generating a complete inventory of the components that are critical in the response to environmental stimuli."

        "abstract": "Drug-plasma protein binding may greatly influence the bioavailability and metabolism of a plasma-borne drug, the bound form being partially protected from the metabolic fate of the unbound drug. Traditionally, equilibrium values (e.g., percentage binding) for drug-protein binding have been measured to rationalize in vivo phenomena. However, such studies overlook the influence of kinetics. A rapid method of simultaneously determining kinetic rate constants and equilibrium constants from chromatographic profiles has been developed, based on the use of immobilized protein columns and HPLC. By measuring the chromatographic profiles (the position and width) of a retained and an unretained compound one can directly determine both the rate and equilibrium constants. Results are presented for the binding of L-tryptophan to human serum albumin to exemplify the method. The association equilibrium constant (Ka) and the association and dissociation rate constants (k(a) and k(d), respectively) were thereby measured in an aqueous pH 7.4 environment at 37 degrees C as 0.84 10(4) M(-1), 5.8 10(4) M(-1) s(-1), and 6.9 s(-1), respectively. These compare favorably with previously published results. The described method may be used in quantitative structure-property relationship-based rational drug discovery or for the rationalization of drug pharmacokinetics."

Rats were treated with 3 or 6 mg/kg cis-Platin (i.p., single injection) and urine samples were collected before and after drug or saline treatment. Analysis of the low molecular weight proteome (<20 kDa) using capillary-electrophoresis coupled mass spectrometry allowed us to tentatively identify 34 urinary peptides that show significant differences between control and treated animals, and hence may serve as a potential biomarker for cis-Platin-induced nephrotoxicity. These biomarkers were confirmed in a blinded assessment of additional samples. The blinded data also revealed time-dependency of induced changes. Some of the potential biomarkers could be sequenced. This information revealed great similarity between cis-Platin-induced changes and significant changes in the urinary proteome of patients suffering from tubular injury (Fanconi syndrome). Our study strongly suggests that (drug-induced) nephrotoxicity can be detected with high accuracy in laboratory rodents using urinary proteome analysis. The effects observed are very similar to those seen in corresponding human diseases and similar approaches may be very helpful in evaluating drug-induced organ damage in preclinical animal models. This study aiming at the definition of biomarkers for drug-induced cytotoxicity may serve as a proof-of-principle for the use of urinary proteomics in assessment of drug-induced nephrotoxicity."

Reliably establishing whether the liver disease was caused by a drug requires the exclusion of other plausible causes and the search for a clinical drug signature. The drug signature consists of the pattern of liver test abnormality, the duration of latency to symptomatic presentation, the presence or absence of immune-mediated hypersensitivity and the response to drug withdrawal. Determination of causality also includes an evaluation of individual susceptibility to drug-induced liver injury. This susceptibility is governed by both genetic and environmental factors. Components of the drug signature in conjunction with certain risk factors have been incorporated into formal scoring systems that are predictive of the likelihood of drug-induced liver injury. The most validated scoring system is the Roussel-Uclaf causality assessment method, which nonetheless retains certain imperfections. Mitigating the potential for drug-induced liver injury is achieved by the identification of toxicity signals during clinical trials and the monitoring of liver tests in clinical practice. There are three signals of liver toxicity in clinical trials: (i) a statistically significant doubling (or more) in the incidence of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation >3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); (ii) any incidence of serum ALT elevation >8-10 x ULN; and (iii) any incidence of serum ALT elevation >3 x ULN accompanied by a serum bilirubin elevation >2 x ULN. Monitoring of liver tests in clinical practice has shown unconvincing efficacy, but where a benefit-risk analysis would favour continued therapy, monthly monitoring may have some benefit compared with no monitoring at all. With rare exception, treatment of drug-induced liver injury is principally supportive. Drug toxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure, defined as a prolonged prothrombin time (international normalised ratio > or =1.5) and any degree of mental alteration occurring <26 weeks after the onset of illness in a patient without pre-existing cirrhosis. A patient who meets these criteria must be evaluated for liver transplantation. The pathogenesis of drug-induced liver injury can be examined on the basis of the two principal patterns of injury. The hepatocellular pattern is characterised by a predominant rise in the level of transaminases and results from the demise of hepatocytes by means of either apoptosis or necrosis. The cholestatic pattern is characterised by a predominant rise of the serum alkaline phosphatase level and usually results from injury to the bile ductular cells either directly by the drug or its metabolite, or indirectly by an adaptive immune response."

There are three signals of liver toxicity in clinical trials: (i) a statistically significant doubling (or more) in the incidence of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation >3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); (ii) any incidence of serum ALT elevation >8-10 x ULN; and (iii) any incidence of serum ALT elevation >3 x ULN accompanied by a serum bilirubin elevation >2 x ULN. Monitoring of liver tests in clinical practice has shown unconvincing efficacy, but where a benefit-risk analysis would favour continued therapy, monthly monitoring may have some benefit compared with no monitoring at all. With rare exception, treatment of drug-induced liver injury is principally supportive. Drug toxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure, defined as a prolonged prothrombin time (international normalised ratio > or =1.5) and any degree of mental alteration occurring <26 weeks after the onset of illness in a patient without pre-existing cirrhosis. A patient who meets these criteria must be evaluated for liver transplantation. The pathogenesis of drug-induced liver injury can be examined on the basis of the two principal patterns of injury. The hepatocellular pattern is characterised by a predominant rise in the level of transaminases and results from the demise of hepatocytes by means of either apoptosis or necrosis. The cholestatic pattern is characterised by a predominant rise of the serum alkaline phosphatase level and usually results from injury to the bile ductular cells either directly by the drug or its metabolite, or indirectly by an adaptive immune response."

        "abstract": "Given the high risk and lengthy procedure of traditional drug development, drug repurposing is gaining more and more attention. Although many types of drug information have been used to repurpose drugs, drug-drug interaction data, which imply possible physiological effects or targets of drugs, remain unexploited. In this work, similarity of drug interaction was employed to infer similarity of the physiological effects or targets for the drugs. We collected 10\u00a0835 drug-drug interactions concerning 1074 drugs, and for 700 of them, drug similarity scores based on drug interaction profiles were computed and rendered using a drug association network with 589 nodes (drugs) and 2375 edges (drug similarity scores). The 589 drugs were clustered into 98 groups with Markov Clustering Algorithm, most of which were significantly correlated with certain drug functions. This indicates that the network can be used to infer the physiological effects of drugs. Furthermore, we evaluated the ability of this drug association network to predict drug targets. The results show that the method is effective for 317 of 561 drugs that have known targets. Comparison of this method with the structure-based approach shows that they are complementary. In summary, this study demonstrates the feasibility of drug repurposing based on drug-drug interaction data."

        "abstract": "Profiling is a highly evocative term with multiple meanings, used in both specialist and non-specialist contexts. Drawing attention to the innovative feature of profiling as a form of non-representational, probabilistic knowledge, this paper focuses on machine profiling. It aims to elaborate a suitable definition that captures the main features of this new form of generating and applying knowledge.The paper is divided in four parts. Part one explores the distinctive elements of profiling. It discusses some existing concepts and distinctions (such as the meaning of organic, human and machine profiling; non-automated and autonomic profiling; group and individual profiling; direct and indirect profiling) and it provides basic information on Knowledge Discovery in Databases and data mining, as key enablers of profiling. It also presents the most relevant sources of profiling, such as behavioural, biometric and location data.Part two discusses the EU legal framework, including the present discussions on the proposed data protection Regulation and Directive, together with relevant recommendations of the Council of Europe to highlight how profiling is defined and conceptualised in the fields of data protection and antidiscrimination. Part three gives an overview of different domains of application, including the security, law enforcement and counter-terrorism domain, the financial sector, healthcare, employment, marketing, and social media. In the final part, the paper develops a definition of profiling. Building on the work of Mireille Hildebrandt, and taking into account insights from the conceptualisation of profiling in other academic literature, law and policy, and from the application areas, the following definitions are proposed of profiling and related concepts.Profiling is a technique to automatically process personal and non-personal data, aimed at developing predictive knowledge from the data in the form of constructing profiles that can subsequently be applied as a basis for decision-making.A profile is a set of correlated data that represents a (human or non-human, individual or group) subject. Constructing profiles is the process of discovering unexpected patterns between data in large data sets that can be used to create profiles. Applying profiles is the process of identifying and representing a specific subject or to identify a subject as a member of a specific group or category and taking some form of decision based on this identification and representation."

        "abstract": "Drug design is an iterative process requiring cycles of compound synthesis and testing, with each successive synthesis phase yielding molecules predicted to have improved characteristics over the previous set of compounds. In the field of cancer drug discovery, a key early-stage element of the drug design and testing process usually involves the screening of compounds in cell-based in vitro assays. One of the most frequent parameters assessed in cancer drug discovery is the impact of a given molecule on the proliferation of a cancer cell. The methyl-[3H]-thymidine incorporation assay is a widely used, gold standard, method for measuring inhibition of cell proliferation and has been used successfully to screen and optimize potential new cancer drugs. The assay is based on measuring incorporation of methyl-[3H]-thymidine (the radiolabeled form of the DNA precursor thymidine) into the DNA of dividing cancer cells. The screen is used to generate concentration effect relationships for test compounds and for the derivation of IC50 values. IC50 value is defined as the concentration of a test compound required to achieve half maximal inhibition of methyl-[3H]-thymidine incorporation, a parameter that is indicative of antiproliferative potency. IC50 values derived from cell-based assays help drive the medicinal chemistry efforts toward improved drug design, and it is, therefore, critical that the screen provides consistent, robust data over the lifetime of the project - a requirement that necessitates good-quality cell culture practices. The methyl-[3H]-thymidine incorporation assay has been adapted to high-throughput format to facilitate screening of large numbers of compounds. The detailed description of this method, exemplified using the COLO-205 colorectal cancer cell line in a 96-well format, should give the reader a thorough account of how to conduct proliferation assays, as well as some notes and tips on how to ensure success and avoid potential pitfalls."

In common with many pharmaceuticals, most such drugs are subject to metabolism by P450 enzymes and to transmembrane transport. This gives rise to considerable potential for drug-drug interactions, to which must be added consideration of drug-diet interactions. The potential for metabolism-based drug interactions is increasingly being taken into account during drug development, using a variety of in silico and in vitro approaches. Prediction of transporter-based interactions is not as advanced. The clinical importance of a drug interaction will depend upon a number of factors, and it is important to address concerns quantitatively, taking into account the therapeutic index of the compound."

We developed a new analytical framework termed SALVO (synchronization, amplitude, length, and variability of oscillation) to profile the amplitude and temporal patterning of intra- and intercellular calcium signals in hSCCM. SALVO quantified drug-induced perturbations in the calcium signaling \"fingerprint\" in spontaneously contractile hSCCM. Multiparametric SALVO outputs were integrated into a single index of in vitro cytotoxicity that confirmed the rank order of perturbation as astemizole > thioridazine > cisapride > flecainide > valdecoxib > sotalol > nadolol approximately control. This rank order of drug-induced Ca(2+) signal disruption is in close agreement with the known arrhythmogenic liabilities of these compounds in humans. Validation of the system using a second set of compounds and hierarchical cluster analysis demonstrated the utility of SALVO to discriminate drugs based on their mechanisms of action. We discuss the utility of this new mechanistically agnostic system for the evaluation of in vitro drug cytotoxicity in hSCCM syncytia and the potential placement of SALVO in the early stage drug screening framework."

        "abstract": "Abstract Prediction of in vivo drug-drug interactions (DDIs) from in vitro and in vivo data, also named in vitro in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), is of interest to scientists involved in the discovery and development of drugs. To avoid detrimental DDIs in humans, new drug candidates should be evaluated for their possible interaction with other drugs as soon as possible, not only as an inhibitor or inducer (perpetrator) but also as a substrate (victim). DDI risk assessment is addressed along the drug development program through an iterative process as the features of the new compound entity are revealed. Both in vitro and preclinical/clinical outcomes are taken into account to better understand the behavior of the developed compound and to refine DDI predictions. During the last decades, several equations have been proposed in the literature to predict DDIs, from a quantitative point of view, showing a substantial improvement in the ability to predict metabolism-based in vivo DDIs. Mechanistic and dynamic approaches have been proposed to predict the magnitude of metabolic-based DDIs. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current equations and methods, the pros and cons of each method, the required input data for each of them, as well as the mechanisms (i.e., reversible inhibition, mechanism-based inhibition, induction) underlying metabolic-based DDIs. In particular, this review outlines how the methods (static and dynamic) can be used in a complementary manner during drug development. The discussion of the limitations and advantages associated with the various approaches, as well as regulatory requirements in that field, can give the reader a helpful overview of this growing area."

To date, proteomic level validation of widely used patient-derived glioblastoma xenografts (PDGX) has not been performed. In the present study, we characterized 20 PDGX models according to subtype classification based on The Cancer Genome Atlas criteria, TP53, PTEN, IDH 1/2, and TERT promoter genetic analysis, EGFR amplification status, and examined their proteomic profiles against those of their parent tumors. The 20 PDGXs belonged to three of four The Cancer Genome Atlas subtypes: eight classical, eight mesenchymal, and four proneural; none neural. Amplification of EGFR gene was observed in 9 of 20 xenografts, and of these, 3 harbored the EGFRvIII mutation. We then performed proteomic profiling of PDGX, analyzing expression/activity of several proteins including EGFR. Levels of EGFR phosphorylated at Y1068 vary considerably between PDGX samples, and this pattern was also seen in primary GBM. Partitioning of 20 PDGX into high (n\u00a0=\u00a05) and low (n\u00a0=\u00a015) groups identified a panel of proteins associated with high EGFR activity. Thus, PDGX with high EGFR activity represent an excellent pre-clinical model to develop therapies for a subset of GBM patients whose tumors are characterized by high EGFR activity. Further, the proteins found to be associated with high EGFR activity can be monitored to assess the effectiveness of targeting EGFR. The development of drugs to inhibit glioblastoma (GBM) growth requires reliable pre-clinical models. We validated proteomic profiles using patient-derived glioblastoma xenografts (PDGX), characterizing 20 PDGX models according to subtype classification based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) criteria, TP53, PTEN, IDH 1/2, and TERT promoter genetic analysis, EGFR amplification status, and examined their proteomic profiles against those of their parent tumors. Proteins found to be associated with high EGFR activity represent potential biomarkers for GBM monitoring."

Typical applications of using pK(a )constants and charge state for absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profiling and quantitative structure-activity relationship modelling complements the methodological comparisons and discussions. The experimental methods discussed include high-throughput screening of pK(a) by multiplexed capillary with ultraviolet absorbance detection on a 96-capillary format instrument, capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (CEMS) based on sample pooling, determination of pK(a) by pH gradient high-performance liquid chromatography, and measurement of pK(a) by a mixed-buffer liner pH gradient system. Comparisons of the different experimental assays are made with emphasis on the newly developed CEMS method. The current status and recent progress in computational approaches to pK(a) prediction are also discussed. In particular, the accuracy limits of simple fragment-based approaches as well as quantum mechanical methods are addressed. Examples of pK(a) prediction from in-house drug candidates as well as commercially available drug molecules are shown and an outline is provided for how drug discovery companies can integrate experiments with computational approaches for increased applications for ADME profiling."

Dual short SEC columns are used to separate small molecule excipients from large protein molecules. The separated protein is quantified using a UV detector at 280. nm. The isolated excipients are switched, online, to the Trinity P1 mixed-mode column for separation, and detected by an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD). Using a stationary phase with 1.7 \u03bcm particles in SEC allows for the use of volatile buffers for both SEC and mix-mode separation. This facilitates the detection of different excipients by ELSD and provides potential for online characterization of the protein with mass spectrometry (MS).

Moreover, the compounds did not confer significant neuroprotection or clinical efficacy measured using standard behavioral endpoints, when studied in clinical trials in a heterogeneous population of stroke patients. To circumvent some of the drug development problems describe above, we have used a rational funnel approach to identify and develop promising candidates. Using a step-wise approach, we have identified a series of compounds based upon two different neuroprotection assays. We have then taken the candidates and determined their \"drug-like\" properties. This guidelines article details in vitro screening assays used to show pleiotropic activity of a series of novel compounds; including enhanced neuroprotective activity compared to the parent compound fisetin. Moreover, for preliminary drug de-risking or risk reduction during development, we used compound assessment in the CeeTox assay, ADME toxicity using the AMES test for genotoxicity and interaction with Cytochrome P450 using CYP450 inhibition analysis against a spectrum of CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) as a measure of drug interaction. Moreover, the compounds have been studied using a transfected Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell assay to assess blood brain barrier penetration (BBB). Using this series of assays, we have identified 4 novel molecules to be developed as an AIS treatment."

Macromolecular therapeutics encompasses a variety of approaches including recombinant proteins, genes, antisense, and small interfering RNAs, all of which have larger molecular dimensions than conventional drugs. These macromolecules have emerged as a powerful class of drugs for a wide range of therapeutic indications mainly on the basis of their site-specific activity and reduced side effects. However, these drugs present an enormous challenge for noninvasive delivery as they are poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized in the body. To surmount these obstacles, either the other aspects of the drug may be exploited or novel delivery systems may be developed. Cost-effectiveness suggests that developing an improved delivery system for an existing drug is a better alternative than modifying the chemical structure of the drug or discovering new drug entities. This chapter focuses on macromolecular drugs and their delivery systems including liposomes, polymers, peptides, and nanoparticles."

Therefore, it is likely that they also modulate sensitivity and resistance to anti-cancer drugs. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of multidrug resistance in SCLC and identify novel molecular markers, we evaluated the expression of 856 miRNAs and ???22,000 genes using miRNA microarray and cDNA microarray in cellular models of SCLC which were widely used as sensitive (NCI-H69) and resistant cell lines (NCI-H69AR) to chemotherapy. We also analysed the correlations between miRNA and mRNA expression patterns. Further studies were tested to determine whether the differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in multidrug resistance in SCLC. Our results showed that 61 miRNAs are presented significantly (>3-fold) including up-regulation of 24 miRNAs and down-regulation of 37 miRNAs. Among these miRNAs, 48 of 61 differentially expressed miRNAs were firstly reported to be closely associated with drug resistance and 37.7% (24/61) of miRNA genes were organised as 10 clusters in total 61 significantly expressed miRNAs. We also found that only 27 of 69 miRNAs were significantly correlated with 604 of 21,522 70 mRNA transcripts by MAS database. The sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs Cisplatin, Etoposide and Doxorubicin greatly increased or reduced following transfection of the drug-resistant H69AR cells with the mimics or antagomirs of miR-134, miR-379 and miR-495, respectively. miR-134 increases the cell survival by inducing G1 arrest in H69AR cells. MRP1/ABCC1 is negatively regulated by miR-134 and down-regulation of MRP1/ABCC1 at the protein level largely correlates with elevated levels of miR-134 in H69AR cells. Our results support for the first time a substantial role for miRNAs in multidrug resistance in SCLC. miR-134 could be a causal factor of the down-regulation of MRP1/ABCC1 in H69AR cells. These findings provide valuable information for potential utility of these miRNAs as specific diagnostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic approaches for drug resistance of SCLC. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) may be regarded as a \"smart\" technology in the design of fluorescence probes for biological sensing and imaging. Recently, a variety of nanoparticles that include quantum dots, gold nanoparticles, polymer, mesoporous silica nanoparticles and upconversion nanoparticles have been employed to modulate FRET. Researchers have developed a number of \"visible\" and \"activatable\" FRET probes sensitive to specific changes in the biological environment that are especially attractive from the biomedical point of view. This article reviews recent progress in bringing these nanoparticle-modulated energy transfer schemes to fruition for applications in biosensing, molecular imaging and drug delivery."

The morphology and properties of the nanoparticles such as pH sensitivity, zeta potential and mean diameters were investigated. The cytotoxicity of PEG-PH-PLLA nanoparticles was evaluated. Doxorubicin (DOX) was encapsulated in the nanoparticles to explore the release profile. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were incubated with HepG2 cells to study the in vitro anti-tumor effect. The results showed the sizes of both blank nanoparticles and drug-loaded nanoparticles in pH 7.4 were smaller than those of nanoparticles in pH 5.0, and the mean diameter of drug-loaded nanoparticles was much bigger than that of blank nanoparticles. The PEG-PH-PLLA nanoparticles were nontoxic to both NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HepG2 cells. The release profile showed that the release of DOX in pH 5.0 was much faster than that in pH 7.4. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that the anti-tumor effect of drug-loaded nanoparticles was preferable to free doxorubicin. The pH-sensitive PEG-PH-PLLA nanoparticles are promising carriers for anti-tumor drug delivery."

In this study, we investigated the applicability of protein profiling of the incubation medium of human, mouse and rat precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) exposed to liver injury-inducing drugs for biomarker identification, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. PCLS were incubated with acetaminophen (APAP), 3-acetamidophenol, diclofenac and lipopolysaccharide for 24-48 h. PCLS medium from all species treated with APAP demonstrated similar changes in protein profiles, as previously found in mouse urine after APAP-induced liver injury, including the same key proteins: superoxide dismutase 1, carbonic anhydrase 3 and calmodulin. Further analysis showed that the concentration of hepcidin, a hepatic iron-regulating hormone peptide, was reduced in PCLS medium after APAP treatment, resembling the decreased mouse plasma concentrations of hepcidin observed after APAP treatment. Interestingly, comparable results were obtained after 3-acetamidophenol incubation in rat and human, but not mouse PCLS. Incubation with diclofenac, but not with lipopolysaccharide, resulted in the same toxicity parameters as observed for APAP, albeit to a lesser extent. In conclusion, proteomics can be applied to identify potential translational biomarkers using the PCLS system. Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Information on the kinetics of these drug interactions with HSA would be valuable in understanding the pharmacokinetic behavior of these drugs and could provide data that might lead to the creation of improved assays for these analytes in biological samples. In this report, an approach based on peak profiling was used with high-performance affinity chromatography to measure the dissociation rate constants for carbamazepine and imipramine with HSA. This approach compared the elution profiles for each drug and a non-retained species on an HSA column and control column over a board range of flow rates. Various approaches for the corrections of non-specific binding between these drugs and the support were considered and compared in this process. Dissociation rate constants of 1.7 (??0.2)s -1 and 0.67 (??0.04)s -1 at pH 7.4 and 37??C were estimated by this approach for HSA in its interactions with carbamazepine and imipramine, respectively. These results gave good agreement with rate constants that have determined by other methods or for similar solute interactions with HSA. The approach described in this report for kinetic studies is not limited to these particular drugs or HSA but can also be extended to other drugs and proteins. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V."

Cellular off-targets and potential side effects of Orlistat in cancer therapies, however, have not been extensively explored thus far. In this study, we report the total of synthesis of THL-like protein-reactive probes, in which extremely conservative modifications (i.e., an alkyne handle) were introduced in the parental THL structure to maintain the native biological properties of Orlistat, while providing the necessary functionality for target identification via the bio-orthogonal click chemistry. With these natural productlike, cell-permeable probes, we were able to demonstrate, for the first time, this chemical proteomic approach is suitable for the identification of previously unknown cellular targets of Orlistat. In addition to the expected fatty acid synthase (FAS), we identified a total of eight new targets, some of which were further validated by experiments including Western blotting, recombinant protein expression, and site-directed mutagenesis. Our findings have important implications in the consideration of Orlistat as a potential anticancer drug at its early stages of development for cancer therapy. Our strategy should be broadly useful for off-target identification against quite a number of existing drugs and/or candidates, which are also covalent modifiers of their biological targets."

A need exists for novel analytical tools to thoroughly characterize the drug as well as its aggregated particle structure in suspension. This work focuses on lipid-based pharmaceutical suspensions for filling of capsules. A rheological approach, namely the fractal concept of flocculation, is introduced to the pharmaceutical field. The model drug mebeverine hydrochloride was first physicochemically analyzed. A special aim was to study the surface energy profiles using inverse gas chromatography as a critical characteristic for the suspension's rheological behavior. Suspensions were manufactured in laboratory process equipment while applying different homogenization speeds. Flow curves of the final suspensions were measured using a cone-and-plate rheometer. As a result, surface energy profiles revealed differences from one mebeverine lot to another. Different homogenization intensities greatly affected the viscosity and the Mooney model was able to predict experimental values as a function of the drug volume fraction. The fractal concept of flocculation characterized mebeverine in suspension and a slight increase of fractal dimension was noted when homogenization speed was increased. It was concluded that the introduced concepts have large potential for designing quality into concentrated pharmaceutical suspensions."

        "abstract": "Urinary retention is a condition in which impaired emptying of the bladder results in postvoidal residual urine. It is generally classified into 'acute' or 'chronic' urinary retention. Because of the complex mechanism of micturition, many drugs can interact with the micturition pathway, all via different modes of action. Although the incidence of urinary retention, in particular acute urinary retention, has been well studied in observational studies and randomized controlled trials, data on the incidence of drug-induced urinary retention are scarce. Data from observational studies suggest that up to 10% of episodes might be attributable to the use of concomitant medication. Urinary retention has been described with the use of drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g. antipsychotic drugs, antidepressant agents and anticholinergic respiratory agents), opioids and anaesthetics, \u03b1-adrenoceptor agonists, benzodiazepines, NSAIDs, detrusor relaxants and calcium channel antagonists. Elderly patients are at higher risk for developing drug-induced urinary retention, because of existing co-morbidities such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and the use of other concomitant medication that could reinforce the impairing effect on micturition. Drug-induced urinary retention is generally treated by urinary catheterization, especially if acute, in combination with discontinuation or a reduction in dose of the causal drug. Studies have been carried out examining the effects of preventive measures for anaesthesia-related urinary retention, both during and after surgery, particularly into the effect of using opioids in combination with non-opioid analgesic drugs on the incidence of postoperative urinary retention. Although combination therapy reduces the opioid-related adverse events, the effect on urinary retention yields contradictory results. This article reviews the literature on drug-induced urinary retention and focuses on its incidence, the different classes of drugs that have been associated with it, and options for its management and prevention. \u00a9 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

Recently, several authors described mathematical models to correct the depth and the resolution values. In this study, we combined theoretical approaches, proposed by different authors with experimental measurements to try to find out the most appropriate approach for correction.

This relies on synthetic testosterone preparations being depleted in (13) C compared to natural testosterone. There is concern, however, about the existence of synthetic testosterone products that are unexpectedly (13) C-enriched and which may allow athletes to circumvent the current GC-C-IRMS test. Further to the reported studies of legitimate pharmaceutical-grade testosterone products, a detailed analysis of seized materials from border-level seizures was required to obtain intelligence concerning trends in 'black market' testosterone manufacture and distribution. The sample set collected for this study between 2006 and 2009 inclusive provided a \u03b4(13) C range (n = 266) of -22.9\u2030 to -32.6\u2030 with mean and median values of -28.4\u2030 and -28.6\u2030, respectively. Within this distribution there were 24 samples (9%) confirmed to have \u03b4(13) C values in the range reported for endogenous urinary steroid metabolites (\u2265 -25.8\u2030). The benefit of \u03b4(13) C profiling for testosterone preparations was demonstrated by the ability to identify specific seized products that can be target tested for future intelligence purposes. In addition, the potential of stable hydrogen isotope ratio ((2) H/(1) H; \u03b4(2) H) discrimination to complement \u03b4(13) C analysis was investigated. Methodologies for the determination of \u03b4(2) H values by gas chromatography-thermal conversion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-TC-IRMS) were developed to provide a \u03b4(2) H range (n = 173) of -177\u2030 to -268\u2030 with mean and median values of -231\u2030 and -234\u2030, respectively."

Here, we describe a novel approach for identifying such drug-induced protein alterations, which combines 2-nitrobenzenesulfenyl chloride (NBS) tryptophan labeling with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE)/mass spectrometry (MS). Lysates from drug-treated and control samples are labeled with light or heavy NBS moiety and separated on a common 2DE gel, and protein alterations are identified by MS through the differential intensity of paired NBS peptide peaks. Using NBS/2DE/MS, we profiled the proteomic alterations induced by tamoxifen (TAM) in the estrogen receptor (ER) positive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Of 88 protein spots that significantly changed upon TAM treatment, 44 spots representing 23 distinct protein species were successfully identified with NBS-paired peptides. Of these 23 TAM-altered proteins, 16 (70%) have not been previously associated with TAM or ER activity. We found the NBS labeling procedure to be both technically and biologically reproducible, and the NBS/2DE/MS alterations exhibited good concordance with conventional 2DE differential protein quantitation, with discrepancies largely due to the comigration of distinct proteins in the regular 2DE gels. To validate the NBS/2DE/MS results, we used immunoblotting to confirm GRP78, CK19, and PA2G4 as bona fide TAM-regulated proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PA2G4 expression can serve as a novel prognostic factor for disease-free survival in two independent breast cancer patient cohorts. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the proteomic changes in breast cancer cells induced by TAM, the most commonly used selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Our results indicate that NBS/2DE/MS may represent a more reliable approach for cellular protein quantitation than conventional 2DE approaches."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are now known to play important roles in the regulation of gene expression for developmental timing, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Therefore, it is likely that they also modulate sensitivity and resistance to anti-cancer drugs. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of multidrug resistance in SCLC and identify novel molecular markers, we evaluated the expression of 856 miRNAs and approximately 22,000 genes using miRNA microarray and cDNA microarray in cellular models of SCLC which were widely used as sensitive (NCI-H69) and resistant cell lines (NCI-H69AR) to chemotherapy. We also analysed the correlations between miRNA and mRNA expression patterns. Further studies were tested to determine whether the differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in multidrug resistance in SCLC. Our results showed that 61 miRNAs are presented significantly (>3-fold) including up-regulation of 24 miRNAs and down-regulation of 37 miRNAs. Among these miRNAs, 48 of 61 differentially expressed miRNAs were firstly reported to be closely associated with drug resistance and 37.7% (24/61) of miRNA genes were organised as 10 clusters in total 61 significantly expressed miRNAs. We also found that only 27 of 69 miRNAs were significantly correlated with 604 of 21,522 70 mRNA transcripts by MAS database. The sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs Cisplatin, Etoposide and Doxorubicin greatly increased or reduced following transfection of the drug-resistant H69AR cells with the mimics or antagomirs of miR-134, miR-379 and miR-495, respectively. miR-134 increases the cell survival by inducing G1 arrest in H69AR cells. MRP1/ABCC1 is negatively regulated by miR-134 and down-regulation of MRP1/ABCC1 at the protein level largely correlates with elevated levels of miR-134 in H69AR cells. Our results support for the first time a substantial role for miRNAs in multidrug resistance in SCLC. miR-134 could be a causal factor of the down-regulation of MRP1/ABCC1 in H69AR cells. These findings provide valuable information for potential utility of these miRNAs as specific diagnostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic approaches for drug resistance of SCLC."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Malaria, caused mostly by Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. Antimalarial drug toxicity is one side of the risk-benefit equation and is viewed differently depending upon whether the clinical indication for drug administration is malaria treatment or prophylaxis. Drug toxicity must be acceptable to patients and cause less harm than the disease itself. Research that leads to drug registration tends to omit two important groups who are particularly vulnerable to malaria - very young children and pregnant women. Prescribing in pregnancy is a particular problem for clinicians because the risk-benefit ratio is often very unclear. The number of antimalarial drugs in use is very small. Despite its decreasing efficacy against P. falciparum, chloroquine continues to be used widely because of its low cost and good tolerability. It remains the drug of first choice for treating P. vivax malaria. Pruritus is a common adverse effect in African patients. As prophylaxis, chloroquine is usually combined with proguanil. This combination has good overall tolerability but mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal upset are more common than with other prophylactic regimens. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is well tolerated as treatment and when used as intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant African women. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is no longer used as prophylaxis because it may cause toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens Johnson syndrome. Mefloquine remains a valuable drug for prophylaxis and treatment. Tolerability is acceptable to most patients and travellers despite the impression given by the lay press. Dose-related serious neuropsychiatric toxicity can occur; mefloquine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of epilepsy or psychiatric disease. Quinine is the mainstay for treating severe malaria in many countries. Cardiovascular or CNS toxicity is rare, but hypoglycaemia may be problematic and blood glucose levels should be monitored. Halofantrine is unsuitable for widespread use because of its potential for cardiotoxicity. There is renewed interest in two old drugs, primaquine and amodiaquine. Primaquine is being developed as prophylaxis, and amodiaquine, which was withdrawn from prophylactic use because of neutropenia and hepatitis, is a potentially good partner drug for artesunate against falciparum malaria. Atovaquone/proguanil is a new antimalarial combination with good efficacy and tolerability as prophylaxis and treatment. The most important class of drugs that could have a major impact on malaria control is the artemisinin derivatives. They have remarkable efficacy and an excellent safety record. They have no identifiable dose-related adverse effects in humans and only very rarely produce allergic reactions. Combining an artemisinin derivative with another efficacious antimalarial drug is increasingly being viewed as the optimal therapeutic strategy for malaria."

        "abstract": "The utility of high-resolution magic-angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR for studying drug delivery in whole tissues was explored by dosing female Sprague-Dawley rats with topical or injectable benzoic acid (BA). In principle, HR-MAS NMR permits the detection of both intra- and extracellular compounds. This is an advantage over the previous detection of topically applied BA using microdialysis coupled to HPLC/UV as microdialysis samples only the extracellular space. Skin and muscle samples were analyzed by H-1 HR-MAS NMR, and BA levels were determined using an external standard solution added to the sample rotor. One to two percent of the BA topical dose was detected in the muscle, showing that BA penetrated through the dermal and subcutaneous layers. Since BA was not detected in the muscle in the microdialysis studies, the NMR spectra revealed the intracellular localization of BA. The amount of BA detected in muscle after subcutaneous injection correlated with the distance from the dosing site. Overall, the results suggest that HR-MAS NMR can distinguish differences in the local concentration of BA varying with tissue type, dosage method, and tissue proximity to the dosing site. The results illustrate the potential of this technique for quantitative analysis of drug delivery and distribution and the challenges to be addressed as the method is refined."

Pharmacological studies of VHD-associated medications (e.g., fenfluramine, pergolide, methysergide, and cabergoline) have revealed that they and/or their metabolites are potent 5-hydroxytryptamine(2B) (5-HT(2B)) receptor agonists. We have shown that activation of 5-HT(2B) receptors on human heart valve interstitial cells in vitro induces a proliferative response reminiscent of the fibrosis that typifies VHD. To identify current or future drugs that might induce VHD, we screened approximately 2200 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or investigational medications to identify 5-HT(2B) receptor agonists, using calcium-based high-throughput screening. Of these 2200 compounds, 27 were 5-HT(2B) receptor agonists (hits); 14 of these had previously been identified as 5-HT(2B) receptor agonists, including seven bona fide valvulopathogens. Six of the hits (guanfacine, quinidine, xylometazoline, oxymetazoline, fenoldopam, and ropinirole) are approved medications. Twenty-three of the hits were then \"functionally profiled\" (i.e., assayed in parallel for 5-HT(2B) receptor agonism using multiple readouts to test for functional selectivity). In these assays, the known valvulopathogens were efficacious at concentrations as low as 30 nM, whereas the other compounds were less so. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the pEC(50) data revealed that ropinirole (which is not associated with valvulopathy) was clearly segregated from known valvulopathogens. Taken together, our data demonstrate that patterns of 5-HT(2B) receptor functional selectivity might be useful for identifying compounds likely to induce valvular heart disease."

The aim of the present project was to design and characterize biosimilar mucus compatible with Caco-2 cell monolayers cultured in vitro to establish a more representative in vitro model for the intestinal mucosa. The rheological profile of a biosimilar mucus mixture composed of purified gastric mucin, lipids and protein in buffer was optimized by supplementing with an anionic polymer to display viscoelastic properties and a microstructure comparable to freshly isolated porcine intestinal mucus (PIM). Further, this multicomponent biosimilar mucus mixture was optimized with regard to the lipid content in order to obtain cellular compatibility with well-differentiated Caco-2 cell monolayers. In contrast, PIM was found to severely disrupt the Caco-2 cell monolayer. When combined with the Caco-2 cell monolayers, the final biosimilar mucus was found to significantly affect the permeability profiles for hydrophobic and hydrophilic small and large model drug compounds in different ways. In conclusion, the present study describes an improvement of the biorelevance of the Caco-2 cell culture model by application of mucus, resulting in an in vitro model of oral mucosa suitable for future assessment of innovative drug delivery approaches. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V."

        "abstract": "Drug-induced valvular heart disease (VHD) is a serious side effect of a few medications, including some that are on the market. Pharmacological studies of VHD-associated medications (e.g., fenfluramine, pergolide, methysergide, and cabergoline) have revealed that they and/or their metabolites are potent 5-hydroxytryptamine2B (5-HT2B) receptor agonists. We have shown that activation of 5-HT2B receptors on human heart valve interstitial cells in vitro induces a proliferative response reminiscent of the fibrosis that typifies VHD. To identify current or future drugs that might induce VHD, we screened approximately 2200 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved or investigational medications to identify 5-HT2B receptor agonists, using calcium-based high-throughput screening. Of these 2200 compounds, 27 were 5-HT2B receptor agonists (hits); 14 of these had previously been identified as 5-HT2B receptor agonists, including seven bona fide valvulopathogens. Six of the hits (guanfacine, quinidine, xylometazoline, oxymetazoline, fenoldopam, and ropinirole) are approved medications.

        "abstract": "Toxicogenomics is the application of gene expression profiling technology to toxicology. This results in the generation of very large and complex gene expression data sets associated with the development of toxicities. It is widely assumed that this data can be deconvoluted to reveal novel insights into toxicological processes that are of value to the task of risk assessment. More specifically, it is hoped that toxicogenomics will aid in the prediction of the toxic potential and mechanisms of toxicity of novel chemical entities. On the basis of such promise, the pharmaceutical industry has invested heavily in this area, as the perceived rewards in terms of improved pipeline efficiency and safer drugs are immense. Consequently, a great deal of groundwork has been done over the past several years to establish working methods in toxicogenomics, both within industry and academia, demonstrating utility in proof-of-concept studies, generating the databases on which some approaches depend, and developing new data analysis tools. Despite such activity, there is little reported evidence to suggest that toxicogenomics is making a significant impact on the discovery and development of drugs. This may partly reflect the understandable reluctance of pharmaceutical industries to share information in a competitive environment. It may also partly reflect difficulties in bridging the gap between theory and practice, as is required to deliver real value to the industry. This review will assess the successes and shortcomings of toxicogenomics, and consider how it can be usefully applied to a drug discovery pipeline."

        "abstract": "While beneficial therapeutically, almost all medications have untoward effects on various body tissues and functions, including the eye in which organ toxic reactions are readily detectable. Every part of the eye and all ocular functions could be affected adversely. In this review, we describe the most commonly recognized drug-induced ocular disorders, their specific clinical features, the medications that can cause the problem, the differential diagnosis and possible mechanisms of action, as well as guidelines for the management of the adverse reactions. The eyelids are most frequently involved in drug toxicity that commonly manifests as inflammation, hypersensitivity reaction or dermatitis. Drug-induced keratoconjunctival disorders present mainly as conjunctival hyperaemia (red eye), with or without superficial corneal involvement. Frequently, drug preservatives in topical ocular medications induce these adverse effects. Treatment of blepharospasm with Botox may lead to drooping of the eyelids and corneal exposure. Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome is a drug-induced reaction in patients treated with tamsulosin and who undergo cataract surgery. Certain sulfa-based drugs can cause swelling of the ciliary body and lead to the development of angle-closure glaucoma. In addition, adrenergic agents, certain beta(2)-adrenergic agonists and anticholinergic agents may induce pupillary dilation and precipitate angle-closure glaucoma in susceptible patients. Glucocorticoids administered systemically, topically or intravitreally are known to increase intraocular pressure, which can lead to the development of open-angle glaucoma in susceptible patients. This painless form of glaucoma has also been associated with the use of the anticancer agents docetaxel and paclitaxel. The toxic effects of systemic and topically applied drugs may manifest as cloudiness of the lens. Long-term use of glucocorticoids produces a characteristic posterior subcapsular cataract and, although the opacities may remain stationary or progress, they rarely regress upon drug withdrawal. Systemic administration of phenothiazines or busulfan induce cataractous changes in the anterior or posterior cortex, respectively. Many systemic drugs reach the retina through the vascular supply. Aminoquinolines induce a characteristic bull's eye maculopathy. Phenothiazines bind to melanin granules and can cause a severe phototoxic retinopathy. Typical tamoxifen retinopathy manifests as crystalline deposits in the inner retina. Some patients treated with retinoids have decreased night vision and abnormal dark-adaptation. Patients on long-term treatment with linezolid may develop an optic neuropathy (swollen or pale optic disc), symmetric painless decrease of visual acuity and colour vision, and bilateral visual field defects. A probable link exists between amiodarone and a bilateral optic neuropathy that is very similar to nonarteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION). The most common adverse effects of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (erectile dysfunction drugs) are changes in colour perception, blurry vision and increased light sensitivity; recently these drugs have been also implicated in the development of NAION. A bilateral, retrobulbar optic neuropathy that manifests as loss of visual acuity or colour vision and visual field defect is associated with the use of ethambutol. Many different kinds of medications can cause similar ocular adverse reactions. Conversely, a single medication may affect more than one ocular structure and cause multiple, clinically recognizable disorders. Clinicians should be mindful of drug-induced ocular disorders, whether or not listed in product package inserts, and, if in doubt, consult with an ophthalmologist."

Here we investigated the added benefit of integrating transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics together with pharmacokinetics for drug testing regimes. Cultured human renal epithelial cells (RPTEC/TERT1) were exposed to the nephrotoxin Cyclosporine A (CsA) at therapeutic and supratherapeutic concentrations for 14days. CsA was quantified in supernatants and cellular lysates by LC-MS/MS for kinetic modeling. There was a rapid cellular uptake and accumulation of CsA, with a non-linear relationship between intracellular and applied concentrations. CsA at 15muM induced mitochondrial disturbances and activation of the Nrf2-oxidative-damage and the unfolded protein-response pathways. All three omic streams provided complementary information, especially pertaining to Nrf2 and ATF4 activation. No stress induction was detected with 5muM CsA; however, both concentrations resulted in a maximal secretion of cyclophilin B. The study demonstrates for the first time that CsA-induced stress is not directly linked to its primary pharmacology. In addition we demonstrate the power of integrated omics for the elucidation of signaling cascades brought about by compound induced cell stress."

        "abstract": "Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in regulating neuroinflammatory and demyelinative responses in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). miRNAs have also been studied as biomarkers of disease pathology and drug-response in MS. However, no complete miRNA profiling at various stages of EAE disease has been examined, especially in the urine. We carried out a systematic analysis of miRNAs in the urine exosomes as well as in the plasma and spinal cord at pre-onset, onset and peak stages of EAE established in the chronic B6 mice model. For the first time, we provide evidence that urine exosomes can be a specific and sensitive source of miRNA biomarkers for all 3 stages of EAE disease. In a significant observation, we observed that miR-155-5p expression increased in urine exosomes, plasma and spinal cord 6 days before the onset of disease, suggesting its early involvement in the pathology of EAE disease. We also analyzed the effect of Glatiramer acetate (GA; copaxone) treatment, an approved treatment for MS patients, in modulating miRNA expression at the peak of EAE disease. We identified miR-155-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-9-5p and miR-350-5p as putative GA-treatment responsive miRNA biomarkers. Since, EAE is a mainly CD4 cells mediated disease, we also examined the above set of miRNAs and found to be significantly altered in T cells polarized to Th1 and Th17 phenotype, similar to urine exosomes. Thus, urine exosome miRNAs hold the potential to be defined as novel accessible stage-specific biomarkers of EAE (MS) disease as well as treatment response."

To facilitate a rational drug discovery programme, in the current study we analysed the synthetic substrate and model inhibitor profiles of FP-2 and FP-3 as well as BP-2 (berghepain-2), an orthologue from the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei. With respect to substrate catalysis, FP-2 exhibited a promiscuous substrate profile based around a consensus non-primeside motif, FP-3 was somewhat more restricted and BP-2 was comparatively specific. Substrate turnover for FP-2 was driven by a basic or acidic P1 residue, whereas for FP-3 turnover occurred predominately through a basic P1 residue only, and for BP-2, turnover was again mainly through a basic P1 residue for some motifs and surprisingly a glycine in the P1 position for other motifs. Within these P1 binding elements, additional recognition motifs were observed with subtle nuances that switched substrate turnover on or off through specific synergistic combinations. The peptidases were also profiled against reversible and irreversible cysteine peptidase inhibitors. The results re-iterated the contrasting kinetic behaviour of each peptidase as observed through the substrate screens. The results showed that the substrate and inhibitor preferences of BP-2 were markedly different from those of FP-2 and FP-3. When FP-2 and FP-3 were compared to each other they also displayed similarities and some significant differences. In conclusion, the in vitro data highlights the current difficulties faced by a peptidase directed anti-malarial medicinal chemistry programme where compounds need to be identified with potent activity against at least three peptidases, each of which displays distinct biochemical traits."

The methyl thioinosine monophosphate (meTIMP)/6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) concentration ratio has been associated with drug efficacy. Here we explored the molecular basis of differences in metabolite profiles and in relation to disease activity.\\n\\nMETHODS: Transcriptional profiles in blood samples from an exploratory IBD-patient cohort (n\u200a=\u200a21) with a normal thiopurine S-methyltransferase phenotype and meTIMP/6-TGN ratios >20, 10.0-14.0 and \u22644, respectively, were assessed by hybridization to microarrays. Results were further evaluated with RT qPCR in an expanded patient cohort (n\u200a=\u200a54). Additionally, 30 purine/thiopurine related genes were analysed separately.\\n\\nRESULTS: Among 17 genes identified by microarray-screening, there were none with a known relationship to pathways of purines/thiopurines. For nine of them a correlation between expression level and the concentration of meTIMP, 6-TGN and/or the meTIMP/6-TGN ratio was confirmed in the expanded cohort. Nine of the purine/thiopurine related genes were identified in the expanded cohort to correlate with meTIMP, 6-TGN and/or the meTIMP/6-TGN ratio. However, only small differences in gene expression levels were noticed over the three different metabolite profiles. The expression levels of four genes identified by microarray screening (PLCB2, HVCN1, CTSS, and DEF8) and one purine/thiopurine related gene (NME6) correlated significantly with the clinical activity of Crohn's disease. Additionally, 16 of the genes from the expanded patient cohort interacted in networks with candidate IBD susceptibility genes.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Seventeen of the 18 genes which correlated with thiopurine metabolite levels also correlated with disease activity or participated in networks with candidate IBD susceptibility genes involved in processes such as purine metabolism, cytokine signaling, and functioning of invariant natural killer T cells, T cells and B cells. Therefore, we conclude that the identified genes to a large extent are related to drug targets and disease mechanisms of IBD."

        "abstract": "Drug induced steatosis (DIS) is characterised by excess triglyceride accumulation in the form of lipid droplets (LD) in liver cells. To explore mechanisms underlying DIS we interrogated the publically available microarray data from the Japanese Toxicogenomics Project (TGP) to study comprehensively whole genome gene expression changes in the liver of treated rats. For this purpose a total of 17 and 12 drugs which are diverse in molecular structure and mode of action were considered based on their ability to cause either steatosis or phospholipidosis, respectively, while 7 drugs served as negative controls. In our efforts we focused on 200 genes which are considered to be mechanistically relevant in the process of lipid droplet biogenesis in hepatocytes as recently published (Sahini and Borlak, 2014). Based on mechanistic considerations we identified 19 genes which displayed dose dependent responses while 10 genes showed time dependency. Importantly, the present study defined 9 genes (ANGPTL4, FABP7, FADS1, FGF21, GOT1, LDLR, GK, STAT3, and PKLR) as signature genes to predict DIS. Moreover, cross tabulation revealed 9 genes to be regulated \u226510 times amongst the various conditions and included genes linked to glucose metabolism, lipid transport and lipogenesis as well as signalling events. Additionally, a comparison between drugs causing phospholipidosis and/or steatosis revealed 26 genes to be regulated in common including 4 signature genes to predict DIS (PKLR, GK, FABP7 and FADS1). Furthermore, a comparison between in vivo single dose (3, 6, 9 and 24 h) and findings from rat hepatocyte studies (2 h, 8 h, 24 h) identified 10 genes which are regulated in common and contained 2 DIS signature genes (FABP7, FGF21). Altogether, our studies provide comprehensive information on mechanistically linked gene expression changes of a range of drugs causing steatosis and phospholipidosis and encourage the screening of DIS signature genes at the preclinical stage."

Despite the relevance of this, the frequency of fatal ADRs (FADRs) is to a large extent unknown. Although spontaneous reporting data cannot give an exact estimate of the magnitude of drug-related mortality, it may highlight the importance and large dimensions of this public health problem. Objective: To describe the types and pattern of reported FADRs by analysing data from the national spontaneous reporting system in Italy. Methods: The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) runs a pharmacovigilance database where all the individual case safety reports (since January 2001) are stored. We selected and then analysed in detail all the case reports (to the end of December 2006) in which death was reported as the outcome. We included in the study only FADR case reports with a probable or possible causality assessment, according to the criteria established by the WHO. In line with the Italian reporting form, we divided FADR reports into two groups: (i) suspected ADRs that caused death; and (ii) suspected ADRs that contributed to death. Results: In the AIFA database 38 507 suspected ADR case reports were collected, of which 641 (1.66%) had a fatal outcome. We analysed 450 case reports (1.17% of total reports), 159 (35.33%) of them causing the patient's death and 291 (64.67%) contributing to death. The annual percentage of FADR reports followed a constant trend during the 6-year period. The majority of fatal reports (79%) were sent by hospital doctors. In total, 222 different drugs were suspected as causes of FADRs. 'Systemic anti-infective drugs' was the drug category associated with the highest percentage of FADRs (21.9%), followed by antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (18.8%), and then by nervous system drugs (14.8%). Other drug categories involved in the fatal case reports were antithrombotic agents, NSAIDs and contrast media. Conclusions: The drugs most frequently involved in FADRs were drugs of wide usage with a narrow therapeutic range or those that caused serious skin or systemic allergic reactions. Ceftriaxone, ticlopidine and nimesulide were associated with the highest number of fatal case reports; the related FADRs were already known and recognized for each of these drugs. We highlight some cases reflecting probable inappropriate drug use by Italian physicians. This suggests a need for continued clinical pharmacology training and that many FADRs might be preventable through better medical and prescribing practice. \u00a9 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: A new experimental set-up for studying partitioning of ionizable drugs at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) by amperometry is presented. The method is quite general, as it can be applied to any charged drug molecule. METHODS: The procedure is based on 96-well microfilter plates with microporous filters to support 96 organic liquid membranes. The new methodology is first validated using a series of tetra-alkylammonium ions and subsequently used to construct the ion partition diagrams of 3,5-N,N-tetramethylaniline and 2,4-dinitrophenol. The lipophilicity of these drugs was examined by potentiometry and cyclic voltammetry in the NPOE/water system. RESULTS: Cyclic voltammetry resulted in potential-pH profiles of the studied drugs. When the aqueous phase pKa is already known, the logP(NPOE) of lipophilic drugs could be determined using a very little amount of solvents and drugs. The values of the partition coefficients for the neutral forms agree well with those obtained by potentiometry. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure based on commercially available 96-well microfilter plates is shown to be useful for determining logP of ionized drugs in a rapid and efficient way."

        "abstract": "The recognition of toxicological potential in new chemical entities early on in development would be highly desirable in streamlining and reducing the cost of drug development. Analysis of gene expression profiles using microarrays is one of the most fashionable methods for achieving this objective. The procedure relies on developing a gene expression profile related to compound exposure and then matching this against a database of profiles associated with known mechanisms of toxicity. Studies profiling tumors and associating these with pathology and phenotype have shown the potential of the technique. However, application of the technique in toxicology is only at the preliminary stage. This article examines current state of development in toxicology and its future potential."

        "abstract": "Atazanavir is a commonly prescribed protease inhibitor for treatment of HIV-1 infection. Thus far, only limited data are available on the in vivo metabolism of the drug. Three systemic circulating metabolites have been reported, but their chemical structures have not been released publicly. Atazanavir metabolites may contribute to its effectiveness but also to its toxicity and interactions. Thus, there is a need for extensive metabolic profiling of atazanavir. Our goals were to screen and identify previously unknown atazanavir metabolites and to develop a sensitive metabolite profiling method in plasma. Five atazanavir metabolites were detected and identified in patient samples using liquid chromatography coupled to linear ion trap mass spectrometry: one N-dealkylation product (M1), two metabolites resulting from carbamate hydrolysis (M2 and M3), a hydroxylated product (M4), and a keto-metabolite (M5). For sensitive semiquantitative analysis of the metabolites in plasma, the method was transferred to liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. In 12 patient samples, all the metabolites could be detected, and possible other potential atazanavir keto-metabolites were found. Atazanavir metabolite levels were positively correlated with atazanavir levels, but interindividual variability was high. The developed atazanavir metabolic screening method can now be used for further clinical pharmacological research with this antiretroviral agent."

        "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs), which play crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression in the human genome, are highly regulated by a variety of mechanisms. A single extracellular stimulus can trigger multiple signaling pathways, and these in turn can activate multiple TFs to mediate the inducible expression of target genes. Alterations in the activities of TFs are often associated with human diseases, such as altered activating factor 1, estrogen receptor, and p53 function in cancer, nuclear factor kappaB in inflammatory diseases, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in obesity. A systematic assay for profiling the activation of TFs will aid in elucidating the mechanisms of TF activation, reveal altered TFs associated with human diseases, and aid in developing assays for drug discovery. Here, we developed a 24-plex fluorescent microsphere-based TF activation assay system with a 96-well plate format. The assay system enabled high-throughput profiling of the DNA binding activity of TFs in multiple samples with high sensitivity."

        "abstract": "Kinases continue to be one of the most important targets in today's drug discovery efforts. Following the identification of lead compounds through screening efforts, it is important to profile these leads against other kinases within that family, as well as from other families, to ascertain potential off-target effects. Because many kinase assays require the use of different substrates, optimization time and costs during profiling can be prohibitive. Here we demonstrate the versatility of a luminescent ADP accumulation assay, where one set of reagents can be used for a wide variety of kinases with differing K(m app) for ATP and substrates. Assay sensitivity allows for the use of low enzyme concentrations and small percent ATP conversion levels while still maintaining high signal:background ratios. We have used a simple, inexpensive automated pipetting system to automate the entire process from enzyme optimization through generation of compound IC(50) values. Agreement with literature values proves this combination of chemistry and instrumentation provides a simple, yet robust solution for automated kinase profiling."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance and has complex pharmacological actions in brain. In this study, we employed a novel drug target validation strategy to uncover the multiple molecular targets of caffeine using combined A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) knockouts (KO) and microarray profiling. Caffeine (10 mg/kg) elicited a distinct profile of striatal gene expression in WT mice compared with that by A(2A)R gene deletion or by administering caffeine into A(2A)R KO mice. Thus, A(2A)Rs are required but not sufficient to elicit the striatal gene expression by caffeine (10 mg/kg). Caffeine (50 mg/kg) induced complex expression patterns with three distinct sets of striatal genes: 1) one subset overlapped with those elicited by genetic deletion of A(2A)Rs; 2) the second subset elicited by caffeine in WT as well as A(2A)R KO mice; and 3) the third subset elicited by caffeine only in A(2A)R KO mice. Furthermore, striatal gene sets elicited by the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor rolipram and the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicucullin, overlapped with the distinct subsets of striatal genes elicited by caffeine (50 mg/kg) administered to A(2A)R KO mice. Finally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis reveals that adipocyte differentiation/insulin signaling is highly enriched in the striatal gene sets elicited by both low and high doses of caffeine. The identification of these distinct striatal gene populations and their corresponding multiple molecular targets, including A(2A)R, non-A(2A)R (possibly A(1)Rs and pathways associated with PDE and GABA(A)R) and their interactions, and the cellular pathways affected by low and high doses of caffeine, provides molecular insights into the acute pharmacological effects of caffeine in the brain."

To test the hypothesis that altered substrate binding and/or catalytic properties contribute to its functional consequences, efavirenz 8-hydroxylation and bupropion 4-hydroxylation were determined in CYP2B6.1 and CYP2B6.6 proteins expressed without and with cytochrome b5 (Cyt b5) and in human liver microsomes (HLMs) obtained from liver tissues genotyped for the CYP2B6*6 allele. The susceptibility of the variant protein to inhibition was also tested in HLMs. Significantly higher V(max) and K(m) values for 8-hydroxyefavirenz formation and \u223c2-fold lower intrinsic clearance (Cl(int)) were noted in expressed CYP2B6.6 protein (-b5) compared with that of CYP2B6.1 protein (-b5); this effect was abolished by Cyt b5. The V(max) and Cl(int) values for 4-hydroxybupropion formation were significantly higher in CYP2B6.6 than in CYP2B6.1 protein, with no difference in K(m), whereas coexpression with Cyt b5 reversed the genetic effect on these kinetic parameters. In HLMs, CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype was associated with markedly lower V(max) (and moderate increase in K(m)) and thus lower Cl(int) values for efavirenz and bupropion metabolism, but no difference in catalytic properties was noted between CYP2B6*1/*1 and CYP2B6*1/*6 genotypes. Inhibition of efavirenz 8-hydroxylation by voriconazole was significantly greater in HLMs with the CYP2B6*6 allele (K(i) = 1.6 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcM) than HLMs with CYP2B6*1/*1 genotype (K(i) = 3.0 \u00b1 1.1 \u03bcM). In conclusion, our data suggest the CYP2B6*6 allele influences metabolic activity by altering substrate binding and catalytic activity in a substrate- and Cyt b5-dependent manner. It may also confer susceptibility to inhibition."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70-80% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases ('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy."

        "abstract": "The mutation pattern of breast cancer molecular subtypes is incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to identify mutations in genes that may be targeted with currently available investigational drugs in the three major breast cancer subtypes (ER+/HER2-, HER2+, and Triple Negative). We extracted DNA from fine needle aspirations of 267 stage I-III breast cancers. These tumor specimens typically consisted of >80% neoplastic cells. We examined 28 genes for 163 known cancer-related nucleic acid variations by Sequenom technology. We observed at least one mutation in 38 alleles corresponding to 15 genes in 108 (40%) samples, including PIK3CA (16.1% of all samples), FBXW7 (8%), BRAF (3.0%), EGFR (2.6%), AKT1 and CTNNB1 (1.9% each), KIT and KRAS (1.5% each), and PDGFR-\u03b1 (1.1%). We also checked for the polymorphism in PHLPP2 that is known to activate AKT and it was found at 13.5% of the patient samples. PIK3CA mutations were more frequent in estrogen receptor-positive cancers compared to triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (19 vs. 8%, p=0.001). High frequency of PIK3CA mutations (28%) were also found in HER2+ breast tumors. In TNBC, FBXW7 mutations were significantly more frequent compared to ER+ tumors (13 vs. 5%, p=0.037). We performed validation for all mutated alleles with allele-specific PCR or direct sequencing; alleles analyzed by two different sequencing techniques showed 95-100% concordance for mutation status. In conclusion, different breast cancer subtypes harbor different type of mutations and approximately 40 % of tumors contained individually rare mutations in signaling pathways that can be potentially targeted with drugs. Simultaneous testing of many different mutations in a single needle biopsy is feasible and allows the design of prospective clinical trials that could test the functional importance of these mutations in the future."

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the genes associated with higher ability of metastasis and chemotherapic resistance in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) by using Agilent whole genome oligonucleotide gene chip,with an attempt to further investigate the molecular mechanism of metastasis and chemotherapic resistance of EOC. Methods Oligonucleotide microarrays were used to determine whether gene expression profile might differentiate EOC cell lines (RMG-1-C,COC1 and HO8910) from their sub-lines (RMG-1-H,COC1/DDP and HO8910/PM) with higher ability of metastasis and chemotherapic resistance. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining validated the microarray results. Results Gene expression profile identified 49 differentially expressed genes that showed\u22652.0 fold change. All these differentially expressed genes were involved mainly in gene expression and biopolymer biosynthesis. Interaction network analysis predicted 21 genes participating in the regulatory connection. Highly differential expression of GCET2,CFTR,FOXP1 and GARS genes was validated by quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction in all cell line samples,and the Results were consistent with microarray findings. Conclusion The change in the metastasis and chemotherapic resistance-associated gene expression profiles may provide a theoretical basis for studies on the molecular mechanisms of metastasis and chemotherapic resistance in EOC."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Background: Since 2009, scheduling legislation of synthetic cannabinoids prompted new compound emergence to circumvent legal restrictions. 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(1-pentyl-indol-3-yl)methanone (RCS-4) is a potent cannabinoid receptor agonist sold in herbal smoking blends. Absence of parent synthetic cannabinoids in urine suggests the importance of metabolite identification for detecting RCS-4 consumption in clinical and forensic investigations. Materials & methods & Results: With 1 h human hepatocyte incubation and TOF high-resolution MS, we identified 18 RCS-4 metabolites, many not yet reported. Most metabolites were hydroxylated with or without demethylation, carboxylation and dealkylation followed by glucuronidation. One additional sulfated metabolite was also observed. O-demethylation was the most common biotransformation and generated the major metabolite. Conclusion: For the first time, we present a metabolic scheme of RCS-4 obtained from human hepatocytes, including Phase I and II metabolites. Metabolite structural information and associated high-resolution mass spectra can be employed for developing clinical and forensic laboratory RCS-4 urine screening methods."

Methods: MDCK-cells overexpressing ABCC2 were cultured until confluency in 96-well plates. Cells were incubated with chloromethylfluorescein-diacetate (CMFDA) in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of potential substrates and inhibitors of ABCC2. After formation of GSMF the extent of intracellular fluorescence was monitored with a fluorescence plate reader in a time- and a concentration-dependent manner. Results: MDCK cells showed stable expression of ABCC2 and, as a consequence, GSMF was extruded by the cells across the apical membrane in an energy-dependent manner. The incubation conditions (optimum CMFDA concentration; glutathione dependency, membrane toxicity) were elaborated. Determination of intracellular glutathione concentration indicated that under the chosen conditions glutathione is not rate limiting for the assay performance. Known inhibitors of ABCB1 (P-GP) and ABCG2 (BCRP) did not influence intracellular fluorescence intensity, but a significant increase of intracellular fluorescence was observed in the presence of MRP2-substrates and inhibitors accompanied with a concomitant decrease of GSMF efflux. Conclusions: The GSMF-assay based on fluorescence accumulation in MRP2-overexpressing MDCK cells can be used as a rapid microplate screening system for interactions of drugs with MRP2 and therefore represents a useful tool in drug profiling. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "A paradoxical drug reaction constitutes an outcome that is opposite from the outcome that would be expected from the drug's known actions. There are three types: 1. A paradoxical response in a condition for which the drug is being explicitly prescribed. 2. Paradoxical precipitation of a condition for which the drug is indicated, when the drug is being used for an alternative indication. 3. Effects that are paradoxical in relation to an aspect of the pharmacology of the drug but unrelated to the usual indication. In bidirectional drug reactions, a drug may produce opposite effects, either in the same or different individuals, the effects usually being different from the expected beneficial effect. Paradoxical and bidirectional drug effects can sometimes be harnessed for benefit; some may be adverse. Such reactions arise in a wide variety of drug classes. Some are common; others are reported in single case reports. Paradoxical effects are often adverse, since they are opposite the direction of the expected effect. They may complicate the assessment of adverse drug reactions, pharmacovigilance, and clinical management. Bidirectional effects may be clinically useful or adverse. From a clinical toxicological perspective, altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics in overdose may exacerbate paradoxical and bidirectional effects. Certain antidotes have paradoxical attributes, complicating management. Apparent clinical paradoxical or bidirectional effects and reactions ensue when conflicts arise at different levels in self-regulating biological systems, as complexity increases from subcellular components, such as receptors, to cells, tissues, organs, and the whole individual. These may be incompletely understood. Mechanisms of such effects include different actions at the same receptor, owing to changes with time and downstream effects; stereochemical effects; multiple receptor targets with or without associated temporal effects; antibody-mediated reactions; three-dimensional architectural constraints; pharmacokinetic competing compartment effects; disruption and non-linear effects in oscillating systems, systemic overcompensation, and other higher-level feedback mechanisms and feedback response loops at multiple levels. Here we review and provide a compendium of multiple class effects and individual reactions, relevant mechanisms, and specific clinical toxicological considerations of antibiotics, immune modulators, antineoplastic drugs, and cardiovascular, CNS, dermal, endocrine, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, haematological, respiratory, and psychotropic agents."

        "abstract": "a b s t r a c t Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) is a very useful tool in the purpose of impurity profiling of drug candidates, as an adequate selection of stationary phases can provide orthogonal separations so as to maximize the chances to see all impurities. The purpose of the present work is to develop a method for chemical purity assessment. The first part, presented here, focuses on mobile phase selection to ensure adequate elution and detection of drug-like molecules, while the second part focuses on stationary phase selection for optimal separation and orthogonality. The use of additives in the carbon dioxide \u2013 solvent mobile phase in SFC is now commonplace, and enables in particular to increase the number of eluted compounds and to improve peak shapes. The objective of this first part was to test different additives (acids, bases, salts and water) for their chro-matographic performance assessed in gradient elution with a diode-array detector, but also for the mass responses obtained with a single-quadrupole mass detector, equipped with an electrospray ionization source (Waters ACQUITY QDa). In this project, we used a selection of one hundred and sixty compounds issued from Servier Research Laboratories to screen a set of columns and additives in SFC with a Waters ACQUITY UPC 2 system. The selected columns were all high-performance columns (1.7\u20131.8 \u242em with totally porous particles or 2.6\u20132.7 \u242em with superficially porous particles) with a variety of stationary phase chemistries. Initially, eight additives dissolved in the methanol co-solvent were tested on a UPC 2 ACQUITY UPC 2 HSS C18 SB column. A Derringer desirability function was used to classify the additives according to selected criteria: elution capability, peak shapes, UV baseline drift, and UV and mass responses (signal-to-noise ratios). Following these tests, the two best additives (ammonium acetate and ammonium hydroxide) were tested on a larger number of columns (10) where the two additives appeared to provide very comparable overall scores. However, ammonium acetate was selected for slightly better chromatographic quality. In a second step, we investigated the effects of ammonium acetate concentration (between 0 and 25 mM in the methanol co-solvent) on retention and peak efficiency. Two types of silica supports were tested by working with ACQUITY UPC 2 HSS C18 SB and BEH columns. 20 mM ammonium acetate in methanol with 2% water was finally selected as the best co-solvent composition."

Consulting patterns by Read code chapter and chapter subdivision were examined using cluster analysis, logistic regression and classification and regression trees (CART).\\n\\nRESULTS: CART and multivariate logistic regression analyses suggested that COPD patients were more likely to consult with pulmonary circulatory disease (multivariate OR: 7.46 (95% confidence intervals: 2.05, 20.01) ), non-COPD respiratory diseases (2.77 (2.28, 3.37)), mycoses (2.0 (1.43, 2.71)), 'symptoms or ill-defined conditions' (1.95 (1.68, 2.29)), or other forms of heart disease (1.84 (1.92, 2.64)), and less likely to consult with hypertensive diseases (0.73 (0.57, 0.96)). Regression also showed positive associations with digestive system diseases (OR: 1.31 (1.02, 1.68)) and negative associations with 'other viral or chlamydial disease' (0.16 (0.03, 0.88)). A borderline significance reduced risk for cancers was seen in univariate logistic regression analyses. Cluster analyses were not useful in discriminating between cases and controls.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These analyses provide information about the natural history of COPD and could be used to help interpret or detect adverse drug reactions if repeated before and after introduction of a treatment. COPD can be considered a multicomponent disease with more frequent comorbidities than age- and gender-matched individuals without COPD."

        "abstract": "This chapter provides a general survey of validated and emerging molecular targets for cancer drug discovery and development, with a focus on those explored for the discovery of molecularly targeted cancer therapeutics. The targeting of oncogenic protein tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways in cancer cells ushered in the molecularly targeted approach to therapeutics. The signaling cascade is initiated by the growth factors binding to their cognate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) at the extracellular domain. Protein and lipid kinases modulate the cellular functions of numerous other proteins and play critical roles in signal transduction pathways of cell growth and proliferation. The chapter explains the major receptor and cytosolic tyrosine kinases identified as novel cancer targets. It is found that, in addition to the HER or erbB family of oncogenic RTKs, several other RTKs constitute potential novel molecular targets for cancer drug discovery such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor has also been shown to be important in cancer progression and angiogenesis. Its overexpression has been correlated with treatment failure and mortality in brain, breast, cervical, esophageal, oropharyngeal, and ovarian cancers."

The experimental matrix contained many different activity profiles. SVM predictions achieved overall high accuracy due to consistently low false-positive and consistently high true-negative rates. However, predictions for promiscuous inhibitors were affected by false-negative rates. Combined target-based SVM classifiers reached or exceeded the performance of SVM profile prediction methods and were superior to Bayesian classification. The classifiers displayed different prediction characteristics including diverse combinations of false-positive and true-negative rates. Predicted and experimentally observed compound activity profiles were compared in detail, revealing activity patterns modeled with different accuracy."

These are used in various traditional herbal formulations and nutraceuticals, as well as to treat neurological disorders like epilepsy, hysteria, syncope, convulsions, and mental weakness. They resemble each other in their external morphological characters and characteristic odour, so their roots are often confused with each other. Since free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a considerable range of neurological disorders, including seizures and epilepsy, analysis of these two important medicinal plants was carried out based on their antioxidant activities and phenolic profiles. N. jatamansi expressed better antioxidant activity with both DPPH and TAC methods. Strong correlation was seen between TPC and antioxidant activities. Phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, protocatechuic acid, and syringic acid were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively in the methanol extracts of N. jatamansi and S. vaginatum by HPLC. N. jatamansi was found to contain only protocatechuic and syringic acids while chlorogenic and ferulic acids were present only in S. vaginatum. The studies suggest that both of the plants exhibit distinctive properties and that their similar therapeutic uses may be dependent on synergistic effects exhibited by the different compounds present in them."

The ability to perform these studies successfully to extract the maximum value and discovery of biologically relevant candidate biomarkers is therefore of primary importance. Many successful studies in the past have focused on total proteome analysis (changes at the protein level) combined with phosphorylation analysis by metal affinity enrichment (changes at the PTM level). Here, we use the gastric carcinoma cell line MKN-45 treated with the c-Met inhibitor SU11274 and PKC inhibitor staurosporine to investigate the most efficient and most comprehensive strategies for both total protein and PTM analysis. Under the conditions used, total protein analysis yielded few changes in response to either compound, while analysis of phosphorylation identified thousands of sites that changed differentially between the two treatments. Both metal affinity and antibody-based enrichments were used to assess phosphopeptide changes, and the data generated by the two methods was largely complementary (non-overlapping). Label-free quantitation of peptide peak abundances was used to accurately determine fold-changes between control and treated samples. Protein interaction network analysis allowed the data to be placed in a biologically relevant context, and follow-up validation of selected findings confirmed the accuracy of the proteomic data. Together, this study provides a framework for start-to-finish proteomic analysis of any experimental system under investigation to maximize the value of the proteomic study and yield the best chance for uncovering actionable target candidates."

        "abstract": "The study was carried out to investigate the distribution and prevalence of some multidrug resistant nosocomial pathogens in various selected hospitals in Ilorin. Various hospitals sections were assessed. This finding revealed that Klebsiella pneumoniae was predominant with 14.9% followed by E. coli, Streptococcus sp. and Acinetobacter sp. of 12.4%, 12.3% and 12.2% respectively. All Gram negative bacteria were susceptible to Ofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin Cephalexin and resistant to Chloramphenicol, Septrin, Vancomycin and Ampicillin while, Gram positive bacteria were found to be susceptible to Ofloxacin, Vancomycin and Ampicillin and resistant to septrin, Augmentin and tetracycline. Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas were found to display high level of resistance to most tested antibiotics with varying magnitude. Six of the isolates harboured R-plasmid acquired transfer of mobile genetic element. Gene coding for antibiotics resistance were located on the plasmid while the other three isolates without plasmids may have their gene coding located on their chromosomal DNA. It was concluded that the principle of antimicrobial stewardship is urgently needed to preserve efficacy of available antimicrobial agents.\\n"

        "abstract": "Cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) mRNA is not inducible in Atlantic tomcod from the Hudson River that are treated with halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs). In contrast, CYP1A1 mRNA is inducible in Hudson River tomcod that are treated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and in tomcod that are collected from cleaner rivers and treated with HAHs or PAHs. We hypothesize that CYP1A1 transcription is inhibited in Hudson River tomcod because of down-regulation of the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway and that separate molecular pathways modulate CYP1A1 transcription in fish treated with HAHs and PAHs. We initially evaluated levels of hepatic nuclear protein binding at enhancer elements (DREs) in the regulatory region of tomcod CYP1A1. No difference in levels of protein binding was observed between tomcod from the Hudson and Miramichi (cleaner) rivers that were untreated or were treated with benzo[a]pyrene. In contrast, levels of protein binding were lower in tomcod from the Hudson River that were treated with TCB than in similarly treated fish from the Miramichi River, suggesting differences between the populations in the structure or expression of AhR pathway molecules. To address this possibility, AhR DNA sequences were characterized from tomcod cDNA and genomic DNA libraries. In tomcod and mammals, AhR is represented by 11 exons, overall peptide sizes are similar, and amino acid sequences at basic, helix-loop-helix, PAAS A, and PAAS B domains are highly conserved. In contrast, little similarity was observed between tomcod and mammals in the sizes or sequences of AhR exons 10 and 11, including the absence in tomcod of glutamine-rich domains. No differences in levels of hepatic AhR mRNA were observed between the two populations or treatment groups when tomcod were untreated or were treated with aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast, variation in levels of AhR mRNA expression was observed among tomcod tissues; however, no relationship was observed between levels of AhR mRNAs and CYP1A1 mRNAs in tissues from chemically or vehicle control-treated fish. RFLP analysis revealed extensive variation in exons 10 and 11 of AhR cDNA among tomcod from different rivers. Our results suggest that variation between tomcod populations in CYP1A1 mRNA inducibility is reflected by differences in levels of inducible hepatic protein binding to DREs. However, levels of hepatic AhR mRNA are not down-regulated in the Hudson River population, are not affected by AH treatments, and levels of AhR mRNA expression are not responsible for the differential inducibility of CYP1A1 transcription."

        "title": "Communication in Drug Safety",
        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Public communication on safety concerns over medicines and advice on how to prevent medicine-induced patient harm is a decisive challenge for the overall success of those responsible for pharmacovigilance. It was in this spirit that the topic of commu-nication in drug safety was put on the agenda of the 10th Annual Meeting of the International Society of Pharmacovigilance (ISoP) in Accra, Ghana, on 5 November 2010, as a follow-up to the sessions on communications at previous an-nual meetings. The informal environment chosen this time was different and unusual but ideal for the topic at stake; an interactive debate involving all participants in the session with the objective of understanding the characteristics of effective communication. Around 30 participants from all over the world came together and presented views from their various perspectives; community and hospital pharmacy, academia, pharmacovigilance centres and regulatory agencies, as well as international bodies. Much is known in theory about good com-munication practices, particularly with regard to the need for clear messages targeted at different populations. But how to achieve this in practice? Reciprocity was defined as the starting point; an exchange of information based on mutual re-spect and shared interest. Two crude commu-nication levels are to be distinguished; one-to-one communication between patients and healthcare professionals, versus mass communication -with smaller or larger audiences -by those investigat-ing and regulating medicines. Independently of the level, the principles of reciprocity and inter-action should apply, not least in the research and planning stage, before communication takes place. The interactive debate was a free-flowing dis-cussion where almost all participants took the floor and presented examples, bringing the prin-ciples and challenges of their application to life. Patients' misunderstandings as to the indication and adverse effects of medicines seem frequent. This was illustrated by examples, including one on women's fears over adverse effects resulting in infertility and termination of pregnancy. The introduction of a communication protocol for thoroughly informing the women concerned in the presence of a third-party witness or supporter has solved the problem in the setting presented. Other examples related to communication over counterfeit medicines, another difficult area given that many people feel they do not have the finan-cial means for, or easy access to, quality-assured products. 882 Bahri et al. The discussion then turned to the topic of feed-back, a further crucial characteristic of reciprocal communication. In one-to-one settings, this may well be achieved, as a participating pharmacist explained, through actively soliciting from the patient a repetition or rehearsal of what was un-derstood. In mass communication settings, ob-taining feedback is no less essential but more complex, and regulators will have to look into designing participation models accordingly. Other aspects for regulators to look at were identified. Participants in the debate stated that regulators often do not consider in their decision-making the situation of health workers in their local setting (particularly relating to easy access to up-to-date safety information), and that there is a need to build sound, trusting partnerships with patients and healthcare professionals. These partnerships may also provide a framework to develop recommendations for one-to-one com-munications between healthcare professionals and patients on certain safety concerns. The partici-pants highlighted the need for regulators to better explain to the public the rationale for regulatory decisions. Towards the end of the workshop, the experi-ences shared during the discussion helped to iden-tify more accurately what targeted, clear messages mean in practice: \u2022 Messages should address, in clear terms, the information needs of the various audiences, in an appropriate language and by suitable methods and, in particular, fill the respective information gaps. \u2022 Messages should describe the action desired as outcome from the communication, where that action has been agreed between the commu-nicating parties on the basis of shared under-standing and purpose. \u2022 Messages prepared for targeted populations should easily enable further individuahzation for one-to-one communications, taking into account the literacy level, psychology and social environment of the given patient. Implementing these recommendations will re-quire outreach to the healthcare communities and finding ways to engage patients. A comment was raised that thought should also be given to how to strengthen communication with health politi-cians and policy makers, who need information for decision-making on the one hand and shape so much of the communications environment by their decisions on the other."

        "abstract": "Cerlapirdine (SAM-531, PF-05212365) is a selective, potent, full antagonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 6 (5-HT6) receptor. Cerlapirdine and other 5-HT6 receptor antagonists have been in clinical development for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion study was conducted to gain further understanding of the metabolism and disposition of cerlapirdine. Because of the low amount of radioactivity administered, total 14C content and metabolic profiles in plasma, urine, and feces were determined using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). After a single, oral 5-mg dose of [14C]cerlapirdine (177 nCi), recovery of total 14C was almost complete, with feces being the major route of elimination of the administered dose, whereas urinary excretion played a lesser role. The extent of absorption was estimated to be at least 70%. Metabolite profiling in pooled plasma samples showed that unchanged cerlapirdine was the major drug-related component in circulation, representing 51% of total 14C exposure in plasma. One metabolite (M1, desmethylcerlapirdine) was detected in plasma, and represented 9% of the total 14C exposure. In vitro cytochrome P450 reaction phenotyping studies showed that M1 was formed primarily by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. In pooled urine samples, three major drug-related peaks were detected, corresponding to cerlapirdine-N-oxide (M3), cerlapirdine, and desmethylcerlapirdine. In feces, cerlapirdine was the major 14C component excreted, followed by desmethylcerlapirdine. The results of this study demonstrate that the use of the AMS technique enables comprehensive quantitative elucidation of the disposition and metabolic profiles of compounds administered at a low radioactive dose."

Drug preference was measured by the method of paired-comparison and personality was measured with the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire-50 CC. Contrary to expectations, high compared with low scorers on Sociability and Impulsive-Sensation Seeking preferred depressants. Surprisingly, low compared with high scorers on neuroticism did not differ in preference for alcohol. As in the previous study, drug preference, use, and availability were highly correlated, although ease of availability was slightly more predictive of drug use than drug preference. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed."

        "abstract": "In vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that the induction or inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) is one of the major mechanisms for some clinically important pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions. Thus, an attempt was made to predict pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions using the pharmacokinetic principles that are used for predicting drug-drug interactions. The expected AUC ratio was mainly dependent on unbound herbal inhibitor concentration ([I]) and inhibition constant (Ki), hepatic fraction (fh), number of inhibitory herbal constituents (n) and metabolic pathway fraction in hepatic metabolism (fm). Herb-drug interactions would be with low risk if sigma(i=1)n [[Ii]/Ki(i)] is less than 0.1, medium risk if it is between 0.1 and 1.0, and high risk if it is greater than 1. For high clearance drugs, the change of fh x fm had minor influence on AUC ratio when sigma(i=1)n [[Ii]/Ki(i)] values were fixed. Similarly, fm did not affect the AUC ratio for low clearance drugs. It appeared likely to predict a herb-drug metabolic interaction when [I], Ki, fh, fm and n could be determined. However, many herb- and drug-related factors may cause difficulties with the prediction, and well-designed human studies are always necessary."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions can be associated with patient morbidity due to either increased toxicity or a potentially ineffective concentration. Because interactions cannot always be anticipated during drug development and actual patients receiving a drug for therapeutic use often differ from those included in clinical trials, postmarketing surveillance is essential. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) databases offer a unique opportunity in this respect. Prerequisites for TDM databases to provide valid information in a pharmacoepidemiological perspective include the following: precise description of exposure to the potentially interacting drugs; measurement of parent compound and active metabolites through accurate and precise analytical techniques; documentation of relevant patient characteristics that may act as confounding factors (e.g. gender, age, smoking habits); repeated assessments over time if possible; and sound pharmacokinetic framework for data selection, analysis and interpretation. The contribution of TDM to the documentation of drug-drug interactions takes advantage of different possible study designs, discussed on the basis of recently published studies. The single case report plays an important role as an alert signal. It is illustrated for a patient on long-term treatment, who displayed an unexpectedly high clozapine concentration rafter the introduction of ciprofloxacin comedication. The prospective on and off comedication panel study shows advantages in terms of carefully selected inclusion criteria and control of treatment modalities. A study of the thioridazine-fluvoxamine interaction is presented, with patients followed on thioridazine monotherapy, after introduction of fluvoxamine and after its discontinuation. The main advantage of the retrospective large-scale TDM database screen is representativeness of patients actually treated, whereas drawbacks are related to quality of data and suitability for valid interpretation. Such an approach is illustrated by a review of data collected over 10 years of routine TDM that allowed documenting induction of nortriptyline metabolism by carbamazepine and inhibition by several phenothiazines. Finally, population pharmacokinetics is well suited to observational data collected for TDM purpose, provided quality is ascertained. Focus is placed on interindividual variability and relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and patient characteristics, including comedication. The population approach is discussed with respect to a study that documented a 32% increase of haloperidol clearance associated with anticonvulsant comedication, in addition to effects of age and bodyweight. Among factors to consider for improved effectiveness in the use of TDM databases for postmarketing surveillance of drug-drug interactions, integration of efficacy and safety data in future studies and communication of expert recommendations to prescribing physicians are essential."

        "abstract": "Introduction: Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are rare heterogeneous pediatric tumors that are treated by surgery, chemotherapy and irradiation. New therapeutic approaches are needed, especially in the advanced stages to target the pro-oncogenic signals. Exploring the molecular interactions of the regulatory signals and their roles in the developmental aspects of different subtypes of RMS is essential to identify potential targets and develop new therapeutic drugs. Areas covered: Insights into different drug discovery approaches are discussed with specific emphasis on gene expression profiling, fusion protein, role of small interfering RNA (siRNA)- and microRNA (miRNA)-based discovery approaches, targeting cancer stem cells, and in vitro and in vivo model systems. Targeting some overexpressed signals along with the possibilities of combination therapy of validated drug targets is discussed. Additionally, methods to overcome the limitations of discovery-based research are briefly discussed. Expert opinion: Due to drug resistance, ineffective therapy in advanced stages and relapse, there is a demand to explore new drug targets and discovery approaches. Implementing miRNA-based profiling would reveal the extent of miR-based regulation, various biomarkers and potential targets in RMS. A suitable combination of innovative techniques and the use of model systems might assist the identification and validation of novel targets and drug discovery methods. Combining specific drugs along with type-specific target inhibition of overexpressed mRNAs through siRNA approaches would enable the development of personalized therapy."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Historically, since the metabolism of administered peptide/protein drugs (\u2018biotherapeutics\u2019) has been expected to undergo predictable pathways similar to endogenous proteins, comprehensive biotherapeutic metabolism studies have not been widely reported in the literature. However, since biotherapeutics have rapidly evolved into an impressive array of eclectic modalities, there has been a shift towards understanding the impact of metabolism on biotherapeutic development. For biotherapeutics containing non-native chemical linkers and other moieties besides natural amino acids, metabolism studies are critical as these moieties may impart undesired toxicology. For biotherapeutics that are comprised solely of natural amino acids, where end-stage peptide and amino acid catabolites do not generally pose toxicity concerns, the understanding of biotherapeutic biotransformation, defined as in vivo modifications such as peripherally generated intermediate circulating catabolites prior to end-stage degradation or elimination, may impact in vivo stability and potency/clearance. As of yet, there are no harmonized methodologies for understanding biotherapeutic biotransformation and its impact on drug development, nor is there clear guidance from regulatory agencies on how and when these studies should be conducted. This review provides an update on biotherapeutic biotransformation studies and an overview of lessons-learned, tools that have been developed, and suggestions of approaches to address issues. Biotherapeutic biotransformation studies, especially for certain modalities, should be implemented at an early stage of development to: 1) understand the impact on potency/clearance, 2) select the most stable candidates or direct protein re-engineering efforts, and 3) select best bioanalytical technique(s) for proper drug quantification and subsequent pharmacokinetic profiling and exposure/response assessment."

This necessitates the ability to perform sorting and prioritization of the output data. Previously described methodologies have used functional pathways or transcriptional regulatory grouping to sort genes for further study. In this paper we demonstrate a comparative genomics based method to leverage data from animal models to prioritize genes for validation. This approach allows one to develop a disease-based focus for the prioritization of gene data, a process that is essential for systems that lack significant functional pathway data yet have defined animal models. This method is made possible through the use of highly controlled spotted cDNA slide production and the use of comparative bioinformatics databases without the use of cross-species slide hybridizations."

The potential contribution of patient reports of adverse drug reactions is discussed, both in terms of their qualitative and quantitative contribution. The crucial question is one of whether patient reports will increase the number and quality of the reports submitted and/or lead to a more timely detection of signals of possible adverse reactions, thus contributing to an enhance- ment of the existing methods of drug safety monitoring.

        "abstract": "Problems associated with pharmacotherapy (in particular, medication errors and adverse drug events) are frequent and are associated with increased costs for treatment. Analysis of original publications published between 1990 and 2005 on the topics of medication errors and/or adverse drug events in hospitalised patients, focusing on the frequency of, risk factors for and avoidance of such problems associated with pharmacotherapy, indicated that medication errors occurred in a mean of 5.7% of all episodes of drug administration, but with a high variability among the 35 studies retrieved. This variability was explained by the methods by which medication errors were detected (systematic screening of patients versus chart review or spontaneous reporting) and by the way drugs were administered (intravenously administered drugs are associated with the highest error frequencies). Errors occurred throughout the whole medication process, with administration errors accounting for more than half of all errors. Important risk factors included insufficient pharmacological knowledge of health professionals, errors in the patient charts or documentation by nurses and inadequate pharmacy services. Adverse events or reactions, on the other hand, affected 6.1 patients per 100 hospitalised and also showed a high variability among the 46 studies retrieved. This variability could also be explained by the different methods of assessment of the frequency of adverse drug events or reactions, as well as by the different wards on which the studies were performed. Important risk factors for adverse drug events or reactions included polypharmacy, female sex, drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, renal elimination of drugs, age >65 years and use of anticoagulants or diuretics. Since medication errors are strong risk factors for preventable adverse drug events or reactions, strategies have to be put in place for their reduction. Such strategies include ensuring that all persons involved in the medication process (nurses, pharmacists and physicians) have good pharmacological knowledge, computerisation of the entire medication process, and the engagement of a sufficient number of clinical pharmacists on the wards."

        "abstract": "Malaria, caused mostly by Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. Antimalarial drug toxicity is one side of the risk-benefit equation and is viewed differently depending upon whether the clinical indication for drug administration is malaria treatment or prophylaxis. Drug toxicity must be acceptable to patients and cause less harm than the disease itself. Research that leads to drug registration tends to omit two important groups who are particularly vulnerable to malaria--very young children and pregnant women. Prescribing in pregnancy is a particular problem for clinicians because the risk-benefit ratio is often very unclear. The number of antimalarial drugs in use is very small. Despite its decreasing efficacy against P. falciparum, chloroquine continues to be used widely because of its low cost and good tolerability. It remains the drug of first choice for treating P. vivax malaria. Pruritus is a common adverse effect in African patients. As prophylaxis, chloroquine is usually combined with proguanil. This combination has good overall tolerability but mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal upset are more common than with other prophylactic regimens. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is well tolerated as treatment and when used as intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant African women. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is no longer used as prophylaxis because it may cause toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens Johnson syndrome. Mefloquine remains a valuable drug for prophylaxis and treatment. Tolerability is acceptable to most patients and travellers despite the impression given by the lay press. Dose-related serious neuropsychiatric toxicity can occur; mefloquine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of epilepsy or psychiatric disease. Quinine is the mainstay for treating severe malaria in many countries. Cardiovascular or CNS toxicity is rare, but hypoglycaemia may be problematic and blood glucose levels should be monitored. Halofantrine is unsuitable for widespread use because of its potential for cardiotoxicity. There is renewed interest in two old drugs, primaquine and amodiaquine. Primaquine is being developed as prophylaxis, and amodiaquine, which was withdrawn from prophylactic use because of neutropenia and hepatitis, is a potentially good partner drug for artesunate against falciparum malaria. Atovaquone/proguanil is a new antimalarial combination with good efficacy and tolerability as prophylaxis and treatment. The most important class of drugs that could have a major impact on malaria control is the artemisinin derivatives. They have remarkable efficacy and an excellent safety record. They have no identifiable dose-related adverse effects in humans and only very rarely produce allergic reactions. Combining an artemisinin derivative with another efficacious antimalarial drug is increasingly being viewed as the optimal therapeutic strategy for malaria."

With the aid of HPLC-based activity profiling of the extract from the first batch, activity was traced to a peak subsequently identified as sanggenon G (3). The second batch had a different phytochemical profile, and HPLC-based activity profiling led to the identification of sanggenon C (4) and a stereoisomer of sanggenon D (2) as positive GABAA receptor modulators. The structurally related compound kuwanon L (1) was inactive. The sanggenons represent a new scaffold of positive GABAA receptor modulators."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "The past decade has seen increased numbers of studies publishing ligand-based computational models for drug transporters. Although they generally use small experimental data sets, these models can provide insights into structure-activity relationships for the transporter. In addition, such models have helped to identify new compounds as substrates or inhibitors of transporters of interest. We recently proposed that many transporters are promiscuous and may require profiling of new chemical entities against multiple substrates for a specific transporter. Furthermore, it should be noted that virtually all of the published ligand-based transporter models are only accessible to those involved in creating them and, consequently, are rarely shared effectively. One way to surmount this is to make models shareable or more accessible. The development of mobile apps that can access such models is highlighted here. These apps can be used to predict ligand interactions with transporters using Bayesian algorithms. We used recently published transporter data sets (MATE1, MATE2K, OCT2, OCTN2, ASBT, and NTCP) to build preliminary models in a commercial tool and in open software that can deliver the model in a mobile app. In addition, several transporter data sets extracted from the ChEMBL database were used to illustrate how such public data and models can be shared. Predicting drug-drug interactions for various transporters using computational models is potentially within reach of anyone with an iPhone or iPad. Such tools could help prioritize which substrates should be used for in vivo drug-drug interaction testing and enable open sharing of models."

Automation plays an important role in obtaining diverse sets of property data for thousands of compounds per year with short turnaround times that match discovery workflow. Key elements of automation in profiling include liquid handling, high capacity detection, and data processing and reporting.

The data pertaining to the attendance at the SSF was gathered in 2012-2013 by VANDU. By relying on this data, a mathematical model was employed to estimate the number of HCV infections prevented by the  former facility in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES). The DTES SSF's benefit-cost ratio was conservatively estimated at 12.1:1 due to its low operating cost. The study used 70% and 90% initial pipe-sharing rates for sensitivity analysis. At 80% sharing rate, the marginal HCV cases prevented were determined to be 55 cases. Moreover, at 80% sharing rate, the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio ranges from $1,705 to $97,203. The results from both the baseline and sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the establishment of the SSF by VANDU on average had annually saved CAD$1.8 million dollars in taxpayer's money. Funding SSFs in Vancouver is an efficient and effective use of financial resources in the public health domain; therefore, Vancouver Coastal Health should actively participate in their establishment in order to reduce HCV and other blood-borne infections such as HIV within the non-injecting drug users."

        "abstract": "The normal electrophysiologic behavior of the heart is determined by the integrated activity of specific cardiac ionic currents. Mutations in genes encoding the molecular components of individual cardiac ion currents have been shown to result in multiple cardiac arrhythmia syndromes. Presently, 12 genes associated with inherited long QT syndrome (LQTS) have been identified, and the most common mutations are in the hKCNQ1 (LQT1, Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome), hKCNH2 (LQT2), and hSCN5A (LQT3, Brugada syndrome) genes. Several drugs have been withdrawn from the market or received black box labeling due to clinical cases of QT interval prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. Other drugs have been denied regulatory approval owing to their potential for QT interval prolongation. Further, off-target activity of drugs on cardiac ion channels has been shown to be associated with increased mortality in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. Since clinical arrhythmia risk is a major cause for compound termination, preclinical profiling for off-target cardiac ion channel interactions early in the drug discovery process has become common practice in the pharmaceutical industry. In the present study, we report assay development for three cardiac ion channels (hKCNQ1/minK, hCa(v)1.2, and hNa(v)1.5) on the IonWorks Quattro\u2122 system. We demonstrate that these assays can be used as reliable pharmacological profiling tools for cardiac ion channel inhibition to assess compounds for cardiac liability during drug discovery."

        "abstract": "P-Glycoprotein (P-gp), the most extensively studied ATP-binding cassette transporter, functions as a biological barrier by extruding toxic substances and xenobiotics out of cells. Drug efflux pumps such as P-gp play a functional role in determining the pharmacokinetics of drugs administered by oral and parenteral routes. Determining the activity of drug efflux transport proteins has important implications in the identification of substrates and/or inhibitors. The significant role of the small intestine in reducing the oral bioavailability of drugs is due to metabolic enzymes and efflux transporters. The role of cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) and P-gp in intestinal drug disposition has been highlighted. This review examines the structure, localisation and functional role of P-gp, the mechanism of drug efflux and drug-herb interactions."

To improve such characteristics, transdermal drug delivery was brought to existence. This delivery system is capable of transporting the drug or macromolecules painlessly through skin into the blood circulation at fixed rate. Topical administration of therapeutic agents offers many advantages over conventional oral and invasive techniques of drug delivery. Several important advantages of transdermal drug delivery are prevention from hepatic first pass metabolism, enhancement of therapeutic efficiency and maintenance of steady plasma level of the drug. Human skin surface, as a site of drug application for both local and systemic effects, is the most eligible candidate available. New controlled transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) technologies (electrically-based, structure-based and velocity-based) have been developed and commercialized for the transdermal delivery of troublesome drugs. This review article covers most of the new active transport technologies involved in enhancing the transdermal permeation via effective drug delivery system."

The purpose of this process is to ensure the safety of the human volunteers. The goals of this guidance are to: (1) establish a consistent terminology for discussing the starting dose; (2) provide common conversion factors for deriving a human equivalent dose (HED); and (3) delineate a strategy for selecting the MRSD for adult healthy volunteers, regardless of the projected clinical use. This process is depicted in a flow chart that presents the decisions and calculations used to generate the MRSD from animal data (see Appendix E).

Relevant animal models are important for HCV research and development of drugs and vaccines. Chimpanzees are the best model for studies of HCV infection and related innate and adaptive host immune responses. They can be used in immunogenicity and efficacy studies of HCV vaccines. The only small animal models of robust HCV infection are T- and B- cell deficient mice with human chimeric livers. Although these mice cannot be used in studies of adaptive immunity, they have provided new insights into HCV neutralization, interactions between virus and receptors, innate host responses, and therapeutic approaches. Recent progress in developing genetically humanized mice is exciting, but these models only permit studies of specific steps in the HCV life cycle and have limited or no viral replication."

The outermost layer of the skin, the SC, is the principal barrier to topically-applied medications. The intact SC thus provides the main barrier to exogenous substances, including drugs. Only drugs with very specific physicochemical properties (molecular weight < 500\u2009Da, adequate lipophilicity, and low melting point) can be successfully administered transdermally. Transdermal delivery of hydrophilic drugs and macromolecular agents of interest, including peptides, DNA, and small interfering RNA is problematic. Therefore, facilitation of drug penetration through the SC may involve by-pass or reversible disruption of SC molecular architecture. Microneedles (MNs), when used to puncture skin, will by-pass the SC and create transient aqueous transport pathways o..."

        "abstract": "A macromolecular pro-drug of a known anti-viral agent Zidovudine (AZT) was synthesized and evaluated as a sustained drug delivery system. The pro-drug was synthesized by coupling the drug to 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) through a succinic spacer to get a monomeric drug conjugate which was polymerized to obtain the polymeric pro-drug. The pro-drug was subjected for in-vitro drug release study in buffers of pH 1.2 and 7.4. The hydrolytic stability of the pro-drug to pepsin was assessed in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 1.2) and to \u03b1-chymotrypsin in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 7.4). The results showed that the drug release from the polymeric backbone takes place in a sustained manner over a period of 24\u2009h, and the amount of drug released was comparatively higher at pH 7.4. Plasmatic hydrolysis studies of succinylzidovudine showed nearly complete release of AZT. At all pH conditions in the presence and absence of \u03b1-chymotrypsin, AZT was released preferentially in comparison with the succinyl derivative. The in-vivo release studies in rabbits after oral administration of AZT conjugate demonstrated a sustained release of parent drug over a period of 24\u2009h. The pro-drug provided a significant increase in the area under the plasma concentration time curve as compared to free drug and extended the plasma half-life from 1.06\u2009h to 8.08\u2009h. This study suggested that, after oral administration, the drug-polymer conjugate can release AZT for prolonged periods, thus improving the pharmacokinetics of AZT and decreasing the fluctuation in plasma drug levels that can lead to toxicity."

        "abstract": "Muraglitazar (Pargluva), a dual alpha/gamma peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activator, has both glucose- and lipid-lowering effects in animal models and in patients with diabetes. This study describes the in vivo and in vitro comparative metabolism of [(14)C]muraglitazar in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans by quantitative and qualitative metabolite profiling. Metabolite identification and quantification methods used in these studies included liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), LC/tandem MS, LC/radiodetection, LC/UV, and a newly described mass defect filtering technique in conjunction with high resolution MS. After oral administration of [(14)C]muraglitazar, absorption was rapid in all species, reaching a concentration peak for parent and total radioactivity in plasma within 1 h. The most abundant component in plasma at all times in all species was the parent drug, and no metabolite was present in greater than 2.5% of the muraglitazar concentrations at 1 h postdose in rats, dogs, and humans. All metabolites observed in human plasma were also present in rats, dogs, or monkeys. Urinary excretion of radioactivity was low (<5% of the dose) in all intact species, and the primary route of elimination was via biliary excretion in rats, monkeys, and humans. Based on recovered doses in urine and bile, muraglitazar showed a very good absorption in rats, monkeys, and humans. The major drug-related components in bile of rats, monkeys, and humans were glucuronides of muraglitazar and its oxidative metabolites. The parent compound was a minor component in bile, suggesting extensive metabolism of the drug. In contrast, the parent drug and oxidative metabolites were the major components in feces, and no glucuronide conjugates were found, suggesting that glucuronide metabolites were excreted in bile and hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract. The metabolites of muraglitazar resulted from both glucuronidation and oxidation. The metabolites in general had greatly reduced activity as PPARalpha/gamma activators relative to muraglitazar. In conclusion, muraglitazar was rapidly absorbed, extensively metabolized through glucuronidation and oxidation, and mainly eliminated in the feces via biliary excretion of glucuronide metabolites in all species studied. Disposition and metabolic pathways were qualitatively similar in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans."

It allows the comprehensive and simultaneous profiling of hundreds of discrete biologically important molecules, including amino acids, sugars, lipids and exogenous substances from biological fluids and tissues. Metabolomics is the 'omics' field that most represents the interplay of internal biological regulation and external environmental influences on disease, thereby being of particular importance to disease mitigation and management. Areas covered in this review: Technological advances in the experimental work flow, analytical detection strategies and bioinformatics tools have enabled metabolomics studies to become increasingly comprehensive, robust and informative for the understanding of disease, drug action and the development of biomarkers. This review will focus on the practical aspects of metabolomics studies as they have been applied to the study of mammalian biological systems, specifically targeted to the steps of experimental design with regard to sample preparation, sample analysis and data analysis of both polar and non-polar metabolites. What the reader will gain: The reader will gain an overview of the field of metabolomics as it applies to drug development and the practical issues involved with experimental design. We will discuss the various methods of sample preparation and analysis as they apply to different classes of metabolites and highlight recent advances in the field that illustrate these methods. Take home message: The field of metabolomics is a rapidly expanding discipline that is being applied to various aspects of drug development. The large diversity of metabolites found in nature dictates that different methods be developed for the investigation of different classes of metabolites. As the field of metabolomics continues to mature, it is likely that it will play an increasingly important role in the characterization of disease and the future development of biomarkers to assess drug efficacy and safety. \u00a9 2010 Informa UK Ltd."

Mechanisms of resistance that are highlighted include altered drug target, overproduction of the target protein, overproduction of substrate or ligand, increased drug-destroying mechanisms, decreased prodrug activation, new pathways that circumvent drug action, reversal of drug action, and altered drug distribution to the site of action. A separate section discusses drug synergism and various approaches used to capitalize on synergism for improved therapeutic effects or enhanced safety margin. Specific topics of drug synergism include inhibition of a drug destroying enzyme, sequential blocking, inhibition of multiple pathways, efflux pump inhibition, and use of multiple drugs for the same target."

However, we have observed cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with features of PMBL but without detectable mediastinal involvement. The goal was to assess our previously established gene expression profiling (GEP) signature for PMBL in classifying these cases. In a large series of DLBCL cases, we identified 24 cases with a GEP signature of PMBL, including 9 cases with a submission diagnosis of DLBCL consistent with PMBL (G-PMBL-P) and 15 cases with a submission diagnosis of DLBCL. The pathology reviewers agreed with the diagnosis in the 9 G-PMBL-P cases. Among the other 15 DLBCL cases, 11 were considered to be PMBL or DLBCL consistent with PMBL, 3 were considered to be DLBCL, and 1 case was a gray-zone lymphoma with features intermediate between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. All 9 G-PMBL-P and 9 of the 15 DLBCL cases (G-PMBL-M) had demonstrated mediastinal involvement at presentation. Interestingly, 6 of the 15 DLBCL cases (G-PMBL-NM) had no clinical or radiologic evidence of mediastinal involvement. The 3 subgroups of PMBL had otherwise similar clinical characteristics, and there were no significant differences in overall survival. Genetic alterations of CIITA and PDL1/2 were detected in 26% and 40% of cases, respectively, including 1 G-PMBL-NM case with gain of PDL1/2. In conclusion, PMBL can present as a nonmediastinal tumor without evidence of mediastinal involvement, and GEP offers a more precise diagnosis of PMBL."

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: As a follow-up to our previous findings that platinum drugs induce a key enzyme in polyamine catabolism, gene expression profiling and mathematical modeling were used to define the effects of cisplatin and oxaliplatin on the expression of polyamine metabolic pathway genes in A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells. METHODS: Time-course and concentration-effect experiments were each carried out with cisplatin or oxaliplatin in two separate experiments and cells subjected to gene expression profiling using Affymetrix array technology. Time-course data were modeled using exponential increase and decrease models. Concentration-effect data were modeled using a four parameter Hill model. RESULTS: Gene expression profiling of human ovarian carcinoma A2780 cells after exposure to either cisplatin or oxaliplatin indicates that the expression of several genes involved in polyamine pathway is affected by the platinum drugs. Mathematical/Statistical modeling of the data from time-course and concentration-effect experiments of gene expression from nine polyamine pathway genes represented on the HGU95Av2 chip, indicates that three biosynthetic pathway genes (SAMDC, ODC1 and SRM) are down-regulated and one catabolic pathway gene (SSAT) is up-regulated. Expression changes were similar for different probesets for a given gene on the array. Studies on the induction of SSAT by platinum drugs suggested by the Affymetrix data have been previously validated from this laboratory (Hector et al. in Mol Cancer Ther 3:813-822, 2004). Here, the effects of oxaliplatin exposure on SAMDC and ODC observed by Affymetix are validated with real time QRT-PCR. CONCLUSION: The data indicate a concerted effect of platinum drugs on the polyamine metabolic pathway with down-regulation in the expression of several enzyme genes involved in biosynthesis and many-fold up-regulation in expression of SSAT, an acetylating enzyme gene that is critically involved in polyamine catabolism and export."

        "abstract": "Ocular drug delivery remains challenging because of the complex nature and structure of the eye. Conventional systems, such as eye drops and ointments, are inefficient, whereas systemic administration requires high doses resulting in significant toxicity. There is a need to develop novel drug delivery carriers capable of increasing ocular bioavailability and decreasing both local and systemic cytotoxicity. Nanotechnology is expected to revolutionize ocular drug delivery. Many nano-structured systems have been employed for ocular drug delivery and yielded some promising results. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have been looked at as a potential drug carrier system since the 1990s. SLNs do not show biotoxicity as they are prepared from physiological lipids. SLNs are especially useful in ocular drug delivery as they can enhance the corneal absorption of drugs and improve the ocular bioavailability of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. SLNs have another advantage of allowing autoclave sterilization, a necessary step towards formulation of ocular preparations. This review outlines in detail the various production, characterization, sterilization, and stabilization techniques for SLNs. In-vitro and in-vivo methods to study the drug release profile of SLNs have been explained. Special attention has been given to the nature of lipids and surfactants commonly used for SLN production. A summary of previous studies involving the use of SLNs in ocular drug delivery is provided, along with a critical evaluation of SLNs as a potential ocular delivery system."

In this article, an attempt has been made to discuss several types of drug delivery systems that show pulsatile drug delivery characteristics. As found frequently in the living body, many vital functions are regulated by pulsed or transient release of bioactive substances at a specific site and time. Thus it is important to develop new drug delivery devices to achieve pulsed delivery of a certain amount of drugs in order to mimic the function of the living systems, while minimizing undesired side-effects. Pulsatile delivery, which is meant as the liberation of drugs following programmed lag phases, has drawn increasing interest, especially in view of emerging chronotherapeutic approaches. This review article is an attempt to discuss various design strategies, chiefly including reservoir, capsular, and osmotic formulations, and drug delivery systems which cause the pulsed or triggered release of bioactive compounds induced due to certain stimuli like thermal, electrical, and magnetic."

The preparation of the mesoporous material and its characterization by X-ray, N2 absorption-desorption isotherm, and thermogravimetry analysis have been described. Drug loading was performed by a soaking procedure. Drug-loaded matrices were characterized for entrapped drug amount, water absorption ability, and thermogravimetric behavior. Drug release studies also were performed at pH 1.1 and 6.8 mimicking gastrointestinal fluids. Experimental results showed that this type of matrix is able to trap the bioactive agents by a soaking procedure and, then, to release them in conditions mimicking the biological fluids. Also, the high affinity of these matrices for water makes them potentially biocompatible. Release data suggest that the matrix impregnated with diflunisal offers good potential as a system for the modified drug release."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevention of drug-drug interactions requires a systematic approach for which the concept of clinical risk management can be used. The objective of our study was to measure the frequency, nature and management of drug-drug interaction alerts as these occur in daily practice of Dutch community pharmacies. METHODS: In total, 63 Dutch pharmacies collected all drug-drug interaction alerts during 153 research days (on average 2.4 days/pharmacy), as well as variables related to these alerts, such as involved medicines, first time or recurrent drug-drug interaction, same or different prescribers, patient data (age, sex) and information about the management of drug-drug interactions by the pharmacy. The latter was discriminated into internal procedures only and external action, such as communication with the patient, the prescriber or the anticoagulation clinic and prescription modification. All drug-drug interactions were classified into categories of clinical relevance (A-F) and available evidence (0-4). RESULTS: A total of 43,129 prescription-only medicines were dispensed during the study period. On average, 16.8 interaction alerts per day per pharmacy were collected. Approximately 6% of all prescriptions generated a drug-drug interaction alert. Of all alerts (n = 2572), 31.1% occurred for the first time and with 21% two different prescribers were involved. The 20 most frequently occurring drug-drug interaction alerts accounted for approximately 76% of all alerts. Cardiovascular drugs, NSAIDs, oral contraceptives and antibacterials were most frequently involved. External action was taken in response to 27.3% of the alerts, meaning either a modification of one of the concerned prescriptions (n = 65; 9.3%), communication with the prescriber or anticoagulation clinic (n = 90; 12.8%) or communication with the patient or a relative (n = 547; 77.9%). Where there was no external action (n = 1860; 72.3%), pharmacists concluded in about two-thirds of cases that the drug-drug interaction had been managed in the past. Other reasons not to intervene externally were for instance: incorrect alert; acceptable drug-drug interaction; or outcome of the interaction considered irrelevant. Adjusted for several variables, a first alert was found to be a main determinant for external action. After stratifying for first alerts no other significant determinants were found. CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of drug-drug interaction alerts was found. Most concerned recurrent alerts, which were the main reason not to act externally. Concerning the assessment phase in the risk-management process, drug-drug interactions with no or low evidence/relevance should be reconsidered. Concerning the management of drug-drug interactions in pharmacies, the opportunity to actively suppress alerts for a certain period of time should be studied in more detail. There are indicators that the management of patient-orientated advice could be improved and a greater degree of consistency developed for the management of first and recurrent interaction alerts."

        "abstract": "Drug eruptions are among the most common adverse drug reactions, affecting approximately 3% of hospitalised patients. Although the rate of severe cutaneous adverse reactions to medications is low, these reactions can affect anyone who takes medication, and can result in death or disability. Two general patterns can be distinguished, depending on the type of onset of these cutaneous adverse drug reactions: acute or chronic. Acute-onset events are usually rather specific cutaneous 'syndromes' that constitute emergencies and should therefore be promptly recognised and treated, while chronic-onset events often present as dermatological diseases. The challenge is therefore to recognise the drug aetiology in front of a 'classical' dermatosis such as acne, lichen or pemphigus. Therefore, clinicians should carefully evaluate the signs or symptoms of all adverse reactions thought to be drug related, and discontinue the offending agent when feasible. Erythematous drug eruptions are the most frequent and less severe acute immune drug-induced rashes, and are sometimes difficult to differentiate from viral eruptions. On the other hand, acute urticaria and angioedema are sometimes life-threatening eruptions for which a drug aetiology must be investigated. Photosensitivity, vasculitis and skin necrosis belong to the acute onset reactions, which are not always drug-induced, in contrast to fixed drug eruptions. The early recognition of acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis, DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are of high importance because of the specific mechanisms involved and the different prognosis of each of these diseases. Chronic onset drug-induced disorders include pigmentary changes, drug-induced autoimmune bullous diseases, lupus, pseudo lymphoma and acneiform eruptions; these are discussed, along with specific data on drug-induced hair and nail disorders. As the disorders are numerous, the mechanisms and the drugs involved in the development of these various reactions are multiple. The list of drugs discussed in relation to the different disorders are as accurate as possible at the time of preparation of this review, but will need updating as new drugs emerge onto the market. We emphasize the clinical recognition, pathophysiology and treatment of skin, hair and nail adverse drug reactions, and the role of each doctor involved in the management of these patients in the notification of the adverse drug reaction to health authorities, using the minimal requirement for notification proposed."

Drawing on interviews with online dating users in Canada and from media analysis of women\u2019s \u2018women-seeking-men\u2019 profiles posted on popular online dating sites, we analyse these data in terms of the discursive and material practices required to \u2018become\u2019 and perform heterosexuality within the public spaces of cyberdating. Our broad aim is to show some of the ways in which online dating as a technology and sociality affects, through everyday practices, the production of heterosexual subjectivity as an ongoing process through the life course. More specifically, we argue that \u2018heterosexual profiling\u2019, a term that refers to the exigency of online dating to make obvious an otherwise unmarked identity emptied of sexual agency and desire, presents particular challenges for women in what is seen as a dating market for the young. Therefore, online dating and the myriad routine everyday activities required to be successful in finding a suitable man entailed a simultaneous negotiation of sexuality and negotiation of ageing for this group of women, who found both pleasure and restriction in their forays online."

        "abstract": "Nephrotoxicity is an inherent adverse effect of certain anticancer drugs. Renal dysfunction can be categorised as prerenal uraemia, intrinsic damage or postrenal uraemia according to the underlying pathophysiological process. Renal hypoperfusion promulgates prerenal uraemia. Intrinsic renal damage results from prolonged hypoperfusion, exposure to exogenous or endogenous nephrotoxins, renotubular precipitation of xenobiotics or endogenous compounds, renovascular obstruction, glomerular disease, renal microvascular damage or disease, and tubulointerstitial damage or disease. Postrenal uraemia is a consequence of clinically significant urinary tract obstruction. Clinical signs of nephrotoxicity and methods used to assess renal function are discussed. Mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced renal dysfunction generally include damage to vasculature or structures of the kidneys, haemolytic uraemic syndrome and prerenal perfusion deficits. Patients with cancer are frequently at risk of renal impairment secondary to disease-related and iatrogenic causes. This article reviews the incidence, presentation, prevention and management of anticancer drug-induced renal dysfunction. Dose-related nephrotoxicity subsequent to administration of certain chloroethylnitrosourea compounds (carmustine, semustine and streptozocin) is commonly heralded by increased serum creatinine levels, uraemia and proteinuria. Additional signs of streptozocin-induced nephrotoxicity include hypophosphataemia, hypokalaemia, hypouricaemia, renal tubular acidosis, glucosuria, aceturia and aminoaciduria. Cisplatin and carboplatin cause dose-related renal dysfunction. In addition to increased serum creatinine levels and uraemia, electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypomagnesaemia and hypokalaemia, are commonly reported adverse effects. Rarely, cisplatin has been implicated as the underlying cause of haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Pharmaceutical antidotes to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity include amifostine, sodium thiosulfate and diethyldithiocarbamate. Dose- and age-related proximal tubular damage is an adverse effect of ifosfamide. In addition to renal wasting of electrolytes, glucose and amino acids, Fanconi syndrome, rickets and osteomalacia have occurred with ifosfamide treatment. High dose azacitidine causes renal dysfunction manifested by tubular acidosis, polyuria and increased urinary excretion of electrolytes, glucose and amino acids. Haemolytic uraemia is a rare adverse effect of gemcitabine. Methotrexate can cause increased serum creatinine levels, uraemia and haematuria. Acute renal failure is reported following administration of high dose methotrexate. Urinary alkalisation and hydration confer protection against methotrexate-induced renal dysfunction. Dose-related nephrotoxicity, including acute renal failure, are reported subsequent to treatment with pentostatin and diaziquone. Acute renal failure is a rare adverse effect of treatment with interferon-alpha. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome occurs with mitomycin administration. A mortality rate of 50 to 100% is reported in patients developing mitomycin-induced haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Capillary leak syndrome occurring with aldesleukin therapy can cause renal dysfunction. Infusion-related hypotension during infusion of high dose carmustine can precipitate renal dysfunction."

Drugs are a common cause of either asymptomatic or symptomatic hypokalaemia. Drug-induced hypokalaemia is an important problem particularly in the elderly and in patients with cardiovascular, renal or hepatic disease. Hypokalaemia can complicate the use of the drug in the therapeutic concentration range, and can also be precipitated with overdose or conditions leading to drug intoxication. Because the etiologies of hypokalaemia are numerous, the diagnosis of drug-induced hypokalaemia may be overlooked. Physicians should always pay close attention to this common side effect. Evaluation and management of a hypokalaemic patient should include a careful review of medications history to determine if a drug capable of causing or aggravating this electrolyte abnormality is present."

        "abstract": "We report clinicopathologic features of a large series of renal translocation carcinomas from a multicentric study. Diagnosis was performed by cytogenetic examination of fresh material and/or by immunochemistry with antibodies directed against the C-terminal part of transcription factor E3 (TFE3) and native transcription factor EB (TFEB) proteins. Clinical data, follow-up, and histologic features were assessed. Antibodies against CK7, CD10, vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen, AE1-AE3, E-cadherin, alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase, melan A, and HMB45 were tested on tissue microarrays. Whole-genome microarray expression profiling was performed on 4 tumors. Twenty-nine cases were diagnosed as TFE3 and 2 as TFEB renal translocation carcinomas, including 13 males and 18 females, mean age 24.6 years. Two patients had a previous history of chemotherapy and 1 had a history of renal failure. Mean size of the tumor was 6.9 cm. Thirteen cases were > or = pT3 stage. Twelve cases were N+ or M+. Mean follow-up was 29.5 months. Three patients presented metastases and 5 have died. Mixed papillary and nested patterns with clear and/or eosinophilic cells represented the most consistent histologic appearance, with common foci of calcifications regardless of the type of translocation. Using a 30 mn incubation at room temperature, TFE3 immunostainings were positive in only 82% of our TFE3 translocation carcinomas. Both TFE3 and TFEB renal translocation carcinomas expressed CD10 and alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase in all cases. An expression of E-cadherin was observed in two-third of cases. Cytokeratins were expressed in less than one-third of cases. Melanocytic markers were expressed at least weakly in all cases except two. Unsupervised clustering on the basis of the gene expression profiling indicated a distinct subgroup of tumors. TRIM 63 glutathione S-transferase A1 and alanyl aminopeptidase are the main differentially expressed genes for this group of tumors. Our results suggest that these differentially expressed genes may serve as novel diagnostic or prognostic markers."

Embryonal carcinoma cells, on the contrary, are stem cells derived from teratomas that give rise to teratocarcinomas and differentiated tissues quite similar to ESCs. What is the difference? Compare the proteomes. Out of 1800 proteins identified and quantitated by Chaerkady et al., roughly 200 showed at least a two-fold difference in abundance by iTRAQ. Among the proteins expressed at high levels in ESCs were factors involved in pluripotency and development. A number of the highly expressed proteins in the ESCs have been found in other systems associated with malignancies.pp. 1359-1373 TALKING TO ITSELF: A CELL MANAGES ITS ADHESION OPTIONS: I once slept on a pillow that squeaked and crunched every time I moved my head. The old chicken feathers just did not want to quit. Perhaps they were plotting where to put the next lump. Cells have a complex system for deciding when to stay or go. Adhesive interactions between cells are critical to development, wound healing and inflammation, etc. They are modulated by membrane receptors that interact with intra- and extracellular ligands. Friedrichs et al. have developed quantitative means to look at how different adhesion receptors on the same cell interact. Using an atomic force microscope, the cantilever is coated with the primary adhesive ligand and the slide with a secondary ligand. A cell to be tested is allowed to attach to the cantilever, then put in contact with the test surface. Analysis of the force-distance profile reveals the presence or absence of communication between the two receptors.pp. 1455-1462 RETRO RECORD SPINNER REVEALS RESIDENCE WITH NURD: DJ-1 was one of those drifters, very often drifting onto the wrong side of the cancer line to be invited to reputable recreation more than once in any tissue. Then, a couple of research posses got her in their sights. What a sight she was when she cleaned up her act. Opsahl et al., using a full set of proteomic tools, found that DJ-1 was a bit of a firefighter (oxidative stress); part-time nurse (staving off death by p53 and daunorubicin); and NuRD master (involved in control of acetylation and deacetylation of proteins by changes in affinity of NuRD complex). The authors characterize DJ-1 as a two-edged sword, able to cut or protect friends and enemies. There are still more lessons to be learned from the number 1 DJ.pp. 1494-1504."

The reversible complexation process of Fe\n                        3+ ions is associated with conformational changes of the three-dimensional structure of the transferrin. This conformational dynamics is attributed to a partial unfolding of the N-lobe of the protein and could be described as a transition between the holo to the apo forms of the transferrin. The aim of the present work is to demonstrate the unprecedented ability of the transferrin to solubilize various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in physiological solution and to explore the impact of these materials on the structure and functionality of the transferrin. The synthesis and characterization of novel materials, consisting of complexes between human transferrin and hydrophobic high-carbon-content compounds, is reported here for the first time. Furthermore, it is shown that the preparation of these complexes from holo-transferrin leads to an irreversible loss of the ferric ions from the protein. Analytical studies of these novel complexes may shed a light on the mechanism by which transferrin could lose its ability to bind and thus to transport and store iron. These findings clearly demonstrate a possible damaging impact of various hydrophobic pollutants, which can enter an organism by inhalation or ingestion, on the functionality of the transferrin. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

The benefit of early antiretroviral (ARV) therapy started within 12 weeks of life is well documented. Although the development of new drug classes give alternative options for highly treatment experienced patients there is inadequate pharmacokinetic knowledge regarding the already established ARV classes in infants and children. Also, there are many practical challenges to administering these agents to children. METHOD AND RESULTS: The challenges of current widely available treatment regimens in the light of new vertical transmission prevention guidelines are discussed. The dynamic physiological changes affecting pharmacokinetics in infancy and childhood are reviewed. New antiretroviral drugs in the established drug classes are presented. The new drug classes of entry inhibitors (including co-receptor binding inhibitors and fusion inhibitors), integrase inhibitors and other novel drug classes under development are described and relevant pediatric studies are reviewed. Work on novel drug delivery systems with potential to enhance adherence, improve drug exposure and reduce side-effects are discussed. CONCLUSION: The established benefits of ARV therapy in children of all ages can be enhanced by appropriate pharmacokinetic data on established antiretroviral agents and child-friendly drug formulations. Besides new suppressive treatment options in treatment experienced patients with multi-class resistant virus the new drug classes provide potential for novel means of disease modification and reduction of vertical transmission. Novel drug classes and delivery systems in development provide potential for further reduction in vertical transmission of HIV, rapid virological suppression and improved neurological outcomes in children and adults."

        "abstract": "A tandem mass spectrometric investigation of the collision-induced dissociation of five commonly prescribed psychoactive pharmaceuticals, risperidone, sertraline, paroxetine, trimipramine, and mirtazapine, and their metabolites has been carried out. Quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry was employed to generate tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) data of the compounds under investigation and structural assignments of product ions were supported by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. These fragmentation studies were then utilised in the development of a liquid chromatographic method to identify the drugs and their metabolites in human hair and saliva samples, thus providing relevant profiling information."

The preparation of the mesoporous material and its characterization by X-ray, N2 absorption-desorption isotherm, and thermogravimetry analysis have been described. Drug loading was performed by a soaking procedure. Drug-loaded matrices were characterized for entrapped drug amount, water absorption ability, and thermogravimetric behavior. Drug release studies also were performed at pH 1.1 and 6.8 mimicking gastrointestinal fluids. Experimental results showed that this type of matrix is able to trap the bioactive agents by a soaking procedure and, then, to release them in conditions mimicking the biological fluids. Also, the high affinity of these matrices for water makes them potentially biocompatible. Release data suggest that the matrix impregnated with diflunisal offers good potential as a system for the modified drug release."

Early profiling of drug like properties provides important information in order to screen out insoluble, poorly absorbed and toxic compounds. Today, large compound libraries have to be screened, and of course the total number of compounds will rise over the next years leading to a growing demand for fully automated assays. A balance between quality, speed, throughput, cost and information content can be accomplished by the careful selection of assays and experimental conditions. Here we describe a novel 384 well format assay for two important ADME related descriptors (lipophilicity and serum protein binding) as input parameters for a precise prediction of fraction absorbed, blood/organ distribution coefficients and permeability, in order to maximize the information about a compound at an early stage of discovery."

The most challenging aspect of drug development has been the failure of therapeutics in expensive Phase II or III trials, and this is most commonly due to lack of efficacy. More can be done during the drug discovery phase to optimize efficacy-testing in animal models by expending resources to explore the congruence of the animal model with the human disease. Historically, relatively little attention has been paid to validation of these models, but access to molecular mRNA and genetic profiling offers a new lens through which the similarity of these disease models to human diseases can be examined and their utility for exploring therapeutic efficacy can be optimized. Exploring congruent experimental end points in clinical and preclinical experiments will also increase confidence of success in late phase clinical development. The expense of this investment is trivial compared to the costs of a failed clinical trial, more than justifying this endeavor."

        "abstract": "In the last decades, advances in molecular biology have led to modern pharmacogenetics, which started as a science that focused on investigating drug metabolising enzymes and genetic determinants of pharmacokinetic variability. As more evidence has become available on the structure of drug targets and the genes coding for them, increasing attention has been directed towards pharmacodynamic explanations of variability in therapeutic response as well as in the risk for adverse drug reactions. Traditionally, genetic drug safety research has focused on variations in single genes whose functions are known to be related to given adverse drug reactions. A few such examples, malignant hyperthermia, the long QT syndrome, venous thromboembolic disease, tardive dyskinesia, and drug addiction, are presented in this article. In the future, results from the Human Genome Project together with tools such as DNA microarray technology, high-output screening systems and advanced bioinformatics, will permit a more thorough elucidation than is currently possible of the genetic components of adverse drug reactions. By screening for a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SNP patterns associated with adverse drug reactions can be discovered even though the functions of the SNPs as such are completely unknown. On the basis of these findings, it can be expected that pharmacogenetic research will identify situations where a drug should be avoided in certain individuals in order to reduce the risk for adverse drug reactions. If so, it will be feasible to use molecular diagnostics to select drugs that are safe for the individual patient"

This review deals with recent progress in molecular and functional research on drug transporters, and then with transporter-mediated drug interactions in absorption and secretion from the intestine, secretion from the kidney and liver, and transport across the blood-brain barrier in humans. Although the participation of the particular transporters in observed drug-drug interactions can be difficult to confirm in humans, this review focuses mainly on pharmacokinetic interactions of clinically important drugs."

The therapeutic index (TI) - which is typically considered as the ratio of the highest exposure to the drug that results in no toxicity to the exposure that produces the desired efficacy - is an important parameter in efforts to achieve this balance. Various types of safety and efficacy data are generated in vitro and in vivo (in animals and in humans), and these data can be used to predict the clinical TI of a drug candidate at an early stage. However, approaches to systematically and quantitatively compare these types of data and to apply this knowledge more effectively are needed. This article critically discusses the various aspects of TI determination and interpretation in drug development for both small molecule drugs and biotherapeutics."

In recent years, there has been little federal interest in drug policy reform and a continuing focus on a prohibitionist deterrence approach. During this period, state initiatives have been in the forefront of drug policy experimentation via ballot initiatives, legislative actions, or judicial and administrative policy decisions. The resulting state-level drug policy landscape includes continued prohibition as well as harm reduction, medicalization, and decriminalization. In addition, there has been considerable state-level policy focus on substance abuse treatment quality. With a new presidential administration, there is some indication that drug policy reform may be a national issue as part of the federal health reform agenda. The authors hope that the results of state policy experiments that provide evidence for the viability of harm reduction, quality treatment, and related approaches can be a viable part of the national policy discussion."

Depending on type of drug, dosage and patient susceptibility, hair loss presents as telogen effluvium, anagen effluvium or both. Telogen effluvium is also commonly observed after discontinuation of drugs that prolong anagen, such as topical minoxidil and oral contraceptives. Although a large number of drugs have been occasionally reported to produce hair loss, only for a few drugs the relation between drug intake and hair loss has been proven."

        "abstract": "Although current immunosuppressive protocols have dramatically decreased acute rejection episodes, there has been less progress in terms of long-term graft survival after kidney transplantation over the last 2 decades. The key to reducing the damage to a transplanted organ as caused by chronic processes is early detection. Modern screening technologies in the fields of genetics, genomics, protein profiling (proteomics), and biochemical profiling (metabolomics) have opened new opportunities for the development of sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. Metabolic profiling appears to be a promising strategy because changes in the cell biochemistry are ultimately responsible for the histologic and pathophysiologic changes of the transplanted kidney and are most likely already detectable before histologic and pathophysiologic changes occur. Using truly no-targeted screening technologies as clinical diagnostic tools is not yet feasible, mostly because of the complexity of the data generated and the lack of algorithms to convert this information into clinically applicable information. A realistic and powerful targeted approach is the development of combinatorial biomarkers. These are biomarker patterns that typically consist of five or more individual parameters. Combined biomarker patterns confer significantly more information than a single measurement and, thus, can be expected to have better specificity and sensitivity. A series of studies in rats and healthy individuals evaluating the effects of immunosuppressants on urine metabolite patterns showed that immunosuppressant-induced changes of metabolite patterns in urine were associated with a combination of changes in glomerular filtration, changes in secretion/absorption by tubulus cells, and changes in kidney cell metabolism. These studies suggested that a combination of biomarkers that can be used for toxicodynamic therapeutic drug monitoring of immunosuppressants should include urine metabolites that constitute valid surrogate markers of these kidney functions."

        "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions account for between 2 to 5% of all hospital admissions and can prevent the administration of an otherwise effective therapeutic agent. Hypersensitivity or immune-mediated reactions, although less common, tend to be proportionately more serious. There is convincing evidence to implicate the immune system in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions. Our understanding of the way in which the immune system recognises drugs is based on the hapten hypothesis; the onset of hypersensitivity involves drug bioactivation, covalent binding to proteins, followed by uptake, antigen processing and T cell proliferation. Central to this hypothesis is the critical role of drug metabolism, with the balance between metabolic bioactivation and detoxification being one important component of individual susceptibility. The purpose of this review is to classify drug hypersensitivity reactions in terms of their clinical presentation, and also to consider recent advances in our understanding of the chemical, biochemical and, in particular, cellular immunological mechanisms of hypersensitivity. The following topics are reviewed: (i) drug disposition and cellular metabolism; (ii) mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation; (iii) the role of cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules in the induction and maintenance of a polarised immune response; and (iv) the application of the hapten hypothesis, danger hypothesis and serial triggering model to drug hypersensitivity. A greater understanding of the mechanism(s) of hypersensitivity may identify novel therapeutic strategies and help to combat one of the more severe forms of adverse reactions to drugs.

        "abstract": "The requirements for a cell surface molecule to be suitable as an antibody-drug conjugate target are stringent. The notion that antibodies-directed toward targets on the surface of malignant cells could be used for drug delivery is not new. The history of antibody-drug conjugates has been marked by hurdles identified and overcome. Early conjugates used mouse antibodies, drugs that were either not sufficiently potent, were immunogenic (proteins) or were too toxic and linkers that were not sufficiently stable in circulation. Three main avenues have been explored using antibodies to target cytotoxic species to malignant cells, antibody-protein toxin conjugates (or antibody fragment-protein toxin fusion proteins), antibody-small molecule drug conjugates and antibody-enzyme conjugates administered along with small molecule prodrugs requiring metabolism by the conjugated enzyme to release the activate species. This review focuses on cell surface proteins that have been targeted primarily by antibody-small molecule drug conjugates and briefly discusses 34 targets being investigated. While only one antibody-drug conjugate has reached regulatory approval, there are nearly 20 of these in clinical trial. The time may have come for this technology to become a major contributor to improving treatment for cancer patients."

        "abstract": "Despite the availability of the BCG vaccine and chemotherapy, tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading infectious killer worldwide. The recent rise of TB and especially the alarming increase of drug-resistant TB call for urgent need to develop new anti-TB drugs. Lengthy chemotherapy and increasing emergence of drug-resistant strains pose a significant problem for effective control. The need for a lengthy TB therapy is a consequence of the presence of persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, not effectively killed by current anti-TB agents. A list of new drug candidates along with proposed targets for intervention is described. Recent advances in the knowledge of the biology of the organism and the availability of the genome sequence provide a wide range of novel targets for drug design. Gene products involved in controlling vital aspects of mycobacterial metabolism, persistence, virulence and cell wall synthesis would be attractive targets. It is expected that the application of functional genomics tools, such as microarray and proteomics, in combination with modern approaches, such as structure-based drug design and combinatorial chemistry to biology-based targets, will lead to the development of new drugs that are not only active against drug-resistant TB but also can shorten the course of TB therapy."

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative diseases are incurable debilitating disorders of the nervous system that affect approximately 30 million people worldwide. Despite profuse efforts attempting to define the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, many aspects of these pathologies remain elusive. The novelty of their mechanisms represents a challenge to biology, to their related biomarkers identification and drug discovery. Because of their multifactorial aspects and complexity, gene expression analysis platforms have been extensively used to investigate altered pathways during degeneration and to identify potential biomarkers and drug targets. AREAS COVERED: This work offers an overview of the gene expression profiling studies carried out on Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and prion disease specimens. Therapeutic approaches are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Although many therapeutic approaches have been tested, some of them acting on several altered cellular pathways, no effective cures for these neurodegenerative diseases have been identified. Microarray technology must be associated with functional proteomics and physiology in an effort to identify specific and selective biomarkers and druggable targets, thus allowing the successful discovery of disease-modifying therapeutic treatments."

        "abstract": "Complex interactions exist amongst the various components of the neuroendocrine system in order to maintain homeostasis, energy balance and reproductive function. These components include the hypothalamus-pituitary- adrenal and -gonadal axes, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the sympathetic nervous system and the pancreatic islets. These hormones, peptides and neurotransmitters act in concert to regulate the functions of many organs, notably the liver, muscles, kidneys, thyroid, bone, adrenal glands, adipocytes, vasculature, intestinal tract and gonads, through many intermediary pathways. Endocrine and metabolic disorders can arise from imbalance amongst numerous hormonal factors. These disturbances may be due to endogenous processes, such as increased secretion of hormones from a tumour, as well as exogenous drug administration. Drugs can cause endocrine abnormalities via different mechanisms, including direct alteration of hormone production, changes in the regulation of the hormonal axis, effects on hormonal transport, binding, and signalling, as well as similar changes to counter-regulatory hormone systems. Furthermore, drugs can affect the evaluation of endocrine parameters by causing interference with diagnostic tests. Common drug-induced endocrine and metabolic disorders include disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, electrolyte and calcium abnormalities, as well as drug-induced thyroid and gonadal disorders. An understanding of the proposed mechanisms of these drug effects and their evaluation and differential diagnosis may allow for more critical interpretation of the clinical observations associated with such disorders, better prediction of drug-induced adverse effects and better choices of and rationales for treatment."

        "abstract": "Colon targeted drug delivery has the potential to deliver bioactive agents for the treatment of a variety of colonic diseases and to deliver proteins and peptides to the colon for their systemic absorption. Various strategies, currently available to target the release of drugs to colon, include formation of prodrug, coating of pH-sensitive polymers, use of colon-specific biodegradable polymers, timed released systems, osmotic systems, and pressure controlled drug delivery systems. Among the different approaches to achieve targeted drug release to the colon, the use of polymers especially biodegradable by colonic bacteria holds great promise. Polysaccharidases are bacterial enzymes that are available in sufficient quantity to be exploited in colon targeting of drugs. Based on this approach, various polysaccharides have been investigated for colon-specific drug release. These polysaccharides include pectin, guar gum, amylose, inulin, dextran, chitosan, and chondroitin sulphate. This family of natural polymers has an appeal to drug delivery as it is comprised of polymers with a large number of derivatizable groups, a wide range of molecular weights, varying chemical compositions, and, for the most part, low toxicity and biodegradability yet high stability. The most favorable property of these materials is their approval as pharmaceutical excipients."

        "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions appear during the clinical use of a drug and constitute a health problem, as they are an important cause of patient morbidity and mortality. In addition, they constitute a major drawback for drug development. Intolerance processes occurring after administration of low drug doses are known as idiosyncratic reactions or as hypersensitivity reactions; the most commonly accepted mechanism for immunological activation is the hapten hypothesis. Most drugs are not reactive per se towards proteins, hence in a number of cases bioactivation seems to be a prerequisite for adduct formation and the subsequent hypersensitivity reaction. Although biotransformation is normally associated with a decreased toxicity, metabolites are sometimes more toxic and reactive than the parent drug. Drug metabolizing enzymes develop their activities especially in liver, where reactive metabolites bind to proteins inducing hepatotoxicity, whereas in skin keratinocytes exhibit the highest biotransformation capability. In the present review, some specific examples of the toxicological consequences of drug biotransformation are given. They include nimesulide, metamizol, celecoxib, paracetamol, dapsone, sulfamethoxazole, amodiaquine, nevirapine, troglitazone, zileuton, felbamate, panadiplon, benzbromarone, fipexide and flutamide. In general, these examples are taken from the recent scientific literature, mostly published during the last decade."

We have surveyed the etymology, usages, and previous definitions of 'surveillance' and its modifiers, such as 'active' and 'passive'. The following essential definitional features of surveillance emerge: (i) surveillance and monitoring are different--surveillance involves populations, while monitoring involves individuals; (ii) surveillance can be performed repeatedly and at any time during the lifetime of a medicinal product or device; (iii) although itself non-interventional, it can adduce any types of evidence (interventional, observational, or anecdotal, potentially at different times); (iv) it encompasses data collection, management, analysis, and interpretation; (v) it includes actions to be taken after signal detection, including initial evaluation and communication; and (vi) it should contribute to the classification of adverse reactions and their prevention or mitigation and/or to the harnessing of beneficial effects. We conclude that qualifiers add ambiguity and uncertainty without enhancing the idea of surveillance. We propose the following definition of surveillance of health-care products, which embraces all the surveyed ideas and reflects real-world pharmacovigilance processes: 'a form of non-interventional public health research, consisting of a set of processes for the continued systematic collection, compilation, interrogation, analysis, and interpretation of data on benefits and harms (including relevant spontaneous reports, electronic medical records, and experimental data).' As a codicil, we note that the purposes of surveillance are to identify, evaluate, understand, and communicate previously unknown effects of health-care products, or new aspects of known effects, in order to harness such effects (if beneficial) or prevent or mitigate them (if harmful)."

In evaluating the pathological changes, the pathologist should carefully define the pattern(s) of injury so that the pathological differential diagnosis can be used to guide further workup or to compare with reported patterns of drug injury. Using this approach, the liver biopsy can become a powerful diagnostic tool in complex cases of drug-induced liver disease."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Many drugs that are used to treat children are either not licensed for use in paediatric patients (unlicensed) or prescribed outside the terms of the product licence (off label). The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of such drugs is yet to be established. This study investigates, for the first time in a German patient population, the impact of unlicensed and off-label drug use on ADRs in paediatric patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An 8-month prospective pharmacoepidemiological cohort-based survey was conducted on a ten-bed paediatric isolation ward at the University Hospital Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. All patients were intensively monitored for ADRs by a pharmacoepidemiological team. ADRs were characterised according to international classification methods. All drug prescriptions were evaluated retrospectively as to unlicensed or off-label use on the basis of the product information. RESULTS: A total of 178 patients were included in the study and 740 drug prescriptions were given to 156 patients (median three prescriptions per patient). In 198 cases (27.7% of all prescriptions) drugs were used in either an unlicensed (n = 3) or off-label (n = 195) manner. A total of 46 ADRs were observed in 31 patients (17.4%). Patients receiving at least one unlicensed or off-label drug prescription during hospitalisation (n = 92) experienced an ADR significantly more frequently (n = 26 patients) than patients receiving only licensed drugs (n = 64 vs 5 patients). ADRs were associated with 29 (5.6%) of the 517 licensed drug prescriptions and with 12 (6.1%) of the 198 unlicensed or off-label drug prescriptions. The majority of ADRs caused by unlicensed and off-label drug use were recognised by the attending physician. However, statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in the number of licensed and unlicensed/off-label drug prescriptions causing ADRs. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that at a paediatric isolation ward the incidence of ADRs caused by unlicensed or off-label drug use was not significantly more than that caused by the licensed drug use. However, patients treated with unlicensed or off-label drugs were shown to possess a significantly increased risk for developing ADRs."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Drug interactions in patients receiving multiple drug regimens are a constant concern for the clinician. With the increased availability of new drugs and their concomitant use with other drugs, there has been a rise in the potential for adverse drug interactions as demonstrated by the recent withdrawals of newly marketed drugs because of unacceptable interaction profiles. Therefore, the interaction potential of a new compound has to be assessed in detail, starting with preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies at candidate selection and continuously followed up through preclinical and clinical development. Since formal in vivo studies of all possible drug interactions are neither practicable nor suggestive, a careful selection of a limited number of drug combinations to be investigated in vivo during the development phase is indicated. Based on knowledge of pharmacokinetic and biopharmaceutical properties, a well balanced link between in vitro investigations and carefully selected in vivo interaction studies allows full assessment of the potential of a new drug to cause clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions, prediction of a lack of interactions and derivation of the proper dose recommendations. Clinical pharmacology plays a number of key roles within the process of collecting information on drug interactions during preclinical and clinical development: addressing issues and/or favourable properties to be expected, thus contributing to the scientific assessment of development potential; setting up a rational in vivo drug-drug interaction programme; performing early mechanistic studies to link in vitro with in vivo information (employing \u2018cocktail\u2019 approaches if possible); reviewing co-medication sections for clinical trials; and conducting labelling-oriented interaction studies after proof of concept. The fact that interactions can occur between various active substances should by itself be a conclusive argument against unnecessary polypharmacy. Prescribing fewer drugs on a rational basis can reduce the risk of adverse effects secondary to drug interactions and may help to improve the quality of drug treatment and to save costs."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the increasing number of expression profiling technologies, researchers today are confronted with choosing the technology that has sufficient power with minimal sample size, in order to reduce cost and time. These depend on data variability, partly determined by sample type, preparation and processing. Objective measures that help experimental design, given own pilot data, are thus fundamental. RESULTS: Relative power and sample size analysis were performed on two distinct data sets. The first set consisted of Affymetrix array data derived from a nutrigenomics experiment in which weak, intermediate and strong PPARalpha agonists were administered to wild-type and PPARalpha-null mice. Our analysis confirms the hierarchy of PPARalpha-activating compounds previously reported and the general idea that larger effect sizes positively contribute to the average power of the experiment. A simulation experiment was performed that mimicked the effect sizes seen in the first data set. The relative power was predicted but the estimates were slightly conservative. The second, more challenging, data set describes a microarray platform comparison study using hippocampal deltaC-doublecortin-like kinase transgenic mice that were compared to wild-type mice, which was combined with results from Solexa/Illumina deep sequencing runs. As expected, the choice of technology greatly influences the performance of the experiment. Solexa/Illumina deep sequencing has the highest overall power followed by the microarray platforms Agilent and Affymetrix. Interestingly, Solexa/Illumina deep sequencing displays comparable power across all intensity ranges, in contrast with microarray platforms that have decreased power in the low intensity range due to background noise. This means that deep sequencing technology is especially more powerful in detecting differences in the low intensity range, compared to microarray platforms. CONCLUSION: Power and sample size analysis based on pilot data give valuable information on the performance of the experiment and can thereby guide further decisions on experimental design. Solexa/Illumina deep sequencing is the technology of choice if interest lies in genes expressed in the low-intensity range. Researchers can get guidance on experimental design using our approach on their own pilot data implemented as a BioConductor package, SSPA http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SSPA.html."

Recent advancements in 'omics sciences, and in particular metabonomics, has enabled some elucidation or insights into toxicological sequelae. Metabonomics is a global metabolic profiling framework which utilizes high resolution analytics (typically NMR and mass spectrometry) together with chemometric statistical tools (such as principal component analysis and partial least squares) to derive an integrated picture of both endogenous and xenobiotic metabolism.

Although many covalent inhibitors have been approved or are in advanced clinical trials to treat indications such as cancer and hepatitis C, there is a general tendency to avoid them as drug candidates because of concerns regarding immune-mediated toxicity that can arise from indiscriminate reactivity with off-target proteins. AREAS COVERED: The review examines potential reason(s) for the excellent safety record of marketed covalent agents and advanced clinical candidates for emerging therapeutic targets. A significant emphasis is placed on proteomic techniques and chemical/biochemical reactivity assays that aim to provide a systematic rank ordering of pharmacologic selectivity relative to off-target protein reactivity of covalent inhibitors. EXPERT OPINION: While tactics to examine selective covalent modification of the pharmacologic target are broadly applicable in drug discovery, it is unclear whether the output from such studies can prospectively predict idiosyncratic immune-mediated drug toxicity. Opinions regarding an acceptable threshold of protein reactivity/body burden for a toxic electrophile and a non-toxic electrophilic covalent drug have not been defined. Increasing confidence in proteomic and chemical/biochemical reactivity screens will require a retrospective side-by-side profiling of marketed covalent drugs and electrophiles known to cause deleterious toxic effects via non-selective covalent binding."

        "abstract": "Rapid determination of in vitro metabolic stability and metabolite profiling of new chemical entities using microsomes or other liver preparations is one of the most important steps in drug discovery. In this paper, we report the use of liquid chromatography-hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometry for the simultaneous analysis of metabolic stability, metabolite profiling, and the kinetics of metabolite formation of praziquantel and three structural analogs. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scans were used to quantify the disappearance of parent compounds and the formation of metabolites. MRM-information dependent acquisition-enhanced product ion (MRM-IDA-EPI) scans were used for the identification of the metabolites formed. Metabolic stability of these anthelmintics were studied in human liver microsomes (HLM) using MRM as a survey scan, which resulted in the identification of a higher number of metabolites compared to neutral loss (NL), precursor ion (PI), and enhanced mass spectrometry (EMS) scans. MRM-IDA-EPI scans resulted in the generation of similar calibration curves to MRM-only quantitative analysis. Therefore, the quantitative capabilities of the method was not affected by the additional qualitative information obtained during the same run. The formation of major metabolites was also simultaneously monitored, which could be used to understand the kinetics and mechanism of metabolite formation. Finally, our data demonstrate that the three analogs had higher metabolic stability than the anthelmintic prototype (praziquantel)."

        "abstract": "The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing rapidly, as are the associated co-morbidities. Consequently, it has become necessary for a diabetic patient to take multiple medications at the same time to delay progression of the disease. This can put patients at an increased risk of moderate to severe drug interactions, which may threaten patients' life or may deteriorate the quality of their life. Hence, managing drug-drug interactions is the cornerstone of anti-diabetic therapy. Most of the clinically important drug-drug interactions of anti-diabetic agents are related to their metabolic pathways, but drugs that compete for renal excretion or impair renal status can also play an important role. In this review, we have examined the clinical implications and underlying mechanisms of drugs that are likely to alter the pharmacologic response of or cause adverse events with antidiabetic drugs, and we have outlined safe and efficacious treatment modalities."

In addition, the failure of preclinical toxicology to predict idiosyncratic reactions, and what can be done to improve this problem, is discussed. Finally, our current understanding of the pathophysiology of experimental drug hepatotoxicity is examined, focusing on acetaminophen, particularly with respect to the role of the innate immune system and control of cell-death pathways, which might provide targets for exploration and identification of risk factors and mechanisms in humans."

Although there are therapies for treating glaucoma, as well as ongoing clinical trials of treatments for age-related macular degeneration, there still is a great need for more efficacious treatments that halt or even reverse ocular diseases. The eye has special attributes that allow local drug delivery and non-invasive clinical assessment of disease, but it is also a highly complex and unique organ, which makes understanding disease pathogenesis and ocular drug discovery challenging. As we learn more about the cellular mechanisms involved in age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, potentially, new drug targets will emerge. This review provides insight into some of the new approaches to therapy."

Pregnant women enrolled in a comprehensive treatment program with drug-free (n=85) or drug-using (n=82) male sexual partners completed a relationship survey and were compared on partner and psychosocial variables. Compared with male drug-free partners, male drug-using partners had more unemployment and more current legal involvement, less education, were less likely to be supportive of the pregnant woman's recovery efforts and were more likely to give them money to buy drugs. Male drug-free partners also had fewer medical, dental, legal and transportation needs than male drug-using partners. Data from treatment retention suggests that women with male drug-using partners are retained in a comprehensive treatment for a shorter time than women with male drug-free partners. A male partner's drug-using status should be considered when treating pregnant drug dependent women. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

        "abstract": "The evolution of scientific information relating to the regulation of xenobiotic disposition has extended to the discovery of an intricate group of receptor systems now recognized as master regulators. These ligand-activated transcription factors are commonly designated as \"nuclear receptors\", and include CAR (NR1I3), PXR (NR1I2), PPAR (NR1C1, NR1C2, and NR1C3) and AhR (HLHE76). As regulators of gene expression, activation of these receptors can elicit a plethora of drug-drug interactions. The aforementioned nuclear receptors bind a wide range of structurally-unrelated ligands, such as steroid hormones, bile acids, and small drug-type molecules. A pivotal nuclear receptor with regards to regulation of drug-drug interactions is the pregnane X receptor (PXR). Gene expression profiling has demonstrated that PXR regulates over 60 human genes that are involved not only in physiological functions but also in the metabolism of xenobiotics. Moreover, chemical library screening suggests that about 10% of the compounds comprising the U. S. Food and Drug Administration 1 and 2, Sigma-Aldrich LOPAC collection, Biomol, and Tocris/TimTec bioactive collection libraries exhibit some form of PXR binding. For these reasons, efficient, rapid and economical systems have been developed to identify nuclear receptor ligands. Cell-based assays encompassing transiently and stably-transfected cells and mammalian two-hybrid systems are currently being employed by the pharmaceutical industry to screen compounds for binding to and/or activation of nuclear receptors. Overall, these systems have the ability to predict in vivo responses to receptor activation that culminate in drug-drug interactions and adverse drug effects."

With major cytochrome P450 structures identified and characterized recently, structure-based drug metabolism prediction becomes increasingly attractive. In silico methods based on molecular and quantum mechanics such as docking, molecular dynamics and ab initio chemical reactivity calculations bring us closer to understand drug metabolism and predict drug-drug interactions.

However, in recent years as a result of improved understanding of seizure neurochemistry and mechanisms of action of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), drug treatment has become somewhat more rational. Nevertheless, it is currently impossible to predict which patient will respond to a particular AED, and which patient will experience adverse drug effects. The only practical way to determine whether a patient will find a drug useful is to try it. The discovery of genetic polymorphism in drug metabolism has contributed significantly to understanding of the variability in dose-concentration relationships, susceptibility to adverse effects, and susceptibility to seizure intractability. The discovery that predisposition to seizure intractability and expression of brain neuromolecules consequent to seizures is under genetic control may allow a more rational approach to AED choice. In the future, treatment may be guided by a series of pharmacogenetic tests, which would serve not only to choose the most appropriate AED (in terms of efficacy and adverse effects) but also to monitor the antiepileptogenic and the evolution status of the disease."

While a definitive in vivo study demonstrating the potential of this methodology for predicting response to chemotherapy is presently lacking, the ability of microarrays to distinguish other subtleties of colon cancer phenotype, as well as recent in vitro proof-of-principle experiments utilizing colon cancer cell lines, illustrate the potential of this methodology for predicting the probability of response to specific chemotherapeutic agents.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mortality and morbidity are increased in patients experiencing drug-drug interactions. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of literature describing clinically significant drug-drug interactions occurring in the intensive care unit (ICU). Knowing the clinically significant drug-drug interactions allows the opportunity for prevention through knowledge and computer-assisted programmes. OBJECTIVE: To identify significant potential drug-drug interactions occurring in the cardiovascular ICU (CCU) and the cardiothoracic ICU (CTICU). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational study conducted over a total of 8 weeks in February and March 2009. SETTING: CCU and CTICU in a major academic medical centre (Presbyterian Hospital, University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre). PATIENTS: All adult patients (>or=18 years of age) admitted during 1 month in each ICU. INTERVENTION: Micromedex and Lexi-Interact interaction databases were used to screen each patient's medication profile daily for the presence of potentially interacting drug pairs that would be considered a potential drug-drug interaction. A severity assessment using these databases was completed after a potential drug-drug interaction was identified. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: The frequency of significant drug-drug interactions, including those that were considered major or contraindicated, according to two commercially available interaction databases. RESULTS: Evaluations of 400 patient medication profiles were conducted, resulting in 225 profiles possessing one or more potential drug-drug interactions. A total of 1150 potential interactions were identified, resulting in 287.5 potential interactions per 100 patient-days. Of the 1150 potential drug-drug interactions, 458 were unique interacting drug pairs; 5-9% of the potential interactions were considered major or contraindicated. Many of the significant and frequent potential interactions involved blood coagulation modifiers, potential interactions that could result in QTc prolongation, and cytochrome P450 inhibition. Micromedex and Lexi-Interact agreed on the severity ratings in 20.5% of the potential interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Significant potential drug-drug interactions occur in the CCU and CTICU, highlighting the need for active surveillance to potentially prevent patient harm. Clinicians should also consider using two references for identifying interactions, due to the lack of congruence between sources."

        "abstract": "Organised criminality is a great concern for national/international security. The demonstration of complex crimes is increasingly dependant on knowledge distributed within law-enforcement agencies and scientific disciplines. This separation of knowledge creates difficulties in reconstructing and prosecuting such crimes. Basic interdisciplinary research in drug intelligence combined with crime analysis, forensic intelligence, and traditional law enforcement investigation is leading to important advances in crime investigation support. Laboratory results constitute one highly dependable source of information that is both reliable and testable. Their operational use can support investigation and even provide undetected connections or organisation of structure. The foremost difficulties encountered by drug analysts are not principally of a chemical or analytical nature, but methodologies to extract parameters or features that are deemed to be crucial for handling and contextualising drug profiling data. An organised memory has been developed in order to provide accurate, timely, useful and meaningful information for linking spatially and temporally distinct events on a national and international level (including cross-border phenomena). Literature has already pointed out that forensic case data are amenable for use in an intelligence perspective if data and knowledge of specialised actors are appropriately organised, shared and processed. As a particular form of forensic case data, the authors' research focuses on parameters obtained through the systematic physical and chemical profiling of samples of illicit drugs. The procedure is used to infer and characterise links between samples that originate from the same and different seizures. The discussion will not, however, focus on how samples are actually analysed and compared as substantial literature on this topic already exists. Rather, attention is primarily drawn to an active and close collaboration between magistrates, forensic scientists, law enforcement investigators and crime analysts from different institutions with the aim of generating, using and validating relevant profiling case data as integral part of investigative and crime analysis processes. Original advances are highlighted through experiences from criminal investigations of offences related to the unlawful importation, exportation, supply and possession of illicit drugs. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Thus, elucidating which drug entities are substrates for ABC drug transporters is a crucial step in the drug development and treatment process. Here, we review the current status of methodology used to categorize drug compounds as substrates or modulators for the major ABC drug transporters including ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2."

Three expert workgroups were assembled to address the goals of the conference. The Evidence Workgroup consisted of 18 individuals with expertise in pharmacology, drug information, biomedical informatics, and clinical decision support. Workgroup members met via webinar 12 times from January 2013 to February 2014. Two in-person meetings were conducted in May and September 2013 to reach consensus on recommendations.\\n\\nRESULTS: We developed expert consensus answers to the following three key questions. (i) What is the best approach to evaluate DDI evidence? (ii) What evidence is required for a DDI to be applicable to an entire class of drugs? (iii) How should a structured evaluation process be vetted and validated?\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Evidence-based decision support for DDIs requires consistent application of transparent and systematic methods to evaluate the evidence. Drug compendia and clinical decision support systems in which these recommendations are implemented should be able to provide higher-quality information about DDIs."

Analyses of gene functions and pathways reveal that the levels of significant numbers of genes involving drug metabolism were changed and that the pathways involving xenobiotics metabolism, Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response, mitochondrial functions and others, were altered. Our results indicate that kava extract can significantly modulate drug metabolizing enzymes, potentially leading to herb-drug interactions and hepatotoxicity."

Drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters present in extrahepatic tissues, such as nasal mucosa and the respiratory tract, have been particularly discussed. As marketed antiallergic drugs include both racemates and enantiomers, aspects of stereoselective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion have been discussed. Finally, a new and promising methodology, microdosing, has been presented, although it has not yet been applied to drugs used in the treatment of allergic diseases."

Therapeutic limitations also exist for the use of the highly effective antibiotic gentamicin, as it evokes acute renal failure. Mechanistic investigations have shed some light on potential targets: the kallikreins, peroxynitrite-related pathways, superoxide production and the accumulation of aminoglycosides. New antibiotic strategies for trachoma, the leading cause of preventable blindness, are also explored along with studies to aid the development of vaccine candidates.

Drugs can be administered either as suspensions or as solutions and the formulation can range in complexity from a gel or an ointment to a multilayer transdermal patch. In this review we describe the theoretical principles used to describe transdermal release and we show that relatively simple membrane transport models based on the appropriate solution to Fick's second law of diffusion can be used to explain drug release kinetics into this complex biological membrane."

Modern liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode serves as the foundation for accurate simultaneous multi-analyte quantitation across large sample sets to provide high-quality information on target molecular profiles in complex systems. Despite the intrinsic multiplexing potential of the LC-MRM-MS technique, the key bottleneck in current LC-MRM-based assays is generally the limited analyte coverage and throughput capacity. Nowadays, the MRM-based approach has emerged as an attractive strategy for quantitative proteomic analysis and high-throughput biomarker discovery. So far, the full potential of the contemporary LCMRM methodology unleashed for quantitative metabolite profiling and metabolomic measurements of non-peptidic small molecules is rarely discussed. In this review we attempt to provide an overview on the major recent developments in LC-MRM-based strategies for quantitative profiling of multi- and non-target small molecules in biological samples. This article highlights the utility and power of the LC-MRM-based targeted approaches as valuable bioanalytical tools for low-cost, multiplexed quantitation on a large scale, with special emphasis on the promise of combining various strategies for expanding coverage and throughput of the LC-MRM-based assays to cover the gap between a widely targeted profiling and large-scale unknown screening towards comparative or quantitative metabolomics. General issues raised in metabolite profiling, such as basic aspects of bioanalysis, methodological dilemmas and challenges in quantitative metabolomics are addressed, and different strategies to circumvent the existing bottleneck and potential pitfalls of the current LC-MRM-MS techniques are outlined. In addition, the rudiments of LC-MRM-MS and its recent applications in combination with such strategies for biomarker quantitation and verification is also described."

It arises from the mathematical problem called \u2018curse of dimensionality,\u2019 which is due to the small number of samples available in training sets, used for calculating transcriptional signatures from the large number of differentially expressed (DE) genes, measured by microarrays. The new generation of causal reasoning algorithms can provide solutions to the curse of dimensionality by transforming microarray data into activity of a small number of cancer hallmark pathways. This new approach can make feature space dimensionality optimal for mathematical signature calculations.Areas covered: The author reviews the reasons behind the current frustration with transcriptional signatures derived from DE genes in cancer. He also provides an overview of the novel methods for signature calculations based on differentially variable genes and expression regulators. Furthermore, the authors provide perspectives on causal reasoning algorithms that use prior knowledge about regulatory events described in scientific literature to identify expression regulators responsible for the differential expression observed in cancer samples.Expert opinion: The author advocates causal reasoning methods to calculate cancer pathway activity signatures. The current challenge for these algorithms is in ensuring quality of the knowledgebase. Indeed, the development of cancer hallmark pathway collections, together with statistical algorithms to transform activity of expression regulators into pathway activity, are necessary for causal reasoning to be used in cancer research."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "The chapter focuses on various pathways that positively and negatively regulate the cell death process in response to anticancer-drug induced damage. Currently used anticancer drugs simultaneously activate several pathways that either positively or negatively regulate cell death induction. The main pathway from specific damage induced by these drugs to apoptosis involves activation of caspases in the cytosol by proapoptotic molecules, such as cytochrome c, released from the mitochondria under the control of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Anticancer drugs modulate this pathway by modifying the expression of Bcl-2 proteins, their activity, and their subcellular localization. Anticancer drugs can also up-regulate the expression of death receptors, such as Fas (APO-1/CD95) and TRAIL receptors, and sensitize tumor cells to their cognate ligands. The Fas\u2013FasL interaction could amplify early steps of drug-induced apoptosis while up-regulation of TRAIL receptors offers the opportunity for a synergistic administration of an anticancer drug and TRAIL. In addition, anticancer drugs activate in tumor cells several lipid-dependent signal transduction pathways that either increase or decrease their ability to die by apoptosis. Better understanding of apoptotic pathways and their modulation by various negative and positive signals simultaneously activated by anticancer agents may prove particularly valuable in cancer therapy. Proteins involved in cell death regulation could be used as new targets for anticancer drugs, and simultaneous signals may be manipulated to increase the efficacy of classical anticancer drugs and radiation."

We applied the methodology to the profiling of clinically approved drugs, resulting in the identification of previously known and unknown drug-protein interactions. In particular, we were able to identify off-targets for erlotinib and atorvastatin, as well as an enzyme target for the anti-inflammatory drug sulfasalazine. We demonstrate that sulfasalazine and its metabolites, sulfapyridine and mesalamine, are inhibitors of the enzyme catalyzing the final step in the biosynthesis of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin. The interference with tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism provides an explanation for some of the beneficial and deleterious properties of sulfasalazine and furthermore suggests new and improved therapies for the drug. This work thus establishes a powerful approach for drug profiling and provides new insights in the mechanism of action of clinically approved drugs."

However, the cochlea is a particularly challenging target for drug therapy, and new technologies will be required to provide safe and efficacious delivery of these compounds. Emerging delivery systems based on microfluidic technologies are showing promise as a means for direct intracochlear delivery. Ultimately, these systems may serve as a means for extended delivery of regenerative compounds to restore hearing in patients suffering from a host of auditory diseases. Areas covered: Recent progress in the development of drug delivery systems capable of direct intracochlear delivery is reviewed, including passive systems such as osmotic pumps, active microfluidic devices and systems combined with currently available devices such as cochlear implants. The aim of this article is to provide a concise review of intracochlear drug delivery systems currently under development and ultimately capable of being combined with emerging therapeutic compounds for the treatment of inner ear diseases. Expert opinion: Safe and efficacious treatment of auditory diseases will require the development of microscale delivery devices, capable of extended operation and direct application to the inner ear. These advances will require miniaturization and integration of multiple functions, including drug storage, delivery, power management and sensing, ultimately enabling closed-loop control and timed-sequence delivery devices for treatment of these diseases."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "In vitro metabolite profiling and characterization experiments are widely employed in early drug development to support safety stud- ies. Samples from incubations of investigational drugs with liver microsomes or hepatocytes are commonly analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for detection and structural elucidation of metabolites. Advanced mass spectrometers with accurate mass capabilities are becoming increasingly popular for characterization of drugs and metabolites, spurring changes in the routine workflows applied. In the present study, using a generic full-scan high-resolution data acquisition approach with a time-of- flight mass spectrometer combined with postacquisition data min- ing, we detected and characterized metabonates (false metabo- lites) in microsomal incubations of several alkylamine drugs. If a targeted approach to mass spectrometric detection (without full- scan acquisition and appropriate data mining) were employed, the metabonates may not have been detected, hence their formation underappreciated. In the absence of accurate mass data, the metabonate formation would have been incorrectly characterized because the detected metabonates manifested as direct cyanide- trapped conjugates or as cyanide-trapped metabolites formed from the parent drugs by the addition of 14 Da, the mass shift commonly associated with oxidation to yield a carbonyl. This study demonstrates that high-resolution mass spectrometry and the as- sociated workflow is very useful for the detection and character- ization of unpredicted sample components and that accurate mass data were critical to assignment of the correct metabonate struc- tures. In addition, for drugs containing an alkylamine moiety, the results suggest that multiple negative controls and chemical trap- ping agents may be necessary to correctly interpret the results of in vitro experiments."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Renal metabolism by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes is central to the clearance of many drugs. However, significant discrepancies about the relative abundance and activity of individual UGT enzymes in the normal kidney prevail among reports, whereas glucuronidation in tumoral kidney has not been examined. In this study, we performed an extensive profiling of glucuronidation metabolism in normal (n = 12) and tumor (n = 14) kidneys using targeted mass spectrometry quantification of human UGTs. We then correlated UGT protein concentrations with mRNA levels assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and with conjugation activity for the major renal UGTs. Beyond the wide interindividual variability in expression levels observed among kidney samples, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, and UGT1A6 are the most abundant renal UGTs in both normal and tumoral tissues based on protein quantification. In normal kidney tissues, only UGT1A9 protein levels correlated with mRNA levels, whereas UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 quantification correlated significantly with their mRNA levels in tumor kidneys. Data support that posttranscriptional regulation of UGT2B7 and UGT1A6 expression is modulating glucuronidation in the kidney. Importantly, our study reveals a significant decreased glucuronidation capacity of neoplastic kidneys versus normal kidneys that is paralleled by drastically reduced UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 mRNA and protein expression. UGT2B7 activity is the most repressed in tumors relative to normal tissues, with a 96-fold decrease in zidovudine metabolism, whereas propofol and sorafenib glucuronidation is decreased by 7.6- and 5.2-fold, respectively. Findings demonstrate that renal drug metabolism is predominantly mediated by UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 and is greatly reduced in kidney tumors."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer, the most common form of cancer among women in North America and almost all of Europe, is a significant health problem in terms of both morbidity and mortality. It is estimated that each year this disease is diagnosed in over one million people worldwide and is the cause of more than 400,000 deaths. Although chemotherapy forms part of a successful treatment regime in many cases, as few as 50% patients may benefit from this, as a result of intrinsic or acquired multiple drug resistance (MDR). Through the use of in vitro cell culture models, a number of mechanisms of MDR have been identified; many, if not all, of which may contribute to breast cancer resistance in the clinical setting. This phenomenon is complicated by the likely multi-factorial nature of clinical resistance combined with the fact that, although apparently studied extensively in breast cancer, reported analyses have been performed using a range of analytical techniques; many on small sub-groups of patients, with different clinicopathological characteristics and receiving a range of therapeutic approaches. Larger defined studies, using standardised genomic and proteomics profiling approaches followed by functional genomics studies, are necessary in order to definitively establish the degree of complexity contributing to drug resistance and to identify novel therapeutic approaches - possibly involving chemotherapy, drug resistance modulators, and novel targeted therapies - to combat this disease."

        "abstract": "High-throughput compound screening is time and resource consuming, and considerable effort is invested into screening compound libraries, profiling, and selecting the most promising candidates for further testing. Active-learning methods assist the selection process by focusing on areas of chemical space that have the greatest chance of success while considering structural novelty. The core feature of these algorithms is their ability to adapt the structure-activity landscapes through feedback. Instead of full-deck screening, only focused subsets of compounds are tested, and the experimental readout is used to refine molecule selection for subsequent screening cycles. Once implemented, these techniques have the potential to reduce costs and save precious materials. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the various computational active-learning approaches and outline their potential for drug discovery."

We consider that drug is released continually by diffusion that is influenced by polymer chain degradation, and polymer matrix erosion starts and enhances the drug release at a certain time. The models give excellent reproduction of drug release profiles within the whole release period, and the parameters can be correlated to various factors such as gamma-irradiation dose, copolymer composition, and initial drug loading, this correlation indicates that the new models can be used to predict the effects of various factors on drug release profiles based on limited experimental data."

        "abstract": "Orlistat, an anti-obesity drug, is a potent and specific inhibitor of intestinal lipases. In light of the recent US FDA approval of the over-the-counter sale of orlistat (60 mg three times daily), clinicians need to be aware that its use may be associated with less well known, but sometimes clinically relevant, adverse effects. More specifically, the use of orlistat has been associated with several mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as oily stools, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and faecal spotting. A few cases of serious hepatic adverse effects (cholelithiasis, cholostatic hepatitis and subacute liver failure) have been reported. However, the effects of orlistat on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are beneficial. Orlistat-induced weight loss seems to have beneficial effects on blood pressure. No effect has been observed on calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, copper or zinc balance or on bone biomarkers. Interestingly, the use of orlistat has been associated with rare cases of acute kidney injury, possibly due to the increased fat malabsorption resulting from the inhibition of pancreatic and gastric lipase by orlistat, leading to the formation of soaps with calcium and resulting in increased free oxalate absorption and enteric hyperoxaluria. Orlistat has a beneficial effect on carbohydrate metabolism. No significant effect on cancer risk has been reported with orlistat.Orlistat interferes with the absorption of many drugs (such as warfarin, amiodarone, ciclosporin and thyroxine as well as fat-soluble vitamins), affecting their bioavailability and effectiveness. This review considers orlistat-related adverse effects and drug interactions. The clinical relevance and pathogenesis of these effects is also discussed."

Drug courts have moved from providing diversion programs for first-time offenders charged with drug possession to developing tracks for more complex clients. Many of these new drug court participants have extensive criminal histories, including histories of violent crime. Drug court decision-makers thus confront the difficulty of balancing the needs of treatment versus corrections by attempting to target offenders whose criminal histories suggest that their candidacy in a drug court would not pose a risk to public safety. To date, little is known about whether drug courts are appropriate for offenders with lengthy criminal histories that often include violence. The research presented here explores correlates of drug court graduation for seriously crime- involved offenders, most of whom have a history of violence."

However, evaluation findings have been less than consistent with respect to the ability of drug courts to have the desired impact on drug use and criminal behavior. This National Inst on Drug Abuse funded paper reviews the literature describing the growth, operations, and evaluations of drug courts. It concludes that, contrary to most \"models,\" drug courts emphasize punishment (e.g., graduated sanctions) and make limited positive, or at least inconsistent, use of reinforcement to promote behavior change and abstinence from drug use. Contingency management techniques that involve the systematic application of reinforcement based on the performance of specified behaviors are presented and reviewed. The success of this model in promoting pro-social behavior and abstinence from illicit drug use suggests that drug courts could benefit substantially from the integration of contingency management-based interventions.

Here, we reconcile apparently contradictory previous reports into a comprehensive survey, and propose a consensus number of current drug targets for all classes of approved therapeutic drugs. One striking feature is the relatively constant historical rate of target innovation (the rate at which drugs against new targets are launched); however, the rate of developing drugs against new families is significantly lower. The recent approval of drugs that target protein kinases highlights two additional trends: an emerging realization of the importance of polypharmacology, and also the power of a gene-family-led approach in generating novel and important therapies."

        "abstract": "Cambodia's first-line artemisinin combination therapy, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), is no longer sufficiently curative against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria at some Thai-Cambodian border regions. We report recent (2008 to 2013) drug resistance trends in 753 isolates from northern, western, and southern Cambodia by surveying for ex vivo drug susceptibility and molecular drug resistance markers to guide the selection of an effective alternative to DHA-PPQ. Over the last 3 study years, PPQ susceptibility declined dramatically (geomean 50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] increased from 12.8 to 29.6 nM), while mefloquine (MQ) sensitivity doubled (67.1 to 26 nM) in northern Cambodia. These changes in drug susceptibility were significantly associated with a decreased prevalence of P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 gene (Pfmdr1) multiple copy isolates and coincided with the timing of replacing artesunate-mefloquine (AS-MQ) with DHA-PPQ as the first-line therapy. Widespread chloroquine resistance was suggested by all isolates being of the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene CVIET haplotype. Nearly all isolates collected from the most recent years had P. falciparum kelch13 mutations, indicative of artemisinin resistance. Ex vivo bioassay measurements of antimalarial activity in plasma indicated 20% of patients recently took antimalarials, and their plasma had activity (median of 49.8 nM DHA equivalents) suggestive of substantial in vivo drug pressure. Overall, our findings suggest DHA-PPQ failures are associated with emerging PPQ resistance in a background of artemisinin resistance. The observed connection between drug policy changes and significant reduction in PPQ susceptibility with mitigation of MQ resistance supports reintroduction of AS-MQ, in conjunction with monitoring of the P. falciparum mdr1 copy number, as a stop-gap measure in areas of DHA-PPQ failure."

PARTICIPANTS 69 patients infected with HIV between June 1994 and August 2000. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prevalence of key mutations associated with drug resistance in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes of HIV-1, by year of infection. RESULTS Between June 1994 and August 2000, 10 (14%) of 69 newly infected patients had one or more key HIV-1 mutations associated with drug resistance. The risk of being infected with drug resistant virus increased over time (adjusted relative risk per year 1.74 (95% confidence interval 0.93 to 3.27), P=0.06). The estimated prevalence of drug resistance in those infected in 2000 was 27% (12% to 48%). CONCLUSIONS Transmission of drug resistant HIV-1 in the United Kingdom seems to be increasing. New approaches to encourage safer sexual behaviour in all sectors of the population are urgently needed."

        "abstract": "This chapter presents a brief overview of how new drug discovery projects begin, some of the science and business decisions that go into them, what types of projects researchers can expect to see, and how targets are identified and validated. Projects tend to have some commonalities that allow most of them to be divided up into several bins, if the bins are made large enough.. The term target validation can mean different things to different people. To a chemist proposing a new project it might refer to affirmative evidence from a mouse knockout or even just an RNA interference experiment in cells. To a clinician it probably means no less than proven statistically significant efficacy by a drug in large-scale, controlled human trials. Target validation, that is, systematically building up evidence that the interaction of a proposed target with an agent like a small molecule or a monoclonal antibody (mAB) can have a therapeutic effect in a human disease state, is often far from trivial. It represents an ongoing, labor-intensive process that can be rate-limiting, but is necessary to avoid disastrous losses in time, money, and manpower that occur when a clinical drug fails to work because its target is not at all crucial to disease progression or symptoms. Target identification, in this case the process whereby a new target is first proposed based on some minimal evidence, is less cumbersome but still requires devoted resources. The beauty of working on a project based upon an already established target is that both of these steps can be skipped."

However, drug-induced AF (DIAF) receives little attention. Thus, this review is an attempt to attract the attention on this adverse effect. AREAS COVERED: Published reports of drug-induced AF (DIAF) are reviewed in this paper, from January 1974 to December 2011, using the PubMed/Medline database and lateral references. EXPERT OPINION: In most cases, DIAF is paroxysmal and terminates spontaneously, but sometimes AF persists and it is necessary to perform a cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm and avoid progression to persistent AF. Because of the short duration of DIAF, in addition to physicians/patients not being knowledgeable about this side effect, the real incidence and clinical consequences of DIAF are presently unknown. DIAF is an increasing problem, as some widely prescribed drugs can present this adverse effect. The risk is expected to increase in the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. It is important that physicians understand the significance of DIAF, to increase the collaboration between cardiac and non-cardiac professionals, and to educate patients to make them aware of this adverse side effect."

The combined use of herbs and drugs has increased the possibility of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the combined use of herbs and drugs can enhance or attenuate the drug efficacy and toxicity. The herb-drug combinations may reduce a drug efficacy and lead to treatment failure when long-term administration. Case reports detailing serious clinical adverse reactions have promoted studies on the interactions between herbs and drugs. This review highlights recent knowledge to discuss herb-drug interactions involving metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. Drug transporters are widely present in body and play an important role in the absorption, distribution, excretion and metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity of drugs. Investigation of transporters has developed rapidly since 1990s, the effects of many transporters on the pharmacokinetics of drugs and herb-drug interactions have been reported. Some concepts on drug transporters issued experimentally and clinically drug-drug and herb-drug interactions have applied in many studies. Methodology studies are very important for understanding the mechanism, considerations and evaluation of experiments and clinical studies on drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters in drug-drug interactions."

        "abstract": "Background: Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, excluding heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, is a rare adverse drug reaction for which the evidence about frequency, relative risk and risk factors mainly originates from case reports and case studies. This study aims to quantify the risk for thrombocytopenia following exposure to drugs that are most often reported to cause thrombocytopenia in the general population. Methods: A retrospective, case-control study was conducted within the PHARMO record linkage system. Cases were defined as patients hospitalised for thrombocytopenia in the period 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2002. For each case, up to four controls were matched based on age, sex and geographical area. Exposure on the index date to anticonvulsants, \u03b2-lactam antibacterials, cinchona alkaloids, disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), diuretics, NSAIDs, sulfonamide antibacterials and tuberculostatics was assessed and categorised into mutually exclusive groups of current, recent, past and non-use. The risk was quantified with multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis. Results: The study population comprised 705 cases and 2658 controls. Current use of \u03b2-lactam antibacterials was associated with an increased risk for thrombocytopenia (adjusted odds ratio 7.4, 95% CI 1.8, 29.6). Increased risk estimates, although not significant, were found for current exposure to DMARDs and the sulfonamide antibacterial cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). No increased risk was found for anticonvulsants, cinchona alkaloids, diuretics, NSAIDs or tuberculostatics. Conclusion: More evidence for an increased risk for thrombocytopenia in current use of \u03b2-lactam antibacterials in the general population was provided. The expected increase in risk could not be confirmed for the other drugs investigated, which is possibly a result of the limited statistical power. Future studies including more patients and with laboratory data should confirm our findings before drawing definite conclusions. \u00a9 2006 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Drug-induced anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions have increased in frequency with more widespread use of pharmaceutical agents. Anaphylaxis is a systemic, severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction caused by immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated immunological release of mediators of mast cells and basophils. An anaphylactoid reaction is an event similar to anaphylaxis but is not mediated by IgE. The incidence of anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions differs amongst classes of medications. Antibacterials are the most usual offenders, and penicillins are the most studied. Other compounds commonly causing reactions include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anaesthetics, muscle relaxants, latex and radiocontrast media. Prevention, if possible, is the purpose of detailed patient history taking and physical examination. Simple strategies can be employed to decrease the risk of anaphylaxis. These include consideration of the route of drug administration, identification of patients with known causes of anaphylaxis, and the knowledge that certain medications cross react and are contraindicated in those with known history of anaphylaxis. Tests are available, and include IgE-specific skin tests and radioallergosorbent tests. Penicillins are the only compounds whose antigenic determinants are well documented, it is therefore difficult to determine the negative predictive value of other compounds tested. Oral challenge remains an alternative, though entails risk. Desensitisation procedures, as well as gradual dose escalation protocols, are available and can be implemented based on patient history and diagnostic testing. The management of anaphylaxis is based on control of the airway, breathing and circulation. Treatment consists of epinephrine (adrenaline) and supportive measures. Rapid diagnosis and intervention are important in these life-threatening reactions. After stabilisation, all individuals with a documented history of anaphylaxis require a Medic-Alert bracelet or necklace, and an identification card for their wallet or purse."

        "title": "Under-Reporting of Adverse Drug Reactions",
        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "The purpose of this review was to estimate the extent of under-reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to spontaneous reporting systems and to investigate whether there are differences between different types of ADRs. A systematic literature search was carried out to identify studies providing a numerical estimate of under-reporting. Studies were included regardless of the methodology used or the setting, e.g. hospital versus general practice. Estimates of under-reporting were either extracted directly from the published study or calculated from the study data. These were expressed as the percentage of ADRs detected from intensive data collection that were not reported to the relevant local, regional or national spontaneous reporting systems. The median under-reporting rate was calculated across all studies and within subcategories of studies using different methods or settings. In total, 37 studies using a wide variety of surveillance methods were identified from 12 countries. These generated 43 numerical estimates of under-reporting. The median under-reporting rate across the 37 studies was 94% (interquartile range 82-98%). There was no significant difference in the median under-reporting rates calculated for general practice and hospital-based studies. Five of the ten general practice studies provided evidence of a higher median under-reporting rate for all ADRs compared with more serious or severe ADRs (95% and 80%, respectively). In comparison, for five of the eight hospital-based studies the median under-reporting rate for more serious or severe ADRs remained high (95%). The median under-reporting rate was lower for 19 studies investigating specific serious/severe ADR-drug combinations but was still high at 85%. This systematic review provides evidence of significant and widespread under-reporting of ADRs to spontaneous reporting systems including serious or severe ADRs. Further work is required to assess the impact of under-reporting on public health decisions and the effects of initiatives to improve reporting such as internet reporting, pharmacist/nurse reporting and direct patient reporting as well as improved education and training of healthcare professionals."

        "abstract": "Our previous report showed that L754.394 and valspodar (PSC833) are potent inhibitors of midazolam hydroxylation in human jejunum microsomes and vectorial transport of vinblastine in Caco-2 cells, respectively. In the present study, to directly examine the interactions of these compounds as well as other substrates with CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), we performed in vitro inhibition studies using recombinant CYP3A4-expressed microsomes and an MDR1-transfected cell line, LLC-MDR1, respectively. In CYP3A4-expressed microsomes, both L754.394 and ketoconazole, at a concentration less than 0.5 microM, are the most potent inhibitors of the formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam, a major metabolite of midazolam formed by CYP3A4. The greatest inhibitory effect on the transcellular transport of digoxin in LLC-MDR1 cells was observed in the presence of valspodar (<0.1 microM), followed by verapamil. From a comparison of the IC(50) values, it was shown that L754.394 and valspodar exhibited the highest selectivity for CYP3A4 and P-gp, respectively. To demonstrate such specificity, both midazolam hydroxylation and digoxin transport were observed in CYP3A4 transfected Caco-2 cells, which coexpress both P-gp and CYP3A4, in the presence or absence of L754.394 (0.5 microM) and valspodar (1.0 microM). L754.394 almost completely inhibited midazolam hydroxylation, but not digoxin transport, whereas almost complete inhibition of digoxin transport was observed in the presence of valspodar, but inhibition of the hydroxylation was minimal. Thus, the present study has demonstrated that L754.394 has a specific inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, whereas valspodar is specific for P-gp."

The objective was to employ latent class analysis (LCA) to empirically categorize and extract potential typologies of poly-substance users within a multi-site cohort of illicit opioid and other drug users (OPICAN) in Canada, and examine potential associations with social and health indicators. Drug use patterns of 582 participants from the most recent follow-up (2005) of the cohort study-focusing on drug use prevalence indicators in the past 30 days-were empirically analyzed via LCA. These classes were further examined for associations with social and health variables using chi-square, ANOVA. Binomial logistic regression models were used to predict class membership. LCA analysis resulted in eight distinct user typologies, characterized both by the distinct relative prevalence of different substances (e.g., including: heroin, prescription opioids, benzodiazepines, cocaine, crack, alcohol, cannabis, and others) used and administration routes (e.g., injection or noninjection), the majority of which were described by the predominant use of two or more distinct substance groups (e.g., opioids and stimulants). At least two of the active poly-substance user classes were described by predominant noninjection as the primary route of administration. 'Poor or fair' health status was reported at the highest prevalence level by the class of intensive poly-substance injectors, while HCV-positive status was disproportionately low in the classes of current noninjectors. Analytical examination of poly-substance use patterns is a distinct challenge for meaningful drug use monitoring, also providing important evidence for targeted prevention and treatment interventions."

However, the BBB is not simply a physical barrier, but a complex interface that is in intimate communication with the rest of the central nervous system (CNS) and influenced by peripheral tissues. This review examines three aspects of the BBB in AD. First, it considers how the BBB may be contributing to the onset and progression of AD. In this regard, the BBB itself is a therapeutic target in the treatment of AD. Second, it examines how the BBB restricts drugs that might otherwise be useful in the treatment of AD and examines strategies being developed to deliver drugs to the CNS for the treatment of AD. Third, it considers how drug penetration across the AD BBB may differ from the BBB of normal aging. In this case, those differences can complicate the treatment of CNS diseases such as depression, delirium, psychoses, and pain control in the AD population."

        "abstract": "Natural products have long been regarded as excellent sources for drug discovery given their structural diversity and wide variety of biological activities. Accordingly, the identification of the molecular targets of natural products is an important aspect of current drug discovery, as knowledge regarding a compound's molecular targets will greatly aid drug development and design. In this review, we will explore genomic, proteomic, and computational approaches to the elucidation of these mechanisms and the implications of these approaches for the target profiling of natural products. The recent applications of target profiling of natural products will also be reviewed."

        "abstract": "Background: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are of great concern, as they are known to be related to adverse drug reactions and hospitalisations. In addition, many DDIs are regarded as predictable and avoidable; therefore, they may be considered as targets for education and interventions. Objective: To analyse the relationship between number of dispensed drugs and the probability of potential DDIs among the elderly by using the new Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Methods: We analysed data on age, sex and dispensed drugs for people aged =75 years who were registered in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register from October to December 2005, and constructed a list of current prescriptions for every individual on the arbitrarily chosen date of 31 December 2005. Thereafter, we included those who had at least two dispensed drugs to capture the elderly population at risk of being exposed to DDIs (n = 630 743). The main outcome measures were potentially clinically relevant DDIs (type C), which may require dose adjustment, and potentially serious DDIs (type D), which should be avoided. Results: The prevalence of type C potential DDIs was 26% and of type D potential DDIs 5% in the study population. There was a strong association between number of dispensed drugs and the probability of type C potential DDIs and an even stronger association for type D potential DDIs, after adjustment for age and sex. In addition, the probability of type D potential DDIs decreased with increasing age, and women had a lower probability of type D potential DDIs than men. Conclusion: There seems to be a strong relationship between number of dispensed drugs and potential DDIs, especially for potentially serious DDIs, which has implications for the importance of trying to minimise the number of drugs prescribed in the elderly. Our findings that the probability of potentially serious DDIs decreases with increasing age among the elderly and that elderly women have a lower probability of potentially serious DDIs than elderly men need to be verified and investigated by further research.

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: High-throughput in vitro ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) profiling has become an important common practice in the pharmaceutical industry to assess compound liability early in the drug discovery process. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the bioanalytical method of choice for ADMET profiling assays that require compound-specific detection. However, the in vitro ADMET profiling environment, with its unique bioanalytical requirements of analyzing many samples generated from many discrete compounds in a high-throughput fashion, poses significant challenges for the traditional LC-MS/MS technology and process workflow, which were originally designed and optimized for single-compound bioanalysis.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This article reviews advances made during the last several years in both conventional high-throughput LC-MS/MS approaches and a number of promising novel MS-based technologies specifically developed to address the unique challenges in an ADMET environment. The advantages and limitations of each technology are also discussed. In addition, software solutions to enable and integrate these hardware improvements into the high-throughput ADMET workflow are reviewed.\\n\\nWHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader will gain an updated knowledge of the state-of-the-art technologies and practices, as well as promising novel MS-based methodologies in the field of ADMET bioanalysis.\\n\\nTAKE HOME MESSAGE: Recent advances such as automated MS/MS optimization, high-speed and multiplexed LC separation, and integrated software support have significantly increased the speed and quality of ADMET bioanalysis using LC-MS/MS. Emerging novel technologies in front-end sample introduction, ionization and mass analysis are expected to further push the current throughput limit and potentially transform the existing bioanalytical paradigm in the future."

In this study we profiled the NCI approved oncology drug set in a qHTS format to identify those that are efficacious in basal type and ErbB2 overexpressing IBC models. Further, we characterized the sensitivity of an acquired therapeutic resistance model to the oncology drugs. We observed that lapatinib-induced acquired resistance in SUM149 cells led to cross-resistance to other targeted- and chemotherapeutic drugs. Removal of the primary drug to which the model was developed led to re-sensitization to multiple drugs to a degree comparable to the parental cell line; this coincided with the cells regaining the ability to accumulate ROS and reduced expression of anti-apoptotic factors and the antioxidant SOD2. We suggest that our findings provide a unique IBC model system for gaining an understanding of acquired therapeutic resistance and the effect of redox adaptation on anti-cancer drug efficacy. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

There are numerous drug-drug interactions (DDIs) related to a loss of therapeutic efficacy and many of these are caused by pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated transcriptional activation of drug-metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters. Evaluation of PXR activation and subsequent induction of proteins involved in drug elimination and distribution have become routine in drug discovery and drug development. The assays used to evaluate PXR directly are high throughput and provide useful information on the ability of a drug's potential to precipitate a DDI. In addition, they may serve as useful tools to support structure-activity or structure-liability relationships to eliminate or minimize the potential of new drug candidates to cause induction and, ultimately, a DDI."

However, research on underlying mechanisms and therapeutic approaches is limited by the lack of animal models that reproduce plaque instability observed in humans.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: Development and use of a mouse model of plaque rupture that reflects the end stage of human atherosclerosis.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: On the basis of flow measurements and computational fluid dynamics, we applied a tandem stenosis to the carotid artery of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice on high-fat diet. At 7 weeks postoperatively, we observed intraplaque hemorrhage in \u224850% of mice, as well as disruption of fibrous caps, intraluminal thrombosis, neovascularization, and further characteristics typically seen in human unstable plaques. Administration of atorvastatin was associated with plaque stabilization and downregulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and ubiquitin. Microarray profiling of mRNA and microRNA (miR) and, in particular, its combined analysis demonstrated major differences in the hierarchical clustering of genes and miRs among nonatherosclerotic arteries, stable, and unstable plaques and allows the identification of distinct genes/miRs, potentially representing novel therapeutic targets for plaque stabilization. The feasibility of the described animal model as a discovery tool was established in a pilot approach, identifying a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs 4 (ADAMTS4) and miR-322 as potential pathogenic factors of plaque instability in mice and validated in human plaques.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The newly described mouse model reflects human atherosclerotic plaque instability and represents a discovery tool toward the development and testing of therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing plaque rupture. Distinctly expressed genes and miRs can be linked to plaque instability."

        "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid (HA), is a polyanionic polysaccharide that consists of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and beta-glucoronic acid. It is most frequently referred to as hyaluronan because it exists in vivo as a polyanion and not in the protonated acid form. HA is distributed widely in vertebrates and presents as a component of the cell coat of many strains of bacteria. Initially the main functions of HA were believed to be mechanical as it has a protective, structure stabilizing and shock-absorbing role in the body. However, more recently the role of HA in the mediation of physiological functions via interaction with binding proteins and cell surface receptors including morphogenesis, regeneration, wound healing, and tumor invasion, as well as in the dynamic regulation of such interactions on cell signaling and behavior has been documented. The unique viscoelastic nature of hyaluronan along with its biocompatibility and nonimmunogenicity has led to its use in a number of cosmetic, medical, and pharmaceutical applications. More recently, HA has been investigated as a drug delivery agent for ophthalmic, nasal, pulmonary, parenteral, and dermal routes. The purpose of our review is to describe the physical, chemical, and biological properties of native HA together with how it can be produced and assayed along with a detailed analysis of its medical and pharmaceutical applications."

Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion comprise an integral part in understanding the safety and efficacy of a potential new drug. Detailed in-depth knowledge of the Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism of a new drug entity is considered a prerequisite to know the appropriate route of administration, correct dose etc. Sometimes there is (are) different/unwanted effect(s) of certain drugs in different populations. This is particularly true for the drug having narrow therapeutic index. Often these different effects are detrimental to an individual, thus termed as adverse drug reactions. After the raw draft of human genome has evolved, it has become increasingly clear that change(s) in the drug response between individuals, is due to the occurrence of genetic polymorphisms in the Phase I and II drug metabolizing enzymes, due to which distinct subgroups in the population differ in their ability to perform certain drug biotransformation reactions. The study about the occurrence of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes is termed as Pharmacogenetics/ Pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenetic characterization of particular drug can be both phenotypically or genotypically conducted in population groups. The study is very important to check the post-marketed drug withdrawal, if a particular percentage of population suffers from adverse drug reactions, and thus a lot of revenue be saved. The study also helps to find out Right Medicine for Right Individual or Individualized Medicine."

Our objective was to develop an algorithm capable of detecting potential signals on this relationship by retrospectively mining data from electronic health records. Material and methods: Data were extracted from the clinical data warehouse (CDW) of the Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou (HEGP). AKI was defined as the first level of the RIFLE criteria, that is, an increase >50 % of creatinine basis. Algorithm accuracy was tested on 20 single drugs, 10 nephrotoxic and 10 non-nephrotoxic. We then tested 45 pairs of non-nephrotoxic drugs, among the most prescribed at our hospital and representing distinct pharmacological classes for DDIs. Results: Sensitivity and specificity were 50 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 23.66-76.34] and 90 % (95 % CI 59.58-98.21), respectively, for single drugs. Our algorithm confirmed a previously identified signal concerning clarithromycin and calcium-channel blockers (unadjusted odds ratio (ORu) 2.92; 95 % CI 1.11-7.69, p = 0.04). Among the 45 drug pairs investigated, we identified a signal concerning 55 patients in association with bromazepam and hydroxyzine (ORu 1.66; 95 % CI 1.23-2.23). This signal was not confirmed after a chart review. Even so, AKI and co-prescription were confirmed for 96 % (95 % CI 88-99) and 88 % (95 % CI 76-94) of these patients, respectively. Conclusion: Data mining techniques on CDW can foster the detection of adverse drug reactions when drugs are used alone or in combination."

This presents several key questions for drug development, including which transporters are clinically important in drug absorption and disposition, and which in vitro methods are suitable for studying drug interactions with these transporters. In addition, what criteria should trigger follow-up clinical studies, and which clinical studies should be conducted if needed. In this article, we provide the recommendations of the International Transporter Consortium on these issues, and present decision trees that are intended to help guide clinical studies on the currently recognized most important drug transporter interactions. The recommendations are generally intended to support clinical development and filing of a new drug application. Overall, it is advised that the timing of transporter investigations should be driven by efficacy, safety and clinical trial enrolment questions (for example, exclusion and inclusion criteria), as well as a need for further understanding of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties of the drug molecule, and information required for drug labelling."

        "abstract": "Membrane transporters can be major determinants of the pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy profiles of drugs. This presents several key questions for drug development, including which transporters are clinically important in drug absorption and disposition, and which in vitro methods are suitable for studying drug interactions with these transporters. In addition, what criteria should trigger follow-up clinical studies, and which clinical studies should be conducted if needed. In this article, we provide the recommendations of the International Transporter Consortium on these issues, and present decision trees that are intended to help guide clinical studies on the currently recognized most important drug transporter interactions. The recommendations are generally intended to support clinical development and filing of a new drug application. Overall, it is advised that the timing of transporter investigations should be driven by efficacy, safety and clinical trial enrolment questions (for example, exclusion and inclusion criteria), as well as a need for further understanding of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties of the drug molecule, and information required for drug labelling."

This technique, which uses instrumentation engineered to handle the narrow peaks and high back pressures generated by 1.7 ??m particle columns, provided significantly better resolution and/or faster analysis than conventional HPLC and capillary electrophoresis (CE). The use of 2 mm internal diameter (i.d.) columns of 3-10 cm length has been evaluated for the separation of basic and neutral drugs, drug profiling, and general screening (including acidic drugs). For these applications, compared to conventional HPLC and CE, it provided up to 12x and 3x faster analyses, respectively. Precision was excellent for both isocratic and gradient analyses. For retention time and peak area, RSDs of ???0.1% were obtainable. Fifteen anabolic steroids and esters were well separated in a 2.5 min gradient. For drug profiling, compared to HPLC and CE, approximately twice as many peaks were resolved. HPLC at elevated pressure is also well suited as a general screening technique. Twenty-four solutes of varying drug classes including narcotic analgesics, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and anabolic steroids were fully separated in a 13.5 min gradient. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: \u2003Repeated mass drug administration (MDA) with preventive chemotherapies (PCs) is the mainstay of morbidity control for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths. Yet, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently reported that less than one third of individuals who required PCs received treatment.\\n\\nMETHODS: \u2003Coverage of community-directed treatment with praziquantel and albendazole was analyzed in 17 villages of Mayuge District, Uganda. National drug registers, household questionnaires, and parasitological surveys were collected to track 935 individuals before and after MDA. Multilevel logistic regressions, including household and village effects, were specified with a comprehensive set of socioeconomic and parasitological variables. The factors predicting who does not receive praziquantel and albendazole from community medicine distributors were identified.\\n\\nRESULTS: \u2003Drug receipt was correlated amongst members within a household and non-recipients of praziquantel or albendazole were profiled by household-level socioeconomic factors. Individuals who were less likely to receive either praziquantel or albendazole had a Muslim household head, low home quality, belonged to the minority tribe, and had settled for more years in their village. Untreated individuals also belonged to households that did not purify drinking water, had no home latrine, and had no members who were part of the village government.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: \u2003The findings demonstrate how to locate and target individuals who are not treated in MDA. Infection risk factors were unable to identify non-recipients. Age, gender, and occupation were not informative, although WHO guidelines rely on these factors. Individuals of low socioeconomic status, minority religions, and minority tribes can be targeted to expand MDA coverage."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are now recognized as a major category of iatrogenic illness in terms of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To describe the type and frequency of avoidable ADRs spontaneously reported to a regional drug monitoring centre following inappropriate prescribing, as a basis for preventive actions. METHODS: A prospective, observational study of ADRs reported to the Regional Drug Monitoring Centre of Tours, France, between 26 November 2002 and 28 November 2003. The outcome measure was ADRs secondary to inappropriate prescribing that were defined as entirely or partly avoidable, i.e. at least one of the recommendations in various sections of the summary of product characteristics (SPC; indication, route of administration, dose, duration of treatment, dose adaptation, precautions for use, monitoring of treatment, absolute contraindications and contraindicated interactions) had not been respected. The link between the lack of conformity of the drug prescription with the SPC and occurrence of the ADR was evaluated by a working group using two criteria: (i) is nonconformity of the prescription of this drug a known and validated risk factor for this ADR?; and (ii) are there other aetiologies or other risk factors for this ADR? RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty ADRs in 294 adults and 66 children were analysed. The prescription was considered inappropriate for 213 of the 659 (32%) drugs implicated in ADRs, corresponding to 161 patients (45%). The ADR was adjudged entirely avoidable for 32 (9%) patients, partly avoidable for 28 (8%) patients and unavoidable for 300 (83%) patients. Not taking into account a history of allergy or altered renal function and not respecting the recommended dose were the most frequent causes of entirely avoidable ADRs. Allopurinol and lamotrigine were the drugs most frequently involved in serious avoidable ADRs. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive actions should focus on more systematic allergy checks when prescribing drugs and on dose adaptation in cases of altered renal function."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Over half of BRAFV600E melanomas display intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors, in part due to adaptive signaling responses. In this communication we ask whether BRAFV600E melanomas share common adaptive responses to BRAF inhibition that can provide clinically relevant targets for drug combinations. We screened a panel of 12 treatment-na\u00efve BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines with MAP Kinase pathway inhibitors in pairwise combination with 58 signaling inhibitors, assaying for synergistic cytotoxicity. We found enormous diversity in the drug combinations that showed synergy, with no two cell lines having an identical profile. Although the 6 lines most resistant to BRAF inhibition showed synergistic benefit from combination with lapatinib, the signaling mechanisms by which this combination generated synergistic cytotoxicity differed between the cell lines. We conclude that adaptive responses to inhibition of the primary oncogenic driver (BRAFV600E) are determined not only by the primary oncogenic driver but also by diverse secondary genetic and epigenetic changes (\"back-seat drivers\") and hence optimal drug combinations will be variable. Because upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases is a major source of drug resistance arising from diverse adaptive responses, we propose that inhibitors of these receptors may have substantial clinical utility in combination with inhibitors of the MAP Kinase pathway."

This analysis revealed evidence of metabolic rewiring during EMT that diverts glucose to the TCA cycle. Such rewiring was at least partially mediated by the reduced expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), which serves as a gatekeeper of the TCA cycle by inactivating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Overexpression of PDK4 partially blocked TGF\u03b2-induced EMT; conversely, PDK4 inhibition via RNAi-mediated knockdown was sufficient to drive EMT and promoted erlotinib resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. We identified a novel interaction between PDK4 and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), an inner mitochondrial protein that appears to play a role in mediating this resistance. In addition, analysis of human tumor samples revealed PDK4-low as a predictor of poor prognosis in lung cancer and that PDK4 expression is dramatically downregulated in most tumor types.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings implicate PDK4 as a critical metabolic regulator of EMT and associated drug resistance."

Methods: We test the hypothesis that an improvement in the employment prospects, as measured by a decline in unemployment, strengthens the intrinsic motivation of an unemployed drug user to enter treatment. Our hypothesis is that the \"payoff\" of entering treatment increases when the unemployed drug user has a greater probability of finding a job. We reviewed the literature and found considerable evidence to substantiate this effect. We tested the hypothesis econometrically using two different data sets, one EU-wide and one German data set. Results: Our main findings were that unemployment has a significant negative effect on the number of drug users entering treatment, i.e. when unemployment declines (increases) the number of drug treatment clients increases (declines). We also found that unemployed drug users entering treatment are most sensitive to variations in the economy-wide unemployment rate. Employed drug users, in contrast, are not influenced by these variations when deciding to enter treatment. Conclusion: Our empirical results confirm that the creation of job prospects adds significantly to the willingness of unemployed drug users to enter treatment. This lends support to the idea that drug treatment should be embedded in programmes to improve the job prospects of drug users. ?? 2011."

Temporality was the most common reason for the perceived association, given by 820 (70.2%) respondents. 478 (41.0%) provided information on two or more aspects of temporality, such as onset, changes with dose and re-challenge. A total of 383 (32.8%) respondents used information sources, such as patient information leaflets or discussions with health professionals to confirm associations, including 145 (12.4%) who had also reported a temporal association. Telephone interviews with 27 reporters (method 2) provided detailed explanations of temporal associations, particularly experiences of rechallenge, and data from 230 Yellow Card reports (method 3) showed that, although reporters are not required to explain reasons for their suspicions, 74.8% of submitted reports included a temporal association. These reports also showed evidence of causal theorizing and differential diagnosis.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: In our study sample, most reporters to the YCS feel able to identify suspected ADRs adequately and describe processes of assessing causality that mirror those in standard algorithms designed for use by health professionals. These findings should help to reduce concerns among health professionals about the ability of patients to identify suspected ADRs when reporting to authorities."

The current validation tests were performed using Chinese hamster ovary cells, in the absence of metabolic activation, against three distinct sets of drug-like compounds that represent all stages of a drug discovery pipeline. A compound categorization scheme was created based on quantitative relationships between micronucleus (MN) signals, cytotoxicity, and compound solubility. Results from initial validation compounds (n = 38) set the stage for differentiating overall positive and negative MN inducers. To delve deeper into the compound categorization process, a more extensive validation set, consisting of a larger set (n = 370) of \"drug-like but less optimized\" early-stage compounds, was used for further refinement of positive and negative compound categories. The predictivity and applicability of the assay for clinical stage compounds was ascertained using (n = 168) clinically developed marketed drugs or well-studied compounds. Upon full validation, a detailed analysis of results established five compound categories--NEG (negative), NEG/xx \u03bcM (negative up to the solubility limit of xx \u03bcM), WPOS (weak positive), POS (positive), and INCON (inconclusive). Furthermore, examples of lead-finding applications and ongoing investigative HCMN activities are described. A proposal is offered on how the HCMN assay can be positioned in parallel to the overall stage gates (e.g., scaffold selection, lead optimization, late-stage preclinical development) of drug discovery programs. Because of its greater throughput, 1-week turnaround time, and a substantially reduced (1-2 mg) requirement for compound consumption, the HCMN assay is appropriate for developing structure-genotoxicity relationships and for mechanistic genotoxicity studies. The assay does not replace the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development-compliant, non-good laboratory practice in vitro MN test (e.g., slide-based MN test in TK6 lymphoblastoid cells) that is used for full characterization of lead candidates."

Designing of phospholipid\u2013bovine serum albumin (BSA) complexes and stealth NPs with BSA has paved the way for drug delivery carriers with prolonged blood circulation times. Preformed albumin corona has shown to decrease non-specific association and thereby reduce the clearance rate. Albumin corona has enabled the localization of drug carriers in specific tissues such as liver and heart, thus regulating biodistribution. Tailored albumin\u2013NP conjugates have also enabled controlled degradation of NP and drug release. However, the binding of albumin with NP is associated with conformational and functional modulations in protein as observed with silver, gold and superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs.

Major limitations in the application of anticancer drugs include their nonspecificity, wide biodistribution, short half-life, low concentration in tumor tissue and systemic toxicity. Drug delivery to the tumor site has become feasible in recent years, and recent advances in the development of new drug delivery systems for controlled drug release in tumor tissues with reduced side effects show great promise. In this field, the use of biodegradable polymers as drug carriers has attracted the most attention. However, drug release is still difficult to control even when a polymeric drug carrier is used. The design of pharmaceutical polymers that respond to external stimuli (known as stimuli-responsive polymers) such as temperature, pH, electric or magnetic field, enzymes, ultrasound waves, etc. appears to be a successful approach. In these systems, drug release is triggered by different stimuli. The purpose of this review is to summarize different types of polymeric drug carriers and stimuli, in addition to the combination use of stimuli in order to achieve a better controlled drug release, and it discusses their potential strengths and applications. A survey of the recent literature on various stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems is also provided and perspectives on possible future developments in controlled drug release at tumor site have been discussed."

        "abstract": "Background: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) contribute significantly to patient morbidity and mortality, as well as to costs for healthcare systems. Our aim was to evaluate the type and incidence of ADRs in a paediatric hospital population, comparatively ascertained by two different methodological approaches. Methods: Our prospective study enrolled all patients admitted to two of the general children wards (46 beds) and the paediatric intensive care unit (6 beds) at the HELIOS Klinikum Wuppertal teaching hospital in Germany, over the study period of 3 months. We used two methods to detect ADRs. The intensified surveillance system relied on a trained physician conducting ward rounds and assessing patient charts. The computer-assisted screening of pathological laboratory parameters used values slightly below or above the age-specific normal range as a trigger signal for a potential ADR, which was subsequently assessed by trained personnel. Results: By applying both methods simultaneously we observed that 14.1% of children experienced an ADR while they were hospitalised and 2.7% of children were admitted to hospital because of the ADR. Intensified surveillance resulted in the detection of 101 ADRs in 11.9% of patients, predominantly presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms, skin and CNS disorders; computer-assisted screening identified 45 ADRs in 5.7% of patients, mainly with drug-induced blood dyscrasia and liver damage. Furthermore, the ADRs detected by the intensified method were more severe, affected younger children and showed a closer causal attributability to the reaction than the ADRs observed by the computerised method. The spectra of drugs involved were similar, with the anti-infectives being suspected most frequently. The sensitivities of the intensified surveillance system and the computerised surveillance screening came to 67.2% and 44.8%, respectively, with computer-assisted screening having a specificity of 72.8%. The mean positive predictive value of the pathological laboratory values under surveillance by computer-assisted screening was 18.6%. Approximately 25% of ADR-related drugs administered were used for off-label indications. Conclusion: Using the published literature for comparison, we found that ADRs occur as frequently in paediatric patients as in adult patients. Intensified surveillance and computerised surveillance applied in the paediatric setting show substantial differences in their detection specificities. A higher number of and more severe ADRs can be detected by intensified surveillance than by computerised surveillance, but require higher personnel resources. \u00a9 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

        "abstract": "The recent technological achievements in biotechnology and recombinant DNA technology have provided multiple new methods, molecular targets, and DNA-based diagnostics to pharmaceutical research that can be utilized in assays for screening and developing potential biotechnology-based drugs, as well as in biomedicine, health and pharmaceutical care. Furthermore, such advances opened up new opportunities by applying genetic information data in pharmacotherapy and drug delivery, thus ensuring better drug efficacy and safety in clinical practice. Now the concepts of personalized medicine and pharmacogenomics are likely improving the area of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, since they favor differentiation of the conventional clinical diagnosis and drug selection into separate molecular subtypes of individuals belonging within a group of patients suffering from the same disease. Genetic polymorphisms have already been detected and analyzed in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters as well as targets (e.g. receptors). The potential of applying genotyping and haplotyping analysis in future pharmaceutical care could eventually lead to pharmacotyping, i.e. individualized drug delivery profiling based on genetic-bioinformatic data in routine patient care. However, the steps towards this direction of drug delivery in clinical practice still have a long way to go to be fully achieved; until then, the critical evaluation of all available clinical data including pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and genomic must be assessed for ensuring drug efficacy and safety. In this way, there has been great progress in elucidating genetic determinants contributing to the observed interindividual differences in drug disposition and effects, thus implementing current drug delivery with molecular genetics and diagnostics."

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Specific delivery of a drug to a target site is a major goal of drug delivery research. Using temperature-sensitive liposomes (TSLs) is one way to achieve this; the liposome acts as a protective carrier, allowing increased drug to flow through the bloodstream by minimizing clearance and non-specific uptake. On reaching microvessels within a heated tumor, the drug is released and quickly penetrates. A major advance in the field is ThermoDox\u00ae (Celsion), demonstrating significant improvements to the drug release rates and drug uptake in heated tumors (\u223c 41\u00b0C). Most recently, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been combined with TSL drug delivery to provide localized chemotherapy with simultaneous quantification of drug release within the tumor.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: In this article the field of hyperthermia-induced drug delivery is discussed, with an emphasis on the development of TSLs and their combination with hyperthermia (both mild and ablative) in cancer therapy. State-of-the-art image-guided heating technologies used with this combination strategy will also be presented, with examples of real-time monitoring of drug delivery and prediction of efficacy.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The specific delivery of drugs by combining hyperthermia with TSLs is showing great promise in the clinic and its potential will be even greater as the use of image-guided focused ultrasound becomes more widespread - a technique capable of penetrating deep within the body to heat a specific area with improved control. In conjunction with this, it is anticipated that multifunctional TSLs will be a major topic of study in this field."

According to WHO, 10-15% of the global population suffers from severe periodontitis. The disease results from the growth of a diverse microflora (especially anaerobes) in the pockets and release of toxins, enzymes and stimulation of body's immune response. Various local or systemic approaches were used for an effective treatment of periodontitis. Currently, controlled local drug delivery approach is more favorable as compared to systemic approach because it mainly focuses on improving the therapeutic outcomes by achieving factors like site-specific delivery, low dose requirement, bypass of first-pass metabolism, reduction in gastrointestinal side effects and decrease in dosing frequency. Overall it provides a safe and effective mode of treatment, which enhances patient compliance. Complete eradication of the organisms from the sites was not achieved by using various surgical and mechanical treatments. So a number of polymer-based delivery systems like fibers, films, chips, strips, microparticles, nanoparticles and nanofibers made from a variety of natural and synthetic materials have been successfully tested to deliver a variety of drugs. These systems are biocompatible and biodegradable, completely fill the pockets, and have strong retention on the target site due to excellent mucoadhesion properties. The review summarizes various available and recently developing targeted delivery devices for the treatment of periodontitis."

In a typical scenario, which mirrors the capabilities of commercial data profiling tools, tables of a relational database are scanned to derive metadata, such as data types and value patterns, completeness and uniqueness of columns, keys and foreign keys, and occasionally functional dependencies and association rules. Individual research projects have proposed several additional profiling tasks, such as the discovery of inclusion dependencies or conditional functional dependencies. Data profiling deserves a fresh look for two reasons: First, the area itself is neither established nor defined in any principled way, despite significant research activity on individual parts in the past. Second, more and more data beyond the traditional relational databases are being created and beg to be profiled. The article proposes new research directions and challenges, including interactive and incremental profiling and profiling heterogeneous and non-relational data."

However, the conventional drug delivery systems often offer a limited by their inability to drug delivery which consists of systemic toxicity, narrow therapeutic window, complex dosing schedule for long term treatment etc. Therefore, there has been a search for the drug delivery system that exhibit broad enhancing activity for more drugs with less complication. More recently, some elegant study has noted that, a new type of micro-electrochemical system or MEMS-based drug delivery systems called microchip has been improved to overcome the problems related to conventional drug delivery. Moreover, micro-fabrication technology has enabled to develop the implantable controlled released microchip devices with improved drug administration and patient compliance. In this article, we have presented an overview of the investigations on the feasibility and application of microchip as an advanced drug delivery system. Commercial manufacturing materials and methods, related other research works and current advancement of the microchips for controlled drug delivery have also been summarized."

        "abstract": "The generation of autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus has been associated with the use of certain drugs in humans. Early reports suggested that procainamide and hydralazine were associated with the highest risk of developing lupus, quinidine with a moderate risk and all other drugs were considered low or very low risk. More recently, drug-induced lupus has been associated with the use of the newer biological modulators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 inhibitors and interferons. The clinical features and laboratory findings of TNF\u03b1 inhibitor-induced lupus are different from that of traditional drug-induced lupus or idiopathic lupus, and standardized criteria for the diagnosis of drug-induced lupus have not been established. The mechanism(s) responsible for the development of drug-induced lupus may vary depending on the drug or even on the patient. Besides lupus, other autoimmune diseases have been associated with drugs or toxins. Diagnosis of drug-induced lupus requires identification of a temporal relationship between drug administration and symptom development, and in traditional drug-induced lupus there must be no pre-existing lupus. Resolution of symptoms generally occurs after cessation of the drug.In this review, we will discuss those drugs that are more commonly associated with drug-induced lupus, with an emphasis on the new biologicals and the difficulty of making the diagnosis of drug-induced lupus against a backdrop of the autoimmune diseases that these drugs are used to treat. Stimulation of the immune system by these drugs to cause autoimmunity may in fact be associated with an increased effectiveness in treating the pathology for which they are prescribed, leading to the dilemma of deciding which is worse, the original disease or the adverse effect of the drug. Optimistically, one must hope that ongoing research in drug development and in pharmacogenetics will help to treat patients with the maximum effectiveness while minimizing side effects. Vigilance and early diagnosis are critical. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most recent developments in our understanding of the incidence, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of drug-induced lupus. \u00a9 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

        "abstract": "Several reports in the literature present the utility and value of in vitro drug-metabolizing enzyme inhibition data to predict in vivo drug-drug interactions in humans. A retrospective analysis has been conducted for 26 GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) drugs and drug candidates for which in vitro inhibition parameters have been determined, and clinical drug interaction information, from a total of 46 studies, is available. The dataset, for drugs with a diverse range of physiochemical properties, included both reversible and potentially irreversible cytochrome P450 inhibitors for which in vitro inhibition parameters (IC(50) or K(I)/k(inact) as appropriate) were determined using standardized methodologies. Mechanistic static models that differentiated reversible and metabolism-dependent inhibition, and also considered the contribution of intestinal metabolism for CYP3A4 substrates, were applied to estimate the magnitude of the interactions. Several pharmacokinetic parameters, including total C(max), unbound C(max), as well as estimates of hepatic inlet and liver concentration, were used as surrogates for the inhibitor concentration at the enzyme active site. The results suggest that estimated unbound liver concentration or unbound hepatic inlet concentration, with consideration of intestinal contribution, offered the most accurate predictions of drug-drug interactions (occurrence and magnitude) for the drugs in this dataset. When used with epidemiological information on comedication profiles for a given therapeutic area, these analyses offer a quantitative risk assessment strategy to inform the necessity of excluding specific comedications in early clinical studies and the ultimate requirement for clinical drug-drug interaction studies. This strategy has significantly reduced the number of clinical drug interaction studies performed at GSK."

These hurdles include: the need for an improved treatment of chemical structure in three-dimensions (3D); a better quantitative accounting of competitive and complementary biotransformation pathways; and, the critical need for a comprehensive, human drug metabolism database (hDMdb) that can serve as a bio/chemoinformatic resource pertaining to drug metabolism and drug metabolism-related drug-drug interactions in general. Approaches that might be taken to traverse each of these hurdles are discussed herein where: the first involves maturation of chemical structures from simple 2D entries into more sophisticated 3D displays that can also account for interactions with relevant biological surfaces; the second involves a systematic, pair-wise comparison of various metabolic options in a statistically driven manner relative to chemical structure descriptors; and, the third involves mounting a hDMdb on the Internet in a user-friendly manner that it is available via a non-profit format."

This is increasingly translating into success in the clinic, with five new kinase inhibitor drugs approved since 2011. However, despite encouraging signs in other areas, success has been largely restricted to oncology.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This article reviews the prospects for kinase inhibitor drug discovery in oncology and other therapeutic areas. Major topics include the application of kinome profiling and lessons learned from kinase system-based research. With these fields nearing maturity, the validation of kinases as targets or their classification as liabilities is becoming increasingly pertinent. Other topics include a discussion of the properties required of good small molecule kinase probes.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The tractability of protein kinases to small molecule discovery through system-based research is excellent, and adequate selectivity can often be achieved. With advances in screening methodology now enabling compound profiling across most of the kinome, researchers involved in drug discovery must decide what inhibition profiles are desirable. However, this assessment must be made on the basis of incomplete understanding of the disease biology of most kinases, and as a result there is a significant risk that drugs entering clinical trials will lack efficacy. Because of this, as well as greater effort to determine which kinases are therapeutically relevant for particular diseases, opportunities for quality pre-candidate compounds developed for specific indications to find alternative uses should be maximised by early screening through panels of phenotypic assays."

In silico proteomics analysis unravels mechanisms by which structural plasticity of the tyrosine kinases is linked with the conformational preferences of Imatinib and Dasatinib in achieving effective drug binding with a distinct spectrum of the tyrosine kinome. The differences in the inhibitor sensitivities to the ABL kinase mutants are rationalized based on variations in the binding free energy profiles with the conformational states of the ABL kinase. While Imatinib binding is highly sensitive to the activation state of the enzyme, the computed binding profile of Dasatinib is remarkably tolerant to the conformational state of ABL. A comparative analysis of the inhibitor binding profiles with the clinically important ABL kinase mutants has revealed an excellent agreement with the biochemical and proteomics data. We have found that conformational adaptability of the kinase inhibitors to structurally different conformational states of the tyrosine kinases may have pharmacological relevance in acquiring a specific array of potent activities and regulating a scope of the inhibitor resistance mutations. This study outlines a useful approach for understanding and predicting the molecular basis of the inhibitor sensitivity against potential kinase targets and drug resistance."

        "abstract": "The objective of this paper was to identify oral bioavailability enhancing approaches for a poorly water-soluble research compound during drug discovery stages using minimal amounts of material. LCQ789 is a pBCS (preclinical BCS) Class II compound with extremely low aqueous solubility (<1 microg/mL) and high permeability, therefore, resulting in very low oral bioavailability in preclinical species (rats and dogs). A number of solubility and/or dissolution enhancing approaches including particle size reduction, solid dispersions, lipid-based formulations and co-crystals, were considered in order to improve the compound's oral bioavailability. High-Throughput Screening (HTS) and in silico modeling (GastroPlus) were utilized to minimize the compound consumption in early discovery stages. In vivo evaluation of selected physical form and formulation strategies was performed in rats and dogs. Amongst the formulation strategies, optimized solid dispersion and lipid-based formulation provided significant improvement in drug dissolution rate and hence, oral bioavailability. In addition, a significant impact of physical form on oral bioavailability of LCQ789 was observed. In conclusion, a thorough understanding of not only the formulation technique but also the physical form of research compounds is critical to ensure physical stability, successful pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling and early developability risk assessment."

        "abstract": "This review aims to highlight the applications of one of the most prominent optical biosensor technologies, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), in the drug discovery process and quality analysis of pharmaceutical compounds and their particularities. SPR assay formats and experimental issues are used for pharmacokinetic drug profiling, ADMET studies, high-throughput screening, and fragment-based drug screening, the last with an emphasis on the detection of small (drug) molecules. The classical method strengths and some applications of localized SPR and SPR imaging that are of high interest in the drug discovery process are presented, as well as possible challenges. While similar works treat separately the steps of drug discovery or focus only on the detection of drug residues in food or health safety, this review presents in a compact format the results and the progress obtained in both areas (drug discovery and quality analysis) based on the application of SPR biosensors."

        "abstract": "The clinical importance of drug-eluting stents (DESs) has been demonstrated by their unparalleled success in preventing restenosis after stenting procedures. The magnitude of success is historic despite their short history. The current DESs deliver a single drug aiming to prevent or minimize proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Since the restenosis process involves several different biological responses, the ability to deliver the right drugs at the right times is critical for further development of the second generation of DESs. As the type of drugs that can be delivered from DESs varies, it is imperative to understand the drug delivery mechanisms and the approaches available for drug coating on the stents. The drug delivery mechanisms of current DESs that have been used clinically and under clinical trials are explained."

The participants were asked to give recommendations concerning dose adjustments, changes to the regimen, and drug-drug interactions to observe whether the expert recommendations were comparable. Of the 30 participants of the QC-program, 16 returned their comments and recommendations with regard to the patient case. The drug level was easy to judge: approximately 90% were able to correctly do so. Almost half of the recommendations (44%) given were satisfactory. Levels of knowledge regarding HIV treatment appeared to be variable among the respondents and for this reason were partly incomparable."

It presents some of the key facts, figures, concepts, and debates on international migration that appear in the arti- cles that follow, and outlines their main arguments. Five arguments in sup- port of greater international cooperation and more formal processes of global governance on international migration are presented here. First, contemporary international migration is now occurring at unprecedented levels and has a truly global reach. Second, international migration can no longer effectively bemanaged or controlled by nationalmigration policies, and greater international cooperation is required to achieve national goals in international migration. Third, there are growing numbers of migrants around the world who are vulnerable and exploited, and insufficiently pro- tected by either states or international institutions. Fourth, emerging struc- tural features in the global economy, alongside the effects of climate change, are likely to significantly increase the scale of internationalmigrationworld- wide, and present new management and protection challenges. Finally, mo- mentumfor change is slowly developing. KEYWORDS: internationalmigration, global governance."

These molecules possess a cage-like supramolecular structure, comparable with the structures of crown ethers, cryptands, spherands, cyclophanes, or calixarenes. However, it took 50 years to establish the molecular structure of CDs. Owing to their capability to form inclusion complexes with a variety of guest molecules, CDs are considered as the most important supramolecular host family among all supramolecular structures mentioned above. They can form complexes with various types of molecules including inorganic, organic, or organometallic that can be radical, cationic, anionic, or neutral molecules. This phenomenon bears the name \"molecular recognition,\" while the selectivity in the formation of complexes with enantiomeric species as guests is called \"chiral recognition.\" In addition, the properties of the molecules forming the complexes with CDs can be modified significantly. As such, a large number of scientists have attempted to elaborate and evaluate various CD derivatives that are able to complex a variety of drugs, enhancing by this way their in vivo solubility and activity. Moreover, a large number of publications describe CD uses in other fields such as foods, textile, cosmetics, or agriculture. This review reports on the recent developments of CDs in drug delivery using various routes of administration."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "The oral availability of many drugs is poor because of the pH of the stomach, the presence of enzymes, and extensive first-pass metabolism. Traditionally, these drugs have been administered as parenteral drug delivery systems, which invariably leads to poor patient compliance. This has made the pharmaceutical industry look for alternative routes of drug delivery. One possible route is via the oral cavity. This review compares the many different and novel drug delivery systems that have been developed for absorption through the oral cavity as well as those that undergo quick disintegration or dissolution in the oral cavity. Systems for oral delivery include mucoadhesive patches, films and tablets, as well as quick-disintegrating wafers, tablets and films. There are many examples of drugs that have been formulated into intraoral absorptive drug delivery systems as well as quick-disintegrating drug delivery systems. The fact that most of the research being conducted on intraoral drug delivery systems is driven by pharmaceutical manufacturers demonstrates the need for such drug delivery systems. As we begin to discover more about oral mucosal drug delivery, and develop much more sophisticated drug delivery systems, many more drugs will be formulated as intraoral systems. There is no doubt that the need for these systems is real, and many classes of drugs could benefit from this noninvasive type of drug delivery. The challenge now is to synthesize drug moieties that exhibit increased absorption across the oral mucosa and are more potent in their action. Intraoral drug delivery systems are possibly one of the very few drug delivery systems that seem to be ahead of the development of new drug compounds that are effectively absorbed across tissue membranes."

Fluorescence lifetime assists in lowering complexity of compound screening assays, affording a modular, toolbox-like approach to assay development and yielding robust homogeneous assays. Areas covered: To date, materials and procedures have been reported for biochemical assays on proteases, as well as on protein kinases and phosphatases. This article gives an overview of two assay families, distinguished by the origin of the fluorescence signal modulation. Expert opinion: The pharmaceutical industry demands techniques with a robust, integrated compound profiling process and short turnaround times. Fluorescence lifetime assays have already helped the drug discovery field, in this sense, by enhancing productivity during the hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases. Future work will focus on covering other biochemical molecular modifications by investigating the detailed photo-physical mechanisms underlying the fluorescence signal."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a well known risk factor for adverse drug reactions. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins') are a cornerstone in the treatment of dyslipidaemia and patients with dyslipidaemia are concomitantly treated with a variety of additional drugs. Since DDIs are associated with adverse reactions, we performed a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of potentially critical drug-drug and drug-statin interactions in an outpatient adult population with dyslipidaemia. METHODS: Data from patients with dyslipidaemia treated with a statin were collected from 242 practitioners from different parts of Switzerland. The medication list was screened for potentially harmful DDIs with statins or other drugs using an interactive electronic drug interaction program. RESULTS: We included 2742 ambulatory statin-treated patients (mean age +/- SD 65.1 +/- 11.1 years; 61.6% males) with (mean +/- SD) 3.2 +/- 1.6 diagnoses and 4.9 +/- 2.4 drugs prescribed. Of those, 190 patients (6.9%) had a total of 198 potentially harmful drug-statin interactions. Interacting drugs were fibrates or nicotinic acid (9.5% of patients with drug-statin interactions), cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (70.5%), digoxin (22.6%) or ciclosporin (cyclosporine) [1.6%]. The proportion of patients with a potential drug-statin interaction was 12.1% for simvastatin, 10.0% for atorvastatin, 3.8% for fluvastatin and 0.3% for pravastatin. Additionally, the program identified 393 potentially critical non-statin DDIs in 288 patients. CONCLUSIONS: CYP3A4 inhibitors are the most frequent cause of potential drug interactions with statins. As the risk for developing rhabdomyolysis is increased in patients with drug-statin interactions, clinicians should be aware of the most frequently observed drug-statin interactions and how these interactions can be avoided."

        "abstract": "Preclinical Research Cellular proteins are the mediators of multiple organism functions being involved in physiological mechanisms and disease. By discovering lead compounds that affect the function of target proteins, the target diseases or physiological mechanisms can be modulated. Based on knowledge of the ligand-receptor interaction, the chemical structures of leads can be modified to improve efficacy, selectivity and reduce side effects. One rational drug design technology, which enables drug discovery based on knowledge of target structures, functional properties and mechanisms, is computer-aided drug design (CADD). The application of CADD can be cost-effective using experiments to compare predicted and actual drug activity, the results from which can used iteratively to improve compound properties. The two major CADD-based approaches are structure-based drug design, where protein structures are required, and ligand-based drug design, where ligand and ligand activities can be used to design compounds interacting with the protein structure. Approaches in structure-based drug design include docking, de novo design, fragment-based drug discovery and structure-based pharmacophore modeling. Approaches in ligand-based drug design include quantitative structure-affinity relationship and pharmacophore modeling based on ligand properties. Based on whether the structure of the receptor and its interaction with the ligand are known, different design strategies can be seed. After lead compounds are generated, the rule of five can be used to assess whether these have drug-like properties. Several quality validation methods, such as cost function analysis, Fisher's cross-validation analysis and goodness of hit test, can be used to estimate the metrics of different drug design strategies. To further improve CADD performance, multi-computers and graphics processing units may be applied to reduce costs. 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

This paper assesses the ethical status of ethnic profiling from the perspective of the ideal of equality. The paper shows how the ethical status of ethnic profiling changes depending on how exactly we specify the egalitarian ideal. Furthermore, it argues that on a plausible interpretation of the ideal of equality, ethnic profiling is not in principle objectionable."

Drugs that successfully delay the aging process will clearly become \"blockbusters.\" To date, the most promising leads have come from studies of the cellular pathways mediating the longevity effects of caloric restriction (CR), particularly target of rapamycin and the sirtuins. Similar research into pathways governing other hormetic responses that influence aging is likely to yield even more targets.

Network science studies their parameters, or quantitative indicators; its instruments make it possible to draw and analyze networks from a mathematical perspective. The present study is an attempt to apply network science techniques to the drug prescription process, a typical subject of Epidemiology for Public Health studies. METHODS: A drug prescription network was created using the set of drug prescriptions written during a 6-month period by a group of 99 general practitioners (GPs) operating in Italy. In this network, named co-prescription network, each drug represented a node, and different drugs prescribed to the same patient at the same moment were considered linked together. Drug prescription data for a total of 42 965 patients and 631 232 drug packages were studied. A number of co-prescription networks were obtained and analyzed on the basis of different subsets of patients by age and gender. The network parameters were measured and compared for the various subsets. RESULTS: All the drug prescription networks studied showed scale invariance behavior. The age- and gender-related co-prescription networks showed different patterns, with different levels of complexity. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that the drug prescription process has specific network aspects and dynamics and, more generally, that it is possible to apply instruments of network science to study public health phenomena from a new, different perspective. Further studies should be encouraged and performed."

        "abstract": "Cancer chemoprevention is a new approach in the management of cancer. Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic approaches cannot cure most advanced solid malignancies. Chemoprevention can be defined as the use of non-cytotoxic drugs and natural agents to block the progression to invasive cancer. Chemoprevention can either prevent DNA damage that initiates the neoplastic transformation process or reverses the progression of pre-invasive lesions. Epidemiological observations, experimental evidence from animal carcinogenesis models, knock-out models, cancer cell lines and clinical trials have shown the efficacy of this approach. Recent advances in our understanding of carcinogenesis have led to the synthesis of new drugs that target specific receptors. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs target the prostaglandin pathway. The identification of the role of cyclooxygenase-2 in epithelial carcinogenesis led to the synthesis of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (Celecoxib). Celecoxib was subsequently approved for the prevention of colon polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis after the completion of a randomized clinical trial. The large chemoprevention clinical trial with the selective estrogen receptor modulator, tamoxifen, showed the benefit of tamoxifen in the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk women. Retinoids and rexinoids target the retinoid receptors and have a role in chemoprevention of aerodigestive, hepatic and cervical neoplasia. Selenium, an inhibitor of the glutathione peroxidase system, is being tested in the chemoprevention of prostate cancer and lung cancer. The different isoforms of vitamin E (tocopherols) may be chemopreventive. Recent evidence indicates that gamma-tocopherol may be a more powerful chemopreventive than the alpha-tocopherol. The review details the rationale, experimental and clinical evidence and the drug targets of the chemopreventive agents that are currently in various phases of clinical development."

Most ocular diseases are treated by topical drug application in the form of solutions, suspensions and ointment. These conventional dosage forms suffer from the problems of poor ocular bioavailability, because of various anatomical and pathophysiological barriers prevailing in the eye. This review provides an insight into the various constraints associated with ocular drug delivery, summarizes recent findings and applications of various nanoparticulate systems like microemulsions, nanosuspensions, nanoparticles, liposomes, niosomes, dendrimers and cyclodextrins in the field of ocular drug delivery and also depicts how the various upcoming of nanotechnology like nanodiagnostics, nanoimaging and nanomedicine can be utilized to explore the frontiers of ocular drug delivery and therapy."

Different responses were obtained depending on the cell type and incubation time. Most pronounced changes were found for lipids, choline containing compounds, glutamate and glutathione, nucleotide sugars, lactate, and some amino acids. Possible contributions of these metabolites to physiologic processes are discussed. The time-dependent metabolic response patterns suggest that A2780 cells on one hand and HEK-293 cells and A2780cisR cells on the other hand may follow different cell death pathways and exist in different temporal stages thereof."

        "abstract": "Together with drug metabolising enzymes, transmembrane transporters are important determinants of drug metabolism and drug clearance by the liver. Hepatic uptake of organic anions, cations, prostaglandins and bile salts is supported by dedicated transporter proteins in the basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane of hepatocytes: OATPs, OATs, OCTs, PGTs and NTCP, respectively. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes mediate the hepatic efflux of drugs, bile salts and metabolites against a steep concentration gradient from liver to bile. This transport is driven by ATP hydrolysis. Drugs, endogenous metabolites, bile salts and cytokines affect the expression levels of these transporters. They act through a family of ligand-activated transcription factors, the nuclear hormone receptors. Consequently, the levels of the various transporter proteins are subject to genetic polymorphism in the encoding genes as well as in these transcription factors. Adverse drug reactions may be caused by genetic or disease-induced variations of transporter expression or drug-drug interactions at the level of these transporters."

To fill this important gap, findings are presented from a quasi-experimental study of 1,156 drug court participants from 23 sites and 625 comparison offenders from 6 sites where drug courts are unavailable. Six-month follow-up interviews were conducted with 1,533 offenders (86%) and 18-month interviews with 1,474 (83%) offenders. Findings indicate that drug courts produced modest positive effects (though many were not statistically significant) across a range of socioeconomic outcomes. Findings also indicate that drug courts reduced family conflict. However, significant effects were not evident with respect to emotional or instrumental support from family members, mental health, or homelessness."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "A candidate antitumor agent, 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)-5-fluorobenzothiazole (5F-203), was empirically discovered through the National Cancer Institute's Anticancer Drug Screen from a unique growth inhibitory-response profile, indicating a novel mechanism of action. 5F-203 activates the CYP1 family of cytochrome P450, involving aryl hydrocarbon receptor translocation into the nucleus. To characterize more completely the pathways involved in 5F-203 toxicity, cDNA microarrays were used to determine gene expression changes in MCF-7, a 5F-203-sensitive breast cancer cell line, after treatment with 1 microM 5F-203. The mRNA expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 were both increased approximately 20-fold after 24 h, but less after 6 h of treatment, confirming previous results. However, the most pronounced drug-induced change was in the PLAB gene, encoding one of the bone morphogenic proteins in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. Other induced gene expressions included the apoptosis-initiating receptor TNFRSF6 (CD95/FAS), the DNA-damage response genes CDKN1A (p21/Cip1), p53-induced gene-3, and DNA binding protein 2. In contrast, the transcription factor c-Myc showed reduced expression. Western blot analysis also showed induction of p53 protein expression in response to 5F-203 treatment. In contrast to the MCF-7 data, MDA-MB-435, a cancer cell line resistant to 5F-203, showed no change in expression of any of these genes or the p53 protein under the same conditions of 5F-203 treatment. These data are consistent with the idea that CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 activation leads to 5F-203 toxicity through DNA damage-induced apoptosis, as well as signaling through a variant member of the TGF-beta superfamily."

        "abstract": "The triple receptor-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype is characterized by the lack of expression of both hormone receptors as well as lack of over-expression and/or lack of gene amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Approximately 10--15% of breast carcinomas are known to be of the TNBC subtype, which constitutes approximately 80% of all `basal-like tumours'. Risk factors for TNBC include young age at breast cancer diagnosis, young age at menarche, high parity, lack of breast feeding, high body mass index and African American ethnicity. The majority of BRCA1 tumours are TNBC. TNBC has a worse prognosis and tends to relapse early compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Conversely, it displays increased chemosensitivity compared with other breast tumour subtypes. Several agents are currently being investigated as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of women with TNBC including agents targeted against EGFR, anti-angiogenic agents, multityrosine kinase inhibitors and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. This review focuses on the epidemiology of TNBC, its pathological features, natural history and recurrence patterns as well as current and future management options."

The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of prioritising techniques utilised at the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for the chemical profiling of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA). The outcome would provide the AFP with the ability to obtain more timely and valuable results that could be used in an intelligence perspective. Correlation coefficients were used to obtain a similarity degree between a population of linked samples (within seizures) and a population of unlinked samples (between different seizures) and discrimination between the two populations was ultimately achieved. The results showed that gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was well suited as a single technique to detect links between seizures and could be used in priority for operational intelligence purposes. Furthermore, the method was applied to seizures known or suspected (through their case information) to be linked to each other to assess the chemical similarity between samples. It was found that half of the seizures previously linked by the case number were also linked by the chemical profile. This procedure was also able to highlight links between cases that were previously unsuspected and retrospectively confirmed by circumstantial information. The findings are finally discussed in the broader forensic intelligence context, with a focus on how they could be successfully incorporated into investigations and in an intelligence-led policing perspective in order to understand trafficking markets. ?? 2014 Forensic Science Society."

        "abstract": "Global metabolomics relies on highly reproducible and sensitive detection of a wide range of metabolites in biological samples. Here we report the optimization of metabolome analysis by nanoflow ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry. Reliable peak features were extracted from the LC-MS runs based on mandatory detection in duplicates and additional noise filtering according to blank injections. The run-to-run variation in peak area showed a median of 14%, and the false discovery rate during a mock comparison was evaluated. To maximize the number of peak features identified, we systematically characterized the effect of sample loading amount, gradient length, and MS resolution. The number of features initially rose and later reached a plateau as a function of sample amount, fitting a hyperbolic curve. Longer gradients improved unique feature detection in part by time-resolving isobaric species. Increasing the MS resolution up to 120000 also aided in the differentiation of near isobaric metabolites, but higher MS resolution reduced the data acquisition rate and conferred no benefits, as predicted from a theoretical simulation of possible metabolites. Moreover, a biphasic LC gradient allowed even distribution of peak features across the elution, yielding markedly more peak features than the linear gradient. Using this robust nUPLC-HRMS platform, we were able to consistently analyze ~6500 metabolite features in a single 60 min gradient from 2 mg of yeast, equivalent to ~50 million cells. We applied this optimized method in a case study of drug (bortezomib) resistant and drug-sensitive multiple myeloma cells. Overall, 18% of metabolite features were matched to KEGG identifiers, enabling pathway enrichment analysis. Principal component analysis and heat map data correctly clustered isogenic phenotypes, highlighting the potential for hundreds of small molecule biomarkers of cancer drug resistance."

Here we review the informatics approaches required to build a complete catalogue of known drug targets. Objective: Using Pfizer's internal target database as a narrative, we review the steps involved in the construction of an integrated, enterprise target-informatics system. We consider how compiling the drug target universe requires integration across several resources such as competitor intelligence and pharmacological activity databases, as well as input from techniques such as text-mining. In particular, we address data standards and the complexities of representing targets in a structured ontology as well as opportunities for future development. Conclusion: Drug target-orientated databases address important areas of drug discovery such as chemogenomics, drug/candidate repurposing and business intelligence. As research in industry and academia drives continued expansion of the druggable genome, it is crucial that such systems be maintained to provide an accurate picture of the landscape. This power of this information stretches beyond drug discovery and into the wider scientific community where small molecule tool compounds can enable the dissection of complex cellular pathways."

        "abstract": "The terms 'adverse drug effects' and 'adverse drug reactions' are commonly used interchangeably, but they have different implications. Adverse drug reactions arise when a compound (e.g. a drug or metabolite, a contaminant or adulterant) is distributed in the same place as a body tissue (e.g. a receptor, enzyme, or ion channel), and the encounter results in an adverse effect (a physiological or pathological change), which results in a clinically appreciable adverse reaction. Both the adverse effect and the adverse reaction have manifestations by which they can be recognized: adverse effects are usually detected by laboratory tests (e.g. biochemical, haematological, immunological, radiological, pathological) or by clinical investigations (e.g. endoscopy, cardiac catheterization), and adverse reactions by their clinical manifestations (symptoms and/or signs). This distinction suggests five scenarios: (i) adverse reactions can result directly from adverse effects; (ii) adverse effects may not lead to appreciable adverse reactions; (iii) adverse reactions can occur without preceding adverse effects; (iv) adverse effects and reactions may be dissociated; and (v) adverse effects and reactions can together constitute syndromes. Defining an adverse drug reaction as \"an appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product\" suggests a definition of an adverse drug effect: \"a potentially harmful effect resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product, which constitutes a hazard and may or may not be associated with a clinically appreciable adverse reaction and/or an abnormal laboratory test or clinical investigation, as a marker of an adverse reaction.\""

A retrospective analysis has been conducted for 26 GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) drugs and drug candidates for which in vitro inhibition parameters have been determined, and clinical drug interaction information, from a total of 46 studies, is available. The dataset, for drugs with a diverse range of physiochemical properties, included both reversible and potentially irreversible cytochrome P450 inhibitors for which in vitro inhibition parameters (IC(50) or K(I)/k(inact) as appropriate) were determined using standardized methodologies. Mechanistic static models that differentiated reversible and metabolism-dependent inhibition, and also considered the contribution of intestinal metabolism for CYP3A4 substrates, were applied to estimate the magnitude of the interactions. Several pharmacokinetic parameters, including total C(max), unbound C(max), as well as estimates of hepatic inlet and liver concentration, were used as surrogates for the inhibitor concentration at the enzyme active site. The results suggest that estimated unbound liver concentration or unbound hepatic inlet concentration, with consideration of intestinal contribution, offered the most accurate predictions of drug-drug interactions (occurrence and magnitude) for the drugs in this dataset. When used with epidemiological information on comedication profiles for a given therapeutic area, these analyses offer a quantitative risk assessment strategy to inform the necessity of excluding specific comedications in early clinical studies and the ultimate requirement for clinical drug-drug interaction studies. This strategy has significantly reduced the number of clinical drug interaction studies performed at GSK."

It is generally accepted that chemical testing of biological fluids is the most objective means of diagnosis of drug use. The presence of a drug analyte in a biological specimen can be used to document exposure. The standard in drug testing is the immunoassay screen, followed by the gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric confirmation conducted on a urine sample. In recent years, remarkable advances in sensitive analytical techniques have enabled the analysis of drugs in unconventional biological specimens such as hair. The advantages of this sample over traditional media, like urine and blood, are obvious: collection is noninvasive, relatively easy to perform, and in forensic situations it may be achieved under close supervision of law enforcement officers to prevent adulteration or substitution. The window of drug detection is dramatically extended to weeks, months or even years when testing hair. It seems that the value of alternative specimen analysis for the identification of drug users is steadily gaining recognition. This can be seen from its growing use in preemployment screening, in forensic sciences, in clinical applications and for doping control. Hair analysis may be a useful adjunct to conventional drug testing in urine. Methods for evading urinalysis do not affect hair analysis.

Furthermore, whereas aggressive PC should be treated immediately to prevent dissemination, indolent PC often does not progress and overtreatment should be avoided. Currently, the best predictors of aggressiveness are Gleason score and T-stage of the primary PC. Better tools to assess PC aggressiveness could aid in treatment decisions. Recently, circulating miRNAs have been suggested as potential new biomarkers for PC with diagnostic and prognostic potential. Here, to identify new serum miRNA biomarker candidates for PC, we performed genome-wide miRNA profiling of serum samples from 13 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) control patients and 31 PC patients. Furthermore, we carefully reviewed the literature on circulating miRNA biomarkers for PC. Our results confirmed the de-regulation of miR-141 and miR-375, two of the most well-documented candidate miRNA markers for PC. Moreover, we identified several new potential serum miRNA markers for PC and developed three novel and highly specific (100\u00a0%) miRNA candidate marker panels able to identify 84\u00a0% of all PC patients (miR-562/miR-210/miR-501-3p/miR-375/miR-551b), 80\u00a0% of patients with disseminated PC when compared to BPH patients (let-7a*/miR-210/miR-562/miR-616), and 75\u00a0% of disseminated PC patients when compared to localized PC patients (miR-375/miR-708/miR-1203/miR-200a), demonstrating high potential of serum miRNAs for diagnosing and staging of PC."

Two ADH1A variants showed statistically significant differences (odds ratio (OR)=5.68, P=0.0006; OR=5.35, P=0.0009) in allele frequencies between patients in complete/partial remission and patients without response, two substitutions on CYP2E1 (OR=0.13, P=0.001; OR=0.09, P=0.003) and one on SLCO1B1 (OR=4.68, P=0.002) were found to differently influence liver toxicity, and two nucleotide changes on SULTB1 and SLC22A12 genes correlated with response to GO (OR=0.24, P=0.0009; OR=2.75, P=0.0029).

USP Apparatus 2 (dissolution model), USP Apparatus 4 (flow through model) and a modified Franz cell (diffusion model), were investigated using identical sink volumes and temperatures (1000 ml and 37 ??C). Microparticulates containing DSCG and different percentages of PVA (0%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90%) were used as model CR formulations. Evaluation of the release profiles of DSCG from the modified PVA formulations, suggested that all data fitted a Weibull distribution model with R2 ??? 0.942. Statistical analysis of the td (time for 63.2% drug release) indicated that all methodologies could distinguish between microparticles that did or did not contain PVA (Students t-test, p < 0.05). However, only the diffusion model could differentiate between samples containing different PVA percentages. Similar results were observed when analysing the data using similarity and difference factors. Furthermore, analysis of the release kinetic profiles for all samples suggested the data fitted the Higuchi diffusion model (R2 ??? 0.862 for the diffusion methodology data set). Due to the relatively low water content in the respiratory tract and the lack of differentiation between formulations for USP Apparatus 2 and 4, it is concluded that the diffusion model is more applicable for the evaluation of CR inhalation medicines. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A major cause of failure of orally administered drugs during their development is the discovery that in humans they have low intestinal absorption and/or high clearance causing low and variable bioavailability. In addition, drug interactions and the presence of active metabolites can prevent or complicate their successful development. With poor pharmacokinetics it can be difficult to achieve a suitable dosage regimen for the required pharmacodynamic action. The main role of DMPK in discovery is, therefore, the prediction of human pharmacokinetics and metabolism. Reducing the rate of attrition during drug discovery and development is now considered essential, particularly as it is now possible to screen an ever-greater number of compounds."

Immunocytes (including mononuclear phagocytes (dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages), neutrophils and lymphocytes) are highly mobile; they can migrate across impermeable barriers and release their drug cargo at sites of infection or tissue injury. Thus, immune cells can be exploited as Trojan horses for drug delivery.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This paper reviews how immunocytes laden with drugs can cross the blood-brain or blood-tumor barriers to facilitate treatments for infectious diseases, injury, cancer, or inflammatory diseases. The promises and perils of cell-mediated drug delivery are reviewed, with examples of how immunocytes can be harnessed to improve therapeutic end points.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Using cells as delivery vehicles enables targeted drug transport and prolonged circulation times, along with reductions in cell and tissue toxicities. Such systems for drug carriage and targeted release represent a new disease-combating strategy being applied to a spectrum of human disorders. The design of nanocarriers for cell-mediated drug delivery may differ from those used for conventional drug delivery systems; nevertheless, engaging different defense mechanisms in drug delivery may open new perspectives for the active delivery of drugs."

By virtue of this property, uncharacterized proteins can be assigned putative functions, based on the similarity of their profiles with those of known proteins.

In this chapter, a rapid, sensitive, and accurate method for the quantification of acidic plant hormones is described. A fast and simple extraction procedure without purification or derivatization was devised, followed by optimized ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis. The analytical procedure was validated in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, recovery, and matrix effects. This protocol facilitates the high-throughput analysis of the main plant hormones and is applicable as a routine tool for a wide range of research fields such as plant-pathogen interactions, mutant screening, or plant development."

The racial and ethnic disparity in CABG use significantly increased in New York immediately after New York\u2019s CABG report card was released, whereas disparities did not change significantly in the comparison states. There was no differential change in racial and ethnic disparities between New York and the comparison states in the use of cardiac catheterization or PTCA after the CABG report card was released. Over time, this increase in racial and ethnic disparities decreased to levels similar to those before the release of report cards.Conclusions\u2014 The release of CABG report cards in New York was associated with a widening of the disparity in CABG use between white versus black and Hispanic patients."

Signal-transduction routes rely mainly on the phosphorylation status of already available proteins; therefore kinases are central players in signal-transduction routes. The array technology can now also be used for the analysis of the kinome. To enable array analysis, consensus peptides for kinases are spot on a solid support. After incubation with cell lysates and in the presence of radioactive ATP, radioactive peptides can be visualized and the kinases that are active in the cells can be determined. The present paper reviews comprehensively the different kinome array platforms available and results obtained hitherto using such platforms. It will appear that this technology does not disappoint its high expectations and is especially powerful because of its species independence. Nevertheless, improvements are still possible and I shall also sketch future possible directions."

This can have profound impact on the pharmacotherapy of widely used clinically relevant medications in terms of safety and efficacy by causing inter-individual variabilities in drug responses. This review article highlights altered drug disposition in inflammation and infectious diseases, and commonly encountered disorders such as cancer, obesity/diabetes, fatty liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. Many of the clinically relevant drugs have a narrow therapeutic index. Thus any changes in the disposition of these drugs may lead to reduced efficacy and increased toxicity. The implications of changes in DMEs and transporters on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of clinically-relevant medications are also discussed. Inflammation-mediated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) are known to play a major role in down-regulation of DMEs and transporters. Although the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear, several studies have shown that inflammation-associated cell-signaling pathway and its interaction with basal transcription factors and nuclear receptors in regulation of DMEs and transporters play a significant role in altered drug metabolism. Altered regulation of DMEs and transporters in a multitude of disease states will contribute towards future development of powerful in vitro and in vivo tools in predicting the drug response and opt for better drug design and development. The goal is to facilitate a better understanding of the mechanistic details underlying the regulation of DMEs and transporters in pathophysiological conditions."

        "abstract": "Class III antiarrhythmic drugs, especially amiodarone (a broad-spectrum antiarrhythmic agent), have gained popularity for use in clinical practice in recent years. Other class III antiarrhythmic drugs include bretylium, dofetilide, ibutilide and sotalol. These agents are effective for the management of various types of cardiac arrhythmias both atrial and ventricular in origin. Class III antiarrhythmic drugs may interact with other drugs by two major processes: pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions. The pharmacodynamic interaction occurs when the pharmacological effects of the object drug are stimulated or inhibited by the precipitant drug. Pharmacokinetic interactions can result from the interference of drug absorption, metabolism and/or elimination of the object drug by the precipitant drug. Among the class III antiarrhythmic drugs, amiodarone has been reported to be involved in a significant number of drug interactions. It is mainly metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and it is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4. In addition, amiodarone may interact with other drugs (such as digoxin) via the inhibition of the P-glycoprotein membrane transporter system, a recently described pharmacokinetic mechanism of drug interactions. Bretylium is not metabolised; it is excreted unchanged in the urine. Therefore the interactions between bretylium and other drugs (including other antiarrhythmic drugs) is primarily through the pharmacodynamic mechanism. Dofetilide is metabolised by CYP3A4 and excreted by the renal cation transport system. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (such as erythromycin) and/or the renal transport system (such as triamterene) may interact with dofetilide. It appears that the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between ibutilide and other drugs is low. This is because ibutilide is not metabolised by CYP3A4 or CYP2D6. However, ibutilide may significantly interact with other drugs by a pharmacodynamic mechanism. Sotalol is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. The potential for drug interactions due to hepatic enzyme induction or inhibition appears to be less likely. However, a number of drugs (such as digoxin) have been reported to interact with sotalol pharmacodynamically. If concurrent use of a class III antiarrhythmic agent and another drug cannot be avoided or no published studies for that particular drug interaction are available, caution should be exercised and close monitoring of the patient should be performed in order to avoid or minimise the risks associated with a possible adverse drug interaction."

        "abstract": "This study sought to determine the frequency of possible cardiopulmonary drug-drug interactions among pregnant women who received intrapartum magnesium sulfate (MgSO4).Pregnant women admitted to an Intermountain Healthcare facility between January 2009 and October 2011 were studied, if they received 1 or more doses of MgSO4. Concomitant medications were electronically queried from an electronic health records system. Adverse events were identified using administrative discharge codes. The frequency of cardiopulmonary drug-drug interactions was compared among women who did, and did not, receive aminoglycoside antibiotics, antacids/laxatives, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, diuretics, neuromuscular blocking agents, and vitamin D analogs, all of which were contraindicated for patients receiving MgSO4.Overall, 683 women received intrapartum MgSO4 during the study period. A total of 219 MgSO4 potentially interacting drugs were identified among 155 (23\\%) unique patients. The most commonly identified potentially interacting agents included calcium channel blockers (26\\%), diuretics (25\\%), and antacids/laxatives (19\\%). Longer hospital stays were significantly associated with increasing numbers of MgSO4 interacting drugs (P < 0.001). Three of 53 (6\\%) women who received furosemide experienced a cardiac arrest, compared with 0 of 618 (0\\%) women who did not receive furosemide (Fisher exact test, P < 0.001).Intrapartum administration of drugs that interact with MgSO4 is common and associated with prolonged hospital stays and potentially cardiopulmonary drug-drug interactions. Caution is warranted when prescribing MgSO4 in combination with known interacting medications."

Now, the conceptual and methodological advances associated with optogenetic approaches are providing fresh momentum to neuroscience drug discovery, particularly in areas that are stalled on the concept of 'fixing the brain chemistry'. Optogenetics is beginning to translate and transit into drug discovery in several key domains, including target discovery, high-throughput screening and novel therapeutic approaches to disease states. Here, we discuss the exciting potential of optogenetic technologies to transform neuroscience drug discovery."

Supposing that such beliefs are true, and that racial profiling is effective in fighting crime, is such profiling morally justified? Recently, Risse and Zeckhauser have explored the racial profiling of African-Americans and argued that justification is forthcoming from a utilitarian as well as deontological point of view. Drawing on criticisms made by G. A. Cohen of the incentives argument for inequality, I argue that, assuming that crime rates between different racial groups would converge in the absence of racial discrimination and unjust inequality, racial profiling is comprehensively unjustified. I also explain that, because Risse and Zeckhauser simply compare the status quo with an outcome that differs from it only in respect of the practice of racial profiling, they fail to show that such profiling is non-comprehensively justified. And, exploring the problem from the point of view of a deontological concern for fairness, I identify a number of situations in which it would be non-comprehensively unjustified to implement racial profiling (as well as some in which it might be non-comprehensively unjustified not to implement racial profiling).

Additionally, clinical examination in the extent of efficacy, safety and drug interactions of newly developed ayurvedic drugs and formulations are required to be carefully evaluated. Ayurvedic experts suggest a reverse-pharmacology approach focusing on the potential targets for which ayurvedic herbs and herbal products could bring tremendous leads to ayurvedic drug discovery. Although several novel leads and drug molecules have already been discovered from ayurvedic medicinal herbs, further scientific explorations in this arena along with customization of present technologies to ayurvedic drug manufacturing principles would greatly facilitate a standardized ayurvedic drug discovery."

A secondary objective was to explore patient and medication variables associated with prescriptions involving multiple providers. PMPs monitor the final allocation of controlled substances from pharmacist to patient. The primary purpose of this scrutiny is to diminish the utilization of multiple providers for controlled substances. Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of the California PMP, the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES). The prevalence of multiple provider episodes was determined using data collected during 2007. A series of binomial logistic regressions was used to predict the odds ratio (OR) of multiple prescriber episodes for each generic type of controlled substance (i.e., opioid, benzodiazepine, stimulant, or diet pill (anorectic) using demographic and prescription variables. Results: Opioid prescriptions (12.8%) were most frequently involved in multiple provider episodes followed by benzodiazepines (4.2%), stimulants (1.4%), and anorectics (0.9%), respectively. The greatest associations with multiple provider episodes were simultaneously receiving prescriptions for different controlled substances. Conclusions: Opioids were involved in multiple provider prescribing more frequently than other controlled substances. The likelihood of using multiple providers to obtain one class of medications was substantially elevated as patients received additional categories of controlled substances from the same provider or from multiple practitioners. Polypharmacy represents a signal that requires additional vigilance to detect the potential presence of doctor shopping. ?? 2010."

        "abstract": "Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is one of the most frequently prescribed progestins for conception, hormone replacement therapy, and adjuvant endocrine therapy. MPA has a low oral bioavailability because of extensive metabolism; however, its metabolism was poorly documented. This study was intended to profile the phase I metabolites of MPA and the cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms involved. After MPA was incubated with human liver microsomes and the NADPH-generating system, five main metabolites (namely M-1, M-2, M-3, M-4, and M-5) were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Three major metabolites (M-2, M-4, and M-3) were tentatively identified to be 6beta-, 2beta-, and 1beta-hydroxy MPA by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance. By consecutive metabolism of purified M-2, M-3, and M-4, M-1 and M-5 were proposed to be 2beta-, 6beta-dihydroxy MPA, and 1,2-dehydro MPA, respectively. CYP3A4 was identified to be the isoform primarily involved in the formation of M-2, M-3, and M-4 in studies with specific P450 inhibitors, recombinant P450s, and correlation analysis. Rat and minipig liver microsomes were included evaluating species differences, and the results showed little difference among the species. In human liver microsomes, the K(m) values ranged from 10.0 to 11.2 muM, and the V(m) values ranged from 194 to 437 pmol/min/mg for M-2, M-3, and M-4. In conclusion, CYP3A4 was the major P450 isoform involved in MPA hydroxylation, with 6beta, 2beta, and 1beta being the possible hydroxylation sites. Minipig and rat could be the surrogate models for man in MPA pharmacokinetic studies."

In this study, we applied this technology to examine the TF activities in three different breast cancer cell lines: MCF7 (estrogen receptor [ER] +, tamoxifen-sensitive), T47D (ER+, tamoxifen-resistant), and HCC1806 (ER-, tamoxifen-resistant). We compared the differences in TF activity in these cells lines following treatment with estradiol or tamoxifen. We found a number of TF activities unique to each of these cell lines. In addition to verifying previous findings, the novel findings of this study provide a more comprehensive view of the differences in the response of these cancer lines to estrogen and tamoxifen."

Among the different forms of drug interactions that are known, inhibition of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes is the most common cause of drug-drug or drug-botanical interactions. Therefore, a rapid and comprehensive mass spectrometry-based in vitro high-throughput P450 cocktail inhibition assay was developed that uses 10 substrates simultaneously against nine CYP isoforms. Including probe substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and two probes targeting different binding sites of CYP3A4/5, this cocktail simultaneously assesses at least as many P450 enzymes as previous assays while remaining among the fastest due to short incubation times and rapid analysis using ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method was validated using known inhibitors of each P450 enzyme and then shown to be useful not only for single-compound testing but also for the evaluation of potential drug-botanical interactions using the botanical dietary supplement licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) as an example."

This is due, in part, to an increased understanding of the fundamental aspects of kinase biology, coupled with advances in the methods used to study the inhibitory effects of small molecules on kinase activity. Underlying the development of these inhibitors are profiling methods that are used to assess the effect of potential compounds against their desired and undesired targets. The advancement of kinase profiling has stemmed from the development of basic assay technology that allows compounds to be tested against ever larger panels of kinases in a robust, cost-effective manner. Methods have also been developed that rapidly assess compound activity against specific activation states of kinases. There has also been a development of newer methods that move beyond traditional biochemical formats, which take a 'whole cell' approach to compound profiling. Areas Covered: This review provides an overview of traditional biochemical-based kinase profiling as well as an introduction to advances that have been made by moving compound profiling into a cell-based format. Expert opinion: While central to the appropriate prioritization and optimization of compounds during the hit to lead phase of early-stage pharmaceutical development, every compound profiling format must be critically assessed so that one can make informed decisions through an understanding of their strengths and limitations. These decisions will ultimately be balanced against cost, complexity and its biological relevance."

The first step in drug profiling for delivery via the respiratory tract needs to address intrinsic physicochemical parameters and their impact on or correlation with absorption. Moreover, the more the pulmonary drug delivery shall find acceptance, the greater will be the need for validated test systems, methods, and guidelines for regulatory purposes. The Biopharmaceuti- cal Classification System (BCS) remains the simplest and most common guiding principle for predicting drug absorption, but it is limited to the gastrointestinal tract. This review suggests an extension, the pulmonary Biopharmaceutical Classi- fication System (pBCS), that will take into consideration the specific biology of the lung as well as particle deposition, aerosol physics, and the subsequent processes of drug absorption and solubility. We will describe the steps to be taken to develop a pBCS as well as the compounds that will be used to establish this classification. Furthermore, we will introduce two cellular models with which drug permeability across the pulmonary barrier will be determined as an alternative to the currently and widely used studies with animals."

        "abstract": "Recently there has been an increase in Australian public funds for drug education. The accompanying rhetoric asserts that it is to enable\u00a0 abstinence among young people. This contradicts some State Government education guidelines endorsing harm minimization. A literature search of the key electronic databases, drug agency libraries, the Internet and\u00a0 reference lists identified evaluation research in school-based drug education. There is little evidence to support the new public rhetoric. The predictors of adolescent drug use are social and personal; schools can have little effect on these. Four models of drug education are described. Schools, however, mix-and-match activities from different models, and exposure is too slight for major effects on behaviours. Although methodological difficulties affect findings, none of the drug education models show consistent behavioural effects over time. There is a mismatch between the new public rhetoric and the\u00a0 evaluation research literature. Reasons for this are explored, including that there are two stakeholder groups, one with exaggerated ideological anti-drug messages and the other with more realistic perspectives about what schools can reasonably achieve. The paradox is that the rhetoric is needed for continued funding, yet this same rhetoric sets up criteria which doom drug education to failure."

Thus, macrophages can be exploited as Trojan horses for targeted drug delivery. Nanocarriers can migrate across the different membrane barriers and release their drug cargo at sites of infection. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the current status and utilization of various micro- as well as nanocarriers like microspheres/microparticles, liposomes, nanoparticles, dendrimers, niosomes, and carbon nanotubes for targeted delivery of bioactives to the macrophages. EXPERT OPINION: The design of nanocarriers for cell-mediated drug delivery may differ from those used for conventional drug delivery systems. The literature review shows that nanocarriers could supplement sustained drug delivery to the macrophages, extended duration of action, reduced therapeutic dose, improved patient compliance, and reduced adverse effects of highly toxic, potent drugs. There is still a need to identify more specific receptors that are responsible for macrophage targeting. The identification of such receptors may also facilitate drug targeting to further specific parts of the body containing different types of macrophages."

Utilizing a robust quantitative PCR array, we quantified expression of 94 human GPCRs, including 75 orphan GPCRs and 19 chemokine receptors, and 36 chemokine ligands, in 40 melanoma metastases from different individuals and benign nevi. Inter-metastatic site comparison revealed that orphan GPR174 and CCL28 are statistically significantly overexpressed in subcutaneous metastases, while P2RY5 is overexpressed in brain metastases. Comparison between metastases (all three metastatic sites) and benign nevi revealed that 16 genes, including six orphan receptors (GPR18, GPR34, GPR119, GPR160, GPR183 and P2RY10) and chemokine receptors CCR5, CXCR4, and CXCR6, were statistically significantly differentially expressed. Subsequent functional experiments in yeast and melanoma cells indicate that GPR18, the most abundantly overexpressed orphan GPCR in all melanoma metastases, is constitutively active and inhibits apoptosis, indicating an important role for GPR18 in tumor cell survival. GPR18 and five other orphan GPCRs with yet unknown biological function may be considered potential novel anticancer targets in metastatic melanoma."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Acquired drug resistance continues to be one of the major obstacles hindering the successful treatment of many forms of cancer. Compounds utilized as antagonists of these cytoprotective mechanisms have, for the most part, proven to be ineffective at overcoming clinical resistance to cytotoxic drugs. Recently, the tumor cell microenvironment has been found to have a significant bearing on the survival of tumor cells following exposure to a wide variety of anti-neoplastic agents, prior to the acquisition of known drug resistance mechanisms. Specifically, interactions between cell surface integrins and extracellular matrix components have been shown to be responsible for this phenomenon of innate drug resistance, which we have termed Cell Adhesion Mediated Drug Resistance, or CAM-DR. Following its discovery using a multiple myeloma cell line model, evidence for CAM-DR has been found in a multitude of other human tumor cell types. In contrast to many other drug resistance mechanisms, integrin-mediated cell signaling is capable of protecting against death induced by an extremely wide variety of structurally and functionally diverse agents from traditional DNA damaging agents to the promising novel kinase inhibitor STI-571. This review examines the role of integrins in regard to their ability to protect tumor cells from drug- and radiation-induced apoptosis through numerous intracellular mechanisms. Current and future antagonists of specific integrin heterodimers may have the potential to sensitize tumor cells when used in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens. Specific signal transduction pathways initiated by integrin ligation will also be discussed as potential bridge points for inhibiting cell survival during cytotoxic drug exposure."

Antipsychotic drugs have revolutionised the therapy and management of schizophrenia. However, patient compliance rates are notoriously poor due to the nature of the disease and troublesome side-effects, and are major causes of symptom recurrence. Although some new antipsychotic agents have been marketed to offer broader efficacy with much reduced side-effect profiles, the drug delivery systems for antipsychotics are still in the stage of conventional dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules and solutions, and need to be dosed at the frequency of 2-4 times daily. Doubtless. novel drug delivery systems, such as sustained and controlled release systems, will be useful for antipsychotics. They should reduce the frequency of dosing. enhance drug bioavailability and improve patient compliance. In this article, the specificity and characterisation of schizophrenia and pathophysiology. drug therapy. and the development and future prospects of neuroleptic drug delivery systems are reviewed."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prescription drugs or drug classes that are most frequently associated with death in the US might be identifiable from death certificate data. OBJECTIVE: To identify the drugs/drug classes associated with the greatest numbers of deaths in the US that might be considered as possible targets for prevention. STUDY DESIGN: US vital statistics data were accessed in order to identify International Classification of Diseases (10th Revision) [ICD-10] codes indicating that prescription drugs had caused or contributed to death and diseases with significant drug-related mortality. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: ICD-10 codes for primarily prescription drugs that were listed as the underlying cause or as 'total mentions' on death certificates and were implicated in >or=1000 deaths in any one year were selected. The annual number of deaths by ICD-10 code was obtained from the Division of Vital Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics. Codes for diseases with significant drug-related aetiologies and involvement in >or=1000 deaths in any one year were also identified and analysed separately. RESULTS: For the selected ICD-10 codes, a total of 25 031 deaths were listed as having a prescription drug as the underlying cause in 2003, compared with 16 135 in 1999, a 55% increase. Total mentions of these codes increased from 46 523 in 1999 to 72 080 in 2003, also a 55% increase. Most codes involved 'poisonings' (overdose or the wrong substance given or taken in error that is accidental, intentional or with undetermined intent). Drugs associated with poisoning deaths had central nervous system effects. Among the codes associated with specified drug classes, poisonings and accidental poisonings involving narcotics, hallucinogens, psychoactive substances and opioids (other than opium and heroin) were associated with the largest numbers of deaths. Drug-related codes associated with the largest percentage increases in deaths between 1999 and 2003 included poisoning due to methadone (275%); poisoning by other and unspecified antidepressants (primarily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [130%]; and poisoning by psychostimulants with potential for abuse (amfetamines and drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) [117%]. Anticoagulants were associated with the largest numbers of deaths with codes involving \"adverse effects in therapeutic use\". Among diseases with significant drug-related aetiologies, Clostridium difficile enterocolitis (associated primarily with antibacterials) had the largest percentage increase in total mentions, with a 203% rise between 1999 and 2003. CONCLUSIONS: Deaths due to overdoses are the most prominent cause of drug-related mortality in death certificate data. Certain drugs and drug classes, especially the opioids (e.g. narcotics, methadone), psychoactive drugs (e.g. antidepressants, amfetamines), anticoagulants and antibacterials (which cause or contribute to C. difficile enterocolitis) are associated with large and increasing numbers of deaths and preventive strategies should be considered."

The microcapsules also have a mucoadhesive property. Ion-exchange resin particles can be loaded with bicarbonate followed by acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) and coated with CAB by emulsion solvent evaporation method. The drug concentration was monitored to maintain the floating property and minimum effective concentration. The effect of CAB: drug-resin ratio (2:1, 4:1, 6:1 w/w) on the particle size, floating time, and drug release was determined. Cholestyramine microcapsules were characterized for shape, surface characteristics, and size distribution; cholestyramine/acetohydroxamic acid interactions inside microcapsules were investigated by X-ray diffractometry. The buoyancy time of CAB-coated formulations was better than that of uncoated resin particles. Also, a longer floating time was observed with a higher polymer:drug resin complex ratio (6:1). With increasing coating thickness the particle size was increased but drug release rate was decreased. The drug release rate was higher in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) than in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). The in vivo mucoadhesion studies were performed with rhodamine-isothiocyanate (RITC) by fluorescent probe method. The amount of CAB-coated cholestyramine microcapsules that remained in the stomach was slightly lower than that of uncoated resin particles. Cholestyramine microcapsules were distributed throughout the stomach and exhibited prolonged gastric residence via mucoadhesion. These results suggest that CAB-coated microcapsules could be a floating as well as a mucoadhesive drug delivery system. Thus, it has promise in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori."

So far merely single target structures which attribute to the AD progression have been considered to develop specific drugs. However, such drug developments have been disappointing in clinical stages. Multitargeting of more than one target structure determines recent studies of developing novel lead compounds. Protein kinases have been identified to contribute to the neuronal decay with CDK1, GSK-3\u03b2 and CDK5/p25 being involved in a pathological tau protein hyperphosphorylation. We discovered novel lead structures of the dihydroxy-1-aza-9-oxafluorene type with nanomolar activities against CDK1, GSK-3\u03b2 and CDK5/p25. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) of the protein kinase inhibition are discussed within our first compound series. One nanomolar active compound profiled as selective protein kinase inhibitor. Bioanalysis of a harmless cellular toxicity and of the inhibition of tau protein phosphorylation qualifies the compound for further studies. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

To date, three generations of polymeric micellar delivery systems, i.e. polymeric micelles for passive, active and multifunctional drug targeting, have arisen from research efforts, with each subsequent generation displaying greater specificity for the diseased tissue and/or targeting efficiency. The present manuscript aims to review the research efforts made for the development of each generation and provide an assessment on the overall success of polymeric micellar delivery system in drug targeting. The emphasis is placed on the design and development of ligand modified, stimuli responsive and multifunctional polymeric micelles for drug targeting."

We also studied the effect of gossypol, a natural polyphenolic cotton-seed extract, on the angiogenic cytokine profile of these cell lines. XTT cell proliferation assay was used for the assessment of cytotoxicity. For apoptosis, both histone-DNA fragmentation by ELISA assay and caspase 3/7 activity measurement were used. Angiogenic cytokine profiles of supernatants from both cell lines, before and after treatment with gossypol, were investigated using the human angiogenesis antibody array I. It was shown that the two different hormone- and drug-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145, constitutively express some important angiogenic cytokines, which are known to regulate tumorigenicity and angiogenesis in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. However, PC-3 and DU-145 cells have distinct angiogenic cytokine profiles. In addition, these two cells lines respond differently to gossypol treatment in terms of cytotoxicity and angiogenic cytokine secretion. After treatment with 10 microM of gossypol, there was a 1.5-fold decrease in angiogenin and IL-8 levels and a 1.7- and 1.8-fold decrease in ENA-78 and GRO-alpha levels respectively, in DU-145 cells. For PC-3 cells, there were 1.6- and 1.8-fold decreases in IL-8 and VEGF levels, respectively. We conclude that PC-3 and DU-145 cells secrete significant amounts of different angiogenic cytokines that may explain their aggressive nature and metastatic potential. Gossypol treatment affects angiogenic cytokine secretion from these two cell lines in a different manner. By expanding our knowledge of the heterogeneous biological behavior of these two cell lines, novel treatment approaches can be developed for the treatment of prostate cancer."

Hence, the existence of cyclin D1-negative MCL has been controversial and difficult to substantiate. Our previous gene expression profiling study identified several cases that lacked cyclin D1 expression, but had a gene expression signature typical of MCL. Herein, we report the clinical, pathologic, and genetic features of 6 cases of cyclin D1-negative MCL. All 6 cases exhibited the characteristic morphologic features and the unique gene expression signature of MCL but lacked the t(11;14)(q13; q32) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The tumor cells also failed to express cyclin D1 protein, but instead expressed either cyclin D2 (2 cases) or cyclin D3 (4 cases). There was good correlation between cyclin D protein expression and the corresponding mRNA expression levels by gene expression analysis. Using interphase FISH, we did not detect chromosomal translocations or amplifications involving CCND2 and CCND3 loci in these cases. Patients with cyclin D1-negative MCL were similar clinically to those with cyclin D1-positive MCL. In conclusion, cases of cyclin D1-negative MCL do exist and are part of the spectrum of MCL. Up-regulation of cyclin D2 or D3 may substitute for cyclin D1 in the pathogenesis of MCL."

Assembly of the capsular systems consisted of push, active and plug tablet arranged from bottom to top in hard gelatin capsule. The capsule system was coated with a semi-permeable membrane of cellulose acetate and drilled towards plug side in cap. A three-factor, three-level central composite design (CCD) with alpha = 1 was introduced to execute the experiments and quadratic polynomial model was generated to predict and assess the independent variables with respect to the dependent variables. The composition of optimal formulation was determined as weight of push tablet 138 mg (coded value: +0.59), plug tablet 60 mg (coded value: +0.49) and coating weight gain of 8.4 mg (coded value: -0.82). The results showed that the optimal formulation of PRCs had lag time of 4.5 h, release at 6 and 12 h are 61.95% and 96.29%, respectively. The X-ray radiographic imaging study was carried out to monitor the in vivo behavior of developed barium sulfate-loaded PRCs in rabbits under fasting conditions. In vivo pharmacokinetic study revealed Tmax of 2 h for marketed tablets; however 7 h for PRCs with initial lag time of 4 h. Thus designed capsular system may be helpful for patients with episodic attack of asthma in early morning and associated allergic rhinitis."

A central composite design was applied for optimization of the formulation parameters and for studying the effects of three independent variables: PLGA concentration, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) concentration and organic solvent removal rate on the particle size and the entrapment efficiency (response variables). Second-order models were obtained to adequately describe the influence of the independent variables on the selected responses. The analysis of variance showed that the three independent variables had significant effects (p < 0.05) on the responses. The experimental results were in perfect accordance with the predictions estimated by the models. Using the desirability approach and overlay contour plots, the optimal preparation area can be highlighted. It was found that the optimum values of the responses could be obtained at higher concentration of PLGA (5%, w/v) and PVA (6%, w/v); and faster organic solvent removal rate (700 rpm). The corresponding particle size was 256.2 nm and the entrapment efficiency was 62.19%. FTIR investigation confirmed that the L-DOPA and PLGA polymer maintained its backbone structure in the fabrication of nanoparticles. The scanning electron microscopic images of nanoparticles showed that all particles had spherical shape with porous outer skin. The results suggested that PLGA nanoparticles might represent a promising formulation for brain delivery of L-DOPA. The preparation of L-DOPA loaded PLGA nanoparticles can be optimized by the central composite design."

The barriers that limit the concentration of toxins and xenobiotics in the interstitial fluids of the CNS are the capillary endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the epithelial cells of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Both of these barriers have cellular tight junctions and express transport systems which serve to actively transport nutrients into the brain, and actively efflux toxic metabolites and xenobiotics out of the brain. This review will focus on the expression and function of selected drug efflux transporters in these two barriers, specifically the multidrug resistance transporter, p-glycoprotein, and various organic anion transporters, such as multidrug resistance-associated proteins, organic anion transporter polypeptides, and organic anion transporters. These transport systems are increasingly recognized as important determinants of drug distribution to, and elimination from, different compartments of the CNS. Consequences of drug efflux transporters in barriers of the CNS include limiting the distribution of substrates that are beneficial to treat CNS diseases, and increasing the possibility of drug-drug interactions that may lead to untoward toxicities. Therefore, the study of these transporters is important in examining the various determinants of drug delivery to the CNS."

Therefore, we investigate four common profiling problems (heap usage, object lifetime, wasted time and time-spent) and report on how well AspectJ handles them. For each, we provide an efficient implementation, discuss any trade-offs or limitations and present the results of an experimental evaluation into the costs of using it. Our conclusions are mixed. On the one hand, we find that AspectJ is sufficiently expressive to describe the four profiling problems and reasonably efficient in most cases. On the other hand, we find several limitations with the current AspectJ implementation that severely hamper its suitability for profiling. Copyright \u00a9 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

        "abstract": "Intestinal phase I metabolism and active extrusion of absorbed drug have only recently been recognized as major determinants of oral drug bioavailability. Both CYP3A4, the major phase I drug metabolizing enzyme in humans, and the multidrug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), are present at high levels in the villus enterocytes of the small intestine, the primary site of absorption for orally administered drugs. Moreover, these proteins are induced by many of the same compounds and demonstrate a broad overlap in substrate and inhibitor specificities, suggesting that they act as a concerted barrier to drug absorption. Clinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated intestinal metabolism can significantly improve the oral bioavailability of a wide range of drugs. Intestinal P-gp is a major route of elimination for both orally and intravenously administered anticancer drugs in animal models, and experiements with the Caco-2 cell line have provided strong evidence that inhibition of intestinal P-gp is another means by which oral drug bioavailability could be enhanced. \u00a9 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V."

        "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that occur via mechanism-based inactivation of cytochrome P450 are of serious concern. Although several predictive models have been published, early risk assessment of MBIs is still challenging. For reversible inhibitors, the DDI risk categorization using [I]/K(i) ([I], the inhibitor concentration; K(i), the inhibition constant) is widely used in drug discovery and development. Although a simple and reliable methodology such as [I]/K(i) categorization for reversible inhibitors would be useful for mechanism-based inhibitors (MBIs), comprehensive analysis of an analogous measure reflecting in vitro potency for inactivation has not been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the term \u03bb/k(deg) (\u03bb, first-order inactivation rate at a given MBI concentration; k(deg), enzyme degradation rate constant) would be useful in the prediction of the in vivo DDI risk of MBIs. Twenty-one MBIs with both in vivo area under the curve (AUC) change of marker substrates and in vitro inactivation parameters were identified in the literature and analyzed. The results of this analysis show that in vivo DDIs with >2-fold change of object drug AUC can be identified with the cutoff value of \u03bb/k(deg) = 1, where unbound steady-state C(max) is used for inhibitor concentration. However, the use of total C(max) led to great overprediction of DDI risk. The risk assessment using \u03bb/k(deg) coupled with unbound C(max) can be useful for the DDI risk evaluation of MBIs in drug discovery and development."

The buccal mucosa, however, while avoiding first-pass effects, is a formidable barrier to drug absorption, especially for biopharmaceutical products (proteins and oligonucleotides) arising from the recent advances in genomics and proteomics. The buccal route is typically used for extended drug delivery, so formulations that can be attached to the buccal mucosa are favoured. The bioadhesive polymers used in buccal drug delivery to retain a formulation are typically hydrophilic macro-molecules containing numerous hydrogen bonding groups. Newer second-generation bioadhesives have been developed and these include modified or new polymers that allow enhanced adhesion and/or drug delivery, in addition to site-specific ligands such as lectins. Over the last 20 years a wide range of formulations has been developed for buccal drug delivery (tablet, patch, liquids and semisolids) but comparatively few have found their way onto the market. Currently, this route is restricted to the delivery of a limited number of small lipophilic molecules that readily cross the buccal mucosa. However, this route could become a significant means for the delivery of a range of active agents in the coming years, if the barriers to buccal drug delivery are overcome. In particular, patient acceptability and the successful systemic delivery of large molecules (proteins, oligonucleotides and polysaccharides) via this route remains both a significant opportunity and challenge, and new/improved technologies may be required to address these."

        "abstract": "Abstract To further develop cholesterol-modified pullulan self-aggregated nanoparticles (CHSPNs) as a drug nanocarrier, CHSP was synthesized and characterized. Its cholesterol degree determined by (1)H NMR was 5.2 cholesterol groups per hundred glucose units. CHSPNs were prepared in aqueous media and characterized by dynamic laser light-scattering (DLS), zeta potential and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These nanoparticles were almost spherical in shape, and the zeta potentials of CHSPNs were near zero in aqueous media. CHSPNs can be stable at least 2 months with no significant size and zeta potential changes. Single dose toxicity test in mice was investigated for the safety evaluation of CHSPNs as a drug nanocarrier, and the result showed CHSPNs were well tolerated at the dose of 200\u2009mg/kg in mice. Epirubicin (EPI)-loaded CHSPNs (EPI-CHSPNs) were prepared and the in vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution were studied. Compared with the EPI solution, EPI-CHSPNs have exhibited higher plasma drug concentration, longer half-life time (t1/2) and the larger area under-the-curve (AUC). Moreover, the drug level of EPI-CHSPNs increased in liver and decreased in heart. The results indicated that CHSPNs were stable, safe and may be a promising drug delivery carrier."

Beads were prepared by simple ionic cross-linking with sodium tripolyphoshate and coated with alginate and/or chitosan to prepare single, double, or multilayered beads. The water uptake capacity depended on the nature of beads (coated or uncoated) and pH of test medium. The number of coatings given to the beads influenced ciprofloxacin release rate. The coating significantly decreased the drug release from the beads in comparison to uncoated beads (p < 0.001). When the beads were given three coatings, viz., alginate, chitosan, and again alginate, the drug release appeared to follow the pattern exhibited by colon-targeted drug delivery systems with time dependent release behavior. The increase in coating formed a barrier for easy ingress of dissolution medium into the bead matrix, reducing the diffusion of drug."

        "abstract": "Drug-eluting stents (DESs) have been associated with adverse clinical effects. Moreover, recent publications have shown that the coating of DESs suffers from defects. The purpose of this contribution is to examine a three-step process for surface modification as a means of improving the durability of DESs. In the first step, 4-(2-bromoethyl)benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate was electrografted onto a stainless steel (SS) stent. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the modified stent confirmed the formation of the organic layer. In the second step, methyl methacrylate was polymerized onto the grafted surface by atom-transfer radical polymerization. XPS, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and contact-angle measurements were used to characterize the polymer brushes. The last step involved spray-coating of the stent with a drug-in-polymer matrix poly(n-butyl methacrylate)/poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) + paclitaxel. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the considerably improved durability of the drug-in-polymer matrix. Bare controls showed greater cracking and delamination of the coating than did the two-step modified stents after incubation under physiological (37 \u00c2C) and accelerated (60 \u00c2C) conditions. Finally, paclitaxel controlled release from the modified SS DESs was moderate compared with that of nontreated samples. In conclusion, the proposed method significantly improves the durability of drug-in-polymer matrixes on a SS DESs."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Meta-analysis has increasingly been used to identify adverse effects of drugs and vaccines, but the results have often been controversial. In one respect, meta-analysis is an especially appropriate tool in these settings. Efficacy studies are often too small to reliably assess risks that become important when a medication is in widespread use, so meta-analysis, which is a statistically efficient way to pool evidence from similar studies, seems like a natural approach. But, as the examples in this paper illustrate, different syntheses can come to qualitatively different conclusions, and the results of any one analysis are usually not as precise as they seem to be. There are three reasons for this: the adverse events of interest are rare, standard meta-analysis methods may not be appropriate for the clinical and methodological heterogeneity that is common in these studies, and adverse effects are not always completely or consistently reported. To address these problems, analysts should explore heterogeneity and use random-effects or more complex statistical methods, and use multiple statistical models to see how dependent the results are to the choice of models."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the frequency, severity and preventability of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in paediatric patients during the 6-year period from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1999. METHODS: Data on patient demographics, documented allergies, suspected drug, American Hospital Formulary Service drug classification and dosage regimen were collected retrospectively from ADRs reported to a hospital surveillance programme. ADRs were categorised by severity, preventability and causality. Analysis was conducted by Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann-Whitney) tests. RESULTS: During the 6-year period, 565 ADRs were reported at a rate of 0.85 ADRs per 100 admissions. The mean patient age was 9.6 years. No history of allergies was documented in 87.4% of the cases, although 2.8% of patients had a documented allergy to the suspected medication. Opioids (narcotics) [n = 65, 11.5%], anticonvulsants (n = 67, 11.9%) and antibiotics (n = 149, 26.4%) were the most frequently implicated drug classes. Over 50% of the reported ADRs resulted in treatment intervention and/or temporary patient harm and of these, 73% required drug therapy. Causality was classified as 'definite' (44.1%), 'probable' (49.9%) or 'possible' (6.0%). Of the reported ADRs, 20.7% were preventable. CONCLUSIONS: ADRs resulted in treatment intervention or temporary patient discomfort in >50% of patients. The incidence of preventable ADRs is similar to that found in adult literature. No single drug caused >5% of reported ADRs. Opioids, anticonvulsants and antibiotics were the most common drug classes associated with ADRs. Thus, strategies targeting these drug classes and interventions during the medication ordering and administration processes may reduce the number of ADRs and possibly the associated costs. Even though preventable ADRs may not be entirely eliminated, the goal should be to increase ADR awareness and encourage early detection and intervention to minimise patient discomfort."

The entire genome sequences of P. falciparum and the rodent malaria parasite, P. yoelii yoelii are now available. Extensive genome sequence data from other Plasmodium species including another important human malaria parasite, P. vivax are also available. Powerful research techniques coupled to genomic resources are needed to help identify new drug and vaccine targets against malaria. Applied to Plasmodium, proteomics combines high-resolution protein or peptide separation with mass spectrometry and computer software to rapidly identify large numbers of proteins expressed from various stages of parasite development. Proteomic methods can be applied to study sub-cellular localization, cell function, organelle composition, changes in protein expression patterns in response to drug exposure, drug-protein binding and validation of data from genomic annotation and transcript expression studies. Recent high-throughput proteomic approaches have provided a wealth of protein expression data on P. falciparum, while smaller-scale studies examining specific drug-related hypotheses are also appearing. Of particular interest is the study of mechanisms of action and resistance of drugs such as the quinolines, whose targets currently may not be predictable from genomic data. Coupling the Plasmodium sequence data with bioinformatics, proteomics and RNA transcript expression profiling opens unprecedented opportunities for exploring new malaria control strategies. This review will focus on pharmacological research in malaria and other intracellular parasites using proteomic techniques, emphasizing resources and strategies available for Plasmodium."

METHODS The chosen drug groups were the intravenous induction agents, the neuromuscular blocking drugs and neostigmine, the inhalational anaesthetic agents and nitrous oxide, local anaesthetic agents and a selection of analgesics agents, naloxone and midazolam and its antagonist flumazenil. From each drug file, the number and type of reactions were analysed. Mortality was calculated as a percentage of the number of deaths against patient reports. RESULTS A total of 11,199 reactions were analysed from 6603 patients of whom 620 (9%) died. Few drug records reported reactions from multiple constituent formulations. The majority of reactions were not allergic. The highest mortality was in the inhalational anaesthetic group. Although the greatest number of fatal events was associated with halothane, this drug is no longer used. Nevertheless the percentage remains high because cardiovascular mortality is still being reported. Local anaesthetic use was associated with the smallest percentage mortality (3%). The highest reported number of reactions was associated with the intravenous induction agents and idiosyncratic neurological and peripheral vascular reactions were linked with the use of etomidate. CONCLUSIONS The reporting of allergic reactions was low. The data demonstrate that induction of anaesthesia presents the highest risk of adverse drug reaction; there is also mortality from newer drugs for example, desflurane, remifentanil as well as from drugs for which there is no alternative, for example, suxamethonium."

METHODS: Retrospective observational study of hospitalized adults receiving systemic antifungal treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in the infectious diseases unit (IDU) of the University Hospital of Bordeaux, France between 1996 and 2001. All treatment episodes with antifungal agent were examined and all prescribed concomitant medication identified for potential drug-drug interactions (PDDI)-serious events occurring during treatment were adjudicated for clinical DDI. RESULTS: There were 150 treatment episodes with antifungal agent in 105 patients. Fluconazole was used in 48% of the treatment episodes, amphotericin B in 46%, itraconazole in 4.7% and flucytosine in 1.3%. One hundred and sixteen PDDIs were identified related to the use of amphotericin B (81.0%), fluconazole (17.2%) or itraconazole (1.7%). Of these, 22 were associated with a clinical evidence of adverse interaction (hypokalemia, increased creatininemia or nephrotoxicity). All these clinical drug-drug interactions (CDDIs) were with amphotericin B. They were due to furosemide (36.4%), cyclosporine (31.8%) and hydrocortisone (18.2%). PDDIs were mostly associated with leukaemia (40.4%), HIV infection (24.6%) and cancer (10.5%). CONCLUSIONS: In ICU and IDU, systemic antifungal treatments lead to many PDDIs, mainly related to the type of antifungal used and to the pathology treated. Clinical DDI seem more common with amphotericin."

We present a method that can be used to optimize the selectivity profile of a compound using historical kinase profiling data. This method proposes chemical transformations based on pairs of very similar compounds, which are both active against a desired target kinase and differ in activity against another kinase.

However, presence of several layers of permeation barriers starting from the tear film till the inner layers of cornea make it difficult to achieve the therapeutic concentrations in the target tissue within the eye. In order to circumvent these barriers and to provide sustained and targeted drug delivery, tremendous advances have been made in developing efficient and safe drug delivery systems. Liposomes due to their unique structure prove to be extremely beneficial drug carriers as they can entrap both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. The conventional liposomes had several drawbacks particularly their tendency to aggregate, the instability and leakage of entrapped drug and susceptibility to phagocytosis. Due to this reason, for a long time, liposomes as drug delivery systems did not attract much attention of researchers and clinicians. However, over recent years development of new generation liposomes has opened up new approaches for targeted and sustained drug delivery using liposomes and has rejuvenated the interest of researchers in this field. In this review we present a summary of current literature to understand the anatomical and physiological limitation in achieving adequate ocular bioavailability of topically applied drugs and utility of liposomes in overcoming these limitations. The recent developments related to new generation liposomes are discussed."

        "abstract": "Photo-induced drug eruptions are cutaneous adverse events due to exposure to a drug and either ultraviolet or visible radiation. Based on their pathogenesis, they can be classified as phototoxic or photoallergic drug eruptions, although in many cases it is not possible to determine whether a particular eruption is due to a phototoxic or photoallergic mechanism. In this review, the diagnosis, prevention and management of drug-induced photosensitivity are discussed. Diagnosis is based primarily on the history of drug intake and the clinical appearance of the eruption, primarily affecting sun-exposed areas of the skin. Phototesting and photopatch testing can be useful adjuncts in making a diagnosis. The mainstay of management is prevention, including informing patients of the possibility of increased sun sensitivity and the use of sun protective measures. However, once the eruption has occurred, it may be necessary to discontinue the culprit medication and treat the eruption with a potent topical corticosteroid. Drugs that have been implicated in causing photosensitive eruptions are reviewed. Tetracycline, doxycycline, nalidixic acid, voriconazole, amiodarone, hydrochlorothiazide, naproxen, piroxicam, chlorpromazine and thioridazine are among the most commonly implicated medications. We review the medical literature regarding evidence for the culpability of each drug, including the results of phototesting, photopatch testing and rechallenge testing."

        "abstract": "Structure-based (SBDD) and ligand-based (LBDD) drug design are extremely important and active areas of research in both the academic and commercial realms. This book provides a complete snapshot of the field of computer-aided drug design and associated experimental approaches. Topics covered include X-ray crystallography, NMR, fragment-based drug design, free energy methods, docking and scoring, linear-scaling quantum calculations, QSAR, pharmacophore methods, computational ADME-Tox, and drug discovery case studies. A variety of authors from academic and commercial institutions all over the world have contributed to this book, which is illustrated with more than 200 images. This is the only book to cover the subject of structure and ligand-based drug design, and it provides the most up-to-date information on a wide range of topics for the practising computational chemist, medicinal chemist, or structural biologist. Professor Kenneth Merz has been selected as the recipient of the 2010 ACS Award for Computers in Chemical & Pharmaceutical Research that recognizes the advances he has made in the use of quantum mechanics to solve biological and drug discovery problems."

        "abstract": "Cancer has become one of the most difficult health challenges of our time, accounting for millions of deaths yearly. Systemic chemotherapy is the most common therapeutic approach; however, considerable limitations exist including toxicities to healthy tissues and low achievable drug concentrations at tumor sites. More than 85% of human cancers are solid tumors, which can greatly benefit from localized delivery. This approach allows for high drug concentrations at the target site, lower systemic toxicity, and extended drug exposure which may be beneficial for cell cycle-specific drugs. Polymers have been widely considered in the development of localized delivery systems. This review focuses on both natural and synthetic biodegradable polymers that have been explored for localized chemotherapy, exploring their advantages, disadvantages, and clinical potential while citing examples of their use in pre-clinical development."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Quinine has been employed in the treatment of malaria for centuries and is still used against severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, its interactions with the parasite remain poorly understood and subject to debate. In this study, we used the Saccharomyces cerevisiae eukaryotic model to better understand quinine's mode of action and the mechanisms underlying the cell response to the drug. We obtained a transcriptomic profile of the yeast's early response to quinine, evidencing a marked activation of genes involved in the low-glucose response (e.g., CAT8, ADR1, MAL33, MTH1, and SNF3). We used a low inhibitory quinine concentration with no detectable effect on plasma membrane function, consistent with the absence of a general nutrient starvation response and suggesting that quinine-induced glucose limitation is a specific response. We have further shown that transport of [(14)C]glucose is inhibited by quinine, with kinetic data indicating competitive inhibition. Also, tested mutant strains deleted for genes encoding high- and low-affinity hexose transporters (HXT1 to HXT5, HXT8, and HXT10) exhibit resistance phenotypes, correlating with reduced levels of quinine accumulation in the mutants examined. These results suggest that the hexose transporters are facilitators of quinine uptake in S. cerevisiae, possibly through a competitive inhibition mechanism. Interestingly, P. falciparum is highly dependent on glucose uptake, which is mediated by the single-copy transporter PfHT1, a protein with high homology to yeast's hexose transporters. We propose that PfHT1 is an interesting candidate quinine target possibly involved in quinine import in P. falciparum, an uptake mechanism postulated in recent studies to occur through a still-unidentified importer(s)."

In this work, we developed a GC-MS method to investigate the metabolites in mice brain which was used to study the mechanism of context-dependent learning associated with rewarding effect of morphine. Metabolites were extracted from brain tissues and derivatized followed by analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In total, 69 peaks were identified as known compounds. By a Wilcoxon ran sum test with p value ???0.05, 21 metabolites were selected and considered as the potential biomarkers of morphine in mice brain. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves, a model was constructed with a combination of these 21 metabolic markers. Multivariate statistics of the model yielded separation between the two groups with an area under the curve value of 0.947. Some metabolites were further discussed in detail about their pathway. Results showed that our technique can be successfully applied to profile for biomarkers and in understanding molecular mechanisms of drug abuse. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V."

The drug, which is available for both oral and intravenous administration, has broad-spectrum activity against pathogenic yeasts, dimorphic fungi, and opportunistic molds. Voriconazole has a nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile with a wide inter- and intraindividual variety. This variability is caused by many factors such as gender, age, genotypic variation, liver dysfunction, the presence of food, and so on. Another important factor influencing voriconazole's pharmacokinetic profile is drug-drug interactions with CYP450 inhibitors as well as inducers. Variability in plasma concentrations, as a result of the previously mentioned aspects, may lead to variability in efficacy or toxicity. Determination of plasma concentrations is indicated in situations to guide dosing and to individualize and improve the treatment options resulting in better therapeutic outcome or fewer side effects. In this article, we review factors influencing voriconazole pharmacokinetic profile, the data supporting exposure-effect and exposure-toxicity relationships, review the gaps in current knowledge, which make broad recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring difficult for voriconazole, provide the indications in which therapeutic drug monitoring is reasonable based on currently available data (eg, children), and outline the ways in which this problem could be solved. We provide a summary of the problem so that further research can be conducted to address this are of clinical need."

        "abstract": "Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol that is often used as a food supplement. Many positive health effects, including cardio protection, tumor suppression, and immune modulation, are associated with the intake of resveratrol. Resveratrol is well tolerated in healthy subjects without any comedication. However, supplemental doses of resveratrol in the range of 1 g/day or above by far exceed the natural intake through food. Whether resveratrol-drug interactions can be harmful in patients taking additional medications remains unknown. Recent in vivo studies and clinical trials indicate a possible drug-drug interaction potential using high-dosage formulations. In this review, the known in vitro and in vivo effects of resveratrol on various cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes are summarized. They are discussed in relation to clinically relevant plasma concentrations in humans. We conclude that resveratrol may lead to interactions with various CYPs, especially when taken in high doses. Aside from systemic CYP inhibition, intestinal interactions must also be considered. They can potentially lead to reduced first-pass metabolism, resulting in higher systemic exposure to certain coadministrated CYP substrates. Therefore, patients who ingest high doses of this food supplement combined with additional medications may be at risk of experiencing clinically relevant drug-drug interactions."

It has been proposed to guide therapy in pregnant women, in whom physiological changes may lead to altered pharmacokinetics resulting in difficulty in predicting the appropriate drug dosage. Ideally, TDM may play a role in enhancing the effectiveness of treatment while minimizing toxicity of both the mother and fetus. Monitoring of drug levels may also be helpful in assessing adherence to prescribed therapy in selected cases. Limitations exist as therapeutic ranges have only been defined for a limited number of drugs and are based on data obtained in nonpregnant patients. TDM has been suggested for anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antiretroviral drugs, based on pharmacokinetic studies that have shown reduced drug concentrations. However, there is only relatively limited (and sometimes inconsistent) information regarding the clinical impact of these pharmacokinetic changes during pregnancy and the effect of subsequent dose adjustments. Further studies are required to determine whether implementation of TDM during pregnancy improves outcome and is associated with any benefit beyond that achieved by clinical judgment alone. The cost effectiveness of TDM programs during pregnancy also remains to be examined."

This is particularly important in cancer therapy, where antitumor drugs are highly cytotoxic and often exert their therapeutic effect at concentrations close to systemic toxicity. In the last years a growing number of studies has started to report the use of plasmonic nanoprobes in the field of theranostics, broadening the application of vibrational spectroscopies like Raman scattering and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) in biomedicine. The present work aims to identify and characterize the vibrational profiles of a widely used anticancer drug, irinotecan (CPT-11). With a rational approach, SERS experiments have been performed on this analyte employing both Au and Ag colloids, starting from simple aqueous solutions up to albumin mixtures. A major step forward for drug detection in albumin solutions has been taken with the adoption of a simple deproteinization strategy, and a two-in-one-step separation and identification by coupling thin layer chromatography, TLC, with SERS (TLC-SERS). The latter has revealed to be a valid system for protein separation and simultaneous analyte detection, showing a potential to become an innovative, sensitive and low cost method for antineoplastic drug profiling in patients' body fluids."

This lipophilic compound is characterized by high in vitro antifungal activity and low acute toxicity. For the purpose of in vivo studies, a new bioanalytical high-performance liquid chromatographic method with UV photodiode-array and mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-PDA-MS), involving a direct injection of diluted mouse urine was developed and used in the evaluation of the metabolic profiling of this drug candidate. The separation of LNO-18-22 and its phase I metabolites was performed in 37 min on a 125 mmx4 mm chromatographic column with Purospher RP-18e using an acetonitrile-water gradient elution. Scan mode of UV detection (195-380 nm) was employed for the identification of the parent compound and its biotransformation products in the biomatrix. Finally, the identity of LNO-18-22 and its metabolites was confirmed using HPLC-MS analyses of the eluate. These experiments demonstrated the power of a comprehensive analytical approach based on the combination of xenobiochemical methods and the results from tandem HPLC-PDA-MS (chromatographic behaviour, UV and MS spectra of native metabolites versus synthetic standards). The chemical structures of five phase I LNO-18-22 metabolites and one phase II metabolite were elucidated in the mouse urine, with two of these metabolites having very unexpected structures."

To date, three generations of polymeric micellar delivery systems, i.e. polymeric micelles for passive, active and multifunctional drug targeting, have arisen from research efforts, with each subsequent generation displaying greater specificity for the diseased tissue and/or targeting efficiency. The present manuscript aims to review the research efforts made for the development of each generation and provide an assessment on the overall success of polymeric micellar delivery system in drug targeting. The emphasis is placed on the design and development of ligand modified, stimuli responsive and multifunctional polymeric micelles for drug targeting."

Methods: BCRP expression was verified by immunostaining and Western blots in intact porcine brain capillaries, isolated endothelial cells (PBCECs) and in MDCKII-cells over-expressing human wild-type BCRP (MDCKII-hBCRP). Transport of fluorescent mitoxantrone across cells was determined to assess a preferred transport direction. Sensitivity of cultured cells versus mitoxantrone in the absence and in the presence of transport modulators was examined at increasing concentrations of the cytostatic using the AlamarBlue\u2122 assay. In addition, cells were incubated with mitoxantrone in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of different compounds with the potential to interact with BCRP. Intracellular fluorescence accumulation was measured using a flow cytometer. Results: Isolated capillaries as well as 7-day old PBCECs showed expression of BCRP. Cell sensitivity to mitoxantrone significantly increased in the presence of the BCRP inhibitors KO143 and GF120918. Transport of mitoxantrone across PBCEC monolayers was directed with Papp (apical to basolateral) 5.6 \u00d7 10-6 cm s-1 and with Papp (basolateral to apical) 2.8 \u00d7 10-5 cm s-1. FACS analysis revealed a different extent of fluorescence accumulation dependent on the kind and concentration of BCRP modulating compounds. Conclusions: The mitoxantrone-based assay can be used as a rapid FACS screening system to assess drug interactions with BCRP at the blood-brain barrier and therefore represents a useful tool in drug profiling. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Application of molecular biological techniques is increasing the availability of novel compounds that can be conveniently produced in bacteria or yeasts, and combinatorial chemistry approaches are being based on natural product scaffolds to create screening libraries that closely resemble drug-like compounds. Various screening approaches are being developed to improve the ease with which natural products can be used in drug discovery campaigns, and data mining and virtual screening techniques are also being applied to databases of natural products. It is hoped that the more efficient and effective application of natural products will improve the drug discovery process."

        "abstract": "Carfilzomib, an irreversible proteasome inhibitor, has a favorable safety profile and significant antitumor activity in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Here we summarize the clinical pharmacokinetics (PK), metabolism, and drug-drug interaction (DDI) profile of carfilzomib. The PK of carfilzomib, infused over 2-10 minutes, was evaluated in patients with solid tumors or MM. Metabolites of carfilzomib were characterized in patient plasma and urine samples. In vitro drug metabolism and DDI studies were conducted in human liver microsomes and hepatocytes. A clinical DDI study was conducted in patients with solid tumors to evaluate the effect of carfilzomib on CYP3A activity. Plasma concentrations of carfilzomib declined rapidly and in a biphasic manner after intravenous administration. The systemic half-life was short and the systemic clearance rate was higher than hepatic blood flow. Carfilzomib was cleared largely extrahepatically via peptidase cleavage and epoxide hydrolysis. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism played a minor role, suggesting that coadministration of P450 inhibitors or inducers is unlikely to change its PK profile. Carfilzomib showed direct and time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A in human liver microsome preparations and exposure to carfilzomib resulted in reductions in CYP3A and 1A2 gene expression in cultured human hepatocytes. However, administration of carfilzomib did not affect the PK of midazolam in patients with solid tumors, and there were no safety signals indicative of potential drug interactions. We conclude that the rapid systemic clearance and short half-life of carfilzomib limit clinically significant DDI."

PANs had nearly spherical shape with a size range of 200-450 nm and low zeta potentials both in distilled water and in 10% FBS. The storage stability of PANs was observed in distilled water. PANs were stored for at least 2 months with no significant size and zeta potential changes. The safety of PANs was studied through single dose toxicity test in mice, and the result showed that PANs were well tolerated at the dose of 200 mg/kg in mice. Epirubicin-loaded PANs (PA/EPI) were also prepared and characterized in this study. Moreover, the in vivo pharmacokinetics of PA/EPI was investigated. Compared with the free EPI group, the PA/EPI group exhibited higher plasma drug concentration, longer half-life time (t(1/2)) and the larger area under the curve (AUC). All results suggested that PANs were stable, safe, and showed a promising potential on improving the bioavailability of the loaded drug of the encapsulated drug."

OBJECTIVE: To identify patient factors that could increase the risk of MDIS. METHOD: Inpatient records over a 5-year period were captured from an electronic prescribing system to identify patients with at least one documented drug allergy. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to compare the rates of MDIS across age, sex, weight, ethnicity, history of atopy or psychological disorders, and previous admissions. RESULTS: A total of 25,695 patients had a documented drug intolerance, 4.9% of whom had MDIS. MDIS was significantly more likely in women (p < 0.001), patients with multiple comorbidities (p < 0.001), and patients with previous hospital admissions (p < 0.001). With the exception of penicillin (p = 0.749), MDIS was more frequent in those with allergies to other drugs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: MDIS was associated with female gender, multiple comorbidities, and previous hospital admissions. A documented allergy to penicillin did not increase the likelihood of MDIS."

        "abstract": "Drug safety is not a matter for healthcare professionals alone. Patients are also involved, at three different levels: (i) in the behaviours patients adopt to reduce the adverse effects of the drugs; (ii) in regard to what some doctors say to their patients about drug risks; and (iii) in what the pharmaceutical industry says about self-medication and risks. This article will examine these aspects on the basis of information gathered in France during anthropological studies on drug use. (i) Patients' concerns about reducing adverse effects give rise to a series of behaviours relating to drug use. Patients start with the identification of what they regard as a risk inherent in the substances or linked to the uncontrolled use of drugs, and try to neutralize the risk by modifying or modulating the prescriptions in line with various parameters. Dimensions as varied as the nature of the prescribed drugs, the quantity, the dosage and the preservation of certain functions or organs are taken into account, and patients follow their own rules of conduct in order to reduce risks. These dimensions bring into play characteristics of both the drug and the individual, and take into account the effects or the risks of drugs in their physical, psychic, behavioural and social aspects. (ii) Doctors' discourse towards patients regarding the risks and possible effects of drugs is examined, in particular the discourse of those who choose to hide the undesirable effects of drugs from their patients with the aim of not jeopardizing the patient's compliance. This situation involves comparing two logics: ethics of care versus ethics of information. (iii) Regarding the pharmaceutical industry's discourse on self-medication and risks, although on the one hand it promotes self-medication on the basis of patients' growing desire for autonomy and competency, on the other hand it discourages the use of the home medicine cabinet for reasons of safety, which questions the ability of patients to use drugs properly. This article aims to demonstrate that the various behaviours and discourses relating to the risks of drugs are embedded with symbolic, ethical and cultural logics. As a consequence, above and beyond work carried out on the question of pharmacovigilance, examining the issue of safe drug use involves studying the human - social and cultural - aspects that govern part of the behaviours and practices relating to drug safety."

ETH mechanism of action is thought to be identical to INH although the pathway of activation is distinct from that of INH. ETH is activated by an EthA enzyme, leading to the formation of an Soxide metabolite that has considerably better activity than the parent drug. This review comprehensively examines the aspects related with the metabolism of ETH since its discovery up to today."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Numerous nanocarriers of various compositions and geometries have been developed for the delivery and release of therapeutic and imaging agents. Due to the high specific surface areas of nanocarriers, different mechanisms such as ion pairing and hydrophobic interaction need to be explored for achieving sustained release. Recently, we developed a three-parameter model that considers reversible drug-carrier interaction and first-order drug release from liposomes. A closed-form analytical solution was obtained. Here, we further explore the ability of the model to capture the release of bioactive molecules such as drugs and growth factors from various nanocarriers. A parameter study demonstrates that the model is capable of resembling major categories of drug release kinetics. We further fit the model to 60 sets of experimental data from various drug release systems, including nanoparticles, hollow particles, fibers, and hollow fibers. Additionally, bootstrapping is used to evaluate the accuracy of parameter determination and validate the model in selected cases. The simplicity and universality of the model and the clear physical meanings of each model parameter render the model useful for the design and development of new drug delivery systems."

        "abstract": "Objective: The conventional liposomal amphotericin B causes many unwanted side effects like blood disorder, nephrotoxicity, dose-dependent side effects, highly variable oral absorption and formulation-related instability. The objective of the present investigation was to develop cost-effective nanoemulsion as nanocarreir for enhanced and sustained delivery of amphotericin B into the skin. Methods and characterizations: Different oil-in-water nanoemulsions were developed by varying the composition of hydrophilic (Tween \u00d5 80) surfactants and co-surfactant by the spontaneous titration method. The developed formulation were characterized, optimized, evaluated and compared for the skin permeation with commercial formulation (fungisome 0.01% w/w). Optimized formulations loaded with amphotericin B were screened using varied concentrations of surfactants and co-surfactants as decided by the ternary phase diagram. Results and discussion: The maximum % transmittance obtained were 96.9 AE 1.0%, 95.9 AE 3.0% and 93.7 AE 1.2% for the optimized formulations F-I, F-III and F-VI, respectively. These optimized nanoemulsions were subjected to thermodynamic stability study to get the most stable nanoemulsions (F-I). The results of the particle size and zeta potential value were found to be 67.32 AE 0.8 nm and \u20133.7 AE 1.2 mV for the final optimized nanoemulsion F-I supporting transparency and stable nanoemulsion for better skin permeation. The steady state transdermal flux for the formulations was observed between 5.89 AE 2.06 and 18.02 AE 4.3 mg/cm 2 /h whereas the maximum enhancement ratio were found 1.85-and 3.0-fold higher than fungisome and drug solution, respectively, for F-I. The results of the skin deposition study suggests that 231.37 AE 3.6 mg/cm 2 drug deposited from optimized nanoemulsion F-I and 2.11-fold higher enhancement ratio as compared to fungisome. Optimized surfactants and co-surfactant combination-mediated transport of the drug through the skin was also tried and the results were shown to have facilitated drug permeation and skin perturbation (SEM). Conclusion: The combined results suggested that amphotericin B nanoemulsion could be a better option for localized topical drug delivery and have greater potential as an effective, efficient and safe approach."

Many drugs and chemicals are capable of damaging the glomerulus, causing its increased permeability to large molecules. Glomerular lesions are usually responsible for proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome. This also holds true for the drug-induced glomerulopathies, of which membranous glomerulonephritis is the most frequent type of lesion encountered. Apart from this, several cases of different glomerular changes such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and crescentic glomerulonephritis have also been reported. The drug-induced glomerulopathies are probably immune mediated. This is, for instance, reflected in the fact that patients with drug-induced nephritic syndrome frequently have the HLA-B8 and DR3 antigens.

        "abstract": "Oral drug delivery to the colon has attracted significant attention during the past 20 years. Colon targeting is recognised to have several therapeutic advantages, such as the oral delivery of drugs that are destroyed by the stomach acid and/or metabolised by pancreatic enzymes. Sustained colonic release of drugs can be useful in the treatment of nocturnal asthma, angina and arthritis. Local treatment of colonic pathologies, such as ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer and Crohn's disease, is more effective with the delivery of drugs to the affected area. Likewise, colonic delivery of vermicides and colonic diagnostic agents requires smaller doses. This article aims to provide an insight into the design and manufacturing considerations, and an evaluation of colonic drug delivery systems in order to understand why there are still few delivery technologies that have reached the market, despite intensive research in this field. For this purpose, various approaches to colon-specific drug delivery are discussed."

The needles are in the hundreds of micron length range and therefore allow relatively little or no pain. For example, biodegradable MNs have been researched in the literature and have several advantages compared with solid or hollow MNs, as they produce non-sharp waste and can be designed to allow rapid or slow release of drugs. However, they also pose a disadvantage as successful insertion into the stratum corneum layer of the skin relies on sufficient mechanical strength of the biodegradable material. This review looks at the various technologies developed in MN research and shows the rapidly growing numbers of research papers and patent publications since the first invention of MNs (using time series statistical analysis). This provides the research and industry communities a valuable synopsis of the trends and progress being made in this field."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Many studies investigating cognitive outcomes in children of women with epilepsy report an increased risk of mental impairment. Verbal scores on neuropsychometric measures may be selectively more involved. While a variety of factors contribute to the cognitive problems of children of women with epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) appear to play a major role. The mechanisms by which AEDs affect neurodevelopmental outcomes remain poorly defined. Animal models suggest that AED-induced apoptosis, altered neurotransmitter environment, and impaired synaptogenesis are some of the mechanisms responsible for cognitive and behavioral teratogenesis. AEDs that are known to induce apoptosis, such as valproate, appear to affect children\u2019s neurodevelopment in a more severe fashion. Fetal valproate exposure has dose-dependent associations with reduced cognitive abilities across a range of domains, and these appear to persist at least until the age of 6. Some studies have shown neurodevelopmental deficiencies associated with the use of phenobarbital and possibly phenytoin. So far, most of the investigations available suggest that fetal exposures to lamotrigine or levetiracetam are safer with regard to cognition when compared with other AEDs. Studies on carbamazepine show contradictory results, but most information available suggests that major poor cognitive outcomes should not be attributed to this medication. Overall, children exposed to polytherapy prenatally appear to have worse cognitive and behavioral outcomes compared with children exposed to monotherapy, and with the unexposed. There is an increase risk of neurodevelopmental deficits when polytherapy involves the use of valproate versus other agents. \u00a9 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland"

In addition, analytical separation and identification of proteins from complex mixtures can provide insight into targeted drug therapy and prediction of response to different therapeutics. AREAS COVERED: In the present review the authors summarize the readily available quantitative proteomics tools for the analytical separation and identification of target proteins in myeloid leukemia, AML in particular, and its future perspectives in its diagnostics and therapeutics. Within, the authors highlight some of the proteomics approaches such as gel-based quantitation strategies (2D, 2D-DIGE); MS-based quantitative proteomics tools (metabolic labeling (SILAC), chemical labeling (ITRAQ, ICAT)); MS techniques (MALDI-MS/MS). In addition, some of the target proteins identified using proteomics approaches in myeloid leukemia are also discussed that may encourage cancer biology investigators to undertake proteomics as a vital tool in their study. EXPERT OPINION: With suitable, selective application of diverse set of quantitative proteomics strategies integrated with bioinformatics software and precise statistical analysis in myeloid leukemia holds tremendous promise in deciphering cancer proteome, understanding tumor pathophysiology and development of personalized molecular medicine and therapy."

This review covers several techniques, computational programs and approaches that have been developed to visualize, navigate and study the chemical space of molecular databases. Techniques developed in our group are presented including a quanti- tative assessment of the multi-fusion similarity maps. Additionally an application of 3D-similarity, based on the overlay of chemical structures, to represent the chemical space is introduced. Several comparisons of the chemical space covered by compound collections from different sources such as combinatorial libraries, drugs and natural products, or directed to specific therapeutic areas are also discussed."

        "abstract": "Nine proteins of the ABC superfamily (P-glycoprotein, 7 MRPs and BCRP) are involved in multidrug transport. Being localised at the surface of endothelial or epithelial cells, they expel drugs back to the external medium (if located at the apical side [P-glycoprotein, BCRP, MRP2, MRP4 in the kidney]) or to the blood (if located at the basolateral side [MRP1, MRP3, MRP4, MRP5]), modulating thereby their absorption, distribution, and elimination. In the CNS, most transporters are oriented to expel drugs to the blood. Transporters also cooperate with Phase I/Phase II metabolism enzymes by eliminating drug metabolites. Their major features are (i) their capacity to recognize drugs belonging to unrelated pharmacological classes, and (ii) their redundancy, a single molecule being possibly substrate for different transporters. This ensures an efficient protection of the body against invasion by xenobiotics. Competition for transport is now characterized as a mechanism of interaction between co-administered drugs, one molecule limiting the transport of the other, potentially affecting bioavailability, distribution, and/or elimination. Again, this mechanism reinforces drug interactions mediated by cytochrome P450 inhibition, as many substrates of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 are common. Induction of the expression of genes coding for MDR transporters is another mechanism of drug interaction, which could affect all drug substrates of the up-regulated transporter. Overexpression of MDR transporters confers resistance to anticancer agents and other therapies. All together, these data justify why studying drug active transport should be part of the evaluation of new drugs, as recently recommended by the FDA."

Danshen is indexed in the 2010 Chinese Pharmacopoeia, with more than 35 formulations and concoctions containing Danshen water-extracts, ethanolic extracts or their combination, which are rich in phenolic acids and different levels of tanshinones. There are rare reports on the adverse effects of Danshen preparations. It is, however, well-known that Danshen leads the anticoagulation failure of warfarin. The Danshen-warfarin interaction may be mediated via both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic mechanisms. This review does not summarize recent progress, but the effects of Danshen and its active ingredients on the interactions of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and drug transporters, as well as the analysis of ingredients, and the metabolism and pharmacokinetics that are related to these interactions. Tanshinones play significant roles in the inhibition and induction of several CYP450 isozymes. It can be concluded that precautions should be taken when using Danshen preparations rich in tanshinones for CYP-related herb-drug interactions."

However, existing intra-procedural profiling techniques have inadequate abilities in loops, i.e., they can only either solve profiling acyclic paths, or limit loop iterations to a certain number first, and then profile paths under such a limitation. This paper presents a new profiling technique called PAP (profiling all paths), which can profile finite-length paths inside a procedural. PAP consists of two basic phases: one is the probe instrumentation which assigns a unique pathid for each path, and the other is backwalk which uses the pathids to determine the corresponding executed paths. Furthermore, breakpoints are introduced to store the probe value which may overflow during long executions, and the probe amount is reduced base on the integration of PAP with an existing profiling technique. Besides, this paper also discusses how to use PAP to profile executed sequences on the method level. As shown in the results of the case study and experiments, PAP is effective and efficient in profiling cyclic paths. \u00a9 2012 ISCAS."

The hydrogels were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and FTIR. Equilibrium swelling studies were carried out in enzyme-free simulated gastric and intestinal fluids (SGF and SIF, respectively). A model drug, olsalazine [3, 3'-azobis (6-hydroxy benzoic acid)] as an azo derivative of 5-aminosalicylic acid, was entrapped in these gels and the in vitro release profiles were established separately in both enzyme-free SGF and SIF. The drug-release profiles indicated that the amount of drug released depended on the degree of swelling. The hydrogels containing polar propoxylate groups were hydrolyzed rather easily."

However, certain limitations are associated with SMEDDS formulations which include in vivo drug precipitation, formulation handling issues, limited lymphatic uptake, lack of predictive in vitro tests and oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. These limitations restrict their potential usage. Inclusion of polymers or precipitation inhibitors within lipid based formulations helps to maintain drug supersaturation after dispersion. This, thereby, improves the bioavailability and reduces the variability on exposure. Also, formulating solid SMEDDS helps to overcome liquid handling and stability problems. Usage of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and suitable antioxidants to minimize oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids are few of the steps to overcome the limitations associated with SMEDDS. The review discussed here, in detail, the limitations of SMEDDS and suitable measures that can be taken to overcome them."

        "abstract": "The success of transdermal drug delivery has been severely limited by the inability of most drugs to enter the skin at therapeutically useful rates. Recently, the use of micron-scale needles in increasing skin permeability has been proposed and shown to dramatically increase transdermal delivery, especially for macromolecules. Using the tools of the microelectronics industry, microneedles have been fabricated with a range of sizes, shapes and materials. Most drug delivery studies have emphasized solid microneedles, which have been shown to increase skin permeability to a broad range of molecules and nanoparticles in vitro. In vivo studies have demonstrated delivery of oligonucleotides, reduction of blood glucose level by insulin, and induction of immune responses from protein and DNA vaccines. For these studies, needle arrays have been used to pierce holes into skin to increase transport by diffusion or iontophoresis or as drug carriers that release drug into the skin from a microneedle surface coating. Hollow microneedles have also been developed and shown to microinject insulin to diabetic rats. To address practical applications of microneedles, the ratio of microneedle fracture force to skin insertion force (i.e. margin of safety) was found to be optimal for needles with small tip radius and large wall thickness. Microneedles inserted into the skin of human subjects were reported as painless. Together, these results suggest that microneedles represent a promising technology to deliver therapeutic compounds into the skin for a range of possible applications."

Several polymeric hydrogel nanoparticulate systems have been prepared and characterized in recent years, based on both natural and synthetic polymers, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. Among the natural polymers, chitosan and alginate have been studied extensively for preparation of hydrogel nanoparticles and from synthetic group, hydrogel nanoparticles based on poly (vinyl alcohol), poly (ethylene oxide), poly (ethyleneimine), poly (vinyl pyrrolidone), and poly-N-isopropylacrylamide have been reported with different characteristics and features with respect to drug delivery. Regardless of the type of polymer used, the release mechanism of the loaded agent from hydrogel nanoparticles is complex, while resulting from three main vectors, i.e., drug diffusion, hydrogel matrix swelling, and chemical reactivity of the drug/matrix. Several crosslinking methods have been used in the way to form the hydrogel matix structures, which can be classified in two major groups of chemically- and physically-induced crosslinking."

        "abstract": "Transport molecules can significantly affect the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs. An important transport molecule, the 170 kDa P-glycoprotein (Pgp), is constitutively expressed at several organ sites in the human body. Pgp is expressed at the blood-brain barrier, in the kidneys, liver, intestines and in certain T cells. Other transporters such as the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and MRP2 also contribute to drug distribution in the human body, although to a lesser extent than Pgp. These three transporters, and especially Pgp, are often targets of drugs. Pgp can be an intentional or unintentional target. It is directly targeted when one wants to block its function by a modifier drug so that another drug, also a substrate of Pgp, can penetrate the cell membrane, which would otherwise be impermeable. Unintentional targeting occurs when several drugs are administered to a patient and as a consequence, the physiological function of Pgp is blocked at different organ sites. Like Pgp, MRP1 also has the capacity to mediate transport of many drugs and other compounds. MRP1 has a protective role in preventing accumulation of toxic compounds and drugs in epithelial tissue covering the choroid plexus/cerebrospinal fluid compartment, oral epithelium, sertoli cells, intesticular tubules and urinary collecting duct cells. MRP2 primarily transports weakly basic drugs and bilirubin from the liver to bile. Most compounds that efficiently block Pgp have only low affinity for MRP1 and MRP2. There are only a few effective and specific MRP inhibitors available. Drug targeting of these transporters may play a role in cancer chemotherapy and in the pharmacokinetics of substrate drugs."

Proniosomes overcome the demerits involved with niosomal and liposomal drug delivery systems. Proniosomes are liquid crystalline compact niosome hybrids which upon hydration form niosomes. They help in reducing physical stability problems involved with niosomes such as leaking, fusion, aggregation and provide convenience in dosing, distribution, transportation and storage showing improved results than conventional niosomes. This review focuses on different aspects of proniosome such as preparation, characterization, drug release, applications, merits, demerits, present scenario in market and future trends."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of in vivo hepatic drug clearance using in vitro assays is important to properly estimate clinical dosing regimens. Clearance of low turnover compounds is especially difficult to predict using short-lived suspensions of un-pooled primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and functionally declining PHH monolayers. Micropatterned co-cultures (MPCCs) of PHHs and 3T3-J2 fibroblasts have been previously shown to display major liver functions for several weeks in vitro. In this study, we first characterized long-term activities of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in MPCCs created from un-pooled cryopreserved PHH donors. Then, MPCCs were utilized to predict the clearance of 26 drugs that exhibit a wide range of turnover rates in vivo (0.05-19.5 mL/min/kg). MPCCs predicted 73%, 92% and 96% of drug clearance values for all tested drugs within 2-fold, 3-fold and 4-fold of in vivo values, respectively. There was good correlation (R2=0.94, slope=1.05) of predictions between the two PHH donors. On the other hand, suspension hepatocytes and conventional monolayers created from the same donor had significantly reduced predictive capacity (i.e. 30-50% clearance values within 4-fold of in vivo), and were not able to metabolize several drugs. Finally, we modulated drug clearance in MPCCs by inducing or inhibiting CYPs. Rifampin-mediated CYP3A4 induction increased midazolam clearance by 73%, while CYP3A4 inhibition with ritonavir decreased midazolam clearance by 79%. Similarly, quinidine-mediated CYP2D6 inhibition reduced clearance of dextromethorphan and desipramine by 71% and 22%, respectively. In conclusion, MPCCs created using cryopreserved un-pooled PHHs can be utilized for drug clearance predictions and to model drug-drug interactions."

        "abstract": "Successful homing of drugs to the desired biological compartment of the host usually depends on the intrinsic properties of the drug molecules. However, it can always be manipulated by appropriate designing of the carrier/delivery system, as little can be done to influence the target and its surroundings. Various carrier systems have emerged to deliver drugs to macrophages, albeit the efficacy, reliability and selectivity of these carriers are still in question. To date, the most extensively studied carriers are liposomes and microspheres. In fact, physicochemical properties of these carriers can alter their efficacy and specificity to a great extent. These properties include hydrophilicity, surface charge, composition, concentration, and presence of various target specific ligands on their surface. Incidentally, the particulate nature of these vehicles may facilitate passive homing of the entrapped drug molecules to the macrophages, which may harbour many of the important pathogens in their intracellular compartments, such as Mycobacterium sps, Leishmania and dengue virus etc., belonging to three different major classes of microbes. Moreover, macrophages upon interaction with particulate drug delivery vehicles may act as secondary drug depot, thus helping in localized delivery of the drug at the infected site. In the present article, a comprehensive review of literature is presented on the suitability of some lipid-based and polymeric materials as vehicles in delivery of drugs to macrophages in parasitic infections."

The most common manifestation is gastrointestinal tract infection; however, encephalitis, ocular infection, sinusitis, myositis and disseminated infection have also been described. In addition, these organisms have been reported in immune competent individuals. Multiple genes are involved in these infections and different organisms can result in distinct clinical pictures. Differences in clinical and parasitologic response to various therapeutic agents have emerged from clinical, as well as in vitro and in vivo studies. Currently there are no precisely defined guidelines for the optimal treatment of microsporidial infections.

This article reviews new technologies and methodological innovations and assesses whether these frameworks offer improved solutions to the problems facing the contemporary CV drug development. Areas covered: The article comprises literature derived from a systematic search (from 2000 onwards) using the US patent office and ESP@CENET search engines as well as through multiple Boolean terms. The article focuses on patents relating to technologies and resources and categorises the patents according to their niche in the CV drug screening landscape. Expert opinion: The CV drug pipeline is stalling due to the inability of many contemporary drug screening frameworks to discriminate between safe, efficacious therapy and hazardous off-target effect. Given the current limitations of drug screening frameworks, there is little scope for expanding the CV drug portfolio with newer, safer drugs with improved mechanisms of action. New screening modalities are urgently needed. Searches reveal that there are few examples of truly new technologies and systems in the patent literature. This apparent failure to revamp facets of the CV drug screening process can only perpetuate the inability of current platforms to improve the CV drug pipeline. Consequently, with few exceptions, there is stagnation in pre-clinical assay design that limits the pharmaceutical industry's ability to search for new drugs in new and more effective ways."

However, its clinical application has been limited due to its poor water solubility. Its current clinical administration uses the adjuvant of serious side effects and has undesired pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. There is, thus, a need for the development of alternate drug delivery systems of PTX to enhance its solubility, permeability and stability and further to promote a sustained, controlled and targeted delivery that will increase its therapeutic effects and reduce its side effects.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review is focused on recent developments of the various PTX delivery systems such as prodrugs, micelles, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanoparticles of biodegradable polymers, dendrimers, nanohydrogels, as well as PTX-eluting stents.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Pharmaceutical nanotechnology can provide solutions to solve the problems encountered in drug formulation and drug delivery and may change the way drugs are made. The various nanocarriers could have high efficiency in drug encapsulation and cellular uptake, escape from elimination by microphages due to their appropriate size and surface modification and realize with ligand conjugation-targeted delivery."

This broader scope of analysis outweighs the disadvantages by making compromises in method development and the reduced accuracy for specific metabolites.

These terpolyesters, especially those with LA:CL:GA composition of 3:1:1, provided good coating integrity following spraying onto bare metal stents. The semi-synthetic macrolide immunosuppressant, everolimus, was incorporated into the terpolyester coating, and its release from the stent was evaluated. Unlike PLLA homopolymers, which are immiscible with the drug and non-optimal for controlled release, these terpolymers gave excellent control in a screening study, by tuning terpolymer molecular weight, relative monomer ratio, and drug-to-polymer ratio. Adjusting the polymer properties to improve drug solubility (or miscibility) in the polymer coating was found beneficial to the release profile."

It brings clinical research to a starting point for the drug discovery process, permitting the generation of a more robust pathophysiological hypothesis essential for a better selection of drug targets and candidate optimization. It also establishes the basis of early proof for clinical concept studies, preferably in phase I, for which biomarkers and surrogate endpoints can often be used. Systems biology is a prerequisite approach to translational research where technologies and expertise are integrated and articulated to support efficient and productive realization of this concept. The first component of systems biology relies on omics-based technologies and integrates the changes in variables, such as genes, proteins and metabolites, into networks that are responsible for an organism's normal and diseased state. The second component of systems biology is in the domain of computational methods, where simulation and modeling create hypotheses of signaling pathways, transcription networks, physiological processes or even cell- or organism-based models. The simulations aim to show the origin of perturbations of the system that lead to pathological states and what treatment could be achieved to ameliorate or normalize the system. This review discusses how translational research and systems biology together could improve global understanding of drug targets, suggest new targets and approaches for therapeutics, and provide a deeper understanding of drug effects. Taken together, these types of analyses can lead to new therapeutic options while improving the safety and efficacy of new and existing medications."

Hydrogels are one of the most studied classes of polymer-based controlled drug release. These have attracted considerable attention in biochemical and biomedical fields because of their characteristics, such as swelling in aqueous medium, biocompatibility, pH and temperature sensitivity or sensitivity towards other stimuli, which can be utilized for their controlled zero-order release. The hydrogels are expected to explore new generation of self-regulated delivery system having a wide array of desirable properties. This review highlights the exciting opportunities and challenges in the area of hydrogels. Here, we review different literatures on stimuli-sensitive hydrogels, such as role of temperature, electric potential, pH and ionic strength to control the release of drug from hydrogels."

This article reviews the approaches aimed to associate bioactive molecules to chitosan in the form of colloidal structures and analyzes the evidence of their efficacy in improving the transport of the associated molecule through mucosae and epithelia. Chitosan forms colloidal particles and entraps bioactive molecules through a number of mechanisms, including chemical crosslinking, ionic crosslinking, and ionic complexation. A possible alternative of chitosan by the chemical modification also has been useful for the association of bioactive molecules to polymer and controlling the drug release profile. Because of the high affinity of chitosan for cell membranes, it has been used as a coating agent for liposome formulations. This review also examines the advances in the application of c..."

Several pharmaceutical treatments that use anti-angiogenic agents have been tried to inhibit the activity of CNV experimentally and clinically. In general, however, systemically administered drugs may reach not only targeted tissues but also other tissues, resulting in unwanted side effects. Also, to maintain therapeutic levels of the drugs in targeted tissues, frequent administration for an extended period of time is required. To solve these problems, drug delivery systems targeted to the CNV are being developed. Anatomic characteristics of CNV tissues resemble those of tumor vasculature, exhibiting enhanced permeability and retention effect. Drug targeting to CNV may be feasible in the same manner as it is to tumors. In this review, we describe two approaches of drug targeting to CNV: passive targeting and active targeting."

Application of molecular biological techniques is increasing the availability of novel compounds that can be conveniently produced in bacteria or yeasts, and combinatorial chemistry approaches are being based on natural product scaffolds to create screening libraries that closely resemble drug-like compounds. Various screening approaches are being developed to improve the ease with which natural products can be used in drug discovery campaigns, and data mining and virtual screening techniques are also being applied to databases of natural products. It is hoped that the more efficient and effective application of natural products will improve the drug discovery process."

These approaches conflate pharmaceutical and genetic principles, providing a conceptual platform that links dominant genetics with drug action. Thus, phenotypic genetic screens using vector-expressed dominant genetic effectors - trans-acting molecules that modulate gene function, such as peptides or RNA interference triggers - can reveal genes whose inhibition engenders a therapeutic effect. The correlation of this genetic inhibition with a specific protein activity defines a drug target candidate. Retroviruses provide a unique opportunity to stably deliver a variety of dominant genetic effectors to mammalian cells in a flexible predetermined fashion and are a favoured system for phenotypic screening. Here, the authors review recent innovations and approaches to therapeutic target discovery using retroviral vectors."

Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) we showed that the phase transition temperature (Tn - i) of K15 and K21 were 34.2 degrees C and 41.5 degrees C respectively. However, the thermogram of K15 and K21 blends with different ratios was shown to be a single endothermic peak similar to that of pure TLCs. K15 and K21 blends did not behave as a physical blend of two thermotropic liquid crystals with different Tn - i. However, they are rather mixed together in such ways that behave like a single unit TLC. The Tn - i of these TLC mixtures was linearly proportionate to the ratio of K15:K21. Using appropriate ratio of K15:K21 TLC, a mixture with desirable phase transition temperature was obtained. A triple layer of cellulose nitrate membranes containing a 50:50 mixture of K15 and K21 was used for drug permeation studies. This composite membrane showed good pulsatile permeation of drug molecules in response to temperature changes below and above the Tn - i of the K15 and K21 blends in a reproducible and reversible manner. Paracetamol and methimazole were chosen as hydrophobic and hydrophilic drug models, respectively. Methimazole permeability through the TLC membrane was much higher (36.0 x 10(-5) cm/s) at temperatures above the phase transition temperature of liquid crystal blends than that (7.2 x 10(-5) cm/s) at temperatures below the phase transition temperature of liquid crystal blends (38.1 degrees C)."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to review preclinical and clinical evidence relating to drug interactions with preparations of the medicinal herb St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum). A systematic literature search was carried out in three electronic databases up to June 2004. Information about case reports classified as St John's wort drug interactions was retrieved from the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring and from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in June 2003. Against the background of proven efficacy in mild to moderate depressive disorders and an excellent tolerability profile in monotherapy, there is sufficient evidence from interaction studies and case reports to suggest that St John's wort may induce the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme system and the P-glycoprotein drug transporter in a clinically relevant manner, thereby reducing efficacy of co-medications. Drugs most prominently affected and contraindicated for concomitant use with St John's wort are metabolised via both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein pathways, including HIV protease inhibitors, HIV non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (only CYP3A4), the immunosuppressants ciclosporin and tacrolimus, and the antineoplastic agents irinotecan and imatinib mesylate. Efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be impaired as reflected by case reports of irregular bleedings and unwanted pregnancies. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored more closely when St John's wort is added, discontinued or the dosage is changed. The St John's wort constituent hyperforin is probably responsible for CYP3A4 induction via activation of a nuclear steroid/pregnane and xenobiotic receptor (SXR/PXR) and hypericin may be assumed to be the P-glycoprotein inducing compound, although the available evidence is less convincing. Combinations of St John's wort with serotonergic agents and other antidepressants should be restricted to prescription-only, by experienced clinicians, due to potential central pharmacodynamic interactions. In conclusion, providing certain precautions and contraindications are followed, and adequate information is given to healthcare professionals and patients, the safe and effective use of quality-tested St John's wort products can be ensured."

        "abstract": "It has already been demonstrated that pitavastatin, a novel potent HMG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is taken up into human hepatocytes mainly by organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1. Because OATP2B1 is also localized in the basolateral membrane of human liver, we took two approaches to further confirm the minor contribution of OATP2B1 to the hepatic uptake of pitavastatin. Western blot analysis revealed that the ratio of the band density of OATP2B1 in human hepatocytes to that in our expression system is at least 6-fold lower compared with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The uptake of pitavastatin in human hepatocytes could be inhibited by both estrone-3-sulfate (OATP1B1/OATP2B1 inhibitor) and estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide (OATP1B1/OATP1B3 inhibitor). These results further supported the idea that OATP1B1 is a predominant transporter for the hepatic uptake of pitavastatin. Then, to explore the possibility of OATP1B1-mediated drug-drug interaction, we checked the inhibitory effects of various drugs on the pitavastatin uptake in OATP1B1-expressing cells and evaluated whether the in vitro inhibition was clinically significant or not. As we previously reported, we used the methodology for estimating the maximum unbound concentration of inhibitors at the inlet to the liver (I(u,in,max)). Judging from I(u,in,max) and inhibition constant (K(i)) for OATP1B1, several drugs (especially cyclosporin A, rifampicin, rifamycin SV, clarithromycin, and indinavir) have potentials for interacting with OATP1B1-mediated uptake of pitavastatin. The in vitro experiments could support the clinically observed drug-drug interaction between pitavastatin and cyclosporin A. These results suggest that we should pay attention to the concomitant use of some drugs with pitavastatin."

        "abstract": "The time course and duration of action of drugs used in cancer chemotherapy are greatly influenced by the molecular and biochemical properties of enzymes associated with their metabolism. Variation in the response of individual patients to cancer chemotherapeutic agents is in large measure due to genetic and environmental factors that impinge on specific enzymes belonging to the two major classes of drug metabolizing enzymes. Current knowledge of the molecular biology and biochemistry of phase I drug metabolizing enzymes (cytochrome P450, flavin-containing and xanthine oxidases, NADPH quinone reductase, and aldehyde and dihydropyridine dehydrogenases), and phase II enzymes (glucuronosyl-, sulfo-, N-acetyl-, and glutathione transferases, and hydrolases) is reviewed briefly. Advances in understanding genetic and environmental factors that influence activities of phase I and phase II pathways of drug metabolism are discussed in the first sections of this review followed by a consideration of the influence of drug metabolism on the actions of agents currently used in the treatment of cancer. Emphasis is given to drugs that have recently been introduced into the armamentarium of cancer chemotherapy including: inhibitors of chromatin function, target-based inhibitors of signal transduction and cyclin-dependent kinases, and angiogenesis inhibitors acting on metalloproteinases, epithelial cell growth, angiogenesis stimulation, and endothelial-specific integrins."

PI3K promotes cell survival proliferation, protein synthesis and glucose metabolism by generating secondary messengers phospholipid phosphatidyl 3,4,5-triphosphate and signaling via AKT/mTOR regulation. Deregulation of PI3K pathways have been observed in cancer, diabetes, neurological and inflammatory diseases and is an attractive target for pharmaceutical industries. Areas covered: In this review, the authors explain different PI3K assay methodologies. Furthermore, the authors summarize the techno-scientific principles and their utility in profiling novel chemical entities against PI3Ks. Specifically, the authors compare different PI3K assay formats explaining their mode of detection as well as their advantages and limitations for drug discovery efforts. Expert opinion: Developing lipid (PI3K) kinase assays involves significant effort and a rational understanding is needed due to the intrinsic lipidic nature of phospholipid phosphatidyl 4,5-biphosphate, which is used as an in vitro substrate for assays with PI3K isoforms. The assay of choice should be versatile, homogenous and definitely adaptable for high-throughput screening campaigns. Additionally, these assays are expected to dissect the mechanism of action of novel compounds (inhibitor characterization) against PI3K. Existing methods provide the versatility to medicinal chemists such that they can choose one or more assay platform to progress their compounds while profiling and/or inhibitor characterization."

Clinical risk management of potential DDIs is required in patients using drugs to influence the benefit-risk profile positively. Information about laboratory test results, in particular, may be useful in the assessment of potential DDIs for the individual patient. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the frequency and nature of laboratory tests required for the assessment of the clinical relevance of potential DDIs in Dutch community pharmacies. In addition, the nature and clinical relevance of these potential DDIs is analysed. METHODS: All patients from 100 Dutch community pharmacies using, according to dispensing information, two or more drugs concomitantly on a specified date (Wednesday, 4 April 2007), were included (n = 223,019). The anonymous dispensing data of the included patients were analysed against a list of DDIs requiring laboratory tests for the assessment of their clinical relevance. The number of patients at risk for these potential DDIs with severe adverse reactions was calculated. The frequency of potential DDIs requiring laboratory tests were stratified by age, sex and degree of polypharmacy. RESULTS: Of the included patients, 24.4% had one or more potential DDIs (n = 54,427). In 9.0% of the included patients, one or more laboratory tests for the assessment of clinical relevance of the potential DDI were required (n = 19,968). The frequency of DDIs requiring laboratory tests increased with increasing age and number of drugs, but was not related to sex. The most commonly required laboratory tests were for renal function (42.2%), electrolytes (20.1%) and coagulation (13.1%). The percentage of patients at risk for potential DDIs requiring laboratory tests with adverse reaction category F (serious, irrecoverable disablement or death) was 2.5%; category E (increased risk of failure of life-saving therapy) was 0.6%; and category D (inconvenience with residual symptom and failure of therapy concerning serious but non-fatal diseases) was 3.8%. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of patients in Dutch community pharmacies are at risk for potential DDIs requiring laboratory tests for the assessment of the clinical relevance of the interaction. There is a strong relationship between the frequency of DDIs requiring laboratory tests and age and the number of drugs concomitantly used. In the clinical risk management of potential DDIs, information about laboratory test results is of additional value. Future research is necessary in order to obtain more evidence on using laboratory tests in terms of which tests should be linked to pharmacy data, in which patients they should be done, how often and what actions should be taken when an abnormal value is found."

Materials and methods: Niosomes were prepared by a modified ethanol injection method, using Span 60, Tween 60 and Tween 65 as well as cholesterol with various cholesterol:surfactant molar ratios. The prepared vesicles were characterized for entrapment efficiency (EE), particle size, zeta potential and in vitro release study. Skin permeation studies were conducted using modified Franz diffusion cell, and excised rat skin was treated with niosomal, liposomal and conventional Carbopol 914 gel of Ibuprofen. Results and discussion: The results showed that the type of surfactant and molar ratio of cholesterol:surfactant altered the EE, size and in vitro drug release of niosomes. Higher EE was obtained with the niosomes prepared with cholesterol and Span 60 at molar ratio of 0.5:1. It has been observed that both niosomal and liposomal formulations enhanced the drug permeation and the percentage of accumulated dose in the skin compared to control conventional gel formulation. However, niosomes prepared by Span 60 and Tween 65 exhibited higher permeation and retention of Ibuprofen, respectively. Conclusion: Our results suggested that niosomal formulations could be used as a promising carrier for the Ibuprofen transdermal delivery system."

Currently, there is no consensus or standard approach to evaluate the quality of the source data, or ETL procedures.\\n\\nMETHODS: We propose a framework for a comprehensive process to ensure data quality throughout the steps used to process and analyze the data. The approach used to manage data anomalies includes: (1) characterization of data sources; (2) detection of data anomalies; (3) determining the cause of data anomalies; and (4) remediation.\\n\\nFINDINGS: Data anomalies included incomplete raw dataset: no race or year of birth recorded.

        "abstract": "The present study was to investigate the potentials of DNA/chitosan nanocomplexes as a carrier for small drug delivery. Two highly water-soluble chitosans (87 kDa and 18 kDa) were prepared and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). DNA/chitosan nanocomplexes were prepared by mixing salmon testes DNA and the FITC labeled chitosan (FITC-chitosan) and their biophysical properties and biodistribution in vivo were then investigated. The molecular weight of chitosan and the ratio of the positive amino group of chitosan to the negative phosphate group of DNA (N/P ratio) influenced the physical properties of the nanocomplexes. The fluorescence intensity of both types of the free FITC-chitosan decreased rapidly within 4 hr post-injection. In contrast, the DNA/chitosan nanocomplexes were accumulated in the liver and kidneys and remained at a relatively high stable level in these tissues and in blood up to 24 hr post-injection. This study also assessed the stability of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) when it was conjugated to chitosan to form a chitosan-doxorubicin conjugate (chi-DOX), which was then mixed with DNA to form a DNA/chitosan-doxorubicin nanocomplex (DNA/chi-DOX). Both the chi-DOX and DNA/chi-DOX complexes exerted cytotoxic effects on HeLa, HepG2, QGY-7703, and L02 cells, while the non-malignant L02 cells were less sensitive to the DNA-containing complex than to the chi-DOX complex, suggesting possible selectivity. Studies in tumor-bearing animals demonstrated that DNA/chi-DOX could efficiently deliver doxorubicin to the tumor and liver, implying that the DNA/chitosan nanocomplex may represent a novel drug carrier."

Acryloyl ester of 5-[4-(hydroxy phenyl) azo] salicylic acid (HPAS) as an azo derivative of 5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA) was prepared under mild conditions. The HPAS was covalently linked with acryloyl chloride, abbreviated as APAS. Cubane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (CDA), linked to two 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) groups, was the cross-linking agent (CA). Methacrylic-type polymeric prodrugs were synthesized by free radical copolymerization of methacrylic acid, poly(ethyleneglycol monomethyl ether methacrylate), and APAS in the presence of cubane cross-linking agent. The effect of copolymer composition on the swelling behavior and hydrolytic degradation were studied in simulated gastric (SGF, pH 1) and intestinal fluids (SIF, pH 7.4). The composition of the cross-linked three-dimensional polymers was determined by FTIR spectroscopy. The hydrolysis of drug-polymer conjugates was carried out in cellophane membrane dialysis bags containing aqueous buffer solutions (pH 1 and pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C. Detection of the hydrolysis product by UV spectroscopy shows that the azo prodrug (HPAS) was released by hydrolysis of the ester bond located between the HPAS and the polymer chain. Drug release studies showed that the increasing content of MAA in the copolymer enhances hydrolysis in SIF. These results suggest that pH-sensitive systems could be useful for preparation of a muccoadhesive system and controlled release of HPAS as an azo derivative of 5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA)."

The most of ocular diseases are treated with topical application of conventional formulation, i.e. solutions, suspensions and ointment. Typically on installation of these conventional formulations, only <5% of the applied dose penetrates the cornea and reaches intraocular tissues, while a major fraction of the instilled dose is wastage due to the presence of many ocular barriers like external barriers, rapid loss of the instilled solution from the precorneal area and nasolacrimal drainage system. Systemic absorption caused systemic side effects varying from mild to life-threatening events. Objective: The main objective of this review is to explore the role of colloidal delivery of drug to minimize the drawbacks associated with them. Methods: This review provides an insight into the various constraints associated with ocular drug delivery, summarizes recent findings and applications of colloidal delivery systems, i.e. nanoparticles, nanosuspensions, liposomes, niosomes, dendrimers and contact lenses containing nanoparticles have the capacity to distribute ocular drugs to categorical target sites and hold promise to revolutionize the therapy of many ocular perceiver diseases and minimized the circumscription of conventional delivery. Conclusion: Form the basis of literature review, it has been found that the novel delivery system have greater impact to maximize ocular drug absorption, and minimize systemic absorption and side effects."

The enthusiasm following its initial release subsided due to side effects from the central nervous system. New anesthetics limited the role of ketamine in anesthetic practice. However, its hemodynamically stable profile, along with its beneficial respiratory properties and analgesic potency, rendered the drug invaluable in battlefield medicine, sedation of the uncooperative child, analgesia, and sedation in burn units. Reevaluation, though, of analgesic properties of ketamine resulted in new interest regarding its use in perioperative and chronic pain management. Moreover, recent studies in the effects of the substance on intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow led to revising the recommendation against its use in brain injury. Furthermore, the bronchodilating effects of the substance led to increasing interest for potential use in asthma treatment. In addition, separation of the 2 enantiomers and subsequent separate studies indicated beneficial results of the S(+) one. Thus, new controlled multicentered clinical trials are to be conducted to justify approval for new uses of ketamine and take advantage of its unique range of applications."

        "abstract": "Alginates are established among the most versatile biopolymers, used in a wide range of applications. The conventional use of alginate as an excipient in drug products generally depends on the thickening, gel-forming, and stabilizing properties. A need for prolonged and better control of drug administration has increased the demand for tailor-made polymers. Hydrocolloids like alginate can play a significant role in the design of a controlled-release product. At low pH hydration of alginic acid leads to the formation of a high-viscosity \"acid gel.\" Alginate is also easily gelled in the presence of a divalent cation as the calcium ion. Dried sodium alginate beads reswell, creating a diffusion barrier decreasing the migration of small molecules (e.g., drugs). The ability of alginate to form two types of gel dependent on pH, i.e., an acid gel and an ionotropic gel, gives the polymer unique properties compared to neutral macromolecules. The molecule can be tailor-made for a number of applications. So far more than 200 different alginate grades and a number of alginate salts are manufactured. The potential use of the various qualities as pharmaceutical excipients has not been evaluated fully, but alginate is likely to make an important contribution in the development of polymeric delivery systems. This natural polymer is adopted by Ph.Eur. It can be obtained in an ultrapure form suitable for implants. This review discusses the present use and future possibilities of alginate as a tool in drug formulation."

Over the past decade, the use of \"Bare metallic stents\" during Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) has become a common practice for treating the coronary arterial stenosis. However, the restenosis is common problem in patients receiving stents. Recently, Drug-Eluting Stents (DES) with synthetic polymer coatings which act as drug reservoirs and elute drugs over a period of several weeks or months have emerged to tackle restenosis. The polymer coatings on these stents contain various drugs like immunosuppressive drugs, anti-neoplastic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, migration inhibitor drugs and enhanced healing drugs that inhibit thrombus formation, inflammation or cellular proliferation which in turn prevent restenosis. Different methods like dip coating, dip spin coating, ultrasonic spray coating and ink-jet coating help to coat stent uniformly. Drug from the stent can be released by diffusion, dissolution or ion exchange mechanism. There are some disadvantages of the polymer coated stents and hence they are being superseded by completely bioabsorbable stents. Such stents are heading for clinical trials and may hit the market soon. This review gives a glimpse over DES and the future prospects of DES."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "A substantial part of the interindividual variability in response to drugs and xenobiotics is related to genetically-determined impairment in drug metabolism. Several drug-metabolising enzymes are polymorphic in humans and often polymorphisms are strongly related to altered drug biodisposition and to the risk of developing adverse effects. Drugs used in general anaesthesia undergo polymorphic metabolism. Among these, halothane is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP3A4 and CYP2A6. CYP2E1 also plays a key role in the metabolism of isoflurane, sevoflurane, enflu-rane and desflurane. CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 play a relevant role in the metabolism of ketamine. The enzymes involved in the metabolism of thiopental and etomidate remains to be elucidated. Propofol is metabolized mainly by glucuronidation by uridine diphos-phate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and by hydroxylation by CYP2B6 and CYP2C enzymes. The enzymes SULT1A1 and NQO1 participate in later steps in propofol metabolism. All the above-mentioned anaesthetic-metabolising enzymes are polymorphic in man. The present review analyzes the importance of en-zymes in the metabolism of anaesthetics and common polymorphisms related to the biotransformation of general anaesthetics and it raises hypotheses on genetic and non-genetics factors related to altered response to anaesthetics that require further investigation. Based on functional relevance and allele frequencies, we identify the most promising targets for the clinical use of pharmacogenomic techniques in anaesthesia to prevent altered pharmacokinetics or adverse drug effects."

A reference set of positive and negative drug-event associations is required.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a pediatric-specific reference set of positive and negative drug-event associations.\\n\\nMETHODS: Considering user patterns and expert opinion, 16 drugs that are used in individuals aged 0-18 years were selected and evaluated against 16 events, regarded as important safety outcomes. A cross-table of unique drug-event pairs was created. Each pair was classified as potential positive or negative control based on information from the drug's Summary of Product Characteristics and Micromedex. If both information sources consistently listed the event as an adverse event, the combination was reviewed as potential positive control. If both did not, the combination was evaluated as potential negative control. Further evaluation was based on published literature.\\n\\nRESULTS: Selected drugs include ibuprofen, flucloxacillin, domperidone, methylphenidate, montelukast, quinine, and cyproterone/ethinylestradiol. Selected events include bullous eruption, aplastic anemia, ventricular arrhythmia, sudden death, acute kidney injury, psychosis, and seizure. Altogether, 256 unique combinations were reviewed, yielding 37 positive (17 with evidence from the pediatric population and 20 with evidence from adults only) and 90 negative control pairs, with the remainder being unclassifiable.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: We propose a drug-event reference set that can be used to compare different signal detection methods in the pediatric population."

However, there has been relatively little quantitative modeling to assess how pharmacogenomic information could be best utilized in clinical practice. Using a quantitative model, this review demonstrates that efficacy is increased and toxicity is reduced when a genetically-guided dose adjustment strategy is utilized in a clinical trial. However, there is limited information available regarding the genetic variables affecting the disposition or mechanism of action of most commonly used medications. These genetic factors must be identified to enable pharmacogenomic testing to be routinely used in the clinic. A recently described murine haplotype-based computational genetic analysis method provides one strategy for identifying genetic factors regulating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of commonly used medications."

The many interesting properties of these gels, such as their thermoreversibility, have led to much excitement over their industrial applications. However, only a few organogels are currently being studied as drug/vaccine delivery vehicles as most of the existing organogels are composed of pharmaceutically unacceptable organic liquids and/or unacceptable/untested gelators. In this paper a brief overview of organogels is presented, followed by a more in-depth review of the gels that have been investigated for drug and/or vaccine delivery. These include microemulsion-based gels and lecithin gels (studied for transdermal delivery), sorbitan monostearate organogels and amphiphilogels (studied as vaccine adjuvants and for oral and transdermal drug delivery, respectively), gels composed of alanine derivatives (investigated as in situ forming gels) and Eudragit organogels (studied as a matrix for suppositories). Finally, pluronic lecithin organogels, descendents of lecithin gels but which are not really organogels, are briefly discussed for their interesting history, their root and the wide interest in these systems."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "A voluntary reporting system of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is fun- damental to drug safety surveillance but under-reporting is its major limita- tion. This bibliographic review sought to assess the influence of personal and professional characteristics on ADR reporting and to identify knowledge and attitudes associated with ADR reporting. A systematic review was conducted using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. We included papers that were published in English, French and Spanish, and covered a study population made up of health professionals. In each case, the following data were extracted: study population; work- place; study type; sample size; type of questionnaire; type of scale for measuring knowledge; response rate; personal and professional factors; and knowledge and attitudes (based on Inman's 'seven deadly sins') assoeiated with reporting. Based on a search of computerized databases, we identified a total of 657 papers in MEDLINE and 973 in EMBASE. In all, the review covered 45 papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Medical specialty was the pro- fessional characteristic most closely associated with under-reporting in 76% of studies involving physicians. Other factors associated with under-reporting were ignorance (only severe ADRs need to be reported) in 95%; diffidence (fear of appearing ridiculous for reporting merely suspected ADRs) in 72%; lethargy (an amalgam of procrastination, lack of interest or time to find a report card, and other excuses) in 77%; indifference (the one case that an individual doctor might see could not contribute to medical knowledge) and insecurity (it is nearly impossible to determine whether or not a drug is res- ponsible for a particular adverse reaction) in 67%; and complacency (only safe drugs are allowed on the market) in 47% of studies. While personal and professional factors display a weak influence, the knowledge and attitudes of health professionals appear to be strongly related with reporting in a high proportion of studies. This result may have im- portant implications in terms of public health, if knowledge and attitudes are viewed as potentially modifiable factors."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an uncommon adverse drug reaction of increasing importance to the medical community, pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies and the general public. OBJECTIVES: The Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established to advance understanding and research into DILI by initiating a prospective registry of patients with bona fide DILI for future studies of host clinical, genetic, environmental and immunological risk factors. The DILIN was also charged with developing standardized nomenclature, terminology and causality assessment instruments. METHODS: Five clinical sites, a data coordinating centre and senior scientists from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases initiated the DILIN prospective study in September 2004. Eligible patients are required to meet minimal laboratory or histological criteria within 6 months of DILI onset and have other competing causes of liver injury excluded. Patients in the general community setting with pre-existing HIV, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infections and/or abnormal baseline liver biochemistries are eligible for enrollment. In addition, subjects with liver injury due to herbal products are eligible to participate. Control patients without DILI are also to be recruited in the future. RESULTS: All referred subjects undergo an extensive review of available laboratory, pathology and imaging studies. Subjects who meet pre-defined eligibility criteria at the 6-month study visit are followed for 2 years to better define the natural history of chronic DILI. Causality assessment is determined by a panel of three hepatologists who independently assign a causality score ranging from 1 (definite) to 5 (unlikely) as well as a severity score ranging from 1 (mild) to 5 (fatal). During the first 3 years, 367 subjects were enrolled into the DILIN prospective study. CONCLUSION: DILIN is a multicentre research network charged with improving our understanding of the aetiologies, risk factors and outcomes of DILI in the US. The network is meeting the targeted enrollment of ten patients per month and is developing a repository of clinical data and biological samples for future studies of DILI pathogenesis and outcome."

        "abstract": "Doping with natural steroids can be detected by evaluating the urinary concentrations and ratios of several endogenous steroids. Since these biomarkers of steroid doping are known to present large inter-individual variations, monitoring of individual steroid profiles over time allows switching from population-based towards subject-based reference ranges for improved detection. In an Athlete Biological Passport (ABP), biomarkers data are collated throughout the athlete's sporting career and individual thresholds defined adaptively. For now, this approach has been validated on a limited number of markers of steroid doping, such as the testosterone (T) over epitestosterone (E) ratio to detect T misuse in athletes. Additional markers are required for other endogenous steroids like dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). By combining comprehensive steroid profiles composed of 24 steroid concentrations with Bayesian inference techniques for longitudinal profiling, a selection was made for the detection of DHT and DHEA misuse. The biomarkers found were rated according to relative response, parameter stability, discriminative power, and maximal detection time. This analysis revealed DHT/E, DHT/5\u03b2-androstane-3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol and 5\u03b1-androstane-3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol/5\u03b2-androstane-3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol as best biomarkers for DHT administration and DHEA/E, 16\u03b1-hydroxydehydroepiandrosterone/E, 7\u03b2-hydroxydehydroepiandrosterone/E and 5\u03b2-androstane-3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol/5\u03b1-androstane-3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol for DHEA. The selected biomarkers were found suitable for individual referencing. A drastic overall increase in sensitivity was obtained. The use of multiple markers as formalized in an Athlete Steroidal Passport (ASP) can provide firm evidence of doping with endogenous steroids."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to review preclinical and clinical evidence relating to drug interactions with preparations of the medicinal herb St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum). A systematic literature search was carried out in three electronic databases up to June 2004. Information about case reports classified as St John's wort drug interactions was retrieved from the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring and from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in June 2003. Against the background of proven efficacy in mild to moderate depressive disorders and an excellent tolerability profile in monotherapy, there is sufficient evidence from interaction studies and case reports to suggest that St John's wort may induce the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme system and the P-glycoprotein drug transporter in a clinically relevant manner, thereby reducing efficacy of co-medications. Drugs most prominently affected and contraindicated for concomitant use with St John's wort are metabolised via both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein pathways, including HIV protease inhibitors, HIV non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (only CYP3A4), the immunosuppressants ciclosporin and tacrolimus, and the antineoplastic agents irinotecan and imatinib mesylate. Efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be impaired as reflected by case reports of irregular bleedings and unwanted pregnancies. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored more closely when St John's wort is added, discontinued or the dosage is changed. The St John's wort constituent hyperforin is probably responsible for CYP3A4 induction via activation of a nuclear steroid/pregnane and xenobiotic receptor (SXR/PXR) and hypericin may be assumed to be the P-glycoprotein inducing compound, although the available evidence is less convincing. Combinations of St John's wort with serotonergic agents and other antidepressants should be restricted to prescription-only, by experienced clinicians, due to potential central pharmacodynamic interactions. In conclusion, providing certain precautions and contraindications are followed, and adequate information is given to healthcare professionals and patients, the safe and effective use of quality-tested St John's wort products can be ensured."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "Helminth infections are responsible for a huge health burden on developing country populations. These are manifest through soil transmitted helminths leading to intestinal infections and vector borne infections, such as schistosomiasis (frequently called Bilharzia) transmitted through water snail, lymphatic filariasis (frequently called elephantiasis) transmitted by mosquitoes and onchocerciasis (frequently called river blindness) transmitted by blackflies. The number of drugs available to treat these infections is incredibly limited, but where they are available they have, in some cases, led to incredible gains in public health. For example, TDR collaborated with Merck in the 1980s in the develop- ment of ivermectin for onchocerciasis. Merck subsequently made the drug available as a donation. Following this, through the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control, an innovative community directed distribution system now provides this drug to \u223c 60 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, with a goal of reaching 90 million by 2010. The disease is significantly reduced as a public health problem as a result, but continued effort and vigilance is needed. WHO is supporting a drive to scale up the treatment of helminth infections through integrated mass drug administration and several other drugs are now also being made available through pharmaceutical company donations. However, this scale up of use further highlights helminth infections for which chemotherapy is not available. It also brings with it the threat of resistance development and highlights the need for additional drugs to be discovered and developed to cover that eventuality. The paucity of products in development for helminth diseases, as well as the lack of a dedicated product development partnership (PDP) for these diseases has necessitated a focused initiative to boost the research and development pipeline for these diseases. Consultation meetings organised by TDR in collaboration with the Japanese Society of Parasitology have identified the need for a focused initiative to facilitate research and development against human parasitic worm infections. This special issue of Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery documents the rationale for the Helminth Drug Initiative, as well as reports of technical consultations and recommendations that led to the initial establishment of the Initiative within TDR. We hope that it will stimulate interest and activity in this highly significant and neglected area of research."

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Metformin hydrochloride is a biguanide derivative widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, prescribed nearly to 120 million people worldwide. Metformin has a relatively low oral bioavailability (about 50-60%). Although the major effect of metformin is to decrease hepatic glucose output as an antihyperglycemic agent, its inhibitory effects on the proliferation of some cancer cells (e.g. prostate, breast, glioma cells) have been demonstrated in the cell culture studies. Development of novel formulation (e.g. microparticles, nanoparticles) strategies for metformin might be useful to improve its bioavailability, to reduce the dosing frequency, to decrease gastrointestinal side effects and toxicity and to be helpful for effective use of metformin in cancer treatment.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The main aim of this review is to summarize metformin HCl-loaded micro- and nanoparticulate drug delivery systems.\\n\\nMETHOD: The literature was rewieved with regard to the physicochemical, pharmacological properties of metformin, and also its mechanism of action in type 2 diabetes and cancer. In addition, micro- and nanoparticulate drug delivery systems developed for metformin were gathered from the literature and the results were discussed.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Metformin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent and also has potential antitumorigenic effects. The repeated applications of high doses of metformin (as immediate release formulations) are needed for an effective treatment due to its low oral bioavailability and short biological half-life. Drug delivery systems are very useful systems to overcome the difficulties associated with conventional dosage forms of metformin and also for its effective use in cancer treatment."

        "abstract": "Abstract Herbal drugs have been used for thousands of years in the east and have had a recent resurgence in popularity among consumers in the west.  However, most of herbal drug are poorly soluble and have hydrophobic properties and poor distribution, leading to reduced bioavailability and hence decreased treatment efficacy, requiring repeated administration or increased dose.  In the past few decades, considerable attention has been focused on the development of self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) for herbal drugs.  SEDDS is isotropic and thermodynamically stable solutions consisting of oil, surfactant, co-surfactant and drug that can spontaneously form oil-in-water micro/nanoemulsion when mixed with water under gentle stirring.  The formulation can be a viable alternative to classical formulations to take advantage of their lipophilic nature and to solve their problems of poor solubility, poor bioavailability, low oral absorption and instability.  The mechanism of self-emulsification, solubility studies, construction of phase diagram, optimization and characterization of herbal drugs-loaded SEDDS formulation and in situ absorption evaluation of herbal drugs in rat intestine are presented in our article.[on SciFinder (R)]"

Biocompatible nanomaterials have been used as biological markers, contrast agents for imaging, healthcare products, pharmaceuticals, drug-delivery systems as well as in detection, diagnosis and treatment of various types of diseases. The classification of drug delivery nanosystems (DDnSs) is a crucial issue and fundamental efforts on this subject are missing from the literature. This article deals with the classification of DDnSs with a modulatory controlled release profile (MCR) denoted as modulatory controlled release nanosystems (MCRnSs). Conventional (c) and advanced (a) DDnSs are denoted by the acronyms cDDnSs and aDDnSs, and can be composed of a single or more than one biomaterials, respectively. The classification was based on their characteristics such as: surface functionality (f), the nature of biomaterials used and the kind of interactions between biomaterials. The aDDnSs can be classified as hybridic (Hy-) or chimeric (Chi-) based on the nature - same or different respectively - of biomaterials and inorganic materials used. The nature of the elements used for producing advanced biomaterials is of great importance and medicinal chemistry contributes effectively to the production of aDDnSs."

        "abstract": "Vaccinations are recommended throughout life to reduce the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases and their sequelae. Vaccines are often administered in patients with chronic diseases who are likely to be treated with several drugs. A growing number of clinical observations have indicated the possibility of interactions between vaccines and drugs, leading to changes in drug metabolism after vaccination. These interactions represent a significant concern because of the increasing use of vaccines in older patients who are likely to be treated with several drugs. Because of the possible implications of adverse reactions in terms of public health, several studies were performed to verify the risk posed by these interactions and to clarify the biologic mechanisms that drive these events. Of the several mechanisms proposed to be at the basis of vaccine-drug interactions, the most convincing evidence suggests a role of inflammatory cytokines on the regulation of specific cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Differences in the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of these drugs could explain these contrasting results and provide important insights to fully understand the clinical importance of these events. Further studies are required to verify whether vaccine-drug interactions may occur in other clinical settings, especially the ones for which patients are required to be vaccinated against specific diseases."

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that some drugs inhibit these transporters and cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Among these drugs, cyclosporin A markedly increases the plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 substrates. In such cases, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the maximum concentration of the affected drugs are increased to a similar degree. Even for OATP1B1 substrates that are metabolized in the liver, the hepatic uptake rate is a determinant of overall hepatic clearance, and the DDIs are partly caused by the inhibition of OATP1B1. Gemfibrozil displays DDIs with some OATP1B1 substrates, although their extent is small. Rifampicin and some HIV protease inhibitors are also OATP1B1 inhibitors. Rifampicin is also an inducer of metabolic enzymes, and although its single coadministration produces an increase in the plasma concentration of the affected drugs, multiple coadministrations may result in reductions in the plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 and CYP3A4 bisubstrates. As a large number of therapeutic reagents are substrates and/or inhibitors of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, we should be aware of DDIs caused by the inhibition of these transporters."

METHODS: This cross-sectional, prospective study was held in 70 Italian internal medicine and geriatric wards. Potentially severe DDIs at hospital admission and discharge; risk of in-hospital mortality and of adverse clinical events, readmission, and all-cause mortality at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Among 2712 patients aged 65 years or older recruited at hospital admission, 1642 (60.5%) were exposed to at least one potential DDI and 512 (18.9%) to at least one potentially severe DDI. Among 2314 patients discharged, 1598 (69.1%) were exposed to at least one potential DDI and 1561 (24.2%) to at least one potentially severe DDI. Multivariate analysis found a significant association with an increased risk of mortality at 3 months in patients exposed to at least two potentially severe DDIs (Odds ratio 2.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-6.68; p = 0.05). Adverse clinical events were potentially related to severe DDIs in two patients who died in the hospital, in five readmitted, and one who died at 3 months after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization was associated with an increase in potentially severe DDIs. A significant association was found for mortality at 3 months after discharge in patients with at least two potentially severe DDIs. Careful monitoring for potentially severe DDIs, especially those created at discharge or recently generated, is important to minimize the risk of harm."

First, there is discussion about how quantitative determination of the contribution of major clearance pathways is fundamental for the accurate prediction of DDIs. Secondly, the concentrations of causative drugs at sites of interactions are discussed. Although DDIs have been predicted from in vitro pharmacokinetic parameters based on predicted hepatic unbound concentrations of inhibitors and inducers, there are noticeable discrepancies between predicted and observed magnitudes of these DDIs. To solve these issues, a method for the prediction of unbound hepatic concentration is proposed based on theoretical considerations. Finally, a pharmacokinetic model to describe the intestinal first pass metabolism is considered, particularly focusing on the importance of the Q(gut) model. Although this Q(gut) model was proposed as an empirical model, theoretical considerations suggest that the model is regarded as a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model that can predict significance of intestinal DDIs. Theoretical considerations proposed in the present article may be helpful for future analysis of DDIs."

We searched the scientific literature published in the last five years, focusing on studies that required at least 2 weeks of abstinence from drug use, and included a control group. All substances of abuse, except cannabis, were associated with sustained deficits in executive functioning, especially inhibition. In addition, verbal memory decrements were consistently found in cocaine, (meth)amphetamines and ecstasy users, but not in heroin or cannabis users. More specific executive functioning deficits were reported depending on the substance of abuse. Cocaine was associated with diminished cognitive flexibility, whereas (meth)amphetamines were associated with worse cognitive planning functions compared to controls. Opiate studies showed lower scores on verbal fluency in opiate dependent subjects compared to controls. Working memory and visuospatial abilities were compromised in alcohol abusers. In ecstasy users, inconsistent findings have been reported across neuropsychological domains, with the exception of inhibition and verbal memory. There was little evidence for sustained cognitive impairments in adult abstinent cannabis users. Recognition of neuropsychological problems related to different substances can help to select subjects that will benefit most from treatment. Furthermore, a better understanding of the neuropsychological impairments in drug abusing individuals could help to explain the remitting course of substance abuse disorders and to improve psychological interventions."

        "abstract": "The protective function of human skin imposes physicochemical limitations to the type of permeant that can traverse the barrier. For a drug to be delivered passively via the skin it needs to have adequate lipophilicity and also a molecular weight <500 Da. These requirements have limited the number of commercially available products based on transdermal or dermal delivery. Various strategies have emerged over recent years to optimize delivery and these can be categorized into passive and active methods. The passive approach entails the optimization of formulation or drug carrying vehicle to increase skin permeability. Passive methods, however do not greatly improve the permeation of drugs with molecular weights >500 Da. In contrast active methods that normally involve physical or mechanical methods of enhancing delivery have been shown to be generally superior. Improved delivery has been shown for drugs of differing lipophilicity and molecular weight including proteins, peptides, and oligonucletides using electrical methods (iontophoresis, electroporation), mechanical (abrasion, ablation, perforation), and other energy-related techniques such as ultrasound and needless injection. However, for these novel delivery methods to succeed and compete with those already on the market, the prime issues that require consideration include device design and safety, efficacy, ease of handling, and cost-effectiveness. This article provides a detailed review of the next generation of active delivery technologies."

BPs are known as gold standard for osteoporosis (OP) treatment due to their positive results in clinical studies. But some serious side effects are associated with BPs like gastrointestinal adverse effect i.e. esophagitis and ulcer of esophagus. Oral bioavailability (BA) of BPs ranges from 0.6 to 1% due to poor absorption through gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Objective: The main objective of this review is to explore the role of novel drug delivery systems (DDSs) for the delivering of BPs and minimizing the drawbacks associated with them. Methods: The current review is focusing on classification, mechanism of action, and limitations of BPs, and is also dwelling on the use of novel DDSs like nanoparticles, liposomes, topical, transdermal systems, implants, bisphosphonate osteotropic DDS (BP-ODDS), microspheres, and calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) for BPs. This review also gives a critically reviewed compilation of the various in vitro and in vivo studies conducted till date. Conclusion: On the basis of the exhaustive literature, it has been found that the novel DDS minimizes the side effects associated with BPs and enhances the BA. The advance drug delivery has a greater impact on reducing the undesirable effects and increasing the BA of BPs."

To improve dosing accuracy and facilitate the determination of dosing regimens in function of the body weight, the proposed study aims at preparing transdermal niosomal gels of simvastatin as possible transdermal drug delivery system for pediatric applications. Twelve formulations were prepared to screen the influence of formulation and processing variables on critical niosomal characteristics. Nano-sized niosomes with 0.31 mum number-weighted size displayed highest simvastatin release rate with 8.5% entrapment capacity. The niosomal surface coverage by negative charges was calculated according to Langmuir isotherm with n = 0.42 to suggest that the surface association was site-independent, probably producing surface rearrangements. Hypolipidemic activities after transdermal administration of niosomal gels to rats showed significant reduction in cholesterol and triglyceride levels while increasing plasma high-density lipoproteins concentration. Bioavailability estimation in rats revealed an augmentation in simvastatin bioavailability by 3.35 and 2.9 folds from formulation F3 and F10, respectively, compared with oral drug suspension. Hence, this transdermal simvastatin niosomes not only exhibited remarkable potential to enhance its bioavailability and hypolipidemic activity but also considered a promising pediatric antihyperlipidemic formulation."

Different formulations of pluronic lecithin organogels were prepared by using pluronic F127, lecithin, flurbiprofen, isopropyl palmitate, water, sorbic acid, and potassium sorbate. To study the in vitro potential of these formulations, permeation studies were performed with Keshary-Chien diffusion cells. The results of the in vitro permeation studies found that release of flurbiprofen from dialysis membrane-70 was more than excised dorsal rat skin. Gelation temperature study was carried out to determine the temperature where sol-gel transformation takes place. The viscosities of different formulations were determined by using Brookfield Viscometer at 25\u00b0C, the viscosity of formulations increases as the lecithin concentration increases. Also the formulations were tested for appearance and feel psychorheologically, pH, and drug content. Interactions between the components of the gel have been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffractometry. The optimized formulation subjected to differential scanning calorimetry shows no drug-polymer interaction. To investigate the in vivo performance of the formulations, a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model and skin irritation study was used. The stability studies and freeze-thaw thermal cyclic test were carried out, showing no phase separation of gel, and representing gel stability. Statistical analysis of the data of animal study (anti-inflammatory activity) was done by using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's test. The formulation shows a statistically significant anti-inflammatory activity and is non-irritant to skin."

The present study aimed to identify functional proteins involved in the allograft-protective effects of these two agents and reveal potential diagnostic markers for treating rejection.\\n\\nMETHODS: Serum samples from heterotopic heart-transplanted LEW(RT-1(1)) rats (either without immunosuppressive treatment or treated with methotrexate alone, rapamycin alone, or methotrexate and rapamycin combined) were analysed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Protein profiles obtained using a weak cation exchange ProteinChip\u00ae CM-10 array were then analysed using ProteinChip\u00ae Software.\\n\\nRESULTS: Of 28 rejection-related proteins identified, isoelectric point and mass information from two potential candidate proteins matched information from the UniProtKB/Swiss-prot database, suggesting them to be complement component C3f fragment and complement component 4A (C4A, anaphylatoxin).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Proteomic analysis revealed 28 proteins as potential diagnostic markers of tissue rejection. Of these, 11 proteins may represent targets relating to the additive effects of methotrexate and rapamycin. Two protein peaks, with mass-to-charge ratios of 1950 Da and 8577 Da, may have potential for use in post-transplant diagnosis of rejection."

Today, most cancer patients still await life-saving treatments. Genomics and other '-omics' technologies have revealed a complexity among cancers that makes almost any tumour genetically unique; as a consequence, effective targeted therapies might be suitable only for small subgroups of patients. We suggest that by merging and organizing their core competencies, academia, biotechnology companies and the pharmaceutical industry can address existing bottlenecks in anticancer drug discovery and development."

Pin1 is overexpressed in many human cancer tissues, including breast, prostate and lung cancer. Its expression correlates with cyclin D1 levels, which contribute to cell transformation. Overexpression of Pin1 promotes tumor growth, while inhibition of Pin1 causes tumor cell apoptosis. Pin1 plays an important role in oncogenesis and therefore may serve as an effective anticancer target. Many inhibitors of Pin1 have been discovered, including several classes of designed inhibitors (alkene isosteres, reduced amides, indanyl ketones) and natural products (juglone, pepticinnamin E analogues, PiB and its derivatives obtained from a library screen). Pin1 inhibitors could be used as a novel type of anticancer drug by blocking cell cycle progression. Therefore, Pin1 represents a new diagnostic and therapeutic anticancer drug target."

Thermosensitive hydrogel-based drug delivery systems have increasingly attracted the attention of the drug delivery community, as the drugs can be readily encapsulated and released by the hydrogels. AREAS COVERED: Thermosensitive hydrogels that can serve as drug carriers are discussed in this paper. Strategies used to control hydrogel properties, in order to tailor drug release kinetics, are also reviewed. This paper also introduces applications of the thermosensitive hydrogel-based drug delivery systems in cancer therapy and tissue regeneration. EXPERT OPINION: When designing a drug delivery system using thermosensitive hydrogels, one needs to consider what type of thermosensitive hydrogel needs to be used, and how to manipulate its properties to meet the desired drug release kinetics. For material selection, both naturally derived and synthetic thermosensitive polymers can be used. Various methods can be used to tailor thermosensitive hydrogel properties in order to achieve the desired drug release profile."

        "abstract": "Introduction: Advances in genomics technologies are providing a very large amount of data on genome-wide gene expression profiles, protein molecules and their interactions with other macromolecules and metabolites. Molecular interaction networks provide a useful way to capture this complex data and comprehend it. Networks are beginning to be used in drug discovery, in many steps of the modern discovery pipeline, with large-scale molecular networks being particularly useful for the understanding of the molecular basis of the disease. Areas covered: The authors discuss network approaches used for drug target discovery and lead identification in the drug discovery pipeline. By reconstructing networks of targets, drugs and drug candidates as well as gene expression profiles under normal and disease conditions, the paper illustrates how it is possible to find relationships between different diseases, find biomarkers, explore drug repurposing and study emergence of drug resistance. Furthermore, the authors also look at networks which address particular important aspects such as off-target effects, combination-targets, mechanism of drug action and drug safety. Expert opinion: The network approach represents another paradigm shift in drug discovery science. A network approach provides a fresh perspective of understanding important proteins in the context of their cellular environments, providing a rational basis for deriving useful strategies in drug design. Besides drug target identification and inferring mechanism of action, networks enable us to address new ideas that could prove to be extremely useful for new drug discovery, such as drug repositioning, drug synergy, polypharmacology and personalized medicine."

        "abstract": "The impact of market concentration has been little studied in markets for ambulatory care in the developing world, where the retail sector often accounts for a high proportion of treatments. This study begins to address this gap through an analysis of the consumer market for malaria treatment in rural areas of three districts in Tanzania. We developed methods for investigating market definition, sales volumes and concentration, and used these to explore the relationship between antimalarial retail prices and competition. The market was strongly geographically segmented and highly concentrated in terms of antimalarial sales. Antimalarial prices were positively associated with market concentration. High antimalarial prices were likely to be an important factor in the low proportion of care seekers obtaining appropriate treatment. Retail sector distribution of subsidised antimalarials has been proposed to increase the coverage of effective treatment, but this analysis indicates that local market power may prevent such subsidies from being passed on to rural customers. Policymakers should consider the potential to maintain lower retail prices by decreasing concentration among antimalarial providers and recommending retail price levels."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of adverse drug reaction (ADR)-related hospitalisations has usually been assessed within hospitals. Because of the variability in results and methodology, it is difficult to extrapolate these results to a national level. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence and characteristics of ADR-related hospitalisations in The Netherlands in 2001. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide study of all hospital admissions in 2001. Data were retrieved from a nationwide computer database for hospital discharge records. All acute, non-planned admissions to all Dutch academic and general hospitals in 2001 were included in the study (n = 668 714). From these admissions we selected all hospitalisations that were coded as drug-related, but intended forms of overdose, errors in administration and therapeutic failures were excluded. Hence, we extracted all ADR-related hospitalisations. We compared age, sex and the risk of a fatal outcome between patients admitted with ADRs and patients admitted for other reasons, as well as the most frequent main diagnoses in ADR-related hospitalisations and which drugs most frequently caused the ADRs. In addition, we evaluated to what extent these ADRs were reported to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb for spontaneous ADR reporting. RESULTS: In 2001, 12 249 hospitalisations were coded as ADR related. This was 1.83% of all acute hospital admissions in The Netherlands (95% CI 1.80, 1.86). The proportion increased with age from 0.8% (95% CI 0.75, 0.85) in the <18 years group to 3.2% in the >/=80 years group (95% CI 3.08, 3.32). The most frequent ADR-related diagnoses of hospitalisations were bleeding (n = 1048), non-specified 'unintended effect of drug' (n = 438), hypoglycaemia (n = 375) and fever (n = 347). The drugs most commonly associated with ADR-related hospitalisations were anticoagulants (n = 2185), cytostatics and immunosuppressives (n = 1809) and diuretics (n = 979). Six percent of the ADR-related hospitalisations had a fatal outcome (n = 734). Older age and female gender were associated with ADR-related hospitalisations. Only approximately 1% of the coded ADRs causing hospitalisation were reported to our national centre for spontaneous ADR reporting. CONCLUSION: The proportion of ADR-related hospitalisations is substantial, especially considering the fact that not all ADRs may be recognised or mentioned in discharge letters. Under-reporting of ADRs that result in hospital admission to our national centre for spontaneous ADR reporting was considerable."

The aim of this study was to establish a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to elucidate in detail the pharmacokinetics of teneligliptin. A PBPK model of teneligliptin was developed using the population-based Simcyp simulator incorporating the results of in vitro and in vivo studies. Model validation was conducted by comparison of simulated teneligliptin plasma concentrations with those from clinical trials. Using the PBPK model, predicted drug-drug interactions with concomitant medication were examined. The robustness of the PBPK model was demonstrated by the accurate simulation of clinically measured plasma concentrations of teneligliptin after oral administration in different ethnic groups, in subjects belonging to different age groups and in patients with kidney or liver impairment; none of these factors were incorporated during model development. The fraction absorbed and intestinal availability of teneligliptin predicted by the model were 0.62 and 0.99, respectively. The predicted ratios of areas under the time-concentration curves (AUCs) in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment who were concomitantly administered ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of P450 3A4, were, respectively, 2.1- and 2.2-fold those in healthy adults who were given teneligliptin alone. A robust PBPK model reflecting the pharmacokinetic properties of teneligliptin was constructed. The final optimized PBPK model enabled us to elucidate in detail the factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of teneligliptin and to predict changes in exposure in drug-drug interactions or in specific populations.

        "abstract": "The concept of a 'derivative' is used widely in chemistry, where its precise meaning depends on the circumstances. However, numerous examples of derivative also occur in domestic drugs legislation, some of which stem from the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. There is a commonly held view that only 'first-order' derivatives should be considered: substances that can be created from a parent structure in a single chemical reaction. In other words, 'derivatives of derivatives' are excluded. However, some substances related to ecgonine (e.g. 2-carbomethoxytropinone) are clearly convertible to cocaine, even though this may require more than one reaction step. It follows that 2-carbomethoxytropinone is a controlled drug, a situation that most chemists would regard as perverse. A more extreme example of the complexity of 'derivative' is shown by the conversion of thebaine to buprenorphine. Even though this requires six or more stages, the US Drug Enforcement Administration successfully argued in a 1986 case that for the purposes of the Controlled Substances Act, the number of steps required was irrelevant; buprenorphine was a derivative of thebaine. Because the term derivative is rarely defined in statutes, the legal status of some substances, such as 2-bromo-LSD, is uncertain. Although a number of definitions of derivative can be found in the chemical literature, no single definition is adequate to describe all situations where it occurs in legislation. Unless qualified, it is suggested that the term derivative should be avoided in any future legislation. Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

        "abstract": "Drug-induced torsade de pointes (TdP) has proved to be a significant iatro-genic cause of morbidity and mortality and a major reason for the withdrawal of a number of drugs from the market in recent times. Enzymes that metabolise many of these drugs and the potassium channels that are responsible for cardiac repolarisation display genetic polymorphisms. Anecdotal reports have suggested that in many cases of drug-induced TdP, there may be a concealed genetic defect of either these enzymes or the potassium channels, giving rise to either high plasma drug concentrations or diminished cardiac repolarisation reserve, respectively. The presence of either of these genetic defects may predispose a patient to TdP, a potentially fatal adverse reaction, even at therapeutic dosages of QT-prolonging drugs and in the absence of other risk factors. Advances in pharmacogenetics of drug metabolising enzymes and pharmacological targets, together with the prospects of rapid and inexpensive genotyping procedures, promise to individualise and improve the benefit/risk ratio of therapy with drugs that have the potential to cause TdP. The qualitative and the quantitative contributions of these genetic defects in clinical cases of TdP are unclear because not all of the patients with TdP are routinely genotyped and some relevant genetic mutations still remain to be discovered. There are regulatory guidelines that recommend strategies aimed at uncovering the risk of TdP associated with new chemical entities during their development. There are also a number of guidelines that recommend integrating pharmacogenetics in this process. This paper proposes a strategy for integrating pharmacogenetics into drug development programmes to optimise association studies correlating genetic traits and endpoints of clinical interest, namely failure of efficacy or development of repolarisation abnormalities. Until pharmacogenetics is carefully integrated into all phases of development of QT-prolonging drugs and large-scale studies are undertaken during their post-marketing use to determine the genetic components involved in induction of TdP, routine genotyping of patients remains unrealistic. Even without this pharmacogenetic data, the clinical risk of TdP can already be greatly minimised. Clinically, a substantial proportion of cases of TdP are due to the use of either high or usual dosages of drugs with potential to cause TdP in the presence of factors that inhibit drug metabolism. Therefore, choosing the lowest effective dose and identifying patients with these non-genetic risk factors are important means of minimising the risk of TdP. In view of the common secondary pharmacology shared by these drugs, a standard set of contraindications and warnings have evolved over the last decade. These include factors responsible for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug interactions. Among the latter, the more important ones are bradycardia, electrolyte imbalance, cardiac disease and co-administration of two or more QT-prolonging drugs. In principle, if large scale prospective studies can demonstrate a substantial genetic component, pharmacogenetically driven prescribing ought to reduce the risk further. However, any potential benefits of pharmacogenetics will be squandered without any reduction in the clinical risk of TdP if physicians do not follow prescribing and monitoring recommendations."

        "abstract": "The ability to use vitro inactivation kinetic parameters in scaling to in vivo drug-drug interactions (DDIs) for mechanism-based inactivators of human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes was examined using eight human P450-selective marker activities in pooled human liver microsomes. These data were combined with other parameters (systemic C(max), estimated hepatic inlet C(max), fraction unbound, in vivo P450 enzyme degradation rate constants estimated from clinical pharmacokinetic data, and fraction of the affected drug cleared by the inhibited enzyme) to predict increases in exposure to drugs, and the predictions were compared with in vivo DDIs gathered from clinical studies reported in the scientific literature. In general, the use of unbound systemic C(max) as the inactivator concentration in vivo yielded the most accurate predictions of DDI with a mean -fold error of 1.64. Abbreviated in vitro approaches to identifying mechanism-based inactivators were developed. Testing potential inactivators at a single concentration (IC(25)) in a 30-min preincubation with human liver microsomes in the absence and presence of NADPH followed by assessment of P450 marker activities readily identified those compounds known to be mechanism-based inactivators and represents an approach that can be used with greater throughput. Measurement of decreases in IC(50) occurring with a 30-min preincubation with liver microsomes and NADPH was also useful in identifying mechanism-based inactivators, and the IC(50) measured after such a preincubation was highly correlated with the k(inact)/K(I) ratio measured after a full characterization of inactivation. Overall, these findings support the conclusion that P450 in vitro inactivation data are valuable in predicting clinical DDIs that can occur via this mechanism."

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyse the prevalence of preventable adverse drug events (pADEs) and non-preventable adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as well as the determinants of both pADEs and ADRs. METHODS: Adverse events experienced by patients admitted to two Dutch hospitals with functioning computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems were prospectively identifed through chart review. For both pADEs and non-preventable ADRs a causal relationship between adverse events and patients' drugs was established using the simplifed Yale algorithm. RESULTS: pADEs and non-preventable ADRs were experienced by 349 (58%) patients, of whom 307 (88%) had non-preventable ADRs. Multi-morbidity (adjusted odds ratio [OR<sub>adj</sub>] 1.90 and 1.28 respec tively), length of stay (OR<sub>adj</sub> 1.13 and 1.11), admission to the geriatric ward (OR<sub>adj</sub> 7.78 and 3.82) and number of medication orders (OR<sub>adj</sub> 1.25 and 1.13) were signifcantly associated with pADEs and ADRs. Admission to the gastroenterology/rheumatology ward (OR<sub>adj</sub> 0.22 and 0.40) was inversely related to both pADEs and ADRs. Other determinants for ADRs only were female sex (OR<sub>adj</sub> 1.77) and use of drugs affecting the nervous system (OR<sub>adj</sub> 1.83). Age was a signifcant determinant for pADEs only (OR<sub>adj</sub> 1.07). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the patients admitted to the hospitals are harmed by drugs, of which most are non-serious, non-preventable ADRs. Determinants of both pADEs and ADRs overlap to a large extent. Our results imply the need for signalling early potential adverse events during the normal use of drugs in multimorbid patients or those in geriatric wards. Subsequent therapeutic interventions may improve their well-being more than focusing on errors in the medication process only."

Both formulations presented high encapsulation efficiencies, mean diameters below 17 microm, and similar collapsed shape. Dissolution experiments showed good gastro-resistance for the microparticles at pH 1.2. At pH 6.8, the blended microparticles retarded the drug release. In vivo studies showed that the formulations were able to protect the rat stomachs against ulcer formation by sodium alendronate.

Their use is controversial due to serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) like extrapyramidal disorders (EPD) and QT prolongation. Objectives: To calculate reporting odds ratios (RORs) of ADRs related to prokinetics in children using WHO Individual Case Safety Reports.Describe time and age-dependent prescription patterns of prokinetics in children in the Netherlands (NL) and Italy (IT). Methods: All paediatric non vaccine related spontaneous reports (N = 812 526) received by the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre until 2006 were analyzed. RORs were calculated stratified for age. A retrospective population-based study was conducted to describe drug use using data from 2 primary care databases in NL (IPCI) and IT (Pedianet). The study period ran from 1995 to 2006 for NL and from 2001 to Jun 2008 for IT. Annual prevalence of use was calculated (users/1000 PY) and stratified by age and gender. Results: RORs for EPD and QT prolongation are highest in children <2yr (284 [95% CI 223, 361]; 25 [95% CI 15, 40]). EPD was mainly reported for metoclopramide (ROR 171 [95% CI 161, 181]) and QT prolongation for cisapride (ROR 35 [95% CI 29, 43]). During the study period, prescribing of prokinetics more than halved bothinNL(27-13/1000 PY)and IT(43-12/1000 PY). This was mainly due to a drop in domperidone prescriptions. Cisapride prescriptions decreased to nil from 2000 on. Prokinetics are mainly prescribed to the youngest except for metoclopramide in NL (>12 yr). Gender difference could only be observed after puberty where prescription of prokinetic drugs is 3 times higher in girls compared to boys (25 vs. 8/1000 PY). Conclusions: Prescription of prokinetics decreased dramatically, probably due to raised safety concerns. EPD and QT prolongation are associated with high RORs in children <2 yr. In line with a recent FDA boxed warning EPD is mainly seen in metoclopramide. Since RORs are hypothesis generating reporting bias could influence the estimates.

        "abstract": "Protein expression profiling is defined in general as identifying the proteins expressed in a particular tissue, under a specified set of conditions and at a particular time, usually compared to expression in reference samples. This information is useful in drug discovery and diagnosis as well as in understanding response mechanisms at the protein level. We may identify all the proteins responding to a particular stimulus and select those whose expression changes most. Or we may isolate significant protein variables and then identify them. These definitive sets of proteins (protein expression signatures; PES) are specific to diseases, toxicants, physical stresses, and to degrees of stress severity. Here we describe a method, based on machine learning, for isolating the sets of proteins, before identifying them by name, which classify accurately the treatment classes in a study. The principle in this chapter is that if proteins associated with known classes of interest can be used to identify unknown classes then the proteins are definitive for diagnosis.The proteins in each class, including controls, are converted to digital data and serve as input to artificial neural network (ANN) models. Multiple two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) gel patterns are included in each treatment class. A training subset of digitized individual, not composite, gel images is used to construct an ANN model which is then applied to a test set of images. Successful classification of the unknown (test) data confirms that the variables included in the model are indeed significant in discrimination among the classes. In the study described here the misclassifications were 5% or less using the ANN models. The ANN method seems to be a useful complement to image analysis, described in Chapter \"Troubleshooting Image Analysis in 2DE\". The reduction in protein variables permits multivariable statistics such as cluster and discriminant analyses."

        "abstract": "Abstract The main objective of the study was to alter the dissolution profile of a practically insoluble Biopharmaceutics Classification System class II drug, aceclofenac, by formulating into lipid semisolid matrix (SSM) formulations using liquid filling technology in hard gelatin capsules, for both immediate and sustained release. SSM formulations of aceclofenac were prepared by melt fusion technique, using Gelucires (44/14, 50/13, 33/01 and 43/01), polyethylene glycols (4000 and 6000) and Poloxamer 188 at different levels. Role of additives like docusate sodium, Tween 80, Aerosil 200 and polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30 in enhancement of drug release was investigated. The optimized immediate and sustained SSM capsules were characterized in terms of assay, in vitro drug release, moisture uptake and differential scanning calorimetry. More than 80% of the drug was released within 15 min in various dissolution media studied, from Gelucire 44/14-based immediate release formulations. Incorporation of docusate sodium and Tween 80 provided further enhancement in drug dissolution when compared to plain drug and marketed tablet. SSM formulations based on Gelucire blends of 50/13 and 43/01 and 44/14 and 43/01 sustained the release of the drug for a period of 24 h following zero-order kinetics. The in vivo study of the optimized immediate release and sustained release formulations revealed significant enhancement in anti inflammatory activity (p < 0.01) in rats. From these findings, liquid fill technique in hard gelatin capsules using Gelucire and their blends might be an efficacious approach for designing immediate or sustained drug release profiles for poorly soluble drugs like aceclofenac."

Enhanced functionality of the hydrogels can be achieved by incorporating drugs and other substances that may assist wound healing into the gel matrix. Controlling the release of active compounds from the hydrogels may be possible by carefully modifying the polymer matrix. For this purpose, cyclodextrins (CD) were grafted to the polymer matrix in 4-5 w/w% in an attempt to retard the release of water-soluble drugs. Ibuprofenate (IBU) was chosen as model drug and loaded in IBU/CD ratios of 0.6, 1.2, and 2.5. Vinyl derivatives of alpha-, beta- and gamma-CD were produced, added to the prepolymer blend and cured by UV-light. During this curing process the CD derivatives were covalently incorporated into the hydrogel matrix. The modified hydrogels were loaded with ibuprofenate by swelling. The release of the model drug from CD modified hydrogels show that especially covalently bonded beta-cyclodextrin can change both the release rate and the release profile of ibuprofen."

METHODS: The in vivo ocular irritation of Labrasol was tested by pathological section observation using rabbits. The effects of Labrasol on corneal permeability of baicalin was investigated in vitro, using isolated rabbit corneas. The pharmacokinetics was evaluated by microdialysis in the rabbit aqueous humors. RESULTS: The results of the ocular irritation studies showed that Labrasol was non-irritant at the concentrations studied (0.5-3.0%(v/v)), while Labrasol produced slight irritation at a concentration of 5.0%(v/v). For the in vitro study, with Labrasol at concentrations of 1.5%, 2.0%, and 3.0%(v/v), the apparent permeability coefficient (P(app)) was 1.69-, 3.14-, and 2.23- fold of baicalin solution, respectively. In the pharmacokinetics studies, the AUC value of baicalin solution with 2.0% and 3.0%(v/v) Labrasol were 4.7- and 5.6-fold of that of the control group (p < 0.01), and the Cmax value of baicalin solution with 2.0% and 3.0%(v/v) Labrasol vs the control group were 3.2- and 5.7-fold (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Labrasol may have potential clinical benefits in improving the ocular drug delivery of baicalin."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pharmacovigilance centres (PVCs) in the World Health Organization (WHO) Programme for International Drug Monitoring have demonstrated their ability to detect preventable adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in their databases. In this field, there is no gold-standard method for detecting medication errors and evaluating ADR preventability. Therefore, we developed, from existing tools, a preventability assessment method: the 'P Method' (PM).\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: To present the PM and to evaluate its inter-rater reliability.\\n\\nMETHODS: The PM includes 20 explicit criteria for assessing ADR preventability. This approach is based on identification of any potentially preventable risk factor that increases the likelihood of ADR occurrence. The outcome of the preventability assessment results in one of three possible scores: 'preventable', 'non-preventable' or 'not assessable'. The PM was tested in a multicentre study involving nine national PVCs. Two experienced reviewers at each participating PVC independently analysed the preventability of 183 ADRs, applying the PM.\\n\\nRESULTS: The overall agreement between all reviewers for assessment of ADR preventability was 'fair', with a kappa value of 0.27 [95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.40]. The level of agreement between reviewer pairs ranged from 'slight', with a kappa\u00a0value of 0.12 (95\u00a0% CI -0.03 to 0.27), to 'substantial', with a kappa value of 0.69 (95\u00a0% CI 0.48-0.89).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The analysis of the agreements and disagreements between reviewers highlighted where improvements might be made. Given that no standard assessment tool exists in the WHO Programme, the transparency of the assessment process in this method provides a substantial basis for further development and for support in signalling possible preventability."

The formulation is nonirritant and suitable for topical application. Gels consisting of cyclosporine were prepared using different methods by mixing the solid gelator (sorbitan or glyceryl fatty acid esters) and the liquid phase (liquid sorbitan esters or polysorbates) and heating them at 60 degrees C to form a clear isotropic sol phase, and cooling this sol phase to form an opaque semisolid at room temperature. Gel microstructure was examined by phase contrast microscopy while gelation temperatures were measured by melting point apparatus and differential scanning calorimetry. These amphiphilic gels were evaluated in vitro for topical as well as transdermal delivery using rat skin mounted in a Franz diffusion cell. Gel microstructures consisted mainly of clusters of tubules of gelator molecules that had aggregated upon cooling of the sol phase, forming a 3D network throughout the continuous phase. The gels demonstrated thermoreversibility with robust gel network. At temperatures near the skin surface temperature, the gels softened considerably and moreover, it facilitated the drug to accumulate in dermis, thus making an ideal delivery vehicle of cyclosporine topically that can be used in treatment of psoriasis. Thus amphiphilic gels were demonstrated as the ideal vehicle for topical use of cyclosporine."

Among the many different stimuli-sensitive delivery systems, temperature-sensitive drug delivery systems offer great potential over their counterparts due to their versatility in design, tunability of phase transition temperatures, passive targeting ability and in situ phase transitions. Thus, thermosensitive drug delivery systems can overcome many of the hurdles of conventional drug delivery systems in order to increase drug efficacies, drug targeting and decrease drug toxicities. In an effort to further control existing temperature-responsive systems, current innovative applications have combined temperature with other stimuli such as pH and light. The result has been the development of highly sophisticated systems, which demonstrate exquisite control over drug release and represent huge advances in biomedical research."

Several genes closely associated with the pathobiology and immune evasion of neuroblastoma, novel targets that warrant evaluation, and decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes are demonstrated. These studies describe a unique and generalizable approach to expand the utility of transgenic models of spontaneous tumor, providing new tools for preclinical investigation."

Nanotopography, in particular, shows great potential in facilitating drug delivery. The flexibility of fabrication techniques has created a diverse array of topographies that have been developed for drug delivery applications. Nanowires and nanostraws deliver drug cytosolically for in vitro and ex vivo applications. In vivo drug delivery is limited by the barrier function of the epithelium. Nanowires on microspheres increase adhesion and residence time for oral drug delivery, while also increasing permeability of the epithelium. Low aspect ratio nanocolumns increase paracellular permeability, and in conjunction with microneedles increase transdermal drug delivery of biologics in vivo. In summary, nanotopography is a versatile tool for drug delivery. It can deliver directly to cells or be used for in vivo delivery across epithelial barriers. This editorial highlights the application of nanotopography in the field of drug delivery."

Accelerated lead discovery has at the same time generated a massive demand for thorough validation of such putative targets. Very often human tissue analysis is needed for this purpose. However, the need to analyse large numbers of well-characterized human tissues constitutes a major bottleneck in drug discovery and development. Traditional tissue analysis in a slide-by-slide manner is slow, expensive and difficult to standardize. In addition, precious specimens, such as tissue samples from clinical studies, are usually exhausted after a few analyses. The tissue microarray technology overcomes these shortcomings as it allows the simultaneous analysis of up to 1,000 minute tissue samples in a single experiment. This article will review how high-throughput tissue microarray analyses can dramatically facilitate translational research at several different levels."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adverse drug interaction surveillance in collections of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) remains underdeveloped. Most efforts to date have focused on disproportionality analysis, but the empirical support for its value is based on isolated examples. Additionally, too little attention has been given to the potential value of the detailed content of ICSRs for improved adverse drug interaction surveillance.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify reporting patterns indicative of suspected adverse drug interactions before the drug interactions are generally established.\\n\\nMETHODS: A reference set of known adverse drug interactions and drug pairs not known to interact was constructed from information added to Stockley's Drug Interactions Alerts between the first quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2009. The reference set was used to systematically study differences in reporting patterns between adverse drug interactions before they are generally established and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to drug pairs that are not known to interact, in the WHO Global ICSR Database, VigiBase. The scope of the study included pharmacological properties such as common cytochrome P450 metabolism, explicit suspicions of drug interactions as noted by the reporter, clinical details such as dose and treatment overlap, and the lower limit of the 95% credibility interval of a three-way measure of disproportionality, Omega(025) (\u03a9(025)), based on the total number of reports on two drugs and one ADR together. Analyses were carried out including and excluding concomitant medicines.\\n\\nRESULTS: Five reporting patterns were highlighted as particularly strong indicators of adverse drug interactions before they are known: suspicion of interactions as noted by the reporter in a case narrative, the assignment of the two drugs as interacting or through an ADR term; co-reporting of effect increased with the drug pair; and, finally, an excess total number of reports on the ADR together with the two drugs, as measured by \u03a9(025). Overall, the inclusion of concomitant medicines led to a larger number of true adverse drug interactions being highlighted, but at a substantial decrease in the strength of most indicators. Notably, the inclusion of concomitant medicines completely eliminated the value of \u03a9(025) as an indicator of adverse drug interactions, in this systematic evaluation.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Reported suspicion of interactions as noted by the reporter in a case narrative, the assignment of the two drugs as interacting or through an ADR term; co-reporting of effect increased with the drug pair and by the \u03a9(025) each provide unique information to highlight adverse drug interactions before they become known in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis demonstrating the value of disproportionality analysis for adverse drug interactions using a comprehensive reference set, and the first study to consider a broader basis including clinical information for systematic drug interaction surveillance."

Hierarchical linear models were used to investigate changes in these behaviors that resulted from the respondents' involvement in drug dealing and drug use. The results indicate that involvement in drug dealing, controlling for drug use, increases violence and other systemic risks to a level that drug use alone is not likely to achieve.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Automated screening for excessive adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting rates has proven useful as a tool to direct clinical review in large-scale drug safety signal detection. Some measures of disproportionality can be adjusted to eliminate any undue influence on the ADR reporting rate of covariates, such as patient age or country of origin, by using a weighted average of stratum-specific measures of disproportionality. Arguments have been made in favour of routine adjustment for a set of common potential confounders using stratification. The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of using adjusted observed-to-expected ratios, as implemented for the Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) and the information component (IC) measures of disproportionality, for first-pass analysis of the WHO database.\\n\\nMETHODS: A simulation study was carried out to investigate the impact of simultaneous adjustment for several potential confounders based on stratification. Comparison between crude and adjusted observed-to-expected ratios were made based on random allocation of reports to a set of strata with a realistic distribution of stratum sizes. In a separate study, differences between the crude IC value and IC values adjusted for (combinations of) patient sex, age group, reporting quarter and country of origin, with respect to their concordance with a literature comparison were analysed. Comparison was made to the impact on signal detection performance of a triage criterion requiring reports from at least two countries before a drug-ADR pair was highlighted for clinical review.\\n\\nRESULTS: The simulation study demonstrated a clear tendency of the adjusted observed-to-expected ratio to spurious (and considerable) underestimation relative to the crude one, in the presence of any very small strata in a stratified database. With carefully implemented stratification that did not yield any very small strata, this tendency could be avoided. Routine adjustment for potential confounders improved signal detection performance relative to the literature comparison, but the magnitude of the improvement was modest. The improvement from the triage criterion was more considerable.\\n\\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that first-pass screening based on observed-to-expected ratios adjusted with stratification may lead to missed signals in ADR surveillance, unless very small strata are avoided. In addition, the improvement in signal detection performance due to routine adjustment for a set of common confounders appears to be smaller than previously assumed. Other approaches to improving signal detection performance such as the development of refined triage criteria may be more promising areas for future research."

        "abstract": "Transscleral delivery is an emerging, high-potential method for delivering drugs to the posterior eye. If successful, it could offer non-invasiveness comparable to drops and delivery efficiency comparable to intravitreal injection. However, there are numerous challenges to be overcome before transscleral delivery will be a significant treatment option. The resistance of the sclera is extremely well understood, but the other tissues, especially the retinal pigment epithelium, clearly demand more attention and the effect of drug chemistry remains poorly understood. In this review, the major research on transscleral delivery with an emphasis on current understanding of these points and open questions for the field is summarized."

Many patients suffering from psoriasis now benefit from the increased understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, which in turn drives translational efforts to test new therapeutic concepts in the clinic. However, a multitude of treatment options is currently needed to satisfy patient needs. AREAS COVERED: This review describes the drug discovery platform in relation to psoriasis with special emphasis on how the major disease mechanisms of psoriasis can be studied in experimental in vitro and in vivo settings. The value of using humanized models and experimental clinical studies is highlighted. EXPERT OPINION: The successful development of novel therapies requires a translational approach to develop and implement the best preclinical and experimental clinical models and analytical tools that capture the various biological aspects of the disease. There is a need for more advanced in vitro skin models that contain the relevant cellular constituents as well as a need for careful validation of relevant in vivo models for psoriasis."

        "abstract": "Background: Recent studies have shown that approximately one in six women of reproductive age use potentially teratogenic medications. Since the pregnancy section in drug labeling is often inconsistent or incomplete, many pregnant women may inadvertently expose their fetus to potentially teratogenic drugs. Methods: We examined the pregnancy section in the labeling of six potentially teratogenic drugs: thalidomide, isotretinoin, leflunomide, warfarin sodium, alprazolam, and lisinopril. We also reviewed regulatory guidelines that address issues regarding contraception method use. Results: The amount of information regarding contraception use in drug labeling varied. Occasionally, this information was not found altogether. Regulatory guidelines regarding contraception use, albeit useful, do not comprehensively cover all relevant areas. Conclusion: There is a need for an internationally harmonized regulatory guideline that clearly defines when, how, and what type of contraception methods should be used, as well as what type of contraception information should be included in the labeling.

        "abstract": "Local skin targeting is of interest for the pharmaceutical and the cosmetic industry. A topically applied substance has basically three possibilities to penetrate into the skin: transcellular, intercellular, and follicular. The transfollicular path has been largely ignored because hair follicles constitute only 0.1% of the total skin. The hair follicle is a skin appendage with a complex structure containing many cell types that produce highly specialised proteins. The hair follicle is in a continuous cycle: anagen is the hair growth phase, catagen the involution phase and telogen is the resting phase. Nonetheless, the hair follicle has great potential for skin treatment, owing to its deep extension into the dermis and thus provides much deeper penetration and absorption of compounds beneath the skin than seen with the transdermal route. In the case of skin diseases and of cosmetic products, delivery to sweat glands or to the pilosebaceous unit is essential for the effectiveness of the drug. Increased accumulation in the pilosebaceous unit could treat alopecia, acne and skin cancer more efficiently and improve the effect of cosmetic substances and nutrients. Therefore, we review herein various drug delivery systems, including liposomes, niosomes, microspheres, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, lipid nanocarriers, gene therapy and discuss the results of recent researches. We also review the drugs which have been investigated for pilosebaceous delivery."

Recombinant proteins, enzymes, and monoclonal antibodies can be re-engineered for transport across the human BBB with the molecular Trojan horse technology. The most active BBB molecular Trojan horse is a monoclonal antibody to the human insulin receptor. The genetic engineering of IgG fusion proteins has been demonstrated for neurotrophic factors, decoy receptors, therapeutic enzymes, single chain Fv antibodies, and avidin. The IgG fusion proteins are not toxic on repeated administration in high doses to primates and do not interfere with glycemic control in plasma or brain. IgG fusion proteins contain amino acid sequences that induce immune tolerance, and show low immunogenicity in primates. The IgG fusion proteins are new bifunctional biopharmaceuticals that are both targeted to brain via transport on endogenous BBB receptors, and exert pharmacological effects in brain at the cognate receptor, ligand, or enzyme substrate."

In the meantime, increasing numbers of patients have turned to social media to share their experiences with drugs, medical devices, and vaccines.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the level of concordance between Twitter posts mentioning AE-like reactions and spontaneous reports received by a regulatory agency.\\n\\nMETHODS: We collected public English-language Twitter posts mentioning 23 medical products from 1 November 2012 through 31 May 2013. Data were filtered using a semi-automated process to identify posts with resemblance to AEs (Proto-AEs). A dictionary was developed to translate Internet vernacular to a standardized regulatory ontology for analysis (MedDRA(\u00ae)). Aggregated frequency of identified product-event pairs was then compared with data from the public FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) by System Organ Class (SOC).\\n\\nRESULTS: Of the 6.9 million Twitter posts collected, 4,401 Proto-AEs were identified out of 60,000 examined. Automated, dictionary-based symptom classification had 86 % recall and 72 % precision [corrected]. Similar overall distribution profiles were observed, with Spearman rank correlation rho of 0.75 (p < 0.0001) between Proto-AEs reported in Twitter and FAERS by SOC.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Patients reporting AEs on Twitter showed a range of sophistication when describing their experience. Despite the public availability of these data, their appropriate role in pharmacovigilance has not been established. Additional work is needed to improve data acquisition and automation."

However, within the past few years, the commercial value of novel targets in licensing deals has fallen dramatically, reflecting that the probability of reaching a clinical drug candidate for a novel target is very low. This has naturally led to questions regarding the success of target-based drug discovery and, more importantly, a search for alternatives. This paper evaluates the strengths and limitations of the main drug discovery approaches, and proposes a novel approach that could offer advantages for the identification of disease-modifying treatments."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this review was to estimate the extent of under-reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to spontaneous reporting systems and to investigate whether there are differences between different types of ADRs. A systematic literature search was carried out to identify studies providing a numerical estimate of under-reporting. Studies were included regardless of the methodology used or the setting, e.g. hospital versus general practice. Estimates of under-reporting were either extracted directly from the published study or calculated from the study data. These were expressed as the percentage of ADRs detected from intensive data collection that were not reported to the relevant local, regional or national spontaneous reporting systems. The median under-reporting rate was calculated across all studies and within subcategories of studies using different methods or settings. In total, 37 studies using a wide variety of surveillance methods were identified from 12 countries. These generated 43 numerical estimates of under-reporting. The median under-reporting rate across the 37 studies was 94% (interquartile range 82-98%). There was no significant difference in the median under-reporting rates calculated for general practice and hospital-based studies. Five of the ten general practice studies provided evidence of a higher median under-reporting rate for all ADRs compared with more serious or severe ADRs (95% and 80%, respectively). In comparison, for five of the eight hospital-based studies the median under-reporting rate for more serious or severe ADRs remained high (95%). The median under-reporting rate was lower for 19 studies investigating specific serious/severe ADR-drug combinations but was still high at 85%. This systematic review provides evidence of significant and widespread under-reporting of ADRs to spontaneous reporting systems including serious or severe ADRs. Further work is required to assess the impact of under-reporting on public health decisions and the effects of initiatives to improve reporting such as internet reporting, pharmacist/nurse reporting and direct patient reporting as well as improved education and training of healthcare professionals."

Coupled with the completion of the malaria genome, this has presented exciting opportunities for target-based antimalarial drug discovery. However, the unraveling of more validated biological targets will not necessarily translate into the identification of new chemical entities that are effective against drug resistant parasites in the long term. As history has already shown, development of antiplasmodial agents aimed at a single parasite target or specialized process has failed to stem the tide of drug resistance. This review highlights recent starting points and/or approaches to antimalarial drug discovery with particular emphasis on innovative efforts, which are not necessarily based on the identification of new drug targets and attendant inhibitor design. Approaches covered include utilization of validated chemical scaffolds, bioprecursor and carrier prodrugs, double drug development and/or multi-therapeutic strategies, use of metallocenic scaffolds, the medicinal chemistry of antimalarial natural products and in silico drug design."

Therefore, developing a novel approaches enhancing the CNS delivery of anti-HIV drugs are required for the treatment of neuro-AIDS. The aim of this study was to develop intranasal nanoemulsion (NE) for enhanced bioavailability and CNS targeting of saquinavir mesylate (SQVM). SQVM is a protease inhibitor which is a poorly soluble drug widely used as antiretroviral drug, with oral bioavailability is about 4%. The spontaneous emulsification method was used to prepare drug-loaded o/w nanoemulsion, which was characterized by droplet size, zeta potential, pH, drug content. Moreover, ex-vivo permeation studies were performed using sheep nasal mucosa. The optimized NE showed a significant increase in drug permeation rate compared to the plain drug suspension (PDS). Cilia toxicity study on sheep nasal mucosa showed no significant adverse effect of SQVM-loaded NE. Results of in vivo biodistribution studies show higher drug concentration in brain after intranasal administration of NE than intravenous delivered PDS. The higher percentage of drug targeting efficiency (% DTE) and nose-to-brain drug direct transport percentage (% DTP) for optimized NE indicated effective CNS targeting of SQVM via intranasal route. Gamma scintigraphy imaging of the rat brain conclusively demonstrated transport of drug in the CNS at larger extent after intranasal administration as NE."

        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reporting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has traditionally been the sole province of healthcare professionals. Since 2003 in Denmark, consumers have been able to report ADRs directly to the authorities. The objective of this study was to compare ADRs reported by consumers with ADRs reported from other sources, in terms of their type, seriousness and the suspected medicines involved. METHODS: The number of ADRs reported to the Danish ADR database from 2004 to 2006 was analysed in terms of category of reporter, seriousness, category of ADRs by system organ class (SOC) and the suspected medicines on level 1 of the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system. ADR reports from consumers were compared with reports from other sources (physicians, pharmacists, lawyers, pharmaceutical companies and other healthcare professionals). Chi-square and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to investigate the dependence between type of reporter and reported ADRs (classified by ATC or SOC). FINDINGS: We analysed 6319 ADR reports corresponding to 15 531 ADRs. Consumers reported 11% of the ADRs. Consumers' share of 'serious' ADRs was comparable to that of physicians (approximately 45%) but lower than that of pharmacists and other healthcare professionals. When consumer reports were compared with reports from other sources, consumers were more likely to report ADRs from the following SOCs: 'nervous system disorders' (OR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.05, 1.53); 'psychiatric disorders' (OR = 1.70; 95% CI 1.31, 2.20) and 'reproductive system and breast disorders' (OR = 2.02; 95% CI 1.13, 3.61) than other sources. Compared with other sources, consumers reported fewer ADRs from the SOCs 'blood and lymphatic system disorders' (OR = 0.22; 95% CI 0.08, 0.59) and 'hepatobiliary system disorders' (OR = 0.14; 95% CI 0.04, 0.57). Consumers were more likely to report ADRs from the ATC group N (nervous system) [OR = 2.72; 95% CI 2.34, 3.17], ATC group P (antiparasitic products) [OR = 2.41; 95% CI 1.32, 4.52] and ATC group S (sensory organs) [OR = 4.79; 95% CI 2.04, 11.23] than other sources. Consumers reported fewer ADRs from the ATC group B (blood and blood-forming organs) [OR = 0.04; 95% CI 0.006, 0.32] and the ATC groups J (anti-infective for systemic use) [OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.33, 0.58], L (antioneoplastic and immunomodulating agents) [OR = 0.19; 95% CI 0.12, 0.30] and V (various) [OR = 0.03; 95% CI 0.004, 0.21] than other sources. In the SOC 'nervous system disorders', consumers reported seven categories of ADRs that were not reported by the other sources. CONCLUSION: This study showed that compared with other sources, consumers reported different categories of ADRs for different types of medicines. Consumers should be actively included in systematic drug surveillance systems, including clinical settings, and their reports should be taken as seriously as reports from other sources."

        "abstract": "Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an increasingly relevant issue for healthcare systems as they are associated with poorer health outcomes and avoidable misuse of resources. The rates of ADEs are higher in the elderly population, as many older patients have comorbidities, multiple drug prescriptions and deteriorated physical and cognitive functioning. The occurrence of ADEs can lead to a perceived lack of therapy efficacy and further underuse or suboptimal adherence in elderly people, with detrimental clinical outcomes. The present article systematically reviews the studies evaluating the economic impact of ADEs occurring as consequence of poor therapy adherence, inappropriate drug use, underuse of effective treatments and poor adherence, medication errors, drug-drug and drug-disease interactions.A Medline systematic literature review of studies evaluating the economic consequences of inappropriate drug prescribing, lack of adherence and compliance, ADEs in older people was performed. English-language articles were screened through a three-step approach (title review, abstract review, full article review) to select pertinent studies quantitatively evaluating costs. We systematically reviewed evidence from767 articles. After title, abstract and full text review, 21 articles were found to measure economic implications ofADEs, inappropriate drug prescribing and poor adherence in elderly patients. Studies suggested that the economic impact of these undesired effects is substantial: hospital costs were the main cost driver, with a relevant part of them being preventable (consequences of inappropriate prescribing). Healthcare costs for unused drug wastage and destruction were also surprisingly high.Although economic evidence in elderly patients is still limited, all studies seemed to confirm that the financial burden due to pharmacological treatment issues is relevant in elderly people. Including economic effects of adverse events in pharmacoeconomic analysis would be beneficial to improve the reliability of results. Preliminary evidence suggests that programmes aimed at comprehensively assessing geriatric conditions, detecting 'high-risk' prescriptions and training patients to comply with prescribed therapies could be costeffective measures to reduce the burden of ADEs."

        "abstract": "Mebeverine Hydrochloride (MB-HCl), an effective spasmolytic drug, was formulated as CODES. A colon-specific drug delivery technology CODES was designed to avoid the inherent problems associated with pH- or time-dependent systems. To achieve more protection and control of drug release, MB-HCl was prepared as microspheres and compressed as core tablets of CODES (modified CODES). The core tablets contained the drug either in free form [Formula 1 (F(1))], or as microspheres with 2 different polymer:drug:lactulose ratios (1:1:0.5 [Formula 2 (F(2))] and 2:1:0.5 [Formula 3 (F(3))]. The release profiles of the coated CODES systems were compared with uncoated compressed tablets. The uncoated tablet showed a drug release of 94% after 1 h in simulated gastric condition (pH = 1.2). The release characteristics of the coated systems revealed that the enteric coating (Eudragit L(100)) prevented any drug release in simulated gastric or duodenal conditions in the first 3 h (pH 1.2-6.1), after which drug was slightly liberated in simulated intestinal fluid (pH 7.4) {Phase 1 (P1)}. After 4 h the pH was adjusted to 7 and beta-glucose-oxidase was added, which is an enzyme produced by enterobacteria present in the colon. The acid-soluble coat (Eudragit)E(100)) dissolved and the drug release suddenly increased to reach 95, 72 and 60.4% for F(1)-F(3), respectively. IR spectrum study showed a covalent bond between the drug and the polymer in the formulae F(2) and F(3) resulting in the sustained drug release from the microspheres with a significant difference (p>0.05) to F(1). The findings were confirmed by in vivo investigation using X-ray images for Guinea pigs ingested tablets containing barium sulphate (F(4)), where the tablet began to disintegrate after 10 h of tablet intake. The results of the study indicated that MB-HCl CODES colon-specific drug delivery can act as a successful trigger for drug targeting in the colon. Furthermore, a sustained release of the drug can be achieved from modified CODES containing the drug in the form of microspheres."

        "abstract": "Prediction tools are commonly used in pre-clinical research to assist target selection, to optimize drug potency or to predict the pharmacological profile of drug candidates. In silico prediction and overcoming drug resistance is a new opportunity that creates a high interest in pharmaceutical research. This review presents two main in silico strategies to meet this challenge: a structure-based approach to study the influence of mutations on the drug-target interaction and a system-biology approach to identify resistance pathways for a given drug. In silico screening of synergies between therapeutic and resistant pathways through biological network analysis is an example of technique to escape drug resistance. Structure-based drug design and in silico system biology are complementary approaches to reach few objectives at once: increase efficiency, reduce toxicity and overcoming drug resistance. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd."
