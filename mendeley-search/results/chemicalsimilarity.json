        "abstract": "As repositories of chemical molecules continue to expand and become more open, it becomes increasingly important to develop tools to search them efficiently and assess the statistical significance of chemical similarity scores. Here, we develop a general framework for understanding, modeling, predicting, and approximating the distribution of chemical similarity scores and its extreme values in large databases. The framework can be applied to different chemical representations and similarity measures but is demonstrated here using the most common binary fingerprints with the Tanimoto similarity measure. After introducing several probabilistic models of fingerprints, including the Conditional Gaussian Uniform model, we show that the distribution of Tanimoto scores can be approximated by the distribution of the ratio of two correlated Normal random variables associated with the corresponding unions and intersections. This remains true also when the distribution of similarity scores is conditioned on the size of the query molecules to derive more fine-grained results and improve chemical retrieval. The corresponding extreme value distributions for the maximum scores are approximated by Weibull distributions. From these various distributions and their analytical forms, Z-scores, E-values, and p-values are derived to assess the significance of similarity scores. In addition, the framework also allows one to predict the value of standard chemical retrieval metrics, such as sensitivity and specificity at fixed thresholds, or receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves at multiple thresholds, and to detect outliers in the form of atypical molecules. Numerous and diverse experiments that have been performed, in part with large sets of molecules from the ChemDB, show remarkable agreement between theory and empirical results.",

One common application of chemical similarity measurements, based on the principle that similar molecules have similar properties, is the read-across approach, where an estimation of a specific endpoint for a chemical is provided using experimental data available from highly similar compounds.\\n\\nRESULTS: This paper reports the comparison of multiple combinations of binary fingerprints and similarity metrics for computing the chemical similarity in the context of two different applications of the read-across technique.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates that the classical similarity measurements can be improved with a generalizable model of similarity. The proposed approach has already been used to build similarity indices in two open-source software tools (CAESAR and VEGA) that make several QSAR models available. In these tools, the similarity index plays a key role for the assessment of the applicability domain.",

This new method, called LaSSI, uses the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a chemical descriptor-molecule matrix to create a low-dimensional representation of the original descriptor space. Ranking molecules by similarity to a probe molecule in the reduced-dimensional space has several advantages over analogous ranking in the original descriptor space: matching latent structures is more robust than matching discrete descriptors, choosing the number of singular values provides a rational way to vary the \"fuzziness\" of the search, and the reduction in the dimensionality of the chemical space increases searching speed. LaSSI also allows the calculation of the similarity between two descriptors and between a descriptor and a molecule.",

The Gumbel distribution with a Gaussian correction term was identified as the most similar to the observed empirical distributions. These techniques were applied in retrospective screenings on a drug-like dataset. Obtained p-values were adjusted to the size of the screening library with four different methods.

        "abstract": "Motivation: The urgent need for efficient and sustainable biological production of fuels and high-value chemicals has elicited a wave of in silico techniques for identifying promising novel pathways to these compounds in large putative metabolic networks. To date, these approaches have primarily used general graph search algorithms, which are prohibitively slow as putative metabolic networks may exceed 1 million compounds. To alleviate this limitation, we report two methods\u2014SimIndex (SI) and SimZyme\u2014which use chemical similarity of 2D chemical fingerprints to efficiently navigate large metabolic networks and propose enzymatic connections between the constituent nodes. We also report a Byers\u2013Waterman type pathway search algorithm for further paring down pertinent networks. Results: Benchmarking tests run with SI show it can reduce the number of nodes visited in search- ing a putative network by 100-fold with a computational time improvement of up to 105-fold. Subsequent Byers\u2013Waterman search application further reduces the number of nodes searched by up to 100-fold, while SimZyme demonstrates ?90% accuracy in matching query substrates with enzymes. Using these modules, we have designed and annotated an alternative to the methylery- thritol phosphate pathway to produce isopentenyl pyrophosphate with more favorable thermo- dynamics than the native pathway. These algorithms will have a significant impact on our ability to use large metabolic networks that lack annotation of promiscuous reactions. Availability",

The map was constructed using principal component analysis covering 899 drugs described by 67 diverse calculated chemical descriptors. The anchor molecules (diclofenac, trimethoprim, and carbamazepine) were selected to represent drugs of known environmental concern. In addition 12 chemicals listed by the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants were used representing typical environmental pollutants. Chemical similarity was quantified by measuring relative Euclidean distances in the five-dimensional chemical map, and more than 100 nearest neighbors (kNNs) were found within a relative distance of less than 10% from each drug anchor. The developed chemical similarity approach not only identified persistent or semipersistent drugs but also a large number of potentially persistent drugs lacking environmental fate data.",

Similarity assessment based on structures is a convenient and popular means of comparison but needs to account for each specific activity or toxicity. This mini review starts by providing an overview of the history and philosophy of similarity in general. It describes the different means of quantifying chemicals and how these numerical descriptors can be applied in so-called similarity indices to compare chemicals with respect to their activity or toxicity.

        "abstract": "Target identification is one of the most critical steps following cell-based phenotypic chemical screens aimed at identifying compounds with potential uses in cell biology and for developing novel disease therapies. Current in silico target identification methods, including chemical similarity database searches, are limited to single or sequential ligand analysis that have limited capabilities for accurate deconvolution of a large number of compounds with diverse chemical structures. Here, we present CSNAP (Chemical Similarity Network Analysis Pulldown), a new computational target identification method that utilizes chemical similarity networks for large-scale chemotype (consensus chemical pattern) recognition and drug target profiling. Our benchmark study showed that CSNAP can achieve an overall higher accuracy (>80%) of target prediction with respect to representative chemotypes in large (>200) compound sets, in comparison to the SEA approach (60-70%). Additionally, CSNAP is capable of integrating with biological knowledge-based databases (Uniprot, GO) and high-throughput biology platforms (proteomic, genetic, etc) for system-wise drug target validation. To demonstrate the utility of the CSNAP approach, we combined CSNAP's target prediction with experimental ligand evaluation to identify the major mitotic targets of hit compounds from a cell-based chemical screen and we highlight novel compounds targeting microtubules, an important cancer therapeutic target. The CSNAP method is freely available and can be accessed from the CSNAP web server (http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/CSNAP/).",

        "abstract": "To investigate the role of template plasticity in shaping nest-mate recognition processes in ants, we constructed experimental mixed-species groups of Manica rubida with either Myrmica rubra, Tetramorium bicarinatum or Formica selysi. Selecting Ma. rubida as the focal species, we observed the behaviour within mixed-species groups and the transfer rates of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) onto the focal ants, and we also tested the aggression of the focal species reared either alone or in association with each of the three different species. We show that Ma. rubida workers were always amicable towards their mixed group members, as towards members of the respective parental colonies, irrespective of the associated species. They did, however, express different levels of aggression towards single-species groups of the other species tested, depending on the species with which they were reared. The study suggests that similarity in CHC profiles in two species leads to a narrow template in mixed groups, while dissimilarity is followed by lower levels of aggression (a broader template), at least against species with similar CHC compound compositions (i.e. both a broader template in the focal ants and familiarity with the compound groups of the tested individuals operate together). This refutes the hypothesis that ants reared in mixed-species groups are systematically more tolerant. It also demonstrates that heterospecific information is not treated equally during development. We suggest that post-imaginal learning, template reforming and decision making are more precisely tuned when the two species' chemical complexes are similar.",

Two amino acids have been designed, synthesized and characterized. These compounds differ in the presence or not of a methylene group between the EDOT ring and the backbone (i.e. I and II, respectively). The electrochemical properties of PEDOT and their conjugates with I and II (PEDOT-I and PEDOT-II) have been determined using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and subsequently compared. Incorporation of end capping amino acids has been found to increase the hydrophilicity of PEDOT surface, which is consistent with the better behaviour of the conjugates as the cellular matrix. The electronic properties of both the amino acids and the conjugates have been investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy. Results indicate that elimination of the methylene group of I provokes a reduction of 0.13 eV in the pi-pi* lowest transition energy (E-g) of the conjugate. This decrease is explained by the larger structural flexibility due to the methylene group in I. Calculations of the electronic properties of the two hybrids at the molecular level using quantum mechanical methods suggest that the end capping amino acids essentially affect the electronic intermolecular effects.",

The aims of this study were to determine whether guards exhibit a restrictive level of rejection towards chemically distinct individuals, becoming more permissive during the encounters with either nestmate or non-nestmate individuals bearing chemically similar profiles. The study demonstrates that Melipona asilvai (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini) guards exhibit a flexible system of nestmate recognition according to the degree of chemical similarity between the incoming forager and its own cuticular hydrocarbons profile. Guards became less restrictive in their acceptance rates when they encounter non-nestmates with highly similar chemical profiles, which they probably mistake for nestmates, hence broadening their acceptance level.",

        "abstract": "A protein-bound conformation of a target molecule can be predicted by aligning the target molecule on the reference molecule obtained from the 3D structure of the compound-protein complex. This strategy is called \"similarity-based docking\". For this purpose, we develop the flexible alignment program fkcombu, which aligns the target molecule based on atomic correspondences with the reference molecule. The correspondences are obtained by the maximum common substructure (MCS) of 2D chemical structures, using our program kcombu. The prediction performance was evaluated using many target-reference pairs of superimposed ligand 3D structures on the same protein in the PDB, with different ranges of chemical similarity. The details of atomic correspondence largely affected the prediction success. We found that topologically constrained disconnected MCS (TD-MCS) with the simple element-based atomic classification provides the best prediction. The crashing potential energy with the receptor protein improved the performance. We also found that the RMSD between the predicted and correct target conformations significantly correlates with the chemical similarities between target-reference molecules. Generally speaking, if the reference and target compounds have more than 70% chemical similarity, then the average RMSD of 3D conformations is <2.0 \u00c5. We compared the performance with a rigid-body molecular alignment program based on volume-overlap scores (ShaEP). Our MCS-based flexible alignment program performed better than the rigid-body alignment program, especially when the target and reference molecules were sufficiently similar.",

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Small organic molecules, from nucleotides and amino acids to metabolites and drugs, play a fundamental role in chemistry, biology and medicine. As databases of small molecules continue to grow and become more open, it is important to develop the tools to search them efficiently. In order to develop a BLAST-like tool for small molecules, one must first understand the statistical behavior of molecular similarity scores. RESULTS: We develop a new detailed theory of molecular similarity scores that can be applied to a variety of molecular representations and similarity measures. For concreteness, we focus on the most widely used measure--the Tanimoto measure applied to chemical fingerprints. In both the case of empirical fingerprints and fingerprints generated by several stochastic models, we derive accurate approximations for both the distribution and extreme value distribution of similarity scores. These approximation are derived using a ratio of correlated Gaussians approach. The theory enables the calculation of significance scores, such as Z-scores and P-values, and the estimation of the top hits list size. Empirical results obtained using both the random models and real data from the ChemDB database are given to corroborate the theory and show how it can be applied to mine chemical space.

        "abstract": "A virtual screening protocol has been applied to seek non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (NNRTIs) and its K103N mutant. First, a chemical similarity search on the Maybridge library was performed using known NNRTIs as reference structures. The top-ranked molecules obtained from this procedure plus 26 known NNRTIs were then docked into the binding sites of the wild-type reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT) and its K103N variant (K103N-RT) using Glide 3.5. The top-ranked 100 compounds from the docking for both proteins were post-scored with a procedure using molecular mechanics and continuum solvation (MM-GB/SA). The validity of the virtual screening protocol was supported by (i) testing of the MM-GB/SA procedure, (ii) agreement between predicted and crystallographic binding poses, (iii) recovery of known potent NNRTIs at the top of both rankings, and (iv) identification of top-scoring library compounds that are close in structure to recently reported NNRTI HTS hits. However, purchase and assaying of selected top-scoring compounds from the library failed to yield active anti-HIV agents. Nevertheless, the highest-ranked database compound, S10087, was pursued as containing a potentially viable core. Subsequent synthesis and assaying of S10087 analogues proposed by further computational analysis yielded anti-HIV agents with EC50 values as low as 310 nM. Thus, with the aid of computational tools, it was possible to evolve a false positive into a true active.",

At present, accurate prediction of solubility remains very challenging and there is an important need of independent benchmarking of the existing in silico models such as to suggest solutions for their improvement. In this study, we developed a new protocol for improved solubility prediction by combining several existing models available in commercial or free software packages. We first performed an evaluation of ten in silico models for aqueous solubility prediction on several data sets in order to assess the reliability of the methods, and we proposed a new diverse data set of 150 molecules as relevant test set, SolDiv150. We developed a random forest protocol to evaluate the performance of different fingerprints for aqueous solubility prediction based on molecular structure similarity. Our protocol, called a \"multimodel protocol\", allows selecting the most accurate model for a compound of interest among the employed models or software packages, achieving r(2) of 0.84 when applied to SolDiv150. We also found that all models assessed here performed better on druglike molecules than on real drugs, thus additional improvement is needed in this direction. Overall, our approach enlarges the applicability domain as demonstrated by the more accurate results for solubility prediction obtained using our protocol in comparison to using individual models.",

In this work, an electroactive polymer-amino acid hybrid material has been synthesized by conjugating poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), a well known conducting polymer, with a synthetic amino acid bearing 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, which has been explicitly designed and prepared for such a purpose. Nanometric films have been electrochemically generated using a two-step procedure to evaluate the properties and potential applications of the resulting hybrid material. The successful incorporation of the amino acid as end-capping of the PEDOT chains has been proved by FTIR, energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. The fabrication of the hybrid material using an engineered tissue has allowed us to preserve not only morphological and structural characteristics of the conducting polymer but also, and most importantly, to preserve the electrical conductivity, electroactivity, electrochemical stability and specific capacitance. Finally, the behavior of the hybrid material as a cellular matrix has been compared with that of PEDOT using cellular adhesion and proliferation assays. Results obtained in this work represent the success of a new strategy for the preparation of peptide-conducting polymer hybrid materials, which is currently being improved upon by transforming the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene- containing amino acid into a cell adhesive peptide.",

        "abstract": "Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a triplet repeating disorder caused by expanded CTG repeats in the 3'-untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The transcribed repeats fold into an RNA hairpin with multiple copies of a 5'CUG/3'GUC motif that binds the RNA splicing regulator muscleblind-like 1 protein (MBNL1). Sequestration of MBNL1 by expanded r(CUG) repeats causes splicing defects in a subset of pre-mRNAs including the insulin receptor, the muscle-specific chloride ion channel, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 1, and cardiac troponin T. Based on these observations, the development of small-molecule ligands that target specifically expanded DM1 repeats could be of use as therapeutics. In the present study, chemical similarity searching was employed to improve the efficacy of pentamidine and Hoechst 33258 ligands that have been shown previously to target the DM1 triplet repeat. A series of in vitro inhibitors of the RNA-protein complex were identified with low micromolar IC(50)'s, which are >20-fold more potent than the query compounds. Importantly, a bis-benzimidazole identified from the Hoechst query improves DM1-associated pre-mRNA splicing defects in cell and mouse models of DM1 (when dosed with 1 mM and 100 mg/kg, respectively). Since Hoechst 33258 was identified as a DM1 binder through analysis of an RNA motif-ligand database, these studies suggest that lead ligands targeting RNA with improved biological activity can be identified by using a synergistic approach that combines analysis of known RNA-ligand interactions with chemical similarity searching.",

        "abstract": "Motivation. Molecular similarity studies play an important role in todays drug discovery research for finding new lead compounds with the expectation that similar molecules would exhibit similar biological activities. Such approaches are of special importance when one tries to find lead compounds from the databases of thousands to millions of compounds. Although a number of similarity measures are available in the literature, it appears that a similarity measure that takes care of the variety/diversity in structural components, such as substructures, of chemical compounds might find useful applications in this regard and Shannons measure of information content of a discrete system may be useful in formulating such a similarity index. However, for doing similarity analyses using molecular descriptors, availability of suitable molecular descriptors becomes an essential requirement too. Graphtheoretical descriptors have been found to be very useful in this purpose since they are fast to compute and take care of important structural aspects. Also, there is a special interest for the descriptors reflecting shape and size aspects of molecules since they are related to the fitting/docking of small molecules in the macromolecular receptor sites. We intend to address these aspects in the present communication. Method. In this paper, we have proposed a new informationtheoretical measure of similarity, INFSIM, based on Shannons measure of information content of a discrete system. In our study, we have also used a topological shape and size index, TSS, defined for small molecules. These indices have been used to carry out molecular similarity analysis for qualitative discrimination (active/inactive) of eleven betalactams, taken from the literature, with respect to the antibacterial activity of penicillin G. These studies have been carried out using the software AZMOLTOP. Results. It appears from the present study that the molecules under consideration may be effectively classified using INFSIM and TSS indices since the similarity values seem to be reflected in the experimentally determined activities of the compounds. A comparative study with Tanimoto similarity indicates that the proposed method has performed relatively better similarity assessment for the studied compounds. Conclusions. The results indicate that the similarity index INFSIM may find useful application in classifying compounds of a database qualitatively according to their activities on the basis of the structural features encoded by TSS. Since TSS is believed to translate the topological shape and size of chemical compounds effectively, it may find applications in database screening for the identification of new lead compounds in drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Acetylcholine activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) by binding to an extracellular site located at the interface of two adjacent subunits. In contrast, recent studies have provided evidence that positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) such as TQS (4-(naphthalen-2-yl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline-8-sulfonamide) and allosteric agonists such as 4BP-TQS (4-(4-bromophenyl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline-8-sulfonamide) interact at an intrasubunit transmembrane site. Here, we describe the synthesis and pharmacological characterization of a series of chemically related allosteric modulators of the \u03b17 nAChR. Minimal changes in the chemical structure of these compounds have been found to exert profound effects on their pharmacological properties. For example, compounds containing a bromine atom at either the ortho or meta position on the phenyl ring, such as 2BP-TQS (4-(2-bromophenyl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline-8-sulfonamide) and 3BP-TQS (4-(3-bromophenyl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline-8-sulfonamide), rather than at the para position (4BP-TQS), display no allosteric agonist activity but retain PAM activity on \u03b17 nAChRs, demonstrating the importance of the location of the halogen atom on pharmacological properties. Replacement of the bromine atom in 4BP-TQS with either a chlorine [4CP-TQS (4-(4-chloroophenyl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline-8-sulfonamide)] or an iodine atom [4IP-TQS (4-(4-iodoophenyl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline-8-sulfonamide)] results in compounds that have pharmacological properties characteristic of allosteric agonists but display differences in activation rates, in inactivation rates, and in levels of desensitization. In contrast, replacement of the bromine atom in 4BP-TQS with a fluorine atom [4FP-TQS (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline-8-sulfonamide)] generated a compound that lacks allosteric agonist activity but acts a potentiator of responses to acetylcholine. In addition, 4FP-TQS was found to act as an antagonist of responses evoked by allosteric agonists such as 4BP-TQS. These findings provide evidence of the pharmacological diversity of compounds interacting with the allosteric transmembrane site on \u03b17 nAChRs.",

We investigated the role of host secondary compounds on pheromone production by the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) (MPB) and beetle attraction in response to a historical (lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and a novel (jack pine, Pinus banksiana) hosts, as pheromones regulate the host colonization process. Beetles emit the same pheromones from both hosts, but more trans-verbenol, the primary aggregation pheromone, was emitted by female beetles on the novel host. The phloem of the novel host contains more \u03b1-pinene, a secondary compound that is the precursor for trans-verbenol production in beetle, than the historical host. Beetle-induced emission of 3-carene, another secondary compound found in both hosts, was also higher from the novel host. Field tests showed that the addition of 3-carene to the pheromone mixture mimicking the aggregation pheromones produced from the two host species increased beetle capture. We conclude that chemical similarity between historical and novel hosts has facilitated host expansion of MPB in jack pine forests through the exploitation of common host secondary compounds for pheromone production and aggregation on the hosts. Furthermore, broods emerging from the novel host were larger in terms of body size.",

        "abstract": "Virtual screening using bioactivity profiles has become an integral part of currently applied hit finding methods in pharmaceutical industry. However, a significant drawback of this approach is that it is only applicable to compounds that have been biologically tested in the past and have sufficient activity annotations for meaningful profile comparisons. Although bioactivity data generated in pharmaceutical institutions are growing on an unprecedented scale, the number of biologically annotated compounds still covers only a minuscule fraction of chemical space. For a newly synthesized compound or an isolated natural product to be biologically characterized across multiple assays, it may take a considerable amount of time. Consequently, this chemical matter will not be included in virtual screening campaigns based on bioactivity profiles. To overcome this problem, we herein introduce bioturbo similarity searching that uses chemical similarity to map molecules without biological annotations into bioactivity space and then searches for biologically similar compounds in this reference system. In benchmark calculations on primary screening data, we demonstrate that our approach generally achieves higher hit rates and identifies structurally more diverse compounds than approaches using chemical information only. Furthermore, our method is able to discover hits with novel modes of inhibition that traditional 2D and 3D similarity approaches are unlikely to discover. Test calculations on a set of natural products reveal the practical utility of the approach for identifying novel and synthetically more accessible chemical matter.",

Interesting complementarities between the two descriptions of molecules were observed. It has been shown that the accuracy of describing molecules with physicochemical descriptors like in ChemGPS-NP is similar to the accuracy of structural fingerprints in retrieving bioactive molecules. Lastly, pharmacological similarity of structurally diverse compounds has been investigated in ChemGPS-NP space.

Semantic similarity applied to enzymes has been used; here we show an approach using metabolites. While there is a number of methods to compare and align metabolic pathways based on metabolites, they are usually based only on their structural information neglecting their biological information. Results: In this work we present an alternative approach for mea- suring the semantic similarity between metabolic pathways by comparing their metabolites. This comparison is based on the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology, and can be useful in toxicology and drug discovery for assessment of biological activity of chemical compounds. We implemented a software capable of measuring the similarity between metabolic pathways present in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database and a preliminary analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Conclusions: We have shown that semantic similarity can be applied to pathways whose chemical compounds are annotated in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology. This work resulted in the creation of a software, CMPSim, accessible as a web-tool at http://xldb.di.fc. ul.pt/biotools/cmpsim/.

        "abstract": "In many modern chemoinformatics systems, molecules are represented by long binary fingerprint vectors recording the presence or absence of particular features or substructures, such as labeled paths or trees, in the molecular graphs. These long fingerprints are often compressed to much shorter fingerprints using a simple modulo operation. As the length of the fingerprints decreases, their typical density and overlap tend to increase, and so does any similarity measure based on overlap, such as the widely used Tanimoto similarity. Here we show that this correlation between shorter fingerprints and higher similarity can be thought of as a systematic error introduced by the fingerprint folding algorithm and that this systematic error can be corrected mathematically. More precisely, given two molecules and their compressed fingerprints of a given length, we show how a better estimate of their uncompressed overlap, hence of their similarity, can be derived to correct for this bias. We show how the correction can be implemented not only for the Tanimoto measure but also for all other commonly used measures. Experiments on various data sets and fingerprint sizes demonstrate how, with a negligible computational overhead, the correction noticeably improves the sensitivity and specificity of chemical retrieval.",

By sampling mother-offspring pairs from two different colonies, using a variety of statistical approaches and genotyping a large panel of microsatellite loci, we show that colony membership, mother-offspring similarity, heterozygosity, and genetic relatedness are all chemically encoded. Moreover, chemical similarity between mothers and offspring reflects a combination of genetic and environmental influences, the former partly encoded by substances resembling known pheromones. Our findings reveal the diversity of information contained within chemical fingerprints and have implications for understanding mother-offspring communication, kin recognition, and mate choice.",

        "abstract": "Chemical space networks (CSNs) have been introduced as a coordinate-free representation of chemical space. In CSNs, nodes represent compounds and edges pairwise similarity relationships. These network representations are mostly used to navigate sections of biologically relevant chemical space. Different types of CSNs have been designed on the basis of alternative similarity measures including continuous numerical similarity values or substructure-based similarity criteria. CSNs can be characterized and compared on the basis of statistical concepts from network science. Herein, a new CSN design is introduced that is based upon asymmetric similarity assessment using the Tversky coefficient and termed TV-CSN. Compared to other CSNs, TV-CSNs have unique features. While CSNs typically contain separate compound communities and exhibit small world character, many TV-CSNs are also scale-free in nature and contain hubs, i.e., extensively connected central compounds. Compared to other CSNs, these hubs are a characteristic of TV-CSN topology. Hub-containing compound communities are of particular interest for the exploration of structure-activity relationships.",

        "abstract": "Investigation of biological processes using selective chemical interventions is generally applied in biomedical research and drug discovery. Many studies of this kind make use of gene expression experiments to explore cellular responses to chemical interventions. Recently, some research groups constructed libraries of chemical related expression profiles, and introduced similarity comparison into chemical induced transcriptome analysis. Resembling sequence similarity alignment, expression pattern comparison among chemical intervention related expression profiles provides a new way for chemical function prediction and chemicalgene relation investigation. However, existing methods place more emphasis on comparing profile patterns globally, which ignore noises and marginal effects. At the same time, though the whole information of expression profiles has been used, it is difficult to uncover the underlying mechanisms that lead to the functional similarity between two molecules. Here a new approach is presented to perform biological effects similarity comparison within small biologically meaningful gene categories. Regarding gene categories as units, a reduced similarity matrix is generated for measuring the biological distances between query and profiles in library and pointing out in which modules do chemical pairs resemble. Through the modularization of expression patterns, this method reduces experimental noises and marginal effects and directly correlates chemical molecules with gene function modules.",

        "abstract": "Drug repositioning, also known as drug repurposing or reprofiling, is the process of finding new indications for established drugs. Because drug repositioning can reduce costs and enhance the efficiency of drug development, it is of paramount importance in medical research. Here, we present a systematic computational method to identify potential novel indications for a given drug. This method utilizes some prior knowledge such as 3D drug chemical structure information, drug\u2013target interactions and gene semantic similarity information. Its prediction is based on another form of \u2018expression profile\u2019, which contains scores ranging from -1 to 1, reflecting the consensus response scores (CRSs) between each drug of 965 and 1560 proteins. The CRS integrates chemical structure similarity and gene semantic similarity information. We define the degree of similarity between two drugs as the absolute value of their correlation coefficients. Finally, we establish a drug similarity network (DSN) and obtain 33 modules of drugs with similar modes of action, determining their common indications. Using these modules, we predict new indications for 143 drugs and identify previously unknown indications for 42 drugs without ATC codes. This method overcomes the instability of gene expression profiling derived from experiments due to experimental conditions, and predicts indications for a new compound feasibly, requiring only the 3D structure of the compound. In addition, the high literature validation rate of 71.8% also suggests that our method has the potential to discover novel drug indications for existing drugs.",

        "abstract": "The similarity comparison of binding sites based on amino acid between different proteins can facilitate protein function identification. However, Binding site usually consists of several crucial amino acids which are frequently dispersed among different regions of a protein and consequently make the comparison of binding sites difficult. In this study, we introduce a new method, named as chemical and geometric similarity of binding site (CGS-BSite), to compute the ligand binding site similarity based on discrete amino acids with maximum-weight bipartite matching algorithm. The principle of computing the similarity is to find a Euclidean Transformation which makes the similar amino acids approximate to each other in a geometry space, and vice versa. CGS-BSite permits site and ligand flexibilities, provides a stable prediction performance on the flexible ligand binding sites. Binding site prediction on three test datasets with CGS-BSite method has similar performance to Patch-Surfer method but outperforms other five tested methods, reaching to 0.80, 0.71 and 0.85 based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, respectively. It performs a marginally better than Patch-Surfer on the binding sites with small volume and higher hydrophobicity, and presents good robustness to the variance of the volume and hydrophobicity of ligand binding sites. Overall, our method provides an alternative approach to compute the ligand binding site similarity and predict potential special ligand binding sites from the existing ligand targets based on the target similarity.",

This paper compares the use of seven different methods that have been suggested previously for the standardization of integer-valued or real-valued data, comparing the results with unstandardized data. Sets of structures from the MDL Drug Data Report and IDAlert databases and represented by Pipeline Pilot physicochemical parameters, molecular holograms and Molconn-Z parameters are clustered using the k-means and Ward's clustering methods. The resulting classifications are evaluated in terms of the degree of clustering of active compounds selected from eleven different biological activity classes, with these classes also being used in similarity searches. It is shown that there is no consistent pattern when the various standardization methods are ranked in order of decreasing effectiveness and that there is no obvious performance benefit (when compared to unstandardized data) that is likely to be obtained from the use of any particular standardization method.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Our approach to the BioCreative IV challenge of recognition and classification of drug names (CHEMDNER task) aimed at achieving high levels of precision by applying semantic similarity validation techniques to Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) mappings. Our assumption is that the chemical entities mentioned in the same fragment of text should share some semantic relation. This validation method was further improved by adapting the semantic similarity measure to take into account the h-index of each ancestor. We applied this method in two measures, simUI and simGIC, and validated the results obtained for the competition, comparing each adapted measure to its original version. RESULTS: For the competition, we trained a Random Forest classifier that uses various scores provided by our system, including semantic similarity, which improved the F-measure obtained with the Conditional Random Fields classifiers by 4.6%. Using a notion of concept relevance based on the h-index measure, we were able to enhance our validation process so that for a fixed recall, we increased precision by excluding from the results a higher amount of false positives. We plotted precision and recall values for a range of validation thresholds using different similarity measures, obtaining higher precision values for the same recall with the measures based on the h-index. CONCLUSIONS: The semantic similarity measure we introduced was more efficient at validating text mining results from machine learning classifiers than other measures. We improved the results we obtained for the CHEMDNER task by maintaining high precision values while improving the recall and F-measure.",

        "abstract": "Animals are often immersed in a chemical world consisting of mixtures of many compounds rather than of single substances, and they constantly face the challenge of extracting relevant information out of the chemical landscape. To this purpose, the ability to discriminate among different stimuli with different valence is essential, but it is also important to be able to generalise, i.e. to treat different but similar stimuli as equivalent, as natural variation does not necessarily affect stimulus valence. Animals can thus extract regularities in their environment and make predictions, for instance about distribution of food resources. We studied perceptual similarity of different plant odours by conditioning individual carpenter ants to one odour, and subsequently testing their response to another, structurally different odour. We found that asymmetry in generalisation, where ants generalise from odour A to B, but not from B to A, is dependent on both chain length and functional group. By conditioning ants to a binary mixture, and testing their reaction to the individual components of the mixture, we show that overshadowing, where parts of a mixture are learned better than others, is rare. Additionally, generalisation is dependent not only on the structural similarity of odorants, but also on their functional value, which might play a crucial role. Our results provide insight into how ants make sense of the complex chemical world around them, for example in a foraging context, and provide a basis with which to investigate the neural mechanisms behind perceptual similarity.",

The best approaches existing today are based on the structure-activity relationship premise, which states that biological activity of a molecule is strongly related to its structural or physicochemical properties. This work presents a novel approach to the automatic classification of chemical compounds by integrating semantic similarity with existing structural comparison methods. Our approach was assessed based on the Matthews Correlation Coefficient for the prediction, and achieved values of 0.810 when used as a prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability, 0.694 for P-glycoprotein substrate, and 0.673 for estrogen receptor binding activity. These results expose a significant improvement over the currently existing methods, whose best performances were 0.628, 0.591, and 0.647 respectively. It was demonstrated that the integration of semantic similarity is a feasible and effective way to improve existing chemical compound classification systems. Among other possible uses, this tool helps the study of the evolution of metabolic pathways, the study of the correlation of metabolic networks with properties of those networks, or the improvement of ontologies that represent chemical information.",

        "abstract": "The large sizes of today's chemical databases require efficient algorithms to perform similarity searches. It can be very time consuming to compare two large chemical databases. This paper seeks to build upon existing research efforts by describing a novel strategy for accelerating existing search algorithms for comparing large chemical collections. The quest for efficiency has focused on developing better indexing algorithms by creating heuristics for searching individual chemical against a chemical library by detecting and eliminating needless similarity calculations. For comparing two chemical collections, these algorithms simply execute searches for each chemical in the query set sequentially. The strategy presented in this paper achieves a speedup upon these algorithms by indexing the set of all query chemicals so redundant calculations that arise in the case of sequential searches are eliminated. We implement this novel algorithm by developing a similarity search program called Symmetric inDexing or SymDex. SymDex shows over a 232% maximum speedup compared to the state-of-the-art single query search algorithm over real data for various fingerprint lengths. Considerable speedup is even seen for batch searches where query set sizes are relatively small compared to typical database sizes. To the best of our knowledge, SymDex is the first search algorithm designed specifically for comparing chemical libraries. It can be adapted to most, if not all, existing indexing algorithms and shows potential for accelerating future similarity search algorithms for comparing chemical databases.",

In geometric models, entities are represented by their positions in a multidimensional space, and similarity is based on the proximity of entities in this space. In featural models, entities are described by their features, and the similarity of entities is an increasing function of their shared features and/or a decreasing function of their unique features. In alignment-based models, the similarity between two structured entities is calculated by placing the elements of their structures into correspondence. In transformational models, the similarity between two entities is conceptualized as the number of transformations required to transform one entity into the other.

In some cases, the novel chemistry from biological reactions provides advances in chemical mechanisms to impact funda-mental understandings in chemistry as well as deeper under-standing in chemistry and biochemistry. The purpose of this JACS Select issue is to provide a cross section of recent articles that have appeared in the Journal of the American Chemical Society and report some of these advances. Selection of these articles was a daunting task because of the expanding research focus at the chemical biology interface, leading to an ever-growing number of publications.

Likewise, many excellent articles do not appear here because of subject overlap.

This Editorial draws on my own impressions of where these efforts are making an impact on future research at the chemistry\u00c0biology interface. Here, I summarize some of the high points of each article and provide some opinion as to where this work will impact the current state of research in the field. With only 24 publications, this selection cannot, in any way, reflect all areas of interest in biochemical mechanisms\u2014they would not be adequately cov-ered even in a selection of hundreds of articles. Since the topics are not intended to be connected by any common mechanism, the articles highlighed below are listed approximately in order of their appearance in JACS during 2010 and early 2011. The diversity of research articles in which chemistry and biochemistry overlap will be apparent from this JACS Select collection. Phosphatidylinositol phospholipases are critical elements in cell signaling, catalyzing the release of inositol 1-phosphate. Bruzik and co-workers 1 point out that all previously known phospholipase C enzymes catalyze cis cyclization to form inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate as an intermediate. Their present report characterizes a phospholipase C from Streptomyces antibioticus, a veritable microbial antibiotic factory. Using short-chain dihex-anoyl phosphothioate analogues of phosphatidylinositol, this enzyme is shown to catalyze a trans cyclization with 1,6-cyclic phosphate as an intermediate. The enzyme reveals an unprecedented ability to distinguish bridging and nonbridging thio effects. Although the biological function of this enzyme in Streptomyces remains to be discovered, it is capable of hydrolyzing structural analogues of phosphatidylinositol known to be present in cell membranes of micro-organisms and plants. Our tendency to categorize chemical mechanisms often leads us to oversimplify in the belief that \" if you've seen one phosphatidylinositol phospholipase, you've seen them all. \" This study provides an example of the evolutionary chemistry where more than one chemical mechanism fulfills the biological imperative to convert reactants to needed products. Proton transfer in biological systems can occur rapidly when donor\u00c0acceptor geometry and distance are optimized. In other cases, the transfer is gated by motions of the protein. Since protein motions take relatively long times, often nanoseconds to milliseconds, the time constants for proton transfer can tell us much about the elements involved in the transfer. Tonge, Meech, and co-workers 2 have examined the rate of proton transfer in green fluorescent protein (GFP), one of the most useful biolog-ical tools for imaging cellular compartments. Light excitation of neutral GFP generates the anionic state with emission of green fluorescence coupled to a three-step proton transfer along amino acids and the chromophore in a proton-transfer chain. Formation of the deprotonated state by the excitation step occurs within the 50 fs time resolution of the instrumentation. As protein con-formational motions are considerably slower, photoexcitation changes the pK a and initiates proton transfer between optimally aligned groups. Sugar-transfer reactions often occur with inversion of chemistry at the anomeric carbon, a stereochemical signature for an S N 2 nucleophilic displacement. In other cases they occur with reten-tion of configuration, indicating a covalent intermediate in a double-displacement mechanism. In the past decade, kinetic isotope effect measurements on several sugar transferases have revealed that, regardless of the inversion or retention of stereo-chemistry at the reaction center, the transition states are dis-tinctly dissociative, with S N 1 character. The original findings were made with N-ribosyltransferases, where a combination of transition-state analysis and structural studies revealed migration of the anomeric carbon in the reaction coordinate. The mechanism was called \" nucleophilic displacement by electrophile migration \" , and a similar mechanism was later shown to characterize the lysozyme reaction. Now, Davies and co-workers 3 demonstrate a similar chemical strategy for a third class of enzymes, a stereo-chemistry-retaining O-GlcNAc hydrolase. A bicyclic oxazoline intermediate is observed crystallographically using a glucopyr-anosyl fluoride to chemically stabilize the intermediate. These novel results define the geometric reaction coordinate for a reaction with a stabilized oxazoline intermediate. With multiple classes of sugar transferases now shown to catalyze their reactions by electrophile migration, a common mechanistic theme is emerging. Vitamin synthesis always involves chemistry that is unique from the synthetic pathways of the host. Riboflavin synthesis involves a remarkable transformation where two molecules of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine fuse to form an intermediate that fragments to riboflavin and a substituted pyrimidinedione. Amazingly, this reaction, though enzyme-catalyzed in cells, occurs spontaneously at elevated temperatures under anoxic aqueous conditions. Previous mechanisms proposed involvement of a nucleophilic amino acid side chain, but the solution chemistry and the lack of a crystallographically convenient nucleophile led to growing doubt about such a mechanism. Now, Fischer, Bacher, and colleagues 4 have proposed a new mechanism for the",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new method based on measurements of the structural similarity for the clustering of chemical databases. The proposed method allows the dynamic adjustment of the size and number of cells or clusters in which the database is classified. Classification is carried out using measurements of structural similarity obtained from the matching of molecular graphs. The classification process is open to the use of different similarity indexes and different measurements of matching. This process consists of the projection of the obtained measures of similarity among the elements of the database in a new space of similarity. The possibility of the dynamic readjustment of the dimension and characteristic of the projection space to adapt to the most favorable conditions of the problem under study and the simplicity and computational efficiency make the proposed method appropriate for its use with medium and large databases. The clustering method increases the performance of the screening processes in chemical databases, facilitating the recovery of chemical compounds that share all or subsets of common substructures to a given pattern.

For this purpose, we have developed a method that uses the SMILES representation of the molecules to perform the corresponding pairwise alignment.

From the resulting alignment, the relationship between two molecules is computed as so-called bioisosteric similarity. This measure was used to perform virtual screening in several publicly available substance databases. We observed that databases containing drug-like compounds throughout showed higher bioisosteric similarities to the query compound than our reference set of confirmed nondrugs. Likewise, most actual drugs within a class show a higher bioisosteric similarity than the large background of other substances. The compounds obtained as highest ranking hits from the lead-like subset of the ZINC library showed distinct differences in comparison with corresponding results from a fingerprint-based similarity search, as well as the FTrees method. In particular the kind of chemical replacements as well as the conservation of substructures strongly reflect the underlying bioisosteric exchanges. Moreover, the bioisosteric similarity was used to assess the chemical diversity of the utilized drug classes and to compute the \"average\" molecule within the respective class.",

        "abstract": "Similarity is a fundamental concept within Cognitive Science. It is routinely invoked in the explanation of cognitive processes as diverse as memory retrieval, categorization, visual search, problem solving, learning, language processing, reasoning, and social behavior. At the same time, it is of fundamental practical concern to computer scientists concerned with clustering and machine learning, and it figures in many philosophical contexts. Crucially, \u2018similar\u2019 is not a relationship that simply reflects objective properties of the objects under consideration but rather is dependent on how those objects are represented by an observer. This ties theories of similarity closely to theories of representation.",

        "abstract": "Since the beginning, Clusterin (CLU) was revealed not as simple to study, and certainly not a single protein. The growing research interest on CLU soon produced many contributions by independent laboratories working in different systems. Thus, many different names or acronyms have been given to CLU in the early years after its discovery. Now, a general consensus recommend the name Clusterin and the abbreviation CLU. CLU was first described as a glycoprotein found nearly ubiquitous in tissues and body fluids. This early knowledge is mostly related to the secretory form of CLU (sCLU), which is exported from the cell and released in secretions acting as an extracellular chaperone. But CLU can also enter the nucleus. The detection of nCLU (nuclear CLU), which is usually associated to cell death, is now emerging as a very important event making this issue even more complex. This may explain why CLU is still often described as an \"enigmatic\" protein. The use of the term \"enigmatic\" is a clear indication that too many aspects related to the biological function(s) of CLU and its possible role in pathogenesis have been obscure, or very difficult to interpret, for long time. Contradictory findings on CLU are also present in the literature, sometimes due to technical biases or alternative interpretation of the same result. The aim of the book is ambitious: through a careful review of old data, in the light of novel information and up to date methods and hypotheses, we will try to simplify the picture for the reader and bring more light in a field still perceived to be too obscure to fully appreciate its importance and potential implementation in the clinical setting. This introduction will provide a brief general history and a critical view of the discovery of CLU with the aim to underline what is new in the field and what is now obsolete. In the rest of the book, conclusions and \"take home messages\" will also be provided to the reader particularly focusing on possible clinical implementations and how all this knowledge will very likely bring novelty in the fight against cancer.",

As a similarity-based methodology, fragment profiling does not depend on the use of predefined descriptors of molecular structure and properties and the design of chemical space representations. To adapt the generation and comparison of random fragment populations for large-scale compound screening, we compare different fragmentation schemes, introduce the concept of compound class-specific fragment frequencies, and develop a novel entropic similarity metric for compound ranking. The approach has been extensively tested on 15 different compound activity classes with varying degrees of intraclass structural diversity and produced promising results in these calculations, comparable to similarity searching using fingerprints. A key feature of fragment profile searching is that the calculation of compound class-specific proportional Shannon entropy of random fragment distributions enables the identification of database molecules that share a significant number of signature substructures with known active compounds.",

        "abstract": "Recent debates concerning conflicting hypotheses of higher-level phylogeny such as the sister-group relationships of tetrapods, turtles, birds and snakes, serve as examples in the analysis of the nature of morphological evidence as it is currently used in phylogeny reconstruction. We note a recent shift of emphasis towards ever-larger data matrices, which may come at the cost of detailed character analysis and argumentation. Because the assessment of morphological characters necessarily entails a conceptual element of abstraction, there is also a threat that preconceived notions of phylogeny influence character analysis. Because the test of congruence does not address character analysis in itself, we argue that character hypotheses, i.e. primary conjectures of homology, need to be testable, and potentially refutable, in their own right. We demonstrate the use of classical criteria of homology (topological relations and/or connectivity, in conjunction with the subsidiary criteria of special similarity and intermediate forms) in the test, and refutation, of morphological characters. Rejection of the classical criteria of homology in the test of morphological character hypotheses requires the formulation of alternative methods of test and potential falsification of morphological characters that have so far not been proposed.",

Lgr5 (leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled re- ceptor 5) has been identified as a marker for adult stem cells in intestine, stomach, and hair follicle; Lgr5-express- ing cells give rise to all types of cells in these tissues. Taste epithelium also regenerates constantly, yet the identity of adult taste stem cells remains elusive. In this study, we found that Lgr5 is strongly expressed in cells at the bot- tom of trench areas at the base of circumvallate (CV) and foliate taste papillae and weakly expressed in the basal area of taste buds and that Lgr5-expressing cells in poste- rior tongue are a subset of K14-positive epithelial cells. Lineage-tracing experiments using an inducible Cre knockin allele in combination with Rosa26-LacZ and Rosa26-tdTomato reporter strains showed that Lgr5- expressing cells gave rise to taste cells, perigemmal cells, along with self-renewing cells at the bottom of trench areas at the base of CV and foliate papillae. Moreover, using subtype-specific taste markers, we found that Lgr5- expressing cell progeny include all three major types of adult taste cells. Our results indicate that Lgr5 may mark adult taste stem or progenitor cells in the posterior por- tion of the tongue. STEM",

In this study, we use two datasets of environmental parameters (i.e. in vitro oestrogenicity and sorption distribution coefficient Kd ) to demonstrate that maximizing representativeness alone cannot deliver optimal improvement in prediction accuracy if many of the chemicals that have already been measured are themselves highly representative.

        "abstract": "There are few measures that can be used to distinguish among mixtures of disinfection by-products (DBPs) produced in the chlorination or chloramination of drinking water. Objective measures of similarities among DBP mixtures would greatly simplify judgments about the risk that may be associated with exposure to DBPs in a given water supply. Major by-products of chlorination/chloramination include the trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), which are routinely measured for compliance to regulations. A key question is whether measurement of similar amounts of these DBPs is indicative of the myriad other DBPs that are known to be produced. This article utilized data from a survey of 35 utilities in the United States that included several additional parameters, including members of the haloacetonitrile, trihaloacetaldehyde, and halopropanone classes. Based upon the distribution of bromine in the THM class, the concentrations of unmeasured brominated and bromochlorinated compounds could be determined. This allowed determination of whether measures of the THM and/or HAA classes reflected the amounts of these less abundant classes. Variations in relative yields among DBP classes were observed with water source type and with whether chlorine or chloramine was used as the disinfectant. However, most of the variability was attributable to geographic location. The relative abundance of brominated by-products also varied among water sources. Recent documentation that potent by-products, such as nitrosamines, are selectively produced in particular water systems and preferentially with chloramination indicates that more measures of individual DBP are needed to evaluate similarity among DBPs mixtures.",

In CSNs, nodes represent compounds and edges pairwise similarity relationships. In addition, nodes are annotated with compound property information such as biological activity. CSNs have been applied to view biologically relevant chemical space in comparison to random chemical space samples and found to display well-resolved topologies at low edge density levels. The way in which molecular similarity relationships are assessed is an important determinant of CSN topology. Previous CSN versions were based on numerical similarity functions or the assessment of substructure-based similarity. Herein, we report a new CSN design that is based upon combined numerical and substructure similarity evaluation. This has been facilitated by calculating numerical similarity values on the basis of maximum common substructures (MCSs) of compounds, leading to the introduction of MCS-based CSNs (MCS-CSNs). This CSN design combines advantages of continuous numerical similarity functions with a robust and chemically intuitive substructure-based assessment. Compared to earlier version of CSNs, MCS-CSNs are characterized by a further improved organization of local compound communities as exemplified by the delineation of drug-like subspaces in regions of biologically relevant chemical space.",

        "abstract": "A new method, based on generalized Fourier analysis, is described that utilizes the concept of \"molecular basis sets\" to represent chemical space within an abstract vector space. The basis vectors in this space are abstract molecular vectors. Inner products among the basis vectors are determined using an ansatz that associates molecular similarities between pairs of molecules with their corresponding inner products. Moreover, the fact that similarities between pairs of molecules are, in essentially all cases, nonzero implies that the abstract molecular basis vectors are nonorthogonal, but since the similarity of a molecule with itself is unity, the molecular vectors are normalized to unity. A symmetric orthogonalization procedure, which optimally preserves the character of the original set of molecular basis vectors, is used to construct appropriate orthonormal basis sets. Molecules can then be represented, in general, by sets of orthonormal \"molecule-like\" basis vectors within a proper Euclidean vector space. However, the dimension of the space can become quite large. Thus, the work presented here assesses the effect of basis set size on a number of properties including the average squared error and average norm of molecular vectors represented in the space-the results clearly show the expected reduction in average squared error and increase in average norm as the basis set size is increased. Several distance-based statistics are also considered. These include the distribution of distances and their differences with respect to basis sets of differing size and several comparative distance measures such as Spearman rank correlation and Kruscal stress. All of the measures show that, even though the dimension can be high, the chemical spaces they represent, nonetheless, behave in a well-controlled and reasonable manner. Other abstract vector spaces analogous to that described here can also be constructed providing that the appropriate inner products can be directly evaluated as is the case in this work, a problem that is well-known in kernel-based machine learning.",

PCM has previously been validated in prospective, experimental work in the medicinal chemistry area, and it draws on the growing amount of bioactivity information available in the public domain.

        "abstract": "Methods that can screen large databases to retrieve a structurally diverse set of compounds with desirable bioactivity properties are critical in the drug discovery and development process. This paper presents a set of such methods that are designed to find compounds that are structurally different to a certain query compound while retaining its bioactivity properties (scaffold hops). These methods utilize various indirect ways of measuring the similarity between the query and a compound that take into account additional information beyond their structure-based similarities. The set of techniques that are presented capture these indirect similarities using approaches based on analyzing the similarity network formed by the query and the database compounds. Experimental evaluation shows that most of these methods substantially outperform previously developed approaches both in terms of their ability to identify structurally diverse active compounds as well as active compounds in general.",

The methods which employ adjustable parameters were tested to determine the stability of each parameter for datasets of varying size and composition. Our experiments suggest that both graph- and fingerprint-based similarity measures can be used effectively for generating chemical clusterings; it is also suggested that the CAST and Yin-Chen methods, suggested recently for the clustering of gene expression patterns, may also prove effective for the clustering of 2D chemical structures.",

        "abstract": "Determination of molecular similarity plays an important role in analyzing large compound databases in chemical and pharmaceutical research. When molecules are described by binary vectors with bits corresponding to the presence or absence of structural features, the Tanimoto association coefficient is the most commonly used measure of similarity or chemical distance between two compounds. However, when used to select compounds for an optimal spread design, the Tanimoto coefficient produces an intrinsic bias toward smaller compounds. We have developed a new association coefficient that overcomes this bias. This article gives details of the new coefficient and contrasts the two coefficients for selecting diverse sets of compounds from a large collection. When the Tanimoto coefficient is modifed as suggested to select a diverse set in the National Cancer Institute and Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances databases, the average number of features among the selected compounds increases by more than 50%.",

        "abstract": "A molecular similarity searching technique based on atom environments, information-gain-based feature selection, and the naive Bayesian classifier has been applied to a series of diverse datasets and its performance compared to those of alternative searching methods. Atom environments are count vectors of heavy atoms present at a topological distance from each heavy atom of a molecular structure. In this application, using a recently published dataset of more than 100000 molecules from the MDL Drug Data Report database, the atom environment approach appears to outperform fusion of ranking scores as well as binary kernel discrimination, which are both used in combination with Unity fingerprints. Overall retrieval rates among the top 5% of the sorted library are nearly 10% better (more than 14% better in relative numbers) than those of the second best method, Unity fingerprints and binary kernel discrimination. In 10 out of 11 sets of active compounds the combination of atom environments and the naive Bayesian classifier appears to be the superior method, while in the remaining dataset, data fusion and binary kernel discrimination in combination with Unity fingerprints is the method of choice. Binary kernel discrimination in combination with Unity fingerprints generally comes second in performance overall. The difference in performance can largely be attributed to the different molecular descriptors used. Atom environments outperform Unity fingerprints by a large margin if the combination of these descriptors with the Tanimoto coefficient is compared. The naive Bayesian classifier in combination with information-gain-based feature selection and selection of a sensible number of features performs about as well as binary kernel discrimination in experiments where these classification methods are compared. When used on a monoaminooxidase dataset, atom environments and the naive Bayesian classifier perform as well as binary kernel discrimination in the case of a 50/50 split of training and test compounds. In the case of sparse training data, binary kernel discrimination is found to be superior on this particular dataset. On a third dataset, the atom environment descriptor shows higher retrieval rates than other 2D fingerprints tested here when used in combination with the Tanimoto similarity coefficient. Feature selection is shown to be a crucial step in determining the performance of the algorithm. The representation of molecules by atom environments is found to be more effective than Unity fingerprints for the type of biological receptor similarity calculations examined here. Combining information prior to scoring and including information about inactive compounds, as in the Bayesian classifier and binary kernel discrimination, is found to be superior to posterior data fusion (in the datasets tested here).",

Although the SIBAR-approach per se does not allow to unambiguously trace back the chemical structure of a compound, similarity searching in a 1.5 million compound database spiked with compounds structurally analogous to the query structure lead to the retrieval of compounds structurally and pharmacologically highly analogous to the \"hidden\" query structure in all three examples investigated. Comparison to results obtained with the original descriptors used to calculate the SIBAR-values showed, that SIBAR indeed adds some fuzziness to the data matrix.",

It contains among others also entries for over 15,000 chemicals including metabolites, drugs, agrochemicals and industrial chemicals. To provide an easy access to this wealth of information we decided to develop a substructure and similarity search tool for chemical structures referenced in Wikipedia.RESULTS:We extracted chemical structures from entries in Wikipedia and implemented a web system allowing structure and similarity searching on these data. The whole search as well as visualization system is written in JavaScript and therefore can run locally within a web page and does not require a central server. The Wikipedia Chemical Structure Explorer is accessible on-line at http://www.cheminfo.org/wikipedia webcite and is available also as an open source project from GitHub for local installation.CONCLUSIONS:The web-based Wikipedia Chemical Structure Explorer provides a useful resource for research as well as for chemical education enabling both researchers and students easy and user friendly chemistry searching and identification of relevant information in Wikipedia. The tool can also help to improve quality of chemical entries in Wikipedia by providing potential contributors regularly updated list of entries with problematic structures. And last but not least this search system is a nice example of how the modern web technology can be applied in the field of cheminformatics.",

        "abstract": "Chemical space networks (CSNs) have recently been introduced as a conceptual alternative to coordinate-based representations of chemical space. CSNs were initially designed as threshold networks using the Tanimoto coefficient as a continuous similarity measure. The analysis of CSNs generated from sets of bioactive compounds revealed that many statistical properties were strongly dependent on their edge density. While it was difficult to compare CSNs at pre-defined similarity threshold values, CSNs with constant edge density were directly comparable. In the current study, alternative CSN representations were constructed by applying the matched molecular pair (MMP) formalism as a substructure-based similarity criterion. For more than 150 compound activity classes, MMP-based CSNs (MMP-CSNs) were compared to corresponding threshold CSNs (THR-CSNs) at a constant edge density by applying different parameters from network science, measures of community structure distributions, and indicators of structure-activity relationship (SAR) information content. MMP-CSNs were found to be an attractive alternative to THR-CSNs, yielding low edge densities and well-resolved topologies. MMP-CSNs and corresponding THR-CSNs often had similar topology and closely corresponding community structures, although there was only limited overlap in similarity relationships. The homophily principle from network science was shown to affect MMP-CSNs and THR-CSNs in different ways, despite the presence of conserved topological features. Moreover, activity cliff distributions in alternative CSN designs markedly differed, which has important implications for SAR analysis. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",

Here, we present the development of a new fingerprint for chemical reactions and validate its usefulness in building machine-learning models and in similarity assessment.

We validated the fingerprints on a large data set of reactions text-mined from granted United States patents from the last 40 years that have been classified using a substructure-based expert system. We applied machine learning to build a 50-class predictive model for reaction-type classification that correctly predicts 97% of the reactions in an external test set. Impressive accuracies were also observed when applying the classifier to reactions from an in-house electronic laboratory notebook. The performance of the novel fingerprint for assessing reaction similarity was evaluated by a cluster analysis that recovered 48 out of 50 of the reaction classes with a median F-score of 0.63 for the clusters. The data sets used for training and primary validation as well as all python scripts required to reproduce the analysis are provided in the Supporting Information.",

Guard workers compare the chemical cues of an incoming individual with their internal template to determine whether the entrant belongs to their colony. In contrast to honeybees, Apis mellifera, stingless bees have singly mated queens and, therefore, are expected to have a higher chemical homogeneity in their colonies. We tested whether aggressive behaviour of Frieseomelitta varia guards towards nestmate and non-nestmate foragers reflects chemical similarities and dissimilarities, respectively, of cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. We also introduced individuals of Lestrimelitta limao, an obligatory robber species, to test the ability of guards to react effectively to intruders from other taxa. We verified that foraging nestmates were almost invariably accepted, while heterospecific and conspecific non-nestmates were rejected at relatively high rates. However, non-nestmate individuals with higher chemical profile similarity were likely to be accepted by guards. We conclude that guards compare the chemical cuticular blend of incoming individuals and make acceptance decisions according to the similarity of the compounds between the colonies. \u00a9 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",

In this paper, the Cluster-based Similarity Partitioning Algorithm (CSPA) was examined for improving the quality of chemical structures clustering. The effectiveness of clustering was evaluated based on the ability to separate active from inactive molecules in each cluster and the results were compared with the Ward's clustering method. The chemical dataset MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) database was used for experiments. The results, obtained by combining multiple clusterings, showed that the consensus clustering method can improve the robustness, novelty and stability of chemical structures clustering.",

        "abstract": "With the amount of chemical data being produced and reported in the literature growing at a fast pace, it is increasingly important to efficiently retrieve this information. To tackle this issue text mining tools have been applied, but despite their good performance they still provide many errors that we believe can be filtered by using semantic similarity. Thus, this paper proposes a novel method that receives the results of chemical entity identification systems, such as Whatizit, and exploits the semantic relationships in ChEBI to measure the similarity between the entities found in the text. The method assigns a single validation score to each entity based on its similarities with the other entities also identified in the text. Then, by using a given threshold, the method selects a set of validated entities and a set of outlier entities. We evaluated our method using the results of two state-of-the-art chemical entity identification tools, three semantic similarity measures and two text window sizes. The method was able to increase precision without filtering a significant number of correctly identified entities. This means that the method can effectively discriminate the correctly identified chemical entities, while discarding a significant number of identification errors. For example, selecting a validation set with 75% of all identified entities, we were able to increase the precision by 28% for one of the chemical entity identification tools (Whatizit), maintaining in that subset 97% the correctly identified entities. Our method can be directly used as an add-on by any state-of-the-art entity identification tool that provides mappings to a database, in order to improve their results.

        "abstract": "Three laws of information theory have been proposed. Labeling by introducing nonsymmetry and formatting by introducing symmetry are defined. The function L (L=lnw, w is the number of microstates, or the sum of entropy and information, L=S+I) of the universe is a constant (the first law of information theory). The entropy S of the universe tends toward a maximum (the second law law of information theory). For a perfect symmetric static structure, the information is zero and the static entropy is the maximum (the third law law of information theory). Based on the Gibbs inequality and the second law of the revised information theory we have proved the similarity principle (a continuous higher similarity-higher entropy relation after the rejection of the Gibbs paradox) and proved the Curie-Rosen symmetry principle (a higher symmetry-higher stability relation) as a special case of the similarity principle. Some examples in chemical physics have been given. Spontaneous processes of all kinds of molecular interaction, phase separation and phase transition, including symmetry breaking and the densest molecular packing and crystallization, are all driven by information minimization or symmetry maximization. The evolution of the universe in general and evolution of life in particular can be quantitatively considered as a series of symmetry breaking processes. The two empirical rules - similarity rule and complementarity rule - have been given a theoretical foundation. All kinds of periodicity in space and time are symmetries and contribute to the stability. Symmetry is beautiful because it renders stability. However, symmetry is in principle ugly because it is associated with information loss.",

We show that for a significant fraction of the predicted similarities, SimShiftDB outperforms the other two methods.

The direct effects of chemicals on ATPase and GTPase function are pertinent to the early stages of carcinogenesis. Interference with triphosphate-diphosphate exchange mechanisms may result from the interaction of carcinogens with the substrate triphosphate chain. To investigate this hypothesis, a computational chemistry programme is used in this study to investigate molecular similarity in ATPase inhibitors, carcinogens and tumour promoters, in relation to the nucleoside triphosphate chain. The results show that atoms in the investigated molecular structures superimpose on sets of oxygen atoms in the triphosphate chain with interatomic distances < 0.3A. Relative molecular similarity to the substrate triphosphate chain is discussed in terms of the established inhibitory properties of carcinogens/tumour promoters on ATPase function, the carcinogen/ tumour promoting properties of ATPase inhibitors and the prediction of carcinogenic activity from chemical structure.",

However, foundations and intrinsic limitations of similarity searching are often not well understood, although a number of similarity methods are rather simplistic. Regardless of methodological details, all similarity search approaches depend on how molecular similarity is evaluated and quantified. In its essence, molecular similarity is a subjective concept and much dependent on how we represent and view molecular structures. Moreover, trying to understand the relationship between molecular similarity, however assessed, and structure-dependent properties including, first and foremost, biological activity continues to be a challenging problem. Consequently, although similarity searching usually provides a quantitative readout and a ranking of compounds relative to chosen reference molecules, predicting structure\u2013activity relationships on the basis of calculated similarity values often involves subjective criteria and chemical intuition. Thus, similarity searching is still far from being a routine application in database mining. In this review, we first discuss important principles underlying similarity searching, describe its tasks, and introduce major categories of search methods. Then, we focus on molecular fingerprints, the design and application of which can be regarded as a paradigm for the similarity search field.",

        "abstract": "A wide variety of computational algorithms have been developed that strive to capture the chemical similarity between two compounds for use in virtual screening and lead discovery. One limitation of such approaches is that, while a returned similarity value reflects the perceived degree of relatedness between any two compounds, there is no direct correlation between this value and the expectation or confidence that any two molecules will in fact be equally active. A lack of a common framework for interpretation of similarity measures also confounds the reliable fusion of information from different algorithms. Here, we present a probabilistic framework for interpreting similarity measures that directly correlates the similarity value to a quantitative expectation that two molecules will in fact be equipotent. The approach is based on extensive benchmarking of 10 different similarity methods (MACCS keys, Daylight fingerprints, maximum common subgraphs, rapid overlay of chemical structures (ROCS) shape similarity, and six connectivity-based fingerprints) against a database of more than 150,000 compounds with activity data against 23 protein targets. Given this unified and probabilistic framework for interpreting chemical similarity, principles derived from decision theory can then be applied to combine the evidence from different similarity measures in such a way that both capitalizes on the strengths of the individual approaches and maintains a quantitative estimate of the likelihood that any two molecules will exhibit similar biological activity.",

Four experiments used different procedures to address 3 main processes: (1) the categorization of musical features, (2) the segmentation of the musical discourse, and (3) the elaboration of a mental schema of the piece. Two short tonal pieces from the classical piano repertoire were used as experimental material. Exps 1 and 2 assessed S's capacity to classify segments from the same musical piece into the appropriate category and to evaluate the segments' degree of similarity. Exp 3 investigated the segmentation process, which underlies the organization of musical events into groups. Exp 4 explored S's ability to reconstruct a piece of music after hearing it. In addition, the effects of different musical features are explored. Results show that Ss performances differed slightly from the nonmusicians. Formal training seems to influence, to a variable degree, all of the tasks of classification, evaluation of similarity, segmentation, and reconstruction of a piece. Familiarization had a more prominent role in child musicians' memory; child musicians had better skills at grasping musical features. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2004 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "abstract": "This paper reviews the use of measures of intermolecular similarity for processing databases of chemical structures, which play an important role in the discovery of new drugs by the pharmaceutical industry. The similarity measures considered here are based on the use of a fingerprint representation of molecular structure, where a fingerprint is a vector encoding the presence of fragment substructures in a molecule and where the similarity between pairs of such fingerprints is computed using an association coefficient such as the Tanimoto coefficient. The Similar Property Principle provides the basic rationale for the use of similarity methods in three important chemoinformatics applications\u2014similarity searching, database clustering, and molecular diversity analysis. Similarity searching enables the identification of those molecules in a database that are most similar to a user-defined, biologically active query molecule, with data fusion providing an effective way of combining the results of multiple similarity searches. Cluster analysis, typically using the Jarvis\u2013Patrick, Ward, or divisive k-means clustering methods, enables the cost-effective selection of molecules for biological testing, for property prediction and for investigating database overlap. Molecular diversity analysis, typically using cluster-based, dissimilarity-based, or optimization-based approaches, enables the identification of structurally diverse sets of molecules, so as to ensure that the full chemical space spanned by a database is tested in the search for novel bioactive molecules. \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

        "abstract": "In this work, we calculated the pair wise chemical similarity for a subset of small molecules screened against the NCI60 cancer cell line panel. Four different compound similarity calculation methods were used: Brutus, GRIND, Daylight and UNITY. The chemical similarity scores of each method were related to the biological similarity data set. The same was done also for combinations of methods. In the end, we had an estimate of biological similarity for a given chemical similarity score or combinations thereof. The data from above was used to identify chemical similarity ranges where combining two or more methods (data fusion) led to synergy. The results were also applied in ligand-based virtual screening using the DUD data set. In respect to their ability to enrich biologically similar compound pairs, the ranking of the four methods in descending performance is UNITY, Daylight, Brutus and GRIND. Combining methods resulted always in positive synergy within a restricted range of chemical similarity scores. We observed no negative synergy. We also noted that combining three or four methods had only limited added advantage compared to combining just two. In the virtual screening, using the estimated biological similarity for ranking compounds produced more consistent results than using the methods in isolation.",

The review describes the historical development of similarity searching since it was first described in the mid-1980s, reviews the many different coefficients, representations, and weightings that can be combined to form a similarity measure, describes quantitative measures of the effectiveness of similarity searching, and concludes by looking at current developments based on the use of data fusion and machine learning techniques.",

This yields a combined task-independent estimate of perceived difference between odor pairs. Comparing these perceived differences to published measures of physicochemical difference reveals a weak correlation. A notable exception are 3-octanol and benzaldehyde, which are distinct in published accounts of chemical similarity and in terms of their published sensory representation but nevertheless are consistently regarded as the most similar of the 10 odor pairs employed. It thus appears as if at least some aspects of olfactory perception are \"computed\" in postreceptor circuits on the basis of sensory signals rather than being immediately given by them.",

The sensor uses surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at the interface of a sample solution and a thin (10 - 70 nm) gold film deposited on half of the exposed core of the optical fiber. The sensor with a film thickness of 45 nm can detect a small change of 5.6 x 10(-5) refractive index (RI) units in the refractivity. The response time is less than 0.5 min and the relative standard deviation for measurements is less than or equal to 1%. A straight line with a correlation coefficient of 0.9995 was obtained below 10%, v/v in the calibration curve for methanol solutions of benzyl alcohol. The minimum of the response curve due to the maximum excitation of SPR in the refractivity range from 1.33 to 1.44 RI units shifts to a lower refractivity as the film becomes thicker.

        "abstract": "A novel compound classification algorithm is described that operates in binary molecular descriptor spaces and groups active compounds together in a computationally highly efficient manner. The method involves the transformation of continuous descriptor value ranges into a binary format, subsequent definition of simplified descriptor spaces, identification of consensus positions of specific compound sets in these spaces, and iterative adjustments of the dimensionality of the descriptor spaces in order to discriminate compounds sharing similar activity from others. We term this approach Dynamic Mapping of Consensus positions (DMC) because the definition of reference spaces is tuned toward specific compound classes and their dimensionality is increased as the analysis proceeds. When applied to virtual screening, sets of bait compounds are added to a large screening database to identify hidden active molecules. In these calculations, molecules that map to consensus positions after elimination of most of the database compounds are considered hit candidates. In a benchmark study on five biological activity classes, hits for randomly assembled sets of bait molecules were correctly identified in 95% of virtual screening calculations in a source database containing more than 1.3 million molecules, thus providing a measure of the sensitivity of the DMC technique.",

In this work the information of NIR-CI at the pixel level was compared through calculation of the similarity between distribution maps of concentration obtained by different multivariate calibration approaches. The comparison was performed by using four different multivariate methods (MCR, MLR, CLS and PLS) in analysis of carbamazepine pharmaceutical formulations. For global determination, all models developed showed RMSEP below 1.9% (w/w) for active principal ingredient (API) and better than 4.6% (w/w) for excipients. Also, the distribution maps obtained by PLS, CLS and MCR showed great similarity for all compounds of the formulation as well with concentrations in the tablets. However, comparing the distribution maps obtained by MLR with those from the other chemometric tools, a lower similarity was observed. Thus, this fitted model does not ensure, by itself, that the images obtained are reliable or accurate. The paper also compares the distribution maps of concentrations obtained from all constituents present in the pharmaceutical formulation with their respective micrographs. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

The goal of this research was to evaluate the utility of a protocol using in vitro bioassays and chemical analysis as a basis for assessing mixture similarity. Two wood preserving wastes (WPWs) containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and pentachlorophenol were extracted and fractionated to generate potentially similar mixtures. Chemical analysis was conducted using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Genotoxicity was evaluated using the Salmonella/microsome and Escherichia coli prophage induction assays. The crude extract of one WPW was also tested in the chick embryotoxicity screening test (CHEST) assay. The CHEST assay provided the most sensitive measurement of toxicity. Overall, the biological potency of the samples was not well correlated with predicted potency based on chemical analysis. Although several mixtures appeared similar based on chemical analysis, the magnitude of the response in bioassays was often dissimilar. Fractionation was required to detect the genotoxicity of mixture components in vitro. The results confirm the need for an integrated protocol, combining chemical analysis, fractionation, and biological testing to characterize the risk associated with complex mixtures.",

The method makes estimates with some similarities to those claimed by species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) but is based on species presence/absence field data and requires assumptions that are more likely to be met. The method uses Jaccard's index (JI), the proportion of species in common to two samples. At a similar level of contamination, the occurrence of species is usually highly variable, and thus JI values between individual pairs of samples can be low. However, by pooling samples with a similar contamination level, an increasingly complete set of species present at this level of contamination is gained. Our method involves calculating JI between randomly selected groups of samples (pooled sample sets) with similar and different levels of contamination. It then relates changes in JI to the difference in contamination and produces estimates of the proportional change in species between preselected categories of contamination. The application of the method is illustrated by using data on riverine freshwater macroinvertebrates exposed to salinity in southeastern Australia; pesticide runoff potential in the Aller River Catchment, Germany; and metal pollution (principle Cu) in the Clark Fork River Catchment, Montana, USA.",

In an acquisition phase, 600 18-25 yr old musicians and nonmusicians listened to the first part of a piece. They were then presented with a set of items of 1 or 2 bars, divided into 3 parts: heard items, unheard items, and modified items. The underlying imprint formation hypothesis was that unheard items would be erroneously felt to have already been perceived before. The material was presented in 3 different familiarization conditions: listening to the first part of the piece either 10, 6, or 2 times during the acquisition phase. In the recognition phase, Ss had to indicate whether the item had previously been heard and to give a degree of confidence in their response. Musicians performed better than nonmusicians performed, and this effect of training was reinforced by the number of previous listenings to the piece. In addition, more correct responses were recorded for items of 2 bars than for items of 1 bar. Finally pitch and rhythm modifications were perceived much better than were pitch changes alone. A clear imprint effect was observed in the different stages of the approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2004 APA, all rights reserved)",

Here, we report on the development of a hazard classification and visualization method that draws upon both chemical structural similarity and comparisons of biological responses to chemicals measured in multiple short-term assays (\"biological\" similarity). The Chemical-Biological Read-Across (CBRA) approach infers each compound's toxicity from both chemical and biological analogues whose similarities are determined by the Tanimoto coefficient. Classification accuracy of CBRA was compared to that of classical RA and other methods using chemical descriptors alone or in combination with biological data. Different types of adverse effects (hepatotoxicity, hepatocarcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and acute lethality) were classified using several biological data types (gene expression profiling and cytotoxicity screening). CBRA-based hazard classification exhibited consistently high external classification accuracy and applicability to diverse chemicals. Transparency of the CBRA approach is aided by the use of radial plots that show the relative contribution of analogous chemical and biological neighbors. Identification of both chemical and biological features that give rise to the high accuracy of CBRA-based toxicity prediction facilitates mechanistic interpretation of the models.",

In this paper, the different chemical components of Saussurea involucrata were characterized and identified over a wide dynamic range by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution hybrid mass spectrometry (HPLC/HRMS/MS(n)) and the mass spectral trees similarity filter (MTSF) technique.\\n\\nMETHODS: The aerial parts of Saussurea involucrata were extracted with 75% ethanol. The partial extract was separated on a chromatography column to concentrate the low-concentration compounds. Mass data were acquired using full-scan mass analysis (resolving power 50,000) with data-dependent incorporation of dynamic exclusion analysis. The identified compounds were used as templates to construct a database of mass spectral trees. Data for the unknown compounds were matched with those templates and matching candidate structures were obtained.\\n\\nRESULTS: The detected compounds were characterized based on matching to candidate structures by the MTSF technique and were further identified by their accurate mass weight, multiple-stage analysis and fragmentation patterns and through comparison with literature data. A total of 38 compounds were identified including 19 flavones, 11 phenylpropanoids and 8 sphingolipids. Among them, 7 flavonoids, 8 phenylpropanoids and 8 sphingolipids were identified for the first time in Saussurea involucrata.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: HPLC/HRMS/MS(n) combined with MTSF was successfully used to discover and identify the chemical compounds in Saussurea involucrata. The results indicated that this combined technique was extremely useful for the rapid detection and identification of the chemical components in TCMs.",

A new formula (Ef=log k (RCl/EtOH/25 degrees C) -1.87), where RCl/EtOH refers to ethanolysis of chlorides, reproduces published values of Ef satisfactorily, avoids multi-parameter optimisations and provides additional values of Ef. From the formula for Ef, it is shown that the term (sfxEf) is compatible with the Hammett-Brown (rho+sigma+) equation for substituent effects. However, the previously published values of N(f) do not accurately account for solvent and leaving group effects (e.g. nucleofuge Cl or X), even for benzhydryl solvolyses; alternatively, if the more exact, two-parameter term, (sfxNf) is used, calculated effects are less accurate. A new formula (Nf=6.14 + log k(BX/any solvent/25 degrees C)), where BX refers to solvolysis of the parent benzhydryl as electrofuge, defines improved Nf values for benzhydryl substrates. The new formulae for Ef and Nf are consistent with an assumption that sf=1.00(,) and so improved correlations for benzhydryl substrates can be obtained from the additive formula: log k(RX/any solvent/25 degrees C)=(Ef + Nf).

Strain-gauge signals were digitalized by a data acquisition system and were displayed in a computer by corresponding software at a sample rate of 20 Hz. The strain data were used to compare post-gel strains, polymerization velocity, and total volumetric change of both materials. Evaluation of microleakage and scanning electron microscopy was also undertaken to elucidate effects of post-gel strains at the tooth-restorative interface. Microstrains of Filtek Z250 were lower than those of Filtek P60 and the differences between post-gel strains at several different time intervals were significant (P < 0.009). There was a correlation between polymerization velocity and total volumetric change. Microleakage evaluation and scanning electron microscopy did not reveal any signs of debonding at the interface for both materials. We conclude that the similarity in chemical composition of light-polymerized resin composites is not a determinant for post-gel strains.

        "abstract": "In chemical-looping combustion, a gaseous fuel is burnt with inherent separation of the greenhouse gas CO2. Oxygen is transferred from the combustion air to the fuel by an oxygen carrier, which is usually a metal oxide, and therefore direct contact between the fuel and the combustion air is avoided. Thus, the products of combustion, i.e., CO2 and H2O, are not mixed with the rest of the flue gases and after condensation almost pure CO2 is obtained, without any energy lost for the separation. A thermal analysis of the process using a large number of possible oxygen carriers was performed by simulating reactions using the HSC Chemistry 5.0 software. Three fuels were used in the investigation, CH4, CO and H2. Based on the ability of the oxygen carriers to convert the fuel to the combustion products CO2 and H2O, stability in air and the melting temperatures of the solid material some metal oxides based on Ni, Cu, Fe, Mn, Co, W and sulphates of Ba and Sr showed good ther-modynamic properties and could be feasible oxygen carriers. Only a few of these possible oxygen carrier systems, based on Cu, Fe and Mn, showed complete conversion of the fuel gas, but still the other systems had limited equilibrium restrictions, with only small and acceptable amounts of unreacted CO and H2 released from the fuel reactor. The promising systems were investigated further with respect to temperature changes in the fuel reactor as well as possible carbon, sulphide and sulphate formation in the fuel reactor. For some systems the reactions in the fuel reactor were endothermic, resulting in a temperature drop in the fuel reactor. However, this drop can be limited by applying a sufficient circulation of particles from the air reactor to the fuel reactor. When Ni or Co is used as oxygen carrier the fuel may need to be desulphurized prior to combustion to avoid formation of solid or liquid sulphides or sulphates. On the other hand, to prevent decomposition of the sulphates BaSO4 and SrSO4, in the fuel reactor, to sulphur-containing gases and metal oxides, it is necessary that some sulphur is present in the fuel and that high temperatures are avoided. Formation of carbon should not be a problem as long as the process is run under conditions of high fuel conversion.",

To study the biochemical changes that may precede lung diseases, metabolomic effects on fetal and maternal lungs and plasma from rats exposed to ETS were compared to filtered air control animals. Genome- reconstructed metabolic pathways may be used to map and interpret dysregulation in metabolic networks. However, mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics datasets often comprise many metabolites for which links to enzymatic reactions have not yet been reported. Hence, network visualizations that rely on current biochemical databases are incomplete and also fail to visualize novel, structurally unidentified metabolites.\\n\\nRESULTS: We present a novel approach to integrate biochemical pathway and chemical relationships to map all detected metabolites in network graphs (MetaMapp) using KEGG reactant pair database, Tanimoto chemical and NIST mass spectral similarity scores. In fetal and maternal lungs, and in maternal blood plasma from pregnant rats exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), 459 unique metabolites comprising 179 structurally identified compounds were detected by gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) and BinBase data processing. MetaMapp graphs in Cytoscape showed much clearer metabolic modularity and complete content visualization compared to conventional biochemical mapping approaches. Cytoscape visualization of differential statistics results using these graphs showed that overall, fetal lung metabolism was more impaired than lungs and blood metabolism in dams. Fetuses from ETS-exposed dams expressed lower lipid and nucleotide levels and higher amounts of energy metabolism intermediates than control animals, indicating lower biosynthetic rates of metabolites for cell division, structural proteins and lipids that are critical for in lung development.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: MetaMapp graphs efficiently visualizes mass spectrometry based metabolomics datasets as network graphs in Cytoscape, and highlights metabolic alterations that can be associated with higher rate of pulmonary diseases and infections in children prenatally exposed to ETS.

The graph-based measures employ a new maximum common edge subgraph isomorphism algorithm, called RASCAL, with several similarity coefficients described previously for quantifying the similarity between pairs of graphs. The effectiveness of these graph-based searches is compared with that resulting from similarity searches using BCI, Daylight and Unity 2D fingerprints. Our results suggest that graph-based approaches provide an effective complement to existing fingerprint-based approaches to virtual screening.",

        "abstract": "Document similarity measures play an important role in many document retrieval and exploration tasks. Over the past decades, several models and techniques have been developed to determine a ranked list of documents similar to a given query document. Interestingly, the proposed approaches typically rely on extensions to the vector space model and are rarely suited for multilingual corpora. In this paper, we present a novel document similarity measure that is based on events extracted from documents. An event is solely described by nearby occurrences of temporal and geographic expressions in a document's text. Thus, a document is modeled as a set of events that can be compared and ranked using temporal and geographic hierarchies. A key feature of our model is that it is term- and language-independent as temporal and geographic expressions mentioned in texts are normalized to a standard format. This also allows to determine similar documents across languages, an important feature in the context of document exploration. Our approach proves to be quite effective, including the discovery of new similarities, as our experiments using different (multilingual) corpora demonstrate.",

We demonstrate that SCISSORS faithfully reflects its source similarity measures for both Tanimoto calculation and rank ordering. After an efficient precalculation step on a database, SCISSORS affords several orders of magnitude of speedup in database screening. SCISSORS furthermore provides an asymptotic speedup for large similarity matrix construction problems, reducing the number of conventional slow similarity evaluations required from quadratic to linear scaling.",

These molecules are inhibitors of inverse transcriptase activity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that prevents the replication of HIV-1 in cells without causing an appreciable effect on other retroviral particles or cellular polymerases. To determine the nature of the bond, enzyme substrate was used for quantum similarity molecular calculations, using the alignment of topo-geometrical superposition approach, solving the problem of finding the best alignment. The reactivity descriptors provide an appropriate methodology to evaluate molecular quantum similarity of these molecular structures, in the context of the density functional theory, taking into account the electronic effects quantified by the quantum similarity descriptor of Coulomb, which turned out to be the best molecular descriptor to describe the electron correlation structures; the determination of the reactive sites is of great importance for the determination of chemical reactivity, providing a bridge between the fields of chemical reactivity, and molecular quantum similarity allows us to find new characteristics and properties of reactivity on these kinds of molecules. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Many computational methods employ similarity measures to identify new compounds for pharmaceutical research. However, chemoinformaticians and medicinal chemists typically perceive similarity in different ways.

        "abstract": "This paper tests a chemical-similarity model against properties of gas-phase neutral triatomic and four-atom molecules. The model is a variant of the Diatomics-in-Molecules (DIM) picture, which considers a molecule to be the superposition of all diatomic molecules that could be formed from adjacent atoms in the molecule. The variant is that adjacent atoms are counted as a diatomic molecule only if they are bonded. The tests consist of investigating whether molecules with the same number of electrons, computed by the adjacent-DIM model, have data more similar than do molecules selected at random. The tests vindicate the model for the heat of atomization and for the equilibrium constant for formation, they agree with the model with lesser confidence for the entropy and the partition function, and they show that the model fails for the ionization potential. The model applies with most confidence to molecules with the more electronegative atoms from rows 2 or 3 (those of greatest interest in organic chemistry) and with lesser confidence otherwise. For these properties and these molecules, the model passes graphical and statistical tests at least as well as does the traditional isoelectronic model. Thus, this work refines what may be called the isoelectronic index.",

How molecular information is represented, called the representation problem, is important to the type of molecular similarity analysis (MSA) that can be carried out in any given situation. In this work, four types of mathematical structure are used to represent molecular information: sets, graphs, vectors, and functions.

Aim of the method is to measure the similarity between the chemical structures of query compounds and the chemical structures of the found reference compounds (hits). A high structural similarity is desirable if the query is not present in the spectral library. Similarity of chemical structures has been measured by the Tanimoto index, calculated from 1365 binary substructure descriptors. The method has been applied to sets of 200-10,000 hitlists obtained with different search methods from a database containing 106,955 compounds. Hitlists with highest structure information have been obtained by using a similarity measure based on the correlation coefficient computed either from spectral features, or from the cubic root of peak intensities for masses up to 200. Frequency distributions of spectral and structural similarities have been investigated and a threshold for the spectral similarity has been derived that in general yields hitlists with structures that are very similar to the query structure.

        "abstract": "Ithomiine butterflies (Nymphalidae) have long-lived, aposematic, chemically protected adults. However, little is known about the defense mechanisms in larvae and other juvenile stages. We showed that larvae Mechanitis polymnia are defended from ants by a chemical similarity between their cuticular lipids and those of the host plant, Solanum tabacifolium (Solanaceae). This is a novel defense mechanism in phytophagous insects. A field survey during one season showed that larval survivorship was up to 80%, which is high when compared with other juvenile stages. In a laboratory bioassay, live larvae on their host plant were not attacked by the predatory ant Camponotus crassus (Formicidae). Two experiments showed that the similarity between the cuticular lipids of M. polymnia and S. tabacifolium protected the larvae from C. crassus: (a) when the caterpillar was switched from a host plant to a non-host plant, the predation rate increased, and (b) when a palatable larva (Spodoptera frugiperda, Noctuidae) was coated with the cuticular lipids of M. polymnia and placed on S. tabacifolium leaves, it no longer experienced a high predation rate. This defensive mechanism can be defined as chemical camouflage, and may have a double adaptive advantage, namely, protection against predation and a reduction in the cost of sequestering toxic compounds from the host plant.",

A possible approach to combine past observations of X and Y with the current values of X to generate an assessment of Y is similarity-weighted averaging. It suggests that the predicted value of Y, Y=ps , be the weighted average of all previously observed values Yi, where the weight of Yi for every i = 1, . . . , n, is the similarity between the vector Xp1 , . . . , Xpm, associated with Yp, and the previously observed vector, Xi1, . . . , Xim. We axiomatize this rule. We assume that, given every database, a predictor has a ranking over possible values, and we show that certain reasonable conditions on these rankings imply that they are determined by the proximity to a similarity-weighted average for a certain similarity function. The axiomatization does not suggest a particular similarity function, or even a particular form of this function. We therefore proceed to suggest that the similarity function be estimated from past observations. We develop tools of statistical inference for parametric estimation of the similarity function, for the case of a continuous as well as a discrete variable. Finally, we discuss the relationship of the proposed method to other methods of estimation and prediction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

How can we uncover the pharmacological relationships among proteins, when drugs may bind them in defiance of bioinformatic criteria? Here we consider a technique that quantitatively relates proteins based on the chemical similarity of their ligands. Starting with tens of thousands of ligands organized into sets for hundreds of drug targets, we calculated the similarity among sets using ligand topology. We developed a statistical model to rank the resulting scores, which were then expressed in minimum spanning trees. We have shown that biologically sensible groups of targets emerged from these maps, as well as experimentally validated predictions of drug off-target effects.",

However, quantitative estimates without additional self-consistency calculations can be made when the Hellmann-Feynman derivative is multiplied with a linearization coefficient that is obtained from a reference pair of compounds. These results suggest that accurate predictions can be made regarding any molecule's energetic properties as long as energies and gradients of three other molecules have been provided. The linearization coefficent can be interpreted as a quantitative measure of chemical similarity.

Evaluation of the new measure reveals periodic tendencies throughout Mendeleev's table. Moreover on the diagonal the global hardness was recovered. Considering a corresponding quantum similarity index reveals that renormalization of the measure can mask periodic patterns. The hardness was calculated for atoms with nuclear charge 3<or=Z<or=103, using the best single configuration electron density functions available. Different hardness kernels were used and the importance of the different contributions to the kernel was investigated.

In order to support the design activity, at any particular stage the representation of the design situation or artefact must be task independent. A comparison of different design cases requires a clear statement of similarity. Similarity assessment has to proceed over complex representation of design case. The design data may include many data models that require a flexible combination of similarity measurements. In this work a general concept of similarity that can cope with various formats of design data has been developed. Uniform representation of the data of the solution and problem parts of the cases and applying a similarity concept for solutions leads to an original idea of adaptation which is task independent as well.

Using molecular dynamics simulation, we have investigated the structural stability as a function of the degree of mechanical perturbation. Both anisotropic perturbation by stretching two terminal atoms and isotropic perturbation by increasing the radius of gyration of the protein show the same key event of force-induced unfolding. Our primary results show that the native structure of apomyoglobin becomes destabilized against the mechanical perturbation as soon as the interhelical packing between the G and H helices is broken, suggesting that our simulation results share a common feature with the experimental observation that the interhelical contact is more important for the folding of apomyoglobin than the stability of individual helices.

We report a series of computational experiments, where we systematically studied the influence of structural descriptors and similarity coefficients on the effectiveness of similarity searching. The study was conducted using two public large data sets, NCI anti-AIDS and MDDR. Four sets of 2D linear fragment descriptors, based on the original definitions of atom pairs and atom sequences, were compared. The effect of using the Tanimoto coefficient and the Euclidean distance was studied as a function of descriptor set. The results clearly indicate that the Tanimoto coefficient is superior to the Euclidean distance in 2D-fragment based similarity searching, in terms of hit rate, while atom sequences demonstrate the best overall performance among the structural descriptors we studied.",

In some cases this can be beneficial and necessary for efficacy and in others it can be detrimental, leading to increased safety liability. To probe off-target pharmacology most drug discovery programs include screening against a broad panel of targets that represent known troublesome pharmacology. Hits against any one of these targets can then be subjected to a risk assessment for potential safety problems in preclinical or clinical studies. In addition, the secondary pharmacology profile can also be thought of as an alternative description of the compound and as such can be used as a method for assessing \u2018similarity\u2019. Consequently, inspection of the in vivo findings of pharmacological neighbors can give important insights into potential safety liabilities that are neither identified by pure chemical similarity searches nor by risk assessment on individual targets. Here we show that the pharmacological profile contains additional information as compared to chemical similarity, and also demonstrate how this can be used in the hazard assessment done during drug discovery and development.",

        "abstract": "Measuring similarity between molecules is a fundamental problem in cheminformatics. Given that similar molecules tend to have similar physical, chemical, and biological properties, the notion of molecular similarity plays an important role in the exploration of molecular data sets, query-retrieval in molecular databases, and in structure-property/activity modeling. Various methods to define structural similarity between molecules are available in the literature, but so far none has been used with consistent and reliable results for all situations. We propose a new similarity method based on atom alignment for the analysis of structural similarity between molecules. This method is based on the comparison of the bonding profiles of atoms on comparable molecules, including features that are seldom found in other structural or graph matching approaches like chirality or double bond stereoisomerism. The similarity measure is then defined on the annotated molecular graph, based on an iterative directed graph similarity procedure and optimal atom alignment between atoms using a pairwise matching algorithm. With the proposed approach the similarities detected are more intuitively understood because similar atoms in the molecules are explicitly shown. This noncontiguous atom matching structural similarity method (NAMS) was tested and compared with one of the most widely used similarity methods (fingerprint-based similarity) using three difficult data sets with different characteristics. Despite having a higher computational cost, the method performed well being able to distinguish either different or very similar hydrocarbons that were indistinguishable using a fingerprint-based approach. NAMS also verified the similarity principle using a data set of structurally similar steroids with differences in the binding affinity to the corticosteroid binding globulin receptor by showing that pairs of steroids with a high degree of similarity (>80%) tend to have smaller differences in the absolute value of binding activity. Using a highly diverse set of compounds with information about the monoamine oxidase inhibition level, the method was also able to recover a significantly higher average fraction of active compounds when the seed is active for different cutoff threshold values of similarity. Particularly, for the cutoff threshold values of 86%, 93%, and 96.5%, NAMS was able to recover a fraction of actives of 0.57, 0.63, and 0.83, respectively, while the fingerprint-based approach was able to recover a fraction of actives of 0.41, 0.40, and 0.39, respectively. NAMS is made available freely for the whole community in a simple Web based tool as well as the Python source code at http://nams.lasige.di.fc.ul.pt/ .",

Considerable variation in performance, when used for (dis)similarity-based techniques, such as similarity searching, database clustering, and dissimilarity-based compound selection, has been reported, the reasons for which are closely related to molecular size. For many of these similarity coefficients, an alternative form can be derived which is applicable to sets of nonbinary data, such as calculated or measured physicochemical properties, or counts of substructural fragments. Here we report on several studies which have been undertaken to investigate the relative performance of twelve coefficients when applied to nonbinary data using such (dis)similarity-based techniques. Results suggest that no single coefficient is appropriate for all methodologies investigated and that the size bias detected with binary data is not as apparent when the data and, hence, coefficient are nonbinary in nature.",

        "abstract": "The metalloproteinase tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE) is involved in the regulation of several key physiological and pathological processes. Therefore, potent and selective synthetic inhibitors are highly sought for the study of the physiological roles of TACE as well as for therapeutic purposes. Because of the high structural similarities between the active site of TACE and those of other related zinc endopeptidases such as disintegrin (ADAMs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), the design of such tailor-made inhibitors is not trivial. To obtain new insights into this problem, we have used a selective MMP inhibitor as a probe to examine the structural and kinetic effects occurring at the active site of TACE upon inhibition. Specifically, we used the selective MMP mechanism-based inhibitor SB-3CT to characterize the fine structural and electronic differences between the catalytic zinc ions within the active sites of TACE and MMP-2. We show that SB-3CT directly binds the metal ion of TACE as observed before with MMP-2. However, in contrast to MMP-2, the binding mode of SB-3CT to the catalytic zinc ion of TACE is different in the length of the Zn-S(SB-3CT) bond distance and the total effective charge of the catalytic zinc ion. In addition, SB-3CT inhibits TACE in a non-competitive fashion by inducing significant conformational changes in the structure. For MMP-2, SB-3CT behaved as a competitive inhibitor and no significant conformational changes were observed. An examination of the second shell amino acids surrounding the catalytic zinc ion of these enzymes indicated that the active site of TACE is more polar than that of MMP-2 and of other MMPs. On the basis of these results, we propose that although there is a seemingly high structural similarity between TACE and MMP-2, these enzymes are significantly diverse in the electronic and chemical properties within their active sites.",

We have thoroughly analyzed this phenomenon and demonstrate that apparent asymmetry in similarity search calculations is a direct consequence of differences in fingerprint bit densities, which often correlate with differences in molecular size. Accordingly, a size-independent fingerprint with constant bit density does not produce asymmetrical search results. For Tversky similarity calculations, differences in fingerprint bit densities between active and inactive compounds determine which weighting factors produce high hit rates.",

It is proposed to generate these hypotheses according to the co-occurrence of different chemical compounds with a known sample constituent in the chemical literature.

The relative co-occurrence of impurity compounds and these products in the Chemical Abstracts Service database was evaluated and compared with corresponding values for several reference groups of probability sampled compounds from the literature. Almost all impurities (97%) and only < or = 8% randomly sampled compounds co-occurred with these chemical products. Mean and median values of relative co-occurrence for impurities are much higher than those of probability sampled compounds which co-occurred with the products. For the combination of impurities and the probability sample of 396 interfering compounds, the power to predict the chemical composition using the highest co-occurrences is 0.49-0.59. The co-occurrence value can also be considered as an \"empiric\" indicator of chemical similarity useful to generate new hypotheses on relationships both between compounds and between compounds and their properties.",

        "abstract": "Colonies of the stingless bee Tetragonilla collina frequently occur in unusually high densities and in direct neighborhood (nest aggregations), in rainforests of Southeast Asia. To investigate whether close relatedness and/or similar chemical profiles facilitate the co-occurrence of multiple T. collina colonies, we investigated aggressive behavior, genetic relatedness and cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles within and between colonies and nest aggregations. Although 17 out of 19 colonies within aggregations were largely unrelated, intraspecific aggression between different colonies was basically absent both within and among aggregations. This lack of aggression should favor social parasitism and hence the occurrence of unrelated individuals within a colony. However, low within-colony relatedness was found in only five out of 19 colonies where it may be explained by queen turnover or the occurrence of foreign workers. CHC profiles of colonies within and among aggregations were statistically different. However, many workers could chemically not be assigned to their maternal colony, indicating considerable overlap among colonies in odor profiles of workers. Moreover, odor profiles tended to be more similar within than among aggregations, although most colonies were unrelated. Thus, CHC profiles were a poor indicator of relatedness in T. collina. The lack of correlation between relatedness and chemical similarity in T. collina may be explained by the incorporation of resin-derived terpenes in their CHC profiles. The composition of these terpenes was highly similar among colonies, particularly within aggregations, hence potentially decreasing chemical distinctiveness and increasing behavioral tolerance.",

How to represent and measure similarity appropriately is a pursuit of many researchers. Many tasks, such as classification and clustering, can be accomplished perfectly when a similarity metric is well-defined. Cosine similarity is a widely used metric that is both simple and effective. This paper proposes a cosine similarity ensemble (CSE) method for learning similarity. In CSE, diversity is guaranteed by using multiple cosine similarity learners, each of which makes use of a different initial point to define the pattern vectors used in its similarity measures. The CSE method is not limited to measuring similarity using only pattern vectors that start at the origin. In addition, the thresholds of these separate cosine similarity learners are adaptively determined. The idea of using a selective ensemble is also implemented in CSE, and the proposed CSE method outperforms other compared methods on various data sets.",

        "abstract": "We present LoFT, a tool for focused combinatorial library design. LoFT provides a set of algorithms, constructing a focused library from a chemical fragment space under optimization of multiple design criteria. A weighted multiobjective scoring function based on physicochemical descriptors is employed for traversing the chemical search space. The new aspect of LoFT is that a similarity-driven product-based library design approach is provided on fragment level. For this reason the feature tree descriptor is incorporated for similarity comparison of library compounds to given bioactive molecules as well as for diversifying the resulting libraries. The feature tree descriptor abstracts the molecular graph to a tree structure where the nodes are labeled with physicochemical properties. For comparison, the nodes of two trees are mapped onto each other. This strictly hierarchical mechanism is suitable for the efficient comparison of chemical fragments, allowing the evaluation of the resulting products on fragment level without explicitly enumerating them. LoFT was validated, applying three different data sets. Starting with a random reagent selection, we optimized the libraries using maximum similarity to known bioactive molecules and iteratively adding further criteria. Moreover, we compared these results with data we obtained with FTrees-FS.",

In order to monitor the multimode chemical process effectively, this paper presents a novel fault detection method based on local neighborhood similarity analysis (LNSA). In the proposed method, prior process knowledge is not required and only themultimode normal operation data are used to construct a reference dataset. For online monitoring of process state, LNSA applies moving window technique to obtain a current snapshot data window. Then neighborhood searching technique is used to acquire the corresponding local neighborhood data window from the reference dataset. Similarity analysis between snapshot and neighborhood data windows is performed, which includes the calculation of principal component analysis (PCA) similarity factor and distance similarity factor. The PCA similarity factor is to capture the change of data direction while the distance similarity factor is used for monitoring the shift of data center position. Based on these similarity factors, two monitoring statistics are built for multimode process fault detection. Finally a simulated continuous stirred tank system is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The simulation results show that LNSA can detect multimode process changes effectively and performs better than traditional fault detection methods.",

To facilitate the preliminary design, the authors have proposed approach based on the re-use of design experience. The design problems in chemical engineering are often quite difficult to represent as a well-structured list of features of one-type data. Many problems in chemical engineering are very large and complex, the problem description is often incomplete and uncertain, and sometimes it changes dynamically. In order to cope with design cases that have different structure representation the general similarity concept has been developed. The paper surveys the existing mathematical methods for similarity measurements and extends them to cope with different data formats.

For prediction of primary targets, the benefit of 3D over 2D was relatively small, but for prediction of off-targets, the added benefit was large. In addition to assessing prediction, the relationship between chemical similarity and pharmacological novelty was studied. Drug pairs that shared high 3D similarity but low 2D similarity (i.e., a novel scaffold) were shown to be much more likely to exhibit pharmacologically relevant differences in terms of specific protein target modulation.",

Sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen peroxide at concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2% (w/v) were used to pretreat ground cotton stalk samples at a solid loading of 10% (w/v). Treatment temperatures of 90\u00baC and 121\u00baC at 15 psi were investigated for residence times of 30, 60, and 90 minutes. Ozone pretreatment was performed in the liquid phase at 4\u00baC with constant sparging. Lignin, carbohydrate, and moisture content analyses were performed on the pretreated solids. The pretreated solids from sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen peroxide pretreatment (at 2%, 60 min, 121\u00baC/15psi) showed significant lignin degradation and/or high sugar availability and hence were hydrolyzed by cellulases from Trichoderma reesei and \u03b2-glucosidase at 50\u00baC. The results showed that time, temperature and concentration were all significant (p\u22640.05) factors in delignification for NaOH and xylan removal for H2SO4. Sulfuric acid pretreatment resulted in the highest xylan reduction (95.23% for 2% acid, 90 min, 121\u00baC/15psi) during pretreatment and the lowest cellulose to glucose conversion during hydrolysis (23.85%). Sodium hydroxide pretreatment resulted in the highest level of delignification (65.63% for 2% NaOH, 90 min, 121\u00baC/15psi) and the highest cellulose conversion (60.8%). Hydrogen peroxide pretreatment resulted in significantly lower (p\u22640.05) delignification (maximum of 29.51% with 2%, 30 min, 121\u00baC/15psi) and cellulose conversion (49.8%) than sodium hydroxide pretreatment, but had a higher (p\u22640.05) conversion than sulfuric acid pretreatment. Ozone pretreatment showed no significant changes in lignin, xylan, or glucan contents with increasing time. Quadratic models using time, temperature, and concentration as numeric variables were developed to predict xylan reduction for H2SO4 pretreatment and lignin reduction for NaOH pretreatment. In addition, linear models relating a modified severity parameter (log Mo) combining the pretreatment parameters with xylan or lignin reduction were developed and resulted in R2 values of 0.89 and 0.78, respectively.",

In the collision model, the post-collisional velocity along the line joining the particle centres is -e(n) times the pre-collisional velocity, and the post-collisional velocity perpendicular to the line joining the particle centres is -e(t) times the pre-collisional value, where e(n) and e(t) are the normal and tangential coefficients of restitution. In the absence of binary collisions, a particle which has a random initial velocity tends to a final state where the translational velocities are zero, and the rotational velocity is equal to (-2V(w)/d), where V-w is the wall velocity. When the effect of binary collisions is included, it is found that there are two possible final steady states, depending on the values of the tangential and normal coefficients of restitution. For certain parameter values, the final steady state is a stationary state, where the translational velocities of all the particles reduce to zero. For other parameter values, the final steady state is dynamic state where the translational velocity fluctuations are non-zero. In the dynamic state, the mean-square velocity has a power-law scaling with epsilon in the limit epsilon -> 0. The exponents predicted by the theory are found to be in quantitative agreement with simulation results in two dimensions",

        "abstract": "There is currently considerable interest in biometric approaches using human odor as a marker of disease or genetic individuality. Body odor is also thought to be used during mate choice to select genetically compatible mates. The idea that body odor reveals information about both genetic identity and genetic similarity is most readily tested by examining odor in twin pairs. However, although this idea can be traced back 130 years to Francis Galton in 1875, most studies using dogs fail to control for shared environmental effects associated with cohabitation. Here we show that odors of identical twins (but not dizygotic twins) can be matched by human sniffers at rates better than chance, even when the twins are living apart. In addition, matching frequencies for identical twin odors were not significantly different from those for duplicate odors from the same individual. These results indicate an important genetic influence on body odor and the potential for developing technologies for human odor printing in relation to underlying genotype.",

        "abstract": "Turbo similarity searching uses information about the nearest neighbors in a conventional chemical similarity search to increase the effectiveness of virtual screening with a data fusion approach being used to combine the nearest-neighbor information. A previous paper suggested that the approach was highly effective in operation; this paper further tests the approach using a range of different databases and of structural representations. Searches were carried out on three different databases of chemical structures, using seven different types of fingerprints, as well as molecular holograms, physicochemical properties, topological indices and reduced graphs. The results show that turbo similarity searching can indeed enhance retrieval but that this is normally achieved only if the similarity search that acts as its starting point has already achieved at least some reasonable level of search effectiveness. In other cases, a modified version of TSS that uses the nearest-neighbor information for approximate machine learning can be used effectively. Though useful for qualitative (active/inactive) predictions of biological activity, turbo similarity searching does not appear to exhibit any predictive power when quantitative property data is available.

        "abstract": "Substructure similarity search is to retrieve graphs that approximately contain a given query graph. It has many applications, e.g., detecting similar functions among chemical compounds. The problem is challenging as even testing subgraph containment between two graphs is NP-complete. Hence, existing techniques adopt the filtering-and-verification framework with the focus on developing effective and efficient techniques to remove non-promising graphs. Nevertheless, existing filtering techniques may be still unable to effectively remove many low quality candidates. To resolve this, in this paper we propose a novel indexing technique, GrafD-Index, to index graphs according to their distances to features. We characterize a tight condition under which the distance-based triangular inequality holds. We then develop lower and upper bounding techniques that exploit the GrafD-Index to (1) prune non-promising graphs and (2) include graphs whose similarities are guaranteed to exceed the given similarity threshold. Considering that the verification phase is not well studied and plays the dominant role in the whole process, we devise efficient algorithms to verify candidates. A comprehensive experiment using real datasets demonstrates that our proposed methods significantly outperform existing methods.",

A single constant was obtained in laminar flow to determine the loss coefficient for all the sizes of valves and types of fluids tested in the valve, indicating that dynamic similarity had been achieved. Consequently a correlation could be developed to determine the loss coefficient in globe valves in both the fully open and half open positions.

        "abstract": "We present a tunable, machine vision-based strategy for automated annotation of virtual small molecule databases. The proposed strategy is based on the use of a machine vision-based tool for extracting structure diagrams in research articles and converting them into connection tables, a virtual \"Chemical Expert\" system for screening the converted structures based on the adjustable levels of estimated conversion accuracy, and a fragment-based measure for calculating intermolecular similarity. For annotation, calculated chemical similarity between the converted structures and entries in a virtual small molecule database is used to establish the links. The overall annotation performances can be tuned by adjusting the cutoff threshold of the estimated conversion accuracy. We perform an annotation test which attempts to link 121 journal articles registered in PubMed to entries in PubChem which is the largest, publicly accessible chemical database. Two cases of tests are performed, and their results are compared to see how the overall annotation performances are affected by the different threshold levels of the estimated accuracy of the converted structure. Our work demonstrates that over 45% of the articles could have true positive links to entries in the PubChem database with promising recall and precision rates in both tests. Furthermore, we illustrate that the Chemical Expert system which can screen converted structures based on the adjustable levels of estimated conversion accuracy is a key factor impacting the overall annotation performance. We propose that this machine vision-based strategy can be incorporated with the text-mining approach to facilitate extraction of contextual scientific knowledge about a chemical structure, from the scientific literature.",

        "abstract": "Data fusion has been shown to work very well when applied to fingerprint-based similarity searching, yet little is known of its application to maximum common substructure (MCS)-based similarity searching. Two similarity search applications of the MCS will be focused on here. Typically, the number of bonds in the MCS, as well as the bonds in the two molecules being compared, are used in a similarity coefficient. The power of this technique can be extended using data fusion, where the MCS similarities of a set of reference molecules against one database molecule are fused. This \"group fusion\" technique forms the first application of the MCS in this work. The other application is that of the chemical hyperstructure. The hyperstructure concept is an alternative form of data fusion, being a hypothetical molecule that is constructed from the overlap of a set of existing molecules. This paper compares fingerprint group fusion (extended-connectivity fingerprints), MCS similarity group fusion, and hyperstructure similarity searching, and describes their relative merits and complementarity in virtual screening. It is concluded that the hyperstructure approach as implemented here is less generally effective than conventional fingerprint approaches.",

A set of 85 structures from 13 diverse protein families was clustered based on binding sites alone, using this score. It was also successfully used to cluster 25 kinases into a number of subfamilies. Using a test kinase query to retrieve other kinase pockets, it was found that a specificity of 99.2% and sensitivity of 97.5% could be achieved using an appropriate cutoff score.

By introducing search intents into the calculation of query similarity, we can obtain more accurate and also informative similarity measures on queries and thus help a variety of applications, especially those related to diversification. Specifically, we first identify the potential search intents of queries, and then measure query similarity under different intents using intent-aware representations. A regularized topic model is employed to automatically learn the potential intents of queries by using both the words from search result snippets and the regularization from query co-clicks. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of intent-aware query similarity on ambiguous queries which can provide significantly better similarity scores over the traditional approaches. We also experimentally verified the utility of intent-aware similarity in the application of query recommendation, which can suggest diverse queries in a structured way to search users.",

We used a complete fragment affinity data set of experimentally determined ligands and inactives for two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the histamine H1 receptor (H1R) and the histamine H4 receptor (H4R), and one ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC), the serotonin receptor (5-HT3AR), to validate our retrospective virtual screening studies.

Our studies show that for these three case study protein targets both consensus scoring approaches can increase virtual screening enrichments compared to single chemical similarity search methods.

An analysis of MACiE, a database of enzyme mechanisms, using our measure of similarity identifies some examples of convergent evolution of chemical mechanisms.

        "abstract": "The paper is concerned with similarity search at large scale, which efficiently and effectively finds similar data points for a query data point. An efficient way to accelerate similarity search is to learn hash functions. The existing approaches for learning hash functions aim to obtain low values of Hamming distances for the similar pairs. However, these methods ignore the ranking order of these Hamming distances. This leads to the poor accuracy about finding similar items for a query data point. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed, referred to top k RHS (Rank Hash Similarity), in which a ranking loss function is designed for learning a hash function. The hash function is hypothesized to be made up of l binary classifiers. The issue of learning a hash function can be formulated as a task of learning l binary classifiers. The algorithm runs l rounds and learns a binary classifier at each round. Compared with the existing approaches, the proposed method has the same order of computational complexity. Nevertheless, experiment results on three text datasets show that the proposed method obtains higher accuracy than the baselines. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "<p>Sentence extraction is a widely adopted text summarization technique where the most important sentences are extracted from document(s) and presented as a summary. The first step towards sentence extraction is to rank sentences in order of importance as in the summary. This paper proposes a novel graph-based ranking method, iSpreadRank, to perform this task. iSpreadRank models a set of topic-related documents into a sentence similarity network. Based on such a network model, iSpreadRank exploits the spreading activation theory to formulate a general concept from social network analysis: the importance of a node in a network (i.e., a sentence in this paper) is determined not only by the number of nodes to which it connects, but also by the importance of its connected nodes. The algorithm recursively re-weights the importance of sentences by spreading their sentence-specific feature scores throughout the network to adjust the importance of other sentences. Consequently, a ranking of sentences indicating the relative importance of sentences is reasoned. This paper also develops an approach to produce a generic extractive summary according to the inferred sentence ranking. The proposed summarization method is evaluated using the DUC 2004 data set, and found to perform well. Experimental results show that the proposed method obtains a ROUGE-1 score of 0.38068, which represents a slight difference of 0.00156, when compared with the best participant in the DUC 2004 evaluation. \ufffd 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

All transformed spectral vectors are projected onto the orthogonal coordinate space. In kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), the nonlinear translation function is implicatively implemented by kernel function. Moreover, all projected spectral vectors are constrained by spectral continuum removal curve. Because of continuum removal curve, various bands contribute the similar measurement differently. The more absorption, the more the contribution in similarity measurement. At last, linear or general linear similarity measure, for example spectral angle mapper, was used to measure the similarity between two nonlinearly transformed spectra.

The experimental data obtained from this work and in the literature show that when the scaling parameter, Gs / (\u03c1p Ug), is modified as FrD\n- 0.3 Gs / (\u03c1p Ug), a detailed hydrodynamic similitude of the gas-solid flow in the fully developed zone of the risers under different operating conditions can be achieved. Furthermore, the experimental results from different gas-solid flow systems also show that as long as FrD\n- 0.3 Gs / (\u03c1p Ug) remains constant, there is the same solid concentration in the fully developed zone of different CFB risers with different particles. With the same FrD\n- 0.3 Gs / (\u03c1p Ug), the local solid concentrations, the descending particle velocities, the cluster frequencies and the solid concentrations inside clusters in the fully developed zone of the risers all display the same axial and radial distribution, respectively. In other words, the empirical similarity parameter, FrD\n- 0.3 Gs / (\u03c1p Ug), appears to have incorporated the effects of operating parameters (Gs and Ug), so that, the gas-solid flow in the fully developed zone of CFB risers under those different operating conditions but having the same FrD\n- 0.3 Gs / (\u03c1p Ug) shows similar micro- and macro-hydrodynamic characteristics. The study shows that the empirical similarity parameter, FrD\n- 0.3 Gs / (\u03c1p Ug), is also independent of the upward gas-solid flow systems. Crown Copyright \u00a9 2008.",

Since we are particularly interested in how stereochemistry affects performance in biological assays, we prepared a disaccharide library containing systematic stereochemical variations, assayed the library for different biological effects, and developed methods to assess the similarity of performance between members across multiple assays. These methods allow us to ask which subsets of stereochemical features best predict similarity in patterns of biological performance between individual members and which features produce the greatest variation of outcomes. We anticipate that the data-analysis approach presented here can be generalized to other sets of biological assays and other chemical descriptors. Methods to assess which structural features of library members produce the greatest similarity in performance for a given set of biological assays should help prioritize synthesis decisions in second-generation library development targeting the underlying cell-biological processes. Methods to assess which structural features of library members produce the greatest variation in performance should help guide decisions about what synthetic methods need to be developed to make optimal small-molecule screening collections.",

        "abstract": "3D molecular shape similarity search has recently become an attractive method for virtual screening and scaffold hopping in drug discovery and chemical genomics research. Among these 3D similarity methods is ROCS (Rapid Overlay of Chemical Structures), a popular tool because of its efficiency and effectiveness. However, searching a large multiconformer molecular database remains a very challenging task because of the nature of such calculations. To simplify shape similarity calculations and potentially increase the efficiency for large scale virtual screening, we have explored an alternative shape similarity approach that does not depend on multiconformers of molecules. The hypothesis underlying this approach is that similar chemical structures tend to have similar 2D chemical depictions and that shape comparison techniques can be utilized to effectively compare the shapes between chemical depictions. We use a 2D depiction program to generate 2-D chemical drawings for both the query molecule and database molecules. We have built a 2D shape comparison program based on the OESHAPE Toolkit (OE Scientific, NM) that compares the molecular depictions and quantifies the shape similarity between the molecules. We demonstrate that this unconventional 2D shape similarity method performs fairly well in virtual screening experiments compared to the 3D Shape method ROCS, with an added advantage of its computational efficiency.",

In the QSAR field they are currently the key factor in read-accross strategy along with the defined chemical space. Similarity indices for binary variables are usually called similarity coefficients and their first definitions date back to the end of the 19th century provided by scientists especially interested in taxonomic studies.

I conclude that groups with balanced similarity structures produce task solutions that approximate the quality of those from other groups, but they do so in significantly less time.

This forms the underlying basis for performing read-across, forming chemical groups and developing (Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationships ((Q)SARs). Chemical similarity is often perceived as structural similarity but in fact there are a number of other approaches that can be used to assess similarity. A systematic similarity analysis usually comprises two main steps. Firstly the chemical structures to be compared need to be characterised in terms of relevant descriptors which encode their physicochemical, topological, geometrical and/or surface properties. A second step involves a quantitative comparison of those descriptors using similarity (or dissimilarity) indices. This work outlines the use of chemical similarity principles in the formation of endpoint specific chemical groupings. Examples are provided to illustrate the development and evaluation of chemical groupings using a new software application called Toxmatch that was recently commissioned by the European Chemicals Bureau (ECB), of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre.

        "abstract": "Since the advent of high-throughput screening (HTS), there has been an urgent need for methods that facilitate the interrogation of large-scale chemical biology data to build a mode of action (MoA) hypothesis. This can be done either prior to the HTS by subset design of compounds with known MoA or post HTS by data annotation and mining. To enable this process, we developed a tool that compares compounds solely on the basis of their bioactivity: the chemical biological descriptor \u201chigh-throughput screening fingerprint\u201d (HTS-FP). In the current embodiment, data are aggregated from 195 biochemical and cell-based assays developed at Novartis and can be used to identify bioactivity relationships among the in-house collection comprising \u223c1.5 million compounds. We demonstrate the value of the HTS-FP for virtual screening and in particular scaffold hopping. HTS-FP outperforms state of the art methods in several aspects, retrieving bioactive compounds with remarkable chemical dissimilarity to a probe structure. We also apply HTS-FP for the design of screening subsets in HTS. Using retrospective data, we show that a biodiverse selection of plates performs significantly better than a chemically diverse selection of plates, both in terms of number of hits and diversity of chemotypes retrieved. This is also true in the case of hit expansion predictions using HTS-FP similarity. Sets of compounds clustered with HTS-FP are biologically meaningful, in the sense that these clusters enrich for genes and gene ontology (GO) terms, showing that compounds that are bioactively similar also tend to target proteins that operate together in the cell. HTS-FP are valuable not only because of their predictive power but mainly because they relate compounds solely on the basis of bioactivity, harnessing the accumulated knowledge of a high-throughput screening facility toward the understanding of how compounds interact with the proteome.",

Differences between users (e.g., age, sex, behavioral patterns, lifestyle) confuse classifiers, which assume everyone is the same. To address this, we propose Community Similarity Networks (CSN), which incorporates inter-person similarity measurements into the classifier training process. Under CSN, every user has a unique classifier that is tuned to their own characteristics. CSN exploits crowd-sourced sensor data to personalize classifiers with data contributed from other similar users. This process is guided by similarity networks that measure different dimensions of inter-person similarity.

The objectives of this study conducted in the Oldman River Basin in Alberta (Canada) were to determine the influence of geology, land use and anthropogenic activities on sources, concentrations and fluxes of riverine sulfate on a watershed scale. This was achieved by combining hydrological, chemical and isotopic techniques. Surfacewater samples were collected from the main stem and tributaries of the Oldman River on a monthly basis between December 2000 and March 2003 and analyzed for chemical and isotopic compositions. At a given sampling site, sulfate sources were primarily dependent on geology and did not vary with time or flow condition. With increasing flow distance a gradual shift from \u03b434S values N10 and \u03b418O values N0 of riverine sulfate indicating evaporite dissolution and soil-derived sulfate in the predominantly forested headwaters, to negative \u03b434S and \u03b418O values suggested that sulfide oxidation was the predominant sulfate source in the agriculturally used downstream part of the watershed. Significant increases in sulfate concentrations and fluxes with downstreamdistance were observed, and were attributed to anthropogenically enhanced sulfide oxidation due to the presence of an extensive irrigation drainage network with seasonally varying water levels. Sulfate-S exports in an artificially drained subbasin (64 kg S/ha/yr) were found to exceed those in a naturally drained subbasin (4 kg S/ha/yr) by an order of magnitude. Our dataset suggests that the naturally occurring process of sulfide oxidation has been enhanced in the Oldman River Basin by the presence of an extensive network of drainage and irrigation canals.",

        "abstract": "The similarity view of scientific representation has recently been subjected to strong criticism. Much of this criticism has been directed against a \u2018naive\u2019 similarity account, which tries to explain representation solely in terms of similarity between scientific models and the world. This article examines the more sophisticated account offered by the similarity view's leading proponent, Ronald Giere. In contrast to the naive account, Giere's account appeals to the role played by the scientists using a scientific model. A similar move is often made by defenders of resemblance theories of depiction, who invoke the role played by the artist, or by the viewers of a painting. In this article I look to debates over depiction to assess the difficulties facing those who wish to defend the similarity view of scientific representation. I then turn to examine Giere's account. Ultimately, I argue, this account is unsuccessful: while appealing to the role of scientists offers a promising way to defend the similarity view, Giere's own account does not capture what it is that scientists do when they use a model to represent the world.",

        "title": "Similarity of Semantic Relations",
        "abstract": "There are at least two kinds of similarity. Relational similarity is correspondence between relations, in contrast with attributional similarity, which is correspondence between attributes. When two words have a high degree of attributional similarity, we call them synonyms. When two pairs of words have a high degree of relational similarity, we say that their relations are analogous. For example, the word pair mason:stone is analogous to the pair carpenter:wood. This paper introduces Latent Relational Analysis (LRA), a method for measuring relational similarity. LRA has potential applications in many areas, including information extraction, word sense disambiguation, and information retrieval. Recently the Vector Space Model (VSM) of information retrieval has been adapted to measuring relational similarity, achieving a score of 47% on a collection of 374 college-level multiple-choice word analogy questions. In the VSM approach, the relation between a pair of words is characterized by a vector of frequencies of predefined patterns in a large corpus. LRA extends the VSM approach in three ways: (1) the patterns are derived automatically from the corpus, (2) the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to smooth the frequency data, and (3) automatically generated synonyms are used to explore variations of the word pairs. LRA achieves 56% on the 374 analogy questions, statistically equivalent to the average human score of 57%. On the related problem of classifying semantic relations, LRA achieves similar gains over the VSM.",

To date, a wide variety of approaches to geo-semantic similarity have been devised. A judgment of similarity is not intrinsically right or wrong, but obtains a certain degree of cognitive plausibility, depending on how closely itmimics human behavior. Thus selecting the most appropriatemeasure for a specific task is a significant challenge. To ad- dress this issue, we make an analogy between computational similarity measures and so- liciting domain expert opinions, which incorporate a subjective set of beliefs, perceptions, hypotheses, and epistemic biases. Following this analogy, we define the semantic similarity ensemble (SSE) as a composition of different similarity measures, acting as a panel of experts having to reach a decision on the semantic similarity of a set of geographic terms. The ap- proach is evaluated in comparison to human judgments, and results indicate that an SSE performs better than the average of its parts. Although the best member tends to outper- form the ensemble,all ensembles outperform the average performance of each ensemble\u2019s member. Hence, in contexts where the bestmeasure is unknown, the ensemble provides a more cognitively plausible approach.",

For convenience, we turn around the ordering in the target domain of the generalized metrics so that we speak of similarity instead of distance. Starting from an extremely general situation without axioms, we examine which axioms or additional properties are needed to obtain useful results. For instance, we shall see that commutativity and associativity of the generalized version of addition occurring in the triangle inequality are not really needed, nor do we require a generalized version of subtraction. Each similarity space comes with its own domain of possible similarity values. Therefore, we consider non-expanding functions modulo some rescaling between different domains of similarity values. We show that non-expanding functions with locally varying rescaling functions correspond to topologically continuous functions, while non-expanding functions with a globally fixed rescaling generalize uniformly continuous functions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The relevant situations enter semantic composition via the interpretation of tense. Counterfactuals are treated as law-like conditionals with de re predication over particular facts. Similarity with respect to particular facts is ensured by the semantics of tense in interaction with the modal, while the modal itself is responsible for invoking laws. In the paper, various arguments are provided to support a local view of similarity over the global approach found in semantics along the line of Lewis\u2019s and Stalnaker\u2019s. Arguments are also provided tying the evaluation of similarity to the interpretation of tense. Finally, arguments are provided to show that in key cases, the approaches make comparable predictions.",

We develop a comprehensive methodology for similarity queries over spatial scenes that incorporates cognitively motivated approaches about scene comparisons, together with explicit domain knowledge about spatial objects and their relations for the relaxation of spatial query constraints.

In this study, high-functioning adults with autism and ability-matched controls performed a low-level categorization task designed to examine perceptual similarity. Results were analysed using standard statistical techniques and modelled using a quantitative model of categorization. This analysis revealed that participants with autism required reliably longer to learn the category structure than did the control group but, contrary to the predictions of the reduced perceptual similarity hypothesis, no evidence was found of more accurate performance by the participants with autism during the generalization stage. Our results suggest that when all participants are attending to the same attributes of an object in the visual domain, people with autism will not display signs of enhanced perceptual similarity.",

        "abstract": "An important feature of a database management systems (DBMS) is its client/server architecture, where managing shared memory among the clients and the server is always an tough issue. However, similarity queries are specially sensitive to this kind of architecture, since the answer sizes vary widely. Usually, the answers of similarity query are fully processed to be sent in full to the user, who often is interested in just parts of the answer, e.g. just few elements closer or farther to the query reference. Compelling the DBMS to retrieve the full answer, further ignoring its majority is at least a waste of server processing power. Paging the answer is a technique that splits the answer onto several pages, following client requests. Despite the success of paging on traditional queries, little work has been done to support it in similarity queries. In this work, we present a technique that not only provides paging in similarity range or k-nearest neighbor queries, but also supports them in two variations: the forward similarity query and the backward similarity query. They return elements either increasingly farther of increasingly closer to the query reference. The reported experiments show that, depending on the proportion of the interesting part over the full answer, both techniques allow answering queries much faster than it is obtained in the non-paged way. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) serve as nestmate recognition cues, and facilitate colony fusion of unrelated L. humile colonies that share similar CHC profiles. In this study, we paired six southeastern U.S. L. humile colonies in a 6-month laboratory fusion assay, and determined if worker and queen CHC profile similarity between colonies was associated with colony fusion and intercolony genetic similarity. We also compared worker and queen CHC profiles between fused colony pairs and unpaired controls to determine if worker and queen chemical profiles changed after fusion. We found that colony fusion correlated with the CHC similarity of workers and queens, with the frequency of fusion increasing with greater CHC profile similarity between colonies. Worker and queen CHC profile similarity between colonies also was associated with genetic similarity between colonies. Queen CHC profiles in fused colonies appeared to be a mix of the two colony phenotypes. In contrast, when only one of the paired colonies survived, the CHC profile of the surviving queens did not diverge from that of the colony of origin. Similarly, workers in non-fused colonies maintained their colony-specific CHC, whereas in fused colonies the worker CHC profiles were intermediate between those of the two colonies. These results suggest a role for CHC in regulating interactions among mutually aggressive L. humile colonies, and demonstrate that colony fusion correlates with both genetic and CHC similarities. Further, changes in worker and queen chemical profiles in fused colonies suggest that CHC plasticity may sustain the cohesion of unrelated L. humile colonies that had fused.",

Few of these parameters have been extensively characterized in the Fischer 344 rat strain. To investigate how odor quality affects perception in this rat strain, we measured how graded perceptual similarity, created by varying carbon chain length across a series of homologous alcohol pairs, influenced odor discrimination using a liquid-motivated go/no-go task. We employed an automated, liquid-dilution olfactometer to train Fischer 344 rats (N = 8) on a 2-odor discrimination task. Six odorants (1-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, and 1-octanol) were arranged to produce 15 novel odorant pairs differing between 1 and 5 carbon atoms; testing sessions included presentation of only 1 pseudorandomly assigned pair daily (200 trials). Results show that although rats can learn to discriminate between any 2 odorant pairs, performance declines systematically as the pairs become more structurally similar and, therefore, more perceptually confusing. As such, the easier discrimination pairs produced reliable ceiling effects across all rats, whereas performance for the difficult discrimination pairs was consistently worse, even after repeated testing. These data emphasize the importance of considering odorant stimulus dimensions in experimental designs employing olfactory stimuli. Moreover, establishing baseline olfactory performance in Fischer 344 rats may be particularly useful for predicting age-related cognitive decline in this model.",

To evidence generality and robustness we give two distinctive applications in widely divergent areas using standard compression programs like gzip and GenCompress.

The method avoids explicit enumeration and calculation of descriptors for every virtual compound, yet provides an optimal or nearly optimal similarity selection in a reasonable time frame. It is based on the principle of probability sampling and the recognition that each reagent is represented in a combinatorial library by multiple products. The method proceeds in three stages. First, a small fraction of the products is selected at random and ranked according to their similarity against the query structure. The top-ranking compounds are then identified and deconvoluted into a list of \"preferred\" reagents. Finally, all the cross-products of these preferred reagents are enumerated in an exhaustive manner, and systematically compared to the target to obtain the final selection. This procedure has been applied to produce similarity selections from several virtual combinatorial libraries, and the dependency of the quality of the selections on several selection parameters has been analyzed.",

We thus introduce a novel method for the detection of groups of non-adjacent vertices with similar classifications in networks through the similarity of measures on the network surrounding them. In the algorithm, vertices are characterized by a large set of structural properties of local and global scale, composing a network attributes vector for each vertex. This characterization is used to construct an affinity dual graph, where clustering is applied. When tested in several real-world networks with ground truth classifications, the groups detected by our algorithm had significantly more homogenous groups than those found by common community detection algorithms. The algorithm allows the clustering of non-adjacent vertices in remote network locations, as shown in two networks. When used in a supervised context, precise predictions of vertices content are accomplished.",

Bioactive small molecules that bind the 5'CAG/3'GAC motif found in r(CAG)(exp) hairpin structure were identified by using RNA binding studies and virtual screening/chemical similarity searching. Specifically, a benzylguanidine-containing small molecule was found to improve pre-mRNA alternative splicing of MBNL1-sensitive exons in cells expressing the toxic r(CAG)(exp). The compound was identified by first studying the binding of RNA 1 \u00d7 1 nucleotide internal loops to small molecules known to have affinity for nucleic acids. Those studies identified 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) as a specific binder to RNAs with the 5'CAG/3'GAC motif. DAPI was then used as a query molecule in a shape- and chemistry alignment-based virtual screen to identify compounds with improved properties, which identified 4-guanidinophenyl 4-guanidinobenzoate, a small molecule that improves pre-mRNA splicing defects associated with the r(CAG)(exp)-MBNL1 complex. This compound may facilitate the development of therapeutics to treat diseases caused by r(CAG)(exp) and could serve as a useful chemical tool to dissect the mechanisms of r(CAG)(exp) toxicity. The approach used in these studies, defining the small RNA motifs that bind small molecules with known affinity for nucleic acids and then using virtual screening to optimize them for bioactivity, may be generally applicable for designing small molecules that target other RNAs in the human genomic sequence.",

        "abstract": "A novel approach for the quantification of drug similarity is proposed, which makes use of the surface polarities, that is, conductor surface polarization charge densities sigma, as defined in the quantum chemically based conductor-like screening model for realistic solvation(COSMO-RS). The histogram of these surface polarities, the so-called sigma profiles, have been proven to be the key for the calculation of all kinds of partition and adsorption coefficients and, therefore, of relevant absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion parameters such as solubility, pKa, log BB, and many others. They also carry a large part of the information required for the estimation of desolvation and binding processes responsible for receptor binding and enzyme inhibition of drug molecules. Thus, a large degree of similarity with respect to the sigma profiles appears to be a necessary condition for drugs of similar physiological action. Driven by this insight, we propose a sigma-profile-based drug similarity measure COSMOsim for the detection of new bioisosteric drug candidates. In several examples, we demonstrate its statistical and pharmaceutical plausibility, its practicability for real drug research projects, and its unique independence from the chemical structure, which enables scaffold hopping in a natural way.",

This paper explores the notion of B-similarity, which is a kind of bisimulation between preferential models. We characterize the equivalence of preferential models in terms of B-similarity. However, this result is applicable only for preferential models of finite depth. To overcome this defect, we introduce a weak notion of similarity called M-similarity, and obtain a result corresponding to Hennessy-Milner Theorem and Keisler-Shelah's Isomorphism Theorem in modal logic and first-order logic, respectively. As its application, we investigate the expressive power of Boolean combinations of conditional assertions (BCA, for short), and prove that BCAs are the fragments of first-order language preserved under M-similarity. Moreover, we obtain a characterization for elementary classes defined by BCAs. A notion of first-order translation originating from modal logic plays an important role in this paper. In order to illustrate that first-order translation is a powerful tool in the study of nonmonotonic logic, some model-theoretic results about preferential models are proved based on this translation. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "The task of clustering is to identify classes of similar objects among a set of objects. The definition of similarity varies from one clustering model to another. However, in most of these models the concept of similarity is often based on such metrics as Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance or other Lp distances. In other words, similar objects must have close values in at least a set of dimensions. In this paper, we explore a more general type of similarity. Under the pCluster model we proposed, two objects are similar if they exhibit a coherent pattern on a subset of dimensions. The new similarity concept models a wide range of applications. For instance, in DNA microarray analysis, the expression levels of two genes may rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of environmental stimuli. Although the magnitude of their expression levels may not be close, the patterns they exhibit can be very much alike. Discovery of such clusters of genes is essential in revealing significant connections in gene regulatory networks. E-commerce applications, such as collaborative filtering, can also benefit from the new model, because it is able to capture not only the closeness of values of certain leading indicators but also the closeness of (purchasing, browsing, etc.) patterns exhibited by the customers. In addition to the novel similarity model, this paper also introduces an effective and efficient algorithm to detect such clusters, and we perform tests on several real and synthetic data sets to show its performance. \u00a9 2008 Springer.",

        "abstract": "Ab initio electronic structure methods give accurate results for small systems, but do not scale well to large systems. Chemical insight tells us that molecular functional groups will behave approximately the same way in all molecules, large or small. This molecular similarity is exploited in semiempirical methods, which couple simple electronic structure theories with parameters for the transferable characteristics of functional groups. We propose that high-level calculations on small molecules provide a rich source of parametrization data. In principle, we can select a functional group, generate a large amount of ab initio data on the group in various small-molecule environments, and \"mine\" this data to build a sophisticated model for the group's behavior in large environments. This work details such a model for electron correlation: a semiempirical, subsystem-based correlation functional that predicts a subsystem's two-electron density matrix as a functional of its one-electron density matrix. This model is demonstrated on two small systems: chains of linear, minimal-basis (H-H)(5), treated as a sum of four overlapping (H-H)(2) subsystems; and the aldehyde group of a set of HOC-R molecules. The results provide an initial demonstration of the feasibility of the approach.",

        "abstract": "Fingerprints are molecular bit string representations and are among the most popular descriptors for similarity searching. In key-type fingerprints, each bit position monitors the presence or absence of a prespecified chemical or structural feature. In contrast to hashed fingerprints, this keyed design makes it possible to evaluate individual bit positions and the associated structural features during similarity searching. Bit silencing is introduced as a systematic approach to assess the contribution of each bit in a fingerprint to similarity search performance. From the resulting bit contribution profile, a bit position-dependent weight vector is derived that determines the relative weight of each bit on the basis of its individual contribution. By merging this weight vector with the Tanimoto coefficient, compound class-directed similarity metrics are obtained that further increase fingerprint search calculations compared to conventional calculations of Tanimoto similarity.

The approach involves the determination of the fingerprint bit pattern entropy of a compound reference set and recalculation of the entropy following the addition of individual test compounds. If a database compound shares similar bit patterns with reference set molecules, adding this compound to the reference set only produces a small change in system entropy. By contrast, inclusion of a compound having a dissimilar fingerprint leads to a notable increase in entropy. Thus, database compounds can be screened for candidate molecules that do not cause significant changes in reference set fingerprint entropy. Compared to nearest neighbor methods, this approach has the computational advantage that it extracts reference set information only once prior to similarity searching. Test calculations on different compound data sets, fingerprints, and screening databases reveal that the ability of our entropy-based method to detect active compounds is often superior to data fusion techniques and Tanimoto similarity calculations.",

The simulations are initiated by a large number of species, evenly distributed along the phenotype axis. Exceptionally, the Gaussian carrying capacity supports coexistence of all species, initially present. In case of any other, distinctly different, carrying capacity functions, competition resulted in extinction of all, but a few species. A comprehensive study of classes of fractal-like carrying capacity functions with different fractal exponents was carried out. The average phenotype differences between surviving species were found to be roughly equal to the competition width. We conclude that, despite the existence of exceptional cases, the classical picture of limiting similarity and niche segregation is a good rule of thumb for practical purposes.",

A new global linear algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is named Maximal Similarity Embedding (MSE). The preserving local feature of this new algorithm makes it distinct from most other methods. The MSE algorithm utilizes the Cosine Metric to describe the geometric characteristics of neighborhood and thus seeks to maximize the global similarity for dimensionality reduction. This new proposal method is robust for sparse dataset and naturally helps in avoiding the problem of small sample size cases.

        "abstract": "Otsu method is one of the most popular image thresholding methods. The segmentation results of Otsu method are in general acceptable for the gray level images with bimodal histogram patterns that can be approximated with mixture Gaussian modal. However, it is difficult for Otsu method to determine the reliable thresholds for the images with mixture non-Gaussian modal, such as mixture Rayleigh modal, mixture extreme value modal, mixture Beta modal, mixture uniform modal, comb-like modal. In order to determine automatically the robust and optimum thresholds for the images with various histogram patterns, this paper proposes a new global thresholding method based on a maximum-image- similarity idea. The idea is inspired by analyzing the relationship between Otsu method and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), which provides a novel interpretation of Otsu method from the perspective of maximizing image similarity. It is then natural to construct a maximum similarity thresholding (MST) framework by generalizing Otsu method with the maximum-image-similarity concept. As an example, a novel MST method is directly designed according to this framework, and its robustness and effectiveness are confirmed by the experimental results on 41 synthetic images and 86 real world images with various histogram shapes. Its extension to multilevel thresholding case is also discussed briefly. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

Upon immersion in the filtrate of 1a (namely 1a-s, freshly filtered) or 1b (namely 1b-s, filtered and then activated in air for three days), single crystal-to-single crystal (SCSC) transformations of 1a\u20131c to a new MOF, formulated as [Co 6 O 2 (OH) 4 (BTB) 8/3 (H 2 O) 4 ]$ 14DMF$4EtOH$2H 2 O (2), occur along with dramatic color change from blue purple to red. Crystallographic studies reveal that the new MOF is also two-fold interpenetrated but is constructed with hexanuclear Co 6 O 2 (CO 2) 8 SBUs. This SCSC transformation from 1a\u20131c to 2 can take place only in 1a-s or 1b-s but not in 1c-s and is accompanied with an increase of metal-to-ligand ratio. ESI-MS studies unveil the formation of free {Co 3 O} units in situ formed only in 1a-s and 1b-s, and evidence that the SCSC transformation involves a postsynthetic uptake of free metal clusters, {Co 3 O}. On the other hand, the SCSC transformation speed decreases from 1a to 1c, which is determined by the chelate carboxylate groups undergoing cleavage of metal-carboxylate bonds during the SCSC transformation and the shape of the 1D channels affecting the diffusion of free metal clusters. Furthermore, the resulting MOF (2) can maintain its crystallinity upon activation and adsorbs iodine up to 38 wt%. Combined with the significant SCSC transformation through postsynthetic uptake of free metal clusters and the resulting MOF capable of adsorbing iodine, the present approach not only provides a true route to construct SBUs-based MOF materials with pre-existing \" real \" SBUs but also represent a new type of SCSC transformation in the field of MOFs that is able to efficiently tune structures and physicochemical properties of MOFs in the solid states.",

        "abstract": "Seven experiments investigated how stimulus context affects judgements of the magnitude of chemosensory stimuli. In each experiment, subjects gave magnitude estimates of the intensity of several concentrations of two substances, with the contextual set of concentrations varying across experimental conditions. Different experiments used different pairs of substances, which could be tastants (sucrose or NaCl) that were sipped, odorants (orange or vanillin) that were sipped (i.e. presented retronasally) or the same odorants sniffed (i.e. presented orthonasally). Varying the stimulus context affected the judgements differentially when the two substances were compositionally different (sucrose and NaCl; sucrose and orange; sucrose and vanillin) but not when they were the same (vanillin or orange presented orally and nasally). Judgements of qualitative similarity of the same pairs of substances, obtained in a separate experiment, failed to predict accurately the pattern of differential context effects. Taken together, the results suggest that differential effects of context relate only indirectly to perceptual dissimilarity per se but may primarily reflect the result of stimulus-specific adaptation-like processes.",

Many toxicological responses result from a multimechanistic process and, consequently, structural diversity among the active compounds is likely. Combining this knowledge, we introduce similarity boosted QSAR modeling, where we calculate molecular descriptors using similarities with respect to representative reference compounds to aid a statistical learning algorithm in distinguishing between different structural classes. We present three approaches for the selection of reference compounds, one by literature search and two by clustering. Our experimental evaluation on seven publicly available data sets shows that the similarity descriptors used on their own perform quite well compared to structural descriptors. We show that the combination of similarity and structural descriptors enhances the performance and that a simple stacking approach is able to use the complementary information encoded by the different descriptor sets to further improve predictive results.

        "abstract": "This paper presents the findings obtained in an experimental study of metric underlying the perceptual colour space. Previous studies evidenced that, in tasks of evaluation of colour similarity, the subjects don't refer to the most general category of \u201ccolour\u201d, but rather rely on the introduction of subordinate categories containing all variations of a colour. Besides, categories related to different colours can sometimes overlap. This forces to conclude that perception of colour variations is not isometric, but is rather weighed in different ways for different colours.In order to detect the metric of colour space we performed an experiment with multiple conditions within the subjects, designed to determine the form of the function that ties the independent variable (tonality of colour) with the dependent variable (similarity judgement). To each subject we presented simultaneously a pair of images, the target one and another differing from the target only for its colour (a suitable perturbation of the tonality). The subject task was to rate the similarity of the second image with the target. The frequency distribution of similarity judgments for each colour gave a qualitative description of how the different colours are represented at the cognitive level. We applied to the observed frequencies a unidimensional scaling procedure to obtain a precise measure of the distance between the variation steps for each colour. We were allowed to choose a single dimension because we limited the study only to the variation of tonality. The scaling was applied separately to each colour scale.The results showed that different colours were associated to different measure scales. Besides, once chosen a particular colour, its measure scale itself was depending on the direction of variation chosen for its tonality during the experimental presentation. We can conclude that the geometry of colour space looks very complicated and not reducible to familiar mathematical concepts.",

One camp has emphasized the limitations and biases produced by the heuristics; another has focused on the accuracy of heuristics and their ecological validity. In this paper we investigate a heuristic proposed by the first camp, using the methods of the second. We investigate a subset of the representativeness heuristic we call the \u201csimilarity\u201d heuristic, whereby decision makers who use it judge the likelihood that an instance is a member of one category rather than another by the degree to which it is similar to others in that category. We provide a mathematical model of the heuristic and test it experimentally in a trinomial environment. In this environment, the similarity heuristic turns out to be a reliable and accurate choice rule and both choice and response time data suggest it is also how choices are made. We conclude with a theoretical discussion of how our work fits in the broader \u201cfast-and-frugal\u201d heuristics program, and of the boundary conditions for the similarity heuristic.

        "abstract": "An evolutionary history of a set of organisms is a family tree, or topology, with branches of various lengths between vertices that describe how closely the organisms are related to each other. We consider the K evolutionary histories of K genes from a set of N organisms. Evolutionary similarity (ES) occurs when the branching patterns and relative branch lengths in the K evolutionary histories of the genes are the same or nearly the same across the set of organisms. Evolutionary similarity indicates similarity of evolutionary pressures acting on these genes. Current likelihood approaches identify ES conditional on a given topology. For a variety of reasons, different genes may support different topologies when fit independently. We use Bayesian models and reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to jointly infer topology and branch lengths for multiple genes simultaneously. We test for ES using Bayes factors, conditionally on a consistent topology over the multiple genes, where the topology is either known or unknown. We relax the single topology assumption by employing a dissimilarity measure between evolutionary histories and testing for ES using both prior and posterior predictive p values. We apply our methodology to three genes (DAX1, SOX9, and SRY) believed to be involved in sex determination in primates. We find support in the data for ES between DAX1 and SRY, but not SOX9. These results are consistent with the hypothesized biological roles of these genes.",

        "abstract": "Words and phrases acquire meaning from the way they are used in society, from their relative semantics to other words and phrases. For computers, the equivalent of \u201csociety\u201d is \u201cdatabase,\u201d and the equivalent of \u201cuse\u201d is \u201ca way to search the database.\u201d We present a new theory of similarity between words and phrases based on information distance and Kolmogorov complexity. To fix thoughts, we use the World Wide Web (WWW) as the database, and Google as the search engine. The method is also applicable to other search engines and databases. This theory is then applied to construct a method to automatically extract similarity, the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the WWW using Google page counts. The WWW is the largest database on earth, and the context information entered by millions of independent users averages out to provide automatic semantics of useful quality. We give applications in hierarchical clustering, classification, and language translation. We give examples to distinguish between colors and numbers, cluster names of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters and names of books by English novelists, the ability to understand emergencies and primes, and we demonstrate the ability to do a simple automatic English-Spanish translation. Finally, we use the WordNet database as an objective baseline against which to judge the performance of our method. We conduct a massive randomized trial in binary classification using support vector machines to learn categories based on our Google distance, resulting in an a mean agreement of 87 percent with the expert crafted WordNet categories.",

Such exploitation includes the taxonomic classification of chemical themes, and data mining to assess mutual information between themes and companies. Importantly, we also launch candidates that evolve by \"natural selection\" as failure of partial match against the patent data base and their ability to bind to the protein target appropriately, by simulation on Blue Gene. An unusual feature of our method is that algorithms and workflows rely on dynamic interaction between match-and-edit instructions, which in practice are regular expressions. Similarity testing by these uses SMILES strings and, less frequently, graph or connectivity representations. Examining how this performs in high throughput, we note that chemical similarity and novelty are human concepts that largely have meaning by utility in specific contexts. For some purposes, mutual information involving chemical themes might be a better concept.",

The first one is accommodating the computational needs of a large amount of data to be processed. The second one is extracting useful information from the raw data in an automated fashion. Both of these problems could result in long processing times that can seriously hamper an investigation. In this paper, we discuss a new approach to one of the basic operations that is invariably applied to raw data - hashing. The essential idea is to produce an efficient and scalable hashing scheme that can be used to supplement the traditional cryptographic hashing during the initial pass over the raw evidence. The goal is to retain enough information to allow binary data to be queried for similarity at various levels of granularity without any further pre-processing/indexing. The specific solution we propose, called a multi-resolution similarity hash (or MRS hash), is a generalization of recent work in the area. Its main advantages are robust performance - raw speed comparable to a high-grade block-level crypto hash, scalability - ability to compare targets that vary in size by orders of magnitude, and space efficiency - typically below 0.5% of the size of the target. \u00a9 2007 DFRWS.",

        "abstract": "Molecules are often characterized by sparse binary fingerprints, where 1s represent the presence of substructures and 0s represent their absence. Fingerprints are especially useful for similarity calculations, such as database searching or clustering, generally measuring similarity as the Tanimoto coefficient. In other cases, such as visualization, design of experiments, or latent variable regression, a low-dimensional Euclidian \"chemical space\" is more useful, where proximity between points reflects chemical similarity. A temptation is to apply principal components analysis (PCA) directly to these fingerprints to obtain a low dimensional continuous chemical space. However, Gower has shown that distances from PCA on bit vectors are proportional to the square root of Hamming distance. Unlike Tanimoto similarity, Hamming similarity (HS) gives equal weight to shared 0s as to shared 1s, that is, HS gives as much weight to substructures that neither molecule contains, as to substructures which both molecules contain. Illustrative examples show that proximity in the corresponding chemical space reflects mainly similar size and complexity rather than shared chemical substructures. These spaces are ill-suited for visualizing and optimizing coverage of chemical space, or as latent variables for regression. A more suitable alternative is shown to be Multi-dimensional scaling on the Tanimoto distance matrix, which produces a space where proximity does reflect structural similarity.",

Using a pre-computed index, the 50 nearest neighbors of a query can be determined in a few seconds, even for databases containing millions of compounds.

Information loss is the driving force of these spontaneous processes. Information is defined as the amount of the compressed data. Information losses due to dynamic motion and static symmetric structure formation are defined as two kinds of entropies - dynamic entropy and static entropy, respectively. There are three laws of information theory, where the first and the second laws are analogs of the two thermodynamic laws. However, the third law of information theory is different: for a solid structure of perfect symmetry (e.g., a perfect crystal), the entropy (static entropy for solid state) S is the maximum. More generally, a similarity principle is set up: if all the other conditions remain constant, the higher the similarity among the components is, the higher the value of entropy of the mixture (for fluid phases) or the assemblage (for a static structure or a system of condensed phases) or any other structure (such as quantum states in quantum mechanics) will be, the more stable the mixture or the assemblage will be, and the more spontaneous the process leading to such a mixture or an assemblage or a chemical bond will be.",

A statistical model was developed to rank the significance of the resulting similarity scores, which are expressed as a minimum spanning tree to map the sets together. Although these maps are connected solely by chemical similarity, biologically sensible clusters nevertheless emerged. Links among unexpected targets also emerged, among them that methadone, emetine and loperamide (Imodium) may antagonize muscarinic M3, alpha2 adrenergic and neurokinin NK2 receptors, respectively. These predictions were subsequently confirmed experimentally. Relating receptors by ligand chemistry organizes biology to reveal unexpected relationships that may be assayed using the ligands themselves.",

In this technique, the global molecular similarity is broken up as local similarity at each grid point surrounding the molecules and is used as a QSAR descriptor. In this way, a view of the molecular sites permitting favorable and rational changes to enhance activity is obtained. The local similarity index, calculated on the basis of Petke's formula, segregates the regions into \"equivalent\", \"favored similar\", and \"disfavored similar\" (alternatively \"favored dissimilar\") potentials with respect to a reference molecule in the data set. The method has been tested on three large and diverse data sets-thrombin, glycogen phosphorylase b, and thermolysin inhibitors. The QSAR models derived using genetic algorithm incorporated partial least square analysis statistics are found to be comparable to the ones obtained by the standard three-dimensional (3D)-QSAR methods, such as comparative molecular field analysis and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis. The graphical interpretation of the LISA models is straightforward, and the outcome of the models corroborates well with literature data. The LISA models give insight into the binding mechanisms of the ligand with the enzyme and allow fine-tuning of the molecules at the local level to improve their activity.",

        "abstract": "Similarity of compound chemical structures often leads to close pharmacological profiles, including binding to the same protein targets. The opposite, however, is not always true, as distinct chemical scaffolds can exhibit similar pharmacology as well. Therefore, relying on chemical similarity to known binders in search for novel chemicals targeting the same protein artificially narrows down the results and makes lead hopping impossible. In this study we attempt to design a compound similarity/distance measure that better captures structural aspects of their pharmacology and molecular interactions. The measure is based on our recently published method for compound spatial alignment with atomic property fields as a generalized 3D pharmacophoric potential. We optimized contributions of different atomic properties for better discrimination of compound pairs with the same pharmacology from those with different pharmacology using Partial Least Squares regression. Our proposed similarity measure was then tested for its ability to discriminate pharmacologically similar pairs from decoys on a large diverse dataset of 115 protein-ligand complexes. Compared to 2D Tanimoto and Shape Tanimoto approaches, our new approach led to improvement in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values in 66 and 58% of domains respectively. The improvement was particularly high for the previously problematic cases (weak performance of the 2D Tanimoto and Shape Tanimoto measures) with original AUC values below 0.8. In fact for these cases we obtained improvement in 86% of domains compare to 2D Tanimoto measure and 85% compare to Shape Tanimoto measure. The proposed spatial chemical distance measure can be used in virtual ligand screening.",

In this paper, a design pattern detection methodology is proposed that is based on similarity scoring between graph vertices. Due to the nature of the underlying graph algorithm, this approach has the ability to also recognize patterns that are modified from their standard representation. Moreover, the approach exploits the fact that patterns reside in one or more inheritance hierarchies, reducing the size of the graphs to which the algorithm is applied. Finally, the algorithm does not rely on any pattern-specific heuristic, facilitating the extension to novel design structures.

Here, we manipulated the cuticular chemical profiles of freeze-dried insect prey to show that chemical background matching with the host plant protects Guayaquila xiphias treehoppers against predaceous Camponotus crassus ants, regardless of honeydew supply. Ant predation is increased when treehoppers are transferred to a nonhost plant with which they have low chemical similarity. Palatable moth larvae manipulated to match the chemical background of Guayaquila's host plant attracted lower numbers of predatory ants than unchanged controls. Although aggressive tending ants can protect honeydew-producing hemipterans from natural enemies, they may prey on the trophobionts under shortage of alternative food resources.

The most popular semantic similarity methods are implemented and evaluated using WordNet and MeSH. Building upon semantic similarity we propose the Semantic Similarity based Retrieval Model (SSRM), a novel information retrieval method capable for discovering similarities between documents containing conceptually similar terms. The most effective semantic similarity method is implemented into SSRM. SSRM has been applied in retrieval on OHSUMED (a standard TREC collection available on the Web).

The question of whether blocking exists in olfactory conditioning of proboscis extension reflex (PER) in honeybees is under debate. The last published accounts on blocking in honeybees state that blocking occurs when odors A and B are similar (the \"similarity hypothesis\"). We have tested this hypothesis using four odors (1-octanol, 1-nonanol, eugenol, and limonene) chosen on the basis of their chemical and physiological similarity (experiment 1). We established a generalization matrix that measured perceptual similarity. Bees in the \"block group\" were first trained with an odor A and, in the second phase, with the mixture AB. Bees in the \"novel group\" (control group) were first trained with an odor N and, in the second phase, with the mixture AB. After conditioning, bees in both groups were tested for their response to B. We assayed all 24 possible combinations for the four odors standing for A, B, and N. We found blocking in four cases, augmentation in two cases, and no difference in 18 cases; odor similarity could not account for these results. We also repeated the experiments with those six odor combinations that gave rise to the similarity hypothesis (experiment 2: 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, geraniol) and found augmentation in one and no effect in five cases. Thus, blocking is not a consistent phenomenon, nor does it depend on odor similarity.",

This paper first analyzes why the cosine similarity is preferred by establishing the connection between the cosine similarity based decision rule in the discriminant analysis framework and the Bayes decision rule for minimum error. The paper then investigates the challenges inherent of the cosine similarity and presents a new similarity that overcomes these challenges. The contributions of the paper are thus three-fold. First, the application of the cosine similarity after discriminant analysis is discovered to have its theoretical roots in the Bayes decision rule. Second, some inherent problems of the cosine similarity such as its inadequacy in addressing distance and angular measures are discussed. Finally, a new similarity measure, which overcomes the problems by integrating the absolute value of the angular measure and the l p norm (the distance measure), is presented to enhance pattern recognition performance. The effectiveness of the proposed new similarity measure in the discriminant analysis framework is evaluated using a large scale, grand challenge problem, namely, the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) problem. Experimental results using 36,818 FRGC images on the most challenging FRGC experiment, the FRGC Experiment 4, show that the new similarity measure improves face recognition performance upon other popular similarity measures, such as the cosine similarity measure, the normalized correlation, and the Euclidean distance measure. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Motivated by geometric intuition and computability, similarity between patterns is proposed to be measured by their included angle in a kernel-induced Hilbert space. Having noticed that the cosine of such an included angle can be represented by a normalized kernel, it can be said that the task of learning similarity is equivalent to learning an appropriate normalized kernel. In addition, an error bound is also established for learning similarity with the multikernel method. Based on this bound, a boosting-style algorithm is developed.

In these calculations, fingerprints of interacting fragments produced significantly higher compound recall than other fingerprints.

As the density gradient quantum similarity integrals are defined as scalar products of three real functions, they appear to possess a richer structure than the corresponding positive definite density overlap quantum similarity measures, while preserving the overall similarity trends, when the molecular frames are relatively moved in three-dimensional space. Similarity indices are also studied when simple cases are analyzed in order to perform more comparisons with density overlap quantum similarity.

The reference set is very general and can be made of molecules from, for example, the set of test molecules itself (the self-referencing case), from a small library or large compound collection, or from actives in a given assay or group of assays. The test set is any collection of compounds to be analyzed with respect to the specified reference set.

They often encounter difficulties when dealing with classes that have large nonlinear variability, especially when the variability is structural or due to articulation. It is well-known that shape representation based on skeletons is superior to contour based representation in such situations. However, approaches to shape similarity based on skeletons suffer from the instability of skeletons, and matching of skeleton graphs is still an open problem. Using a new skeleton pruning method, we are able to obtain stable pruned skeletons even in the presence of significant contour distortions. We also propose a new method for matching of skeleton graphs. In contrast to most existing methods, it does not require converting of skeleton graphs to trees and it does not require any graph editing. Shape classification is done with Bayesian classifier. We present excellent classification results for complete shapes.",

Algorithms that are adapted from spatial join techniques are designed primarily for data in a vector space and often employ some form of a multidimensional index. For these algorithms, when the data lies in ametric space, the usual solution is to embed the data in vector space and then make use of a multidimensional index. Such an approach has a number of drawbacks when the data is high dimensional as we must eventually find the most discriminating dimensions, which is not trivial. In addition, although the maximum distance between objects increases with dimension, the ability to discriminate between objects in each dimension does not. These drawbacks are overcome via the introduction of a new method called Quickjoin that does not require a multidimensional index and instead adapts techniques used in distance-based indexing for use in amethod that is concep- tually similar to the Quicksort algorithm. A formal analysis is provided of the Quickjoin method. Experiments show that the Quickjoin method significantly outperforms two existing techniques.",

Similarity in the perceiver's and target's self-ratings of personality was related to experienced similarity. However, distinctive similarity (beyond the level of similarity expected between randomly paired individuals) in personality showed negligible associations with experienced similarity. Experienced similarity was strongly related to similarity in perceiver's self-ratings and their ratings of a target, and especially when that target has a personality profile that was normative or desirable. Exploratory analyses provided some indications that similarity in aspects of extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness might be particularly important to the experience of being similar. The findings thus suggest that a perceiver's experience of being similar to a target person is particularly associated with seeing the other person positively, but does not particularly indicate that one is actually much more similar to this person than chance in most circumstances unless the perceiver and target are very well-acquainted. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Let P be a poset, and let A be an element of its strict incidence algebra. Saks (SIAM J. Algebraic Discrete Methods 1 (1980) 211\u2013215; Discrete Math. 59 (1986) 135\u2013166) and Gansner (SIAM J. Algebraic Discrete Methods 2 (1981) 429\u2013440) proved that the kth Dilworth number of P is less than or equal to the dimension of the nullspace of Ak, and that there is some member of the strict incidence algebra of P for which equality is attained (for all k simultaneously). In this paper we focus attention on the question of when equality is attained with the strict zeta matrix, and proceed under a particular random poset model. We provide an invariant depending only on two measures of nonunimodality of the level structure for the poset that, with probability tending to 1 as the smallest level tends to infinity, takes on the same value as the inequality gap between the width of P and the dimension of the nullspace of its strict zeta matrix. In particular, we characterize the level structures for which the width of P is, with probability tending to 1, equal to the dimension of the nullspace of its strict zeta matrix. As a consequence, by the Kleitman\u2013Rothschild Theorem 5, almost all posets in the Uniform random poset model have width equal to the dimension of the nullspace of their zeta matrices. We hope this is a first step toward a complete characterization of when equality holds in Saks\u2019 and Gansner's inequality for the strict zeta matrix and for all k. New to this paper are also the canonical representatives of the poset similarity classes (where two posets are said to be similar if their strict zeta matrices are similar in the matrix-theoretic sense), and these form the setting for our work on Saks\u2019 and Gansner's inequalities. (Also new are two functions that measure the nonunimodality of a sequence of real numbers.)",

        "abstract": "Genomics has contributed to a growing collection of gene-function and gene-disease annotations that can be exploited by informatics to study similarity between diseases. This can yield insight into disease etiology, reveal common pathophysiology and/or suggest treatment that can be appropriated from one disease to another. Estimating disease similarity solely on the basis of shared genes can be misleading as variable combinations of genes may be associated with similar diseases, especially for complex diseases. This deficiency can be potentially overcome by looking for common biological processes rather than only explicit gene matches between diseases. The use of semantic similarity between biological processes to estimate disease similarity could enhance the identification and characterization of disease similarity. We present functions to measure similarity between terms in an ontology, and between entities annotated with terms drawn from the ontology, based on both co-occurrence and information content. The similarity measure is shown to outperform other measures used to detect similarity. A manually curated dataset with known disease similarities was used as a benchmark to compare the estimation of disease similarity based on gene-based and Gene Ontology (GO) process-based comparisons. The detection of disease similarity based on semantic similarity between GO Processes (Recall = 55%, Precision = 60%) performed better than using exact matches between GO Processes (Recall = 29%, Precision = 58%) or gene overlap (Recall = 88% and Precision = 16%). The GO-Process based disease similarity scores on an external test set show statistically significant Pearson correlation (0.73) with numeric scores provided by medical residents. GO-Processes associated with similar diseases were found to be significantly regulated in gene expression microarray datasets of related diseases. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "The distinction between rules and similarity is central to our understanding of much of cognitive psychology. Two aspects of existing research have motivated the present work. First, in different cognitive psychology areas we typically see different conceptions of rules and similarity; for example, rules in language appear to be of a different kind compared to rules in categorization. Second, rules processes are typically modeled as separate from similarity ones; for example, in a learning experiment, rules and similarity influences would be described on the basis of separate models. In the present article, I assume that the rules versus similarity distinction can be understood in the same way in learning, reasoning, categorization, and language, and that a unified model for rules and similarity is appropriate. A rules process is considered to be a similarity one where only a single or a small subset of an object's properties are involved. Hence, rules and overall similarity operations are extremes in a single continuum of similarity operations. It is argued that this viewpoint allows adequate coverage of theory and empirical findings in learning, reasoning, categorization, and language, and also a reassessment of the objectives in research on rules versus similarity.",

Several approaches can be adopted at each stage of the product life to achieve the goal of green chemistry. The chapter lists certain industries that need to go green. Finally, it states that the replacement of the chemical step with a biocatalytic step is the first move toward green chemistry. This is followed by replacing the entire multiple-step process with a single fermentation process. The introduction of green chemistry has resulted in about 140 million pounds of hazardous substances not being produced in the United States each year. It has saved more than 55 million gallons of process water, prevented 57 million pounds of carbon dioxide emissions, and prevented formation of 3 billion pounds of hazardous waste per year.",

        "abstract": "Modeling proximity search problems as a metric space provides a general framework usable in many areas, like pattern recognition, web search, clustering, data mining, knowledge management, textual and multimedia information retrieval, to name a few. Metric indexes have been improved over the years and many instances of the problem can be solved efficiently. However, when very large/high dimensional metric databases are indexed exact approaches are not yet capable of solving efficiently the problem, the performance in these circumstances is degraded to almost sequential search. To overcome the above limitation, non-exact proximity searching algorithms can be used to give answers that either in probability or in an approximation factor are close to the exact result. Approximation is acceptable in many contexts, specially when human judgement about closeness is involved. In vector spaces, on the other hand, there is a very successful approach dubbed Locality Sensitive Hashing which consist in making a succinct representation of the objects. This succinct representation is relatively insensitive to small variations of the locality. Unfortunately, the hashing function have to be carefully designed, very close to the data model, and different functions are used when objects come from different domains. In this paper we give a new schema to encode objects in a general metric space with a uniform framework, independent from the data model. Finally, we provide experimental support to our claims using several real life databases with different data models and distance functions obtaining excellent results in both the speed and the recall sense, specially for large databases.",

        "title": "Beyond the bag-of-words paradigm to enhance information retrieval applications",
        "abstract": "The typical IR-approach to indexing, clustering, classification and retrieval, just to name a few, is the one based on the bag-of-words paradigm. It eventually transforms a text into an array of terms, possibly weighted (with tf-idf scores or derivatives), and then represents that array via points in highly-dimensional space. It is therefore syntactical and unstructured, in the sense that different terms lead to different dimensions. Co-occurrence detection and other processing steps have been thus proposed (see e.g. LSI, Spectral analysis [7]) to identify the existence of those relations, but yet everyone is aware of the limitations of this approach especially in the expanding context of short (and thus poorly composed) texts, such as the snippets of search-engine results, the tweets of a Twitter channel, the items of a news feed, the posts of a blog, or the advertisement messages, etc.. A good deal of recent work is attempting to go beyond this paradigm by enriching the input text with additional structured annotations. This general idea has been declined in the literature in two distinct ways. One consists of extending the classic term-based vector-space model with additional dimensions corresponding to features (concepts) extracted from an external knowledge base, such as DMOZ, Wikipedia, or even the whole Web (see e.g. [4, 5, 12]). The pro of this approach is to extend the bag-of-words scheme with more concepts, thus possibly allowing the identification of related texts which are syntactically far apart. The cons resides in the contamination of these vectors by un-related (but common) concepts retrieved via the syntactic queries. The second way consists of identifying in the input text short-and-meaningful sequences of terms (aka spots) which are then connected to unambiguous concepts drawn from a catalog. The catalog can be formed by either a small set of specifically recognized types, most often People and Locations (aka Named Entities, see e.g. [13, 14]), or it can consists of millions of concepts drawn from a large knowledge base, such as Wikipedia. This latter catalog is ever-expanding and currently offers the best trade-off between a catalog with a rigorous structure but with low coverage (like WordNet, CYC, TAP), and a large text collection with wide coverage but unstructured and noised content (like the whole Web). To understand how this annotation works, let us consider the following short news: \"Diego Maradona won against Mexico\". The goal of the annotation is to detect \"Diego Maradona\" and\"Mexico\" as spots, and then hyper-link them with theWikipedia pages which deal with the ex Argentina's coach and the football team of Mexico. The annotator uses as spots the anchor texts which occur in Wikipedia pages, and as possible concepts for each spot the (possibly many) pages pointed in Wikipedia by that spot/anchor | \"Diego Maradona\" is the name of two persons and \"Mexico\" points to 154 different pages in Wikipedia. . The annotator then selects among the potentially many available mappings (spot-to-page) the most pertinent ones by finding a collective agreement among them via proper scoring functions which need to be computed fast and be accurate in the finally produced annotation. The first work that implemented this structured annotation wasWikify [8], followed by [2]. Recently [6, 10] yielded considerable improvements by proposing several new algorithmic ingredients, the most notable ones were: (i) a measure of relatedness among Wikipedia pages based on the overlap of their in-links [9]; and (ii) the modeling of the process as the search for the annotations that maximize some global score which depends on their coherence/relatedness and other statistics. These ingredients allowed Milne@amp;Witten [10] to achieve an F-measure of 74.8% over long and focused input texts, and Chakrabarti et al [6] to improve the recall by still obtaining comparable precision. Recently Ferragina and Scaiella [3] designed a system, called tagme (available at tagme.di.unipi.it), which adds the specialty that the input texts may be very short, such as the ones arising in the applicative scenarios mentioned above. Of course these poorly composed texts pose other challenges in terms of efficiency and effectiveness of the annotation process, which (1) should be very fast, because in those contexts data may be retrieved at query time and thus cannot be preprocessed, and (2) should be designed properly, because the input texts are so short that it is difficult to mine significant statistics that are rather available when texts are long. Tagme works on-the-fly and outperforms [6, 10]. We believe that this novel annotating technology has implications which go far beyond the enrichment of a text with explanatory links. Its most interesting benefit is the structured knowledge attached to textual fragments that leverages not only a bag of concepts but also the powerful semantic network defined by the Wikipedia links among them. This could allow the efficient and effective resolution of ambiguity and polysemy issues which often occur when operating with the, purely syntactic, bag-of-words paradigm. In this invited talk we will survey the algorithmic technology underlying these annotators and present various interesting algorithmic problems whose solution could allow to make a significant step in designing enhanced IR applications. Among the others, we will comment on the on-the-fly labeled clustering of search-engine results (see also Clusty.com, Carrot2 [11], and the survey [1]), and sketch the application to concept-based classification of texts and Web Advertising.

UNITY 2D fingerprints are also used to provide a comparison with a more traditional approach to similarity searching, and similarity based on simple whole-molecule properties is used to provide a baseline for the more sophisticated searches. Overall, UNITY 2D fingerprints and ROCS with the chemical force field option gave comparable performance and were superior to the shape-only 3D methods. When the flexible methods were compared with the rigid methods, it was generally found that the flexible methods gave slightly better results than their respective rigid methods; however, the increased performance did not justify the additional computational cost required.",

We develop two new asymmetric measures: HFM and HIPM. The HFM and HIPM are derived from cosine function and proportion function by combining asymmetric similarity concept with HFV. The HFV is to truncate the original full frequency vector to a short vector. We can adjust the parameter of HFV to balance the model's performance.

This paper introduces a new molecular similarity method, termed morphological similarity (MS), that addresses the apparent paradox. Two sets of molecule pairs are identified from a set of ligands whose protein-bound states are known crystallographically. Pairs that bind the same protein sites form the first set, and pairs that bind different sites from the second. MS is shown to separate the two sets significantly better than a benchmark 2D similarity technique. Further, MS agrees with crystallographic observation of bound ligand states, independent of information about bound states. MS is efficient to compute and can be practically applied to large libraries of compounds.",

        "abstract": "Similarity also plays a crucial role in support vector machines. Similarity assessment plays a key role in lazy learning methods such as k -nearest neighbor or case-based reasoning. In this paper we will show how refinement graphs, that were originally introduced for inductive learning, can be employed to assess and reason about similarity. We will define and analyze two similarity measures, S \u03bb and S \u03c0 , based on refinement graphs. The anti-unification-based similarity , S \u03bb , assesses similarity by finding the anti-unification of two instances, which is a description capturing all the information common to these two instances. The property-based similarity , S \u03c0 , is based on a process of disintegrating the instances into a set of properties , and then analyzing these property sets. Moreover these similarity measures are applicable to any representation language for which a refinement graph that satisfies the requirements we identify can be defined. Specifically, we present a refinement graph for feature terms, in which several languages of increasing expressiveness can be defined. The similarity measures are empirically evaluated on relational data sets belonging to languages of different expressiveness.",

In traditional patch-based methods, such as the NL-means method, block matching mainly depends on structure similarity. The homogeneity similarity is defined in adaptive weighted neighborhoods, which can find more similar points than the structure similarity, and so it is more effective, especially for points with less repetitive patterns, such as corner and end points. Comparative results on synthetic and real image denoising indicate that our method can effectively remove noise and preserve effective information, such as edges and contrast, while avoiding artifacts. The application on medical image denoising also demonstrates that our method is practical.",

Furthermore, the concept of partial preference similarity based on a machine learning model is presented. For evaluation the cold-start behavior of the presented classification-based similarity metrics is evaluated in a large-scale experiment.

In this paper, we propose a similarity measure to resolve the interoperability issue by using a similarity graph.

A profile approach to issues such as personality judgment, personality similarity, behavioral consistency, developmental stability, and person-environment fit is intuitively appealing. However, it entails conceptual and statistical challenges arising from the overlap among profile similarity and normativeness, which presents potential confounds and potential opportunities. This article describes the normativeness problem, articulating the need to evaluate profile similarity alongside normativeness and distinctiveness. It presents conceptual and psychometric foundations of a framework differentiating these elements for pairs of profiles. It derives two models from this framework, and it discusses the application of their components to a variety of research domains. Finally, it presents recommendations and implications regarding the use of these components and profile similarity more generally. This approach can reveal and manage potential confounds, and it can provide theoretical insights that might otherwise be overlooked.",

After optimizing the contribution of nonisomorphic distance to the new graph similarity, predictive models built with approximate similarity matrixes show higher predictive ability than those using traditional similarity matrixes. The new method has been applied to the prediction of steroids binding to the corticosteroid globulin receptor.

Psychologists, however, routinely analyse the success of mental representations for guiding behaviour in terms of a similarity between representation and the world. I provide a foundation for this practice by developing a philosophically responsible account of the relationship between similarity and representation in natural systems. I analyse similarity in terms of the existence of a suitable homomorphism between two structures. The key insight is that by restricting attention to only those homomorphisms induced by causal processes, we can solve two philosophical problems with a single assumption. First, causal structure provides an adequate source for the bias required to ensure the similarity relation is non-trivial; second, it provides an adequate source for the directionality required to move from similarity to representation. I defend this account against objections by Goodman and van Fraassen and demonstrate that it is indeed the account of similarity's role in representation assumed by psychological practice.",

This work explores experimental control landscapes expressing the yields of dissociative ionization products from halogenated hydrocarbons in terms of three control variables specifying a polynomial expansion of the spectral phase of the ultrafast laser pulse. Many of the landscapes in this work exhibit features predicted by control landscape theory, including a lack of suboptimal extrema, i.e., \"traps\" and the presence of connected optimal level sets, i.e., continuously varying values of the control variables that produce an optimal objective yield. Placing significant constraints on the control resources, particularly by limiting the laser pulse energy, was found to distort the underlying landscape topology. The control landscapes from a diverse, yet related family of halogenated hydrocarbons are shown to possess similar features, reflecting the chemical similarity of the compounds.",

In this study we present three novel hAQP1 blockers that have been identified by virtual screening and inhibit water flux through hAQP1 in Xenopus laevis oocyte swelling assays at low micromolar concentrations. The newly discovered compounds display no chemical similarity to hitherto known hAQP1 blockers and bind at the extracellular entrance of the channel, close to the ar/R selectivity filter. Furthermore, mutagenesis studies showed that Lys36, which is not conserved among the hAQP family, is crucially involved in binding and renders the discovered compounds suitable as leads for the development of selective hAQP1 inhibitors.",

This method allows a large data reduction while retaining relevant information, and the data-derived factors used to quantify phenotype have discernable biological meaning. We used factor analysis of cells stained with fluorescent markers of cell cycle state to profile a compound library and cluster the hits into seven phenotypic categories.

In MDS, similarity is intimately connected to the idea of a geometric representation of stimuli in a perceptual space. Whilst connecting similarity and closeness of stimuli in a geometric representation may be intuitively plausible, Tversky and Gati [Tversky, A., & Gati, I. (1982). Similarity, separability, and the triangle inequality. Psychological Review, 89(2), 123-154] have reported data which are inconsistent with the usual geometric representations that are based on segmental additivity. We show that similarity measures based on Shepard's universal law of generalization [Shepard, R. N. (1987). Toward a universal law of generalization for psychologica science. Science, 237(4820), 1317-1323] lead to an inner product representation in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In such a space stimuli are represented by their similarity to all other stimuli. This representation, based on Shepard's law, has a natural metric that does not have additive segments whilst still retaining the intuitive notion of connecting similarity and distance between stimuli. Furthermore, this representation has the psychologically appealing property that the distance between stimuli is bounded. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

We quantitatively measured the relationship between the similarity order induced by the indexes and perceived similarity. In contrast to previous evaluation approaches, we objectively measured similarity both for the few best-matching images and also for relatively distinct images. The results show that, to a large degree, the rank orders induced by the indexes predict the perceived similarity between images. The highest index concordance employing a single index was obtained using the chromaticity histogram. Combining different information sources substantially improved the correspondence with the observers. We conclude that image-indexing systems can provide useful measures for perceptual image similarity.

The colour similarity argument assumes that if colour physicalism is true, then colour similarities should be scrutable under standard physical descriptions of surface reflectance properties such as their spectral reflectance curves. Given this assumption, our evident failure to find such similarities at the reducing level seemingly proves fatal to colour physicalism. I argue that we should dispense with this assumption, and thus endorse the inscrutability of colour similarity. This strategy is inspired by parallels between the colour similarity argument and the explanatory gap between mind and body made vivid by Jackson's (1986) knowledge argument, and in particular by type-B physicalist responses to that argument. This inscrutability response is further motivated by cases in chemistry and biochemistry in which analogous scrutability theses fail to hold. Along the way, I present a challenge to standard formulations of the colour similarity argument based on the extreme context sensitivity of the similarity relation. Most presentations of the argument fail to control for such contextual variation, which raises the distinct possibility that the argument equivocates on the similarity relation across its premises. Although ultimately inconclusive, this context challenge forces a significant reformulation of the colour similarity argument, and highlights the need for much greater care in handling claims about colour similarity. \u00a9 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

In traditional patch-based methods, such as the NL-means method, block matching mainly depends on structure similarity. The homogeneity similarity is defined in adaptive weighted neighborhoods, which can find more similar points than the structure similarity, and so it is more effective, especially for points with less repetitive patterns, such as corner and end points. Comparative results on synthetic and real image denoising indicate that ourmethod can effectively remove noise and preserve effective information, such as edges and contrast, while avoiding artifacts. The application on medical image denoising also demonstrates that our method is practical.",

        "abstract": "How are odor mixtures perceived? We take a behavioral approach toward this question, using associative odor-recognition experiments in Drosophila. We test how strongly flies avoid a binary mixture after punishment training with one of its constituent elements and how much, in turn, flies avoid an odor element if it had been a component of a previously punished binary mixture. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that we first adjust odors for task-relevant behavioral potency, that is, for equal learnability. Doing so, we find that 1) generalization between mixture and elements is symmetrical and partial, 2) elements are equally similar to all mixtures containing it and that 3) mixtures are equally similar to both their constituent elements. As boundary conditions for the applicability of these rules, we note that first, although variations in learnability are small and remain below statistical cut-off, these variations nevertheless correlate with the elements' perceptual \"weight\" in the mixture; thus, even small differences in learnability between the elements have the potential to feign mixture asymmetries. Second, the more distant the elements of a mixture are to each other in terms of their physicochemical properties, the more distant the flies regard the elements from the mixture. Thus, titrating for task-relevant behavioral potency and taking into account physicochemical relatedness of odors reveals rules of mixture perception that, maybe surprisingly, appear to be fairly simple.",

(ii) The scaling relation: ratio \u03bbij is equal to (dYi/dz)/(dYj/dz). (iii) Global similarity: ratio (\u2202Yi/\u2202pk)/(\u2202Yi/\u2202pm) is constant in a range of the independent variable z. It is shown that the existence of low-dimensional slow manifolds in chemical kinetic systems may cause local similarity. The scaling relation is present if the dynamics of the system is controlled by a one-dimensional slow manifold. The rank of the local sensitivity matrix is less than or equal to the dimension of the slow manifold. Global similarity emerges if local similarity is present and the sensitivity differential equations are pseudohomogeneous. Global similarity means that the effect of the simultaneous change of several parameters can be fully compensated for all Variables, in a wide range of the independent Variable by changing a single parameter. Therefore, the presence of global similarity has far-reaching practical consequences for the \u201cvalidation\u201d of complex reaction mechanisms, for parameter estimation in chemical kinetic systems, and in the explanation of the robustness of many self-regulating systems.",

By conducting four case studies, we have demonstrated the superiority of the CW-SSIM index against other indices (e.g., Dice, Hausdorff distance) commonly used for assessing the similarity of a given pair of images. In addition, we show that the CW-SSIM index has a number of advantages. It is robust to small rotations and translations. It provides useful comparisons even without a preprocessing image registration step, which is essential for other indices. Moreover, it is computationally less expensive. ER  -",

For example, complex molecules tend to produce fingerprints with higher bit density than simple ones, which often leads to artificially high similarity values in search calculations. We introduce here a variant of the Tversky coefficient that makes it possible to modulate or eliminate molecular complexity effects when evaluating fingerprint similarity. This has enabled us to study in detail the role of molecular complexity in similarity searching and the relationship between reference and active database compounds. Balancing complexity effects leads to constant distributions of similarity values for reference and database molecules, independent of how compound contributions are weighted. When searching for active compounds with varying complexity, hit rates can be optimized by modulating complexity effects, rather than eliminating them, and adjusting relative compound weights. For reference molecules and active database compounds having different complexity, preferred parameter settings are identified.",

The COSMOsim method therefore introduced a global measure of molecular similarity on the basis of similarity of \u03c3-profiles, but it had the disadvantage of neglecting the 3D distribution of molecular polarities, which is crucially determining all ligand-receptor binding. This disadvantage is now overcome by COSMOsim3D, which is a logical and physically sound extension of the COSMOsim method, which uses local \u03c3-profiles on a spatial grid. This new method is used to measure intermolecular similarities on the basis of the 3D representation of the surface polarization charge densities \u03c3 of the target and the probe molecule. The probe molecule is translated and rotated in space in order to maximize the sum of local \u03c3-profile similarities between target and probe. This sum, the COSMOsim3D similarity, is a powerful descriptor of ligand similarity and allows for a good discrimination between bioisosters and random pairs. Validation experiments using about 600 pharmacological activity classes in the MDDR database are given. Furthermore, COSMOsim3D represents a unique and very robust method for a field-based ligand-ligand alignment.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, ontologies have become a mainstream topic in biomedical research. When biological entities are described using a common schema, such as an ontology, they can be compared by means of their annotations. This type of comparison is called semantic similarity, since it assesses the degree of relatedness between two entities by the similarity in meaning of their annotations. The application of semantic similarity to biomedical ontologies is recent; nevertheless, several studies have been published in the last few years describing and evaluating diverse approaches. Semantic similarity has become a valuable tool for validating the results drawn from biomedical studies such as gene clustering, gene expression data analysis, prediction and validation of molecular interactions, and disease gene prioritization.\\nWe review semantic similarity measures applied to biomedical ontologies and propose their classification according to the strategies they employ: node-based versus edge-based and pairwise versus groupwise. We also present comparative assessment studies and discuss the implications of their results. We survey the existing implementations of semantic similarity measures, and we describe examples of applications to biomedical research. This will clarify how biomedical researchers can benefit from semantic similarity measures and help them choose the approach most suitable for their studies.\\nBiomedical ontologies are evolving toward increased coverage, formality, and integration, and their use for annotation is increasingly becoming a focus of both effort by biomedical experts and application of automated annotation procedures to create corpora of higher quality and completeness than are currently available. Given that semantic similarity measures are directly dependent on these evolutions, we can expect to see them gaining more relevance and even becoming as essential as sequence similarity is today in biomedical research.",

Can one find statistically significant separation between \"active/active\" and \"active/inactive\" spaces? These questions are explored using 734,486 biologically tested chemical structures, 1,389 biological assay data sets, and six different 3-D similarity types utilized by PubChem analysis tools.\\n\\nRESULTS: The similarity value distributions of 269.7 billion unique conformer pairs from 734,486 biologically tested compounds (all-against-all) from PubChem were utilized to help work towards an answer to the question: what is a biologically meaningful 3-D similarity score? The average and standard deviation for the six similarity measures STST-opt, CTST-opt, ComboTST-opt, STCT-opt, CTCT-opt, and ComboTCT-opt were 0.54 \u00b1 0.10, 0.07 \u00b1 0.05, 0.62 \u00b1 0.13, 0.41 \u00b1 0.11, 0.18 \u00b1 0.06, and 0.59 \u00b1 0.14, respectively. Considering that this random distribution of biologically tested compounds was constructed using a single theoretical conformer per compound (the \"default\" conformer provided by PubChem), further study may be necessary using multiple diverse conformers per compound; however, given the breadth of the compound set, the single conformer per compound results may still apply to the case of multi-conformer per compound 3-D similarity value distributions. As such, this work is a critical step, covering a very wide corpus of chemical structures and biological assays, creating a statistical framework to build upon.The second part of this study explored the question of whether it was possible to realize a statistically meaningful 3-D similarity value separation between reputed biological assay \"inactives\" and \"actives\". Using the terminology of noninactive-noninactive (NN) pairs and the noninactive-inactive (NI) pairs to represent comparison of the \"active/active\" and \"active/inactive\" spaces, respectively, each of the 1,389 biological assays was examined by their 3-D similarity score differences between the NN and NI pairs and analyzed across all assays and by assay category types. While a consistent trend of separation was observed, this result was not statistically unambiguous after considering the respective standard deviations. While not all \"actives\" in a biological assay are amenable to this type of analysis, e.g., due to different mechanisms of action or binding configurations, the ambiguous separation may also be due to employing a single conformer per compound in this study. With that said, there were a subset of biological assays where a clear separation between the NN and NI pairs found. In addition, use of combo Tanimoto (ComboT) alone, independent of superposition optimization type, appears to be the most efficient 3-D score type in identifying these cases.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This study provides a statistical guideline for analyzing biological assay data in terms of 3-D similarity and PubChem structure-activity analysis tools. When using a single conformer per compound, a relatively small number of assays appear to be able to separate \"active/active\" space from \"active/inactive\" space.",

        "abstract": "Evaporative discharge of regional groundwater from more than 50 playa lakes at the 400 km2 Raak Plain groundwater discharge complex forms a very large reservoir of hypersaline Na+\u2013Mg2+\u2013Cl\u2212\u2013SO42\u2212 type subsurface brine, but very little salt precipitates. The main processes controlling the formation and evolution of brine compositions are: (a) evapo-concentration of the regional groundwater, (b) mixing between the high \u2013 and low \u2013 TDS end-members and (c) subsurface gypsum precipitation. Uniformity in these processes across the entire groundwater discharge complex, coupled with the chemical similarity between the regional groundwater and local recharge sources, has led to remarkably similar brine chemistries and evaporite compositions across Raak Plain. The similarity between the source waters and the ultimate brine compositions indicates that solutes are generally conserved within the system. The greatest variation in groundwater chemistry at Raak Plain was found to occur within the playa lakes, particularly within the top 1\u20132 m of the subsurface brine body, rather than amongst the different lakes. This small-scale variability is a result of 1) advective and diffusive mixing between the hypersaline shallow (< 3 m below ground surface) brines and the less saline underlying groundwaters, 2) the transient precipitation and re-dissolution of surface salt efflorescences, and 3) differential diffusion rates of the various solutes over long time scales (> 20 kyr).",

It uses recurrence plot analysis to characterize patterns of repetition in the feature sequence, and the normalized compression distance, a practical approximation of the joint Kolmogorov complexity, to measure the pairwise similarity between the plots. By measuring the distance between intermediate representations of signal structure, the proposed method departs from common approaches to music structure analysis which assume a block-based model of music, and thus concentrate on segmenting and clustering sections. The approach ensures that global structure is consistently and robustly characterized in the presence of tempo, instrumentation, and key changes, while the used metric provides a simple to compute, versatile and robust alternative to common approaches in music similarity research. Finally, experimental results demonstrate success at characterizing similarity, while contributing an optimal parameterization of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Detecting that two images are different is faster for highly dissimilar images than for highly similar images. Paradoxically, we showed that the reverse occurs when people are asked to describe how two images differ--that is, to state a difference between two images. Following structure-mapping theory, we propose that this disassociation arises from the multistage nature of the comparison process. Detecting that two images are different can be done in the initial (local-matching) stage, but only for pairs with low overlap; thus, \"different\" responses are faster for low-similarity than for high-similarity pairs. In contrast, identifying a specific difference generally requires a full structural alignment of the two images, and this alignment process is faster for high-similarity pairs. We described four experiments that demonstrate this dissociation and show that the results can be simulated using the Structure-Mapping Engine. These results pose a significant challenge for nonstructural accounts of similarity comparison and suggest that structural alignment processes play a significant role in visual comparison.",

In this paper we propose an approach that uses a combination of morpho-syntactic and semantic similarity measures without using any external linguistic resources to mine tag pairs that can be reduced to base tags. Our approach is based on the Levenshtein distance for morpho-syntactic similarity and tag signatures for semantic similarity. The evaluation of our approach, based on a data set crawled from Delicious, shows that we are able to recognize a wide range of linguistic variations with high quality.",

The algorithm is implemented by an efficient max-heap data structure and runs in nearly linear time, thus is capable of dealing with large sparse networks with tens of thousands of nodes. Experiments on synthesized and real-world networks demonstrate that our method is efficient to detect community structures, and the proposed metric is the most suitable one among all the tested similarity indices.",

It is based on conceptual speci\ufb01city, which measures how much a certain concept is relevant in a given context, and on conceptual distance, which introduces di\ufb00erent edge lengths in the ontology graph. We also address the problem of computing similarity between concepts in the presence of implicit classes in ontologies.

This latter phenomenon has been postulated to be related to the imminence of delivery (6). Consistent with the latter hypothesis, women with preterm labor have been found to have a higher concentration of fetal DNA in their plasma (7, 8). These results suggest that circulating fetal DNA concentrations are undergoing a time of flux during the late third trimester, but detailed information on the dynamics of maternal plasma fetal DNA is not available for this stage of gestation.

        "abstract": "A similarity-driven approach to flexible ligand docking is presented. Given a reference ligand or a pharmacophore positioned in the protein active site, the method allows inclusion of a similarity term during docking. Two different algorithms have been implemented, namely, a similarity-penalized docking (SP-DOCK) and a similarity-guided docking (SG-DOCK). The basic idea is to maximally exploit the structural information about the ligand binding mode present in cases where ligand-bound protein structures are available, information that is usually ignored in standard docking procedures. SP-DOCK and SG-DOCK have been derived as modified versions of the program DOCK 4.0, where the similarity program MIMIC acts as a module for the calculation of similarity indices that correct docking energy scores at certain steps of the calculation. SP-DOCK applies similarity corrections to the set of ligand orientations at the end of the ligand incremental construction process, penalizing the docking energy and, thus, having only an effect on the relative ordering of the final solutions. SG-DOCK applies similarity corrections throughout the entire ligand incremental construction process, thus affecting not only the relative ordering of solutions but also actively guiding the ligand docking. The performance of SP-DOCK and SG-DOCK for binding mode assessment and molecular database screening is discussed. When applied to a set of 32 thrombin ligands for which crystal structures are available, SG-DOCK improves the average RMSD by ca. 1 A when compared with DOCK. When those 32 thrombin ligands are included into a set of 1,000 diverse molecules from the ACD, DIV, and WDI databases, SP-DOCK significantly improves the retrieval of thrombin ligands within the first 10% of each of the three databases with respect to DOCK, with minimal additional computational cost. In all cases, comparison of SP-DOCK and SG-DOCK results with those obtained by DOCK and MIMIC is performed.",

        "abstract": "Similarity searches based on chemical descriptors have proven extremely useful in aiding large-scale drug screening. Typically an investigator starts with a \"probe\", a drug-like molecule with an interesting biological activity, and searches a database to find similar compounds. In some projects, however, the only known actives are peptides, and the investigator needs to identify drug-like actives. 3D similarity methods are able to help in this endeavor but suffer from the necessity of having to specify the active conformation of the probe, something that is not always possible at the beginning of a project. Also, 3D methods are slow and are complicated by the need to generate low-energy conformations. In contrast, topological methods are relatively rapid and do not depend on conformation. However, unmodified topological similarity methods, given a peptide probe, will preferentially select other peptides from a database. In this paper we show some simple protocols that, if used with a standard topological similarity search method, are sufficient to select nonpeptide actives given a peptide probe. We demonstrate these protocols by using 10 peptide-like probes to select appropriate nonpeptide actives from the MDDR database.",

Early prediction of a drug candidate's hERG channel activity is becoming increasingly important in the drug discovery process because blockade of the hERG channel may lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Using the Tripos Topomer Search technology as compound similarity measure, we query molecules with unknown hERG activity for similar molecules in a set of compounds with known hERG activity. The hERG activity of the query molecule is then predicted based on the hERG activity of its Topomer Search neighbors and their distances to the query molecule. The similarity property principle can be applied with promising performance to predict hERG inhibition as long as there is a high structural overlap between the chemical spaces of the query compounds and the reference data set. We show that this is achievable for database sizes of about 10,000 structurally diverse molecules. In this case topoHERG is a similarity-based hERG classifier, which also acts as a knowledge base for hERG channel inhibition.",

A set of retrospective cross-validation experiments using 20 diverse in-house activity sets were done to find a good discriminator of prediction accuracy as measured by root-mean-square difference between observed and predicted activity. Among the measures we tested, two seem useful: the similarity of the molecule to be predicted to the nearest molecule in the training set and/or the number of neighbors in the training set, where neighbors are those more similar than a user-chosen cutoff. The molecules with the highest similarity and/or the most neighbors are the best-predicted. This trend holds true for narrow training sets and, to a lesser degree, for many diverse training sets and does not depend on which QSAR method or descriptor is used. One may define the similarity using a different descriptor than that used for the QSAR model. The similarity dependence for diverse training sets is somewhat unexpected. It appears to be greater for those data sets where the association of similar activities vs similar structures (as encoded in the Patterson plot) is stronger. We propose a way to estimate the reliability of the prediction of an arbitrary chemical structure on a given QSAR model, given the training set from which the model was derived.",

For each step, we remove five seams, and then calculate the dissimilarity between the original image and its resized one as well as the relative difference of dissimilarity between neighboring steps. According to the relative differences of dissimilarity of all steps, we can assess the degree of distortion of the resized image and conclude the similarity criterion. On the basis of the similarity criterion, we present an effective image-resizing algorithm by combining Seam Carving, Scaling, and Bidirectional Similarity iteration. Before the salient feature gets damaged markedly, we change the resizing method from Seam Carving to Scaling, and resize the image up to the preferred size. Then, we can update the resized image to eliminate artifacts by iterative computations of Bidirectional Similarity measure. Experiments show that, even though the amount of adjustment is large, our algorithm can preserve the important information, local structures, and global visual effect adequately.",

We argue for a renewed focus on similarity as an explanatory concept, by surveying established results and new developments in the theory and methods of similarity-preserving associative lookup and dimensionality reduction-critical components of many cognitive functions, as well as of intelligent data management in computer vision. We focus in particular on the growing family of algorithms that support associative memory by performing hashing that respects local similarity, and on the uses of similarity in representing structured objects and scenes. Insofar as these similarity-based ideas and methods are useful in cognitive modeling and in AI applications, they should be included in the core conceptual toolkit of computational neuroscience. In support of this stance, the present paper (1) offers a discussion of conceptual, mathematical, computational, and empirical aspects of similarity, as applied to the problems of visual object and scene representation, recognition, and interpretation, (2) mentions some key computational problems arising in attempts to put similarity to use, along with their possible solutions, (3) briefly states a previously developed similarity-based framework for visual object representation, the Chorus of Prototypes, along with the empirical support it enjoys, (4) presents new mathematical insights into the effectiveness of this framework, derived from its relationship to locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and to concomitant statistics, (5) introduces a new model, the Chorus of Relational Descriptors (ChoRD), that extends this framework to scene representation and interpretation, (6) describes its implementation and testing, and finally (7) suggests possible directions in which the present research program can be extended in the future.",

These two aspects compose the proposed method named SimG which supports both structure-based and ligand-based strategies. The validity of the proposed method was examined by analyzing the similarity score variation between actives and decoys as well as correlation among distinct reference methods. A retrospective virtual screening test was carried out on DUD data sets, demonstrating that the performance of structure-based shape matching virtual screening in DUD data sets is substantially dependent on some physical properties, especially the solvent-exposure extent of the binding site: The enrichments of targets with less solvent-exposed binding sites generally exceeds that of the one with more solvent-exposed binding sites and even surpasses the corresponding ligand-based virtual screening.",

        "abstract": "RIG-I detects invading viral RNA and activates the transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF3 through the mitochondrial protein MAVS. Here we show that RNA bearing 5'-triphosphate strongly activates the RIG-I-IRF3 signaling cascade in a reconstituted system composed of RIG-I, mitochondria, and cytosol. Activation of RIG-I requires not only RNA but also polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine 63 (K63) of ubiquitin. RIG-I binds specifically to K63-polyubiquitin chains through its tandem CARD domains in a manner that depends on RNA and ATP. Mutations in the CARD domains that abrogate ubiquitin binding also impair RIG-I activation. Remarkably, unanchored K63-ubiquitin chains, which are not conjugated to any target protein, potently activate RIG-I. These ubiquitin chains function as an endogenous ligand of RIG-I in human cells. Our results delineate the mechanism of RIG-I activation, identify CARD domains as a ubiquitin sensor, and demonstrate that unanchored K63-polyubiquitin chains are signaling molecules in antiviral innate immunity.",

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Discovering drug's Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification rules at molecular level is of vital importance to understand a vast majority of drugs action. However, few studies attempt to annotate drug's potential ATC-codes by computational approaches. RESULTS: Here, we introduce drug-target network to computationally predict drug's ATC-codes and propose a novel method named NetPredATC. Starting from the assumption that drugs with similar chemical structures or target proteins share common ATC-codes, our method, NetPredATC, aims to assign drug's potential ATC-codes by integrating chemical structures and target proteins. Specifically, we first construct a gold-standard positive dataset from drugs' ATC-code annotation databases. Then we characterize ATC-code and drug by their similarity profiles and define kernel function to correlate them. Finally, we use a kernel method, support vector machine, to automatically predict drug's ATC-codes. Our method was validated on four drug datasets with various target proteins, including enzymes, ion channels, G-protein couple receptors and nuclear receptors. We found that both drug's chemical structure and target protein are predictive, and target protein information has better accuracy. Further integrating these two data sources revealed more experimentally validated ATC-codes for drugs. We extensively compared our NetPredATC with SuperPred, which is a chemical similarity-only based method. Experimental results showed that our NetPredATC outperforms SuperPred not only in predictive coverage but also in accuracy. In addition, database search and functional annotation analysis support that our novel predictions are worthy of future experimental validation. Conclusion: In conclusion, our new method, NetPredATC, can predict drug's ATC-codes more accurately by incorporating drug-target network and integrating data, which will promote drug mechanism understanding and drug repositioning and discovery.

        "abstract": "A central aim of biological research is to elucidate the many roles of proteins in complex, dynamic living systems; the selective perturbation of protein function is an important tool in achieving this goal. Because chemical perturbations offer opportunities often not accessible with genetic methods, the development of small-molecule modulators of protein function is at the heart of chemical biology research. In this endeavor, the identification of biologically relevant starting points within the vast chemical space available for the design of compound collections is a particularly relevant, yet difficult, task. In this Account, we present our research aimed at linking chemical and biological space to define suitable starting points that guide the synthesis of compound collections with biological relevance. Both protein folds and natural product (NP) scaffolds are highly conserved in nature. Whereas different amino acid sequences can make up ligand-binding sites in proteins with highly similar fold types, differently substituted NPs characterized by particular scaffold classes often display diverse biological activities. Therefore, we hypothesized that (i) ligand-binding sites with similar ligand-sensing cores embedded in their folds would bind NPs with similar scaffolds and (ii) selectivity is ensured by variation of both amino acid side chains and NP substituents. To investigate this notion in compound library design, we developed an approach termed biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS). BIOS employs chem- and bioinformatic methods for mapping biologically relevant chemical space and protein space to generate hypotheses for compound collection design and synthesis. BIOS also provides hypotheses for potential bioactivity of compound library members. On the one hand, protein structure similarity clustering (PSSC) is used to identify ligand binding sites with high subfold similarity, that is, high structural similarity in their ligand-sensing cores. On the other hand, structural classification by scaffold trees (for example, structural classification of natural products or SCONP), when combined with software tools like \u201cScaffold Hunter\u201d, enables the hierarchical structural classification of small-molecule collections in tree-like arrangements, their annotation with bioactivity data, and the intuitive navigation of chemical space. Brachiation (in a manner analogous to tree-swinging primates) within the scaffold trees serves to identify new starting points for the design and synthesis of small-molecule libraries, and PSSC may be used to select potential protein targets. The introduction of chemical diversity in compound collections designed according to the logic of BIOS is essential for the frequent identification of small molecules with diverse biological activities. The continuing development of synthetic methodology, both on solid phase and in solution, enables the generation of focused small-molecule collections with sufficient substituent, stereochemical, and scaffold diversity to yield comparatively high hit rates in biochemical and biological screens from relatively small libraries. BIOS has also allowed the identification of new ligand classes for several different proteins and chemical probes for the study of protein function in cells.",

To assess the influence of task on measured perceptual similarities among odorants and to demonstrate that the systematic similarities observed within homologous odorant series are not task specific, the authors compare 3 different behavioral paradigms for rats (olfactory habituation, generalization, and discrimination). Although overall patterns of odorant similarity are consistent across all 3 of these paradigms, both quantitative measurements of perceptual similarity and comparability with 2-deoxyglucose imaging data from the olfactory bulb are dependent on the specific behavioral tasks used. Thus, behavioral indices of perceptual similarity are affected by task parameters such as learning and reward associations.",

We here demonstrate that reaction of the outermost amino groups on (S)-/(R)-penicillamine-protected gold clusters with ethyl isocyanate readily modifies the chiral surface structure through carbamoylation. Interestingly, the clusters are electrophoretically separated by the size of the surface ligand, not by the size of the gold core, which is revealed by UV-vis, IR, and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy as well as SAXS measurements. The ligand size (or length) is extended through additional reactions of the carbamoylated amino groups with isocyanate, while the chemical similarity in ligand structures is realized by their IR spectral similarity. Optical and chiroptical responses of the separated cluster compounds are thus overall similar to each other, but a close inspection reveals that the ligand size has a small but distinct influence on the chiroptical response of the gold clusters.",

        "abstract": "Structurally similar molecules tend to have similar properties, i.e. closer molecules in the molecular space are more likely to yield similar property values while distant molecules are more likely to yield different values. Based on this principle, we propose the use of a new method that takes into account the high dimensionality of the molecular space, predicting chemical, physical, or biological properties based on the most similar compounds with measured properties. This methodology uses ordinary kriging coupled with three different molecular similarity approaches (based on molecular descriptors, fingerprints, and atom matching) which creates an interpolation map over the molecular space that is capable of predicting properties/activities for diverse chemical data sets. The proposed method was tested in two data sets of diverse chemical compounds collected from the literature and preprocessed. One of the data sets contained dihydrofolate reductase inhibition activity data, and the second molecules for which aqueous solubility was known. The overall predictive results using kriging for both data sets comply with the results obtained in the literature using typical QSPR/QSAR approaches. However, the procedure did not involve any type of descriptor selection or even minimal information about each problem, suggesting that this approach is directly applicable to a large spectrum of problems in QSAR/QSPR. Furthermore, the predictive results improve significantly with the similarity threshold between the training and testing compounds, allowing the definition of a confidence threshold of similarity and error estimation for each case inferred. The use of kriging for interpolation over the molecular metric space is independent of the training data set size, and no reparametrizations are necessary when more compounds are added or removed from the set, and increasing the size of the database will consequentially improve the quality of the estimations. Finally it is shown that this model can be used for checking the consistency of measured data and for guiding an extension of the training set by determining the regions of the molecular space for which new experimental measurements could be used to maximize the model's predictive performance.",

        "abstract": "In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, an online algorithm makes a sequence of choices. In each round it chooses from a time-invariant set of alternatives and receives the payoff associated with this alternative. While the case of small strategy sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on MAB problems with exponentially or infinitely large strategy sets, where one needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In particular, recent literature considered information on similarity between arms. We consider similarity information in the setting of \"contextual bandits\", a natural extension of the basic MAB problem where before each round an algorithm is given the \"context\" - a hint about the payoffs in this round. Contextual bandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on webpages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly simple way to represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a \"similarity distance\" between the context-arm pairs which gives an upper bound on the difference between the respective expected payoffs. Prior work on contextual bandits with similarity uses \"uniform\" partitions of the similarity space, which is potentially wasteful. We design more efficient algorithms that are based on adaptive partitions adjusted to \"popular\" context and \"high-payoff\" arms.",

However, the assessment of automatic semantic measures is limited by the coverage of user studies, which do not scale with the size, heterogeneity, and growth of the Web. Here we propose to leverage human-generated metadata namely topical directories to measure semantic relationships among massive numbers of pairs of Web pages or topics. The Open Directory Project classifies millions of URLs in a topical ontology, providing a rich source from which semantic relationships between Web pages can be derived. While semantic similarity measures based on taxonomies (trees) are well studied, the design of well-founded similarity measures for objects stored in the nodes of arbitrary ontologies (graphs) is an open problem. This paper defines an information-theoretic measure of semantic similarity that exploits both the hierarchical and non-hierarchical structure of an ontology. An experimental study shows that this measure improves significantly on the traditional taxonomy-based approach. This novel measure allows us to address the general question of how text and link analyses can be combined to derive measures of relevance that are in good agreement with semantic similarity. Surprisingly, the traditional use of text similarity turns out to be ineffective for relevance ranking.",

A number of factors which contribute to and may artificially promote this self-similarity are discussed. It is shown that the amplitude of vortex \u201cwandering\u201d (or the random modulations in the vortex trajectory) observed in some experimental measurements are of sufficient amplitude to cause any arbitrary finite and axisymmetric flow structure to collapse with an idealized trailing vortex when scaled on inner parameters. It is further shown that, for the case of an incompletely developed wing-tip vortex, similarity in the outer core region may be an artefact of the rate of roll-up of the vortex sheet. Great care must, therefore, be taken when interpreting experimental measurements of vortex flows.",

        "abstract": "Tools that allow effective information organisation, access and navigation are becoming increasingly important on the Web. Similarity between web pages is a concept that is central to such tools. In this paper, we examine the effect that content and layout-related aspects of web pages have on web page similarity. We consider the textual content contained within common HTML tags, the structural layout of pages, and the query terms contained within pages. Our study shows that combinations of factors can yield more promising results than individual factors, and that different aspects of web pages affect similarities between pages in a different manner. We found a number of factors that, when taken into account, can result in effective measures of similarity between web pages. Query information in particular, proved to be important for the effective organisation of web pages. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",

There are numerous scenarios in which it is necessary to identify the author of a piece of software whose author is unknown, including software forensics investigations, plagiarism detection, and questions of software ownership. A number of methods for authorship attribution of source code have been presented in the past, including two state-of-the-art methods: SCAP and Burrows. Each of these two state-of-the-art methods was individually improved, and \u2013 as presented in this paper \u2013 an ensemble method was developed from them based on the Bayes optimal classifier. An empirical study was performed using a data set consisting of 7,231 open-source and textbook programs written in C++ and Java by thirty unique authors. The ensemble method successfully attributed 98.2% of all documents in the data set, compared to 88.9% by the Burrows baseline method and 91.0% by the SCAP baseline method.",

        "abstract": "In this article, a face recognition algorithm aimed at mimicking the human ability to differentiate people is proposed. For each individual, we first compute a projection line that maximizes his or her dissimilarity to all other people in the user database. Facial identity is thus encoded in the dissimilarity pattern composed by all the projection coefficients of an individual against all other enrolled user identities. Facial recognition is achieved by calculating the dissimilarity pattern of an unknown individual with that of each enrolled user. As the proposed algorithm is composed of different one-dimensional projection lines, it easily allows adding or removing users by simply adding or removing the corresponding projection lines in the system. Ideally, to minimize the influence of these additions/removals, the user group should be representative enough of the general population. Experiments on three widely used databases (XM2VTS, AR and Equinox) show consistently good results. The proposed algorithm achieves Equal Error Rate (EER) and Half-Total Error Rate (HTER) values in the ranges of 0.41-1.67% and 0.1-1.95%, respectively. Our approach yields results comparable to the top two winners in recent contests reported in the literature. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In particular, we show that the Web emerges as the outcome of a number of essentially independent stochastic processes that evolve at various scales. A striking consequence of this scale invariance is that the structure of the Web is \"fractal\"---cohesive subregions display the same characteristics as the Web at large. An understanding of this underlying fractal nature is therefore applicable to designing data services across multiple domains and scales.We describe potential applications of this line of research to optimized algorithm design for Web-scale data analysis.",

        "abstract": "Molecular similarity methods have played a crucial role in the success of structure-based and computer-assisted drug design. However, with the exception of CoMSIA, the current approaches for estimating molecular similarity yield a global picture thereby providing limited information about the local spatial molecular features responsible for the variation of activity with the 3D structure. Application of molecular similarity measures, each related to the functional \"pieces\" of a ligand-receptor complex, is advantageous over a composite molecular similarity alone and will provide more insights to rationally interpret the activity based on the receptor and ligand structural features. Building on the ideas of our previously published methodologies-CoRIA and LISA, we present here a local molecular similarity based receptor dependent QSAR method termed CoRILISA which is a hybrid of the two approaches. The method improves on previous techniques by inclusion of receptor attributes for the calculation and comparison of similarity between molecules. For validation studies, the CoRILISA methodology was applied on three large and diverse data sets-glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb), human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease (HIV PR), and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) inhibitors. The statistics of the CoRILISA models were benchmarked against the standard CoRIA approach and with other published approaches. The CoRILISA models were found to be significantly better, especially in terms of the predictivity for the test set. CoRILISA is able to identify the thermodynamic properties associated with residues that define the active site and modulate the variation in the activity of the molecules. It is a useful tool in the fragment-based drug discovery approach for ligand activity prediction.",

The complete data set is divided into subsets based on 4D-molecular similarity measures using cluster analysis. The compounds in each cluster subset are further divided into a training set and a test set. Predictive QASAR models are constructed for each cluster subset using the corresponding training sets. These QSAR models best predict test set compounds which are assigned to the same cluster subset, based on the 4D-molecular similarity measures, from which the models are derived. The results suggest that the specific properties governing blood-brain barrier permeability may vary across chemically diverse compounds. Partitioning compounds into chemically similar classes is essential to constructing predictive blood-brain barrier penetration models embedding the corresponding key physiochemical properties of a given chemical class.",

The dependence between temperature and runoff, and chemical weathering is complicated by other factors such as the presence/depth of soil cover. Soil cover favors chemical weathering when it is thin and rich in weatherable minerals. In contrast, it reduces chemical weathering when is thick and poor in primary minerals. Processes that increase the contact time and the surface of the water-rock interactions such as physical denudation, increase chemical weathering rates in granitic environments. The effect of temperature can be quantified assuming an apparent activation energy value of 48.7 kJ/mol to describe chemical weathering of silica in granitic crystalline environment under high runoff conditions. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Studies reporting a similarity advantage have used simple stimuli whose similar- ity varied along a featural continuum. Studies reporting a sim- ilarity disadvantage have used complex stimuli from either a single or multiple categories. To elucidate stimulus conditions for similarity effects in visual working memory, we tested memory for complex stimuli (faces) whose similarity varied along a morph continuum. Participants encoded 3 morphs generated from a single face identity in the similar condition, or 3 morphs generated from different face identities in the dissimilar condition. After a brief delay, a test face appeared at one of the encoding locations for participants to make a same/different judgment. Two experiments showed that simi- larity enhanced memory accuracy without changing the re- sponse criterion. These findings support previous computa- tional models that incorporate featural variance as a compo- nent of working memory load.

Mental processes involved in the perception of musical similarity may be an integral part of the functional logic of music composition and thus underly important aspects of musical experience. How much and in what ways can musical materials be varied and still be considered as perceptually related or as belonging to the same category? The notions of musical material, musical variation, perceptual similarity and invariance, and form-bearing dimensions are considered in this light. Recent work on similarity perception has demonstrated that the transformation space for a given musical material is limited by several factors ranging from degree of match of the values of auditory attributes of the events composing the sequences to their relations of various levels of abstraction and to the degree that the transformation respects the grammar of the musical system within which the material was composed. These notions and results are considered in the light of future directions of research, particularly concerning the role of similarity and invariance in the understanding of musical form during listening.",

This paper presents a high level description of the lazar framework and discusses the performance of example classification and regression models.",

        "abstract": "Long-range chemical communication takes place over micrometer distance within different biological organisms and biomimetic chemical micro-compartments). A proper model for studying this phenomenon could rely on three features, namely (i) the compartmentalization of chemical information (using microfluidics), (ii) a stable emitter of periodic chemical signals inside compartments (Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky oscillating reaction) and (iii) a suitable spatio-temporal monitoring of the emitted chemical signal. In this paper we study chemical transmission across the interface between two immiscible liquids, eventually in the presence of lipid, by local electrochemical probing. We show that chemical information is transmitted either by direct transfer of redox active species and or by interfacial electron transfer. Insights obtained by electrochemical measurements, together with numerical simulations, are then used to transpose the communication across a phospholipid bilayer among oscillators compartmentalized in liposomes and dispersed in a water medium. The procedure for the successful generation of these cell-like compartments through microfluidics is reported here for the first time.",

This metric, phylogenetic community dissimilarity (PCD), can be partitioned into two components, a nonphylogenetic component that reflects shared species between communities (analogous to S\u00f8rensen' s similarity metric) and a phylogenetic component that reflects the evolutionary relationships among nonshared species. Therefore, even if a species is not shared between two communities, it will increase the similarity of the two communities if it is phylogenetically related to species in the other community. We illustrate PCD with data on fish and aquatic macrophyte communities from 59 temperate lakes. Dissimilarity between fish communities associated with environmental differences between lakes often has a phylogenetic component, whereas this is not the case for macrophyte communities. With simulations, we then compare PCD with two other metrics of phylogenetic community similarity, II(ST) and UniFrac. Of the three metrics, PCD was best at identifying environmental drivers of community dissimilarity, showing lower variability and greater statistical power. Thus, PCD is a statistically powerful metric that separates the effects of environmental drivers on compositional versus phylogenetic components of community structure.",

A new set of distance measures are derived from the harmonic distance, the geometric distance, and their generalized variants according to the Maximum Likelihood theory. These measures can provide a more accurate feature model than the classical Euclidean and Manhattan distances. We also find that the feature elements are often from heterogeneous sources that may have different influence on similarity estimation. Therefore, the assumption of single isotropic distribution model is often inappropriate. To alleviate this problem, we use a boosted distance measure framework that finds multiple distance measures which fit the distribution of selected feature elements best for accurate similarity estimation. The new distance measures for similarity estimation are tested on two applications: stereo matching and motion tracking in video sequences. The performance of boosted distance measure is further evaluated on several benchmark data sets from the UCI repository and two image retrieval applications. In all the experiments, robust results are obtained based on the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "\u2014The problem of similarity learning is relevant to many data mining applications, such as recommender systems, classification, and retrieval. This problem is particularly challeng-ing in the context of networks, which contain different aspects such as the topological structure, content, and user supervision. These different aspects need to be combined effectively, in order to create a holistic similarity function. In particular, while most similarity learning methods in networks such as SimRank utilize the topological structure, the user supervision and content are rarely considered. In this paper, a Factorized Similarity Learning (FSL) is proposed to integrate the link, node content, and user supervision into an uniform framework. This is learned by using matrix factorization, and the final similarities are approximated by the span of low rank matrices. The proposed framework is further extended to a noise-tolerant version by adopting a hinge-loss alternatively. To facilitate efficient computation on large scale data, a parallel extension is developed. Experiments are conducted on the DBLP and CoRA datasets. The results show that FSL is robust, efficient, and outperforms the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "As the core of the Energy-Minimization Multi-Scale (EMMS) approach, the so-called stability condition has been proposed to reflect the compromise between different dominant mechanisms and believed to be indispensable for understanding the complex nature of gas-solid fluidization systems. This approach was recently extended to the study of gas-liquid bubble columns. In this article, we try to analyze the intrinsic similarity between gas-solid and gas-liquid systems by using the EMMS approach. First, the model solution spaces for the two systems are depicted through a unified numerical solution strategy, so that we are able to find three structural hierarchies in the EMMS model for gas-solid systems. This may help to understand the roles of cluster diameter correlation and stability condition. Second, a common characteristic of gas-solid and gas-liquid systems can be found by comparing the model solutions for the two systems, albeit structural parameters and stability criteria are specific in each system: two local minima of the micro-scale energy dissipation emerges simultaneously in the solution space of structure parameters, reflecting the compromise of two different dominant mechanisms. They may share an equal value at a critical condition of operating conditions, and the global minimum may shift from one to the other when the operating condition changes. As a result, structure parameters such as voidage or gas hold-up exhibit a jump change due to this shift, leading to dramatic structure variation and hence regime transition of these systems. This demonstrates that it is the stability condition that drives the structure variation and system evolution, which may be the intrinsic similarity of gas-solid and gas-liquid systems. ?? 2012 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).",

Phys. 124 (2006) 194106] and apply it in order to approximate the similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian in both traditional and unitary coupled cluster theory. The equilibrium bond distance, harmonic vibrational frequency, and anharmonic constant of H 2, HF, N 2, CuH, and Cu 2 were computed using the coupled cluster approach with single and double excitations (CCSD) and CCSD with the RSC approximation of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian (CCSD-RSC). Our results demonstrate that the RSC approximation introduces substantial errors in the estimates of molecular properties. The leading pejorative effects of the RSC approximation can be traced back to the imbalanced description of diagrams arising from the term 12H,T 2,T 2. Following this analysis we consider a modified RSC scheme correct to fourth-order in the energy, which is found to reproduce CCSD results more closely. The RSC scheme is also applied in conjunction with the state-specific multireference coupled cluster approach of Mukherjee and co-workers [U.S. Mahapatra, B. Datta, D. Mukherjee, J. Chem. Phys. 110 (1999) 6171] to compute the potential energy curve of the BeH 2 model, the vibrational frequencies of ozone, and the singlet-triplet splitting of p-benzyne. These examples show that the deterioration of the results caused by the RSC scheme is analogous to the one observed in the single-reference case.

Students cannot solve similarity tasks simply by iterating or partitioning a composed unit, strategies typically used on numerical proportional tasks. The transition to thinking proportionally is difficult for students and tremendously challenging for teachers to get across to students. After working with urban middle school students, the authors concluded that understanding similarity was difficult, in part, because opportunities to study proportional reasoning were missing from the mathematics curriculum. These opportunities involved studying the following: (1) simple and complex figures; (2) distortion and proportion; and (3) visual reasoning and more analytical strategies. In this article, the authors describe in depth two different types of classroom activities where these opportunities can arise for students: (1) categorization; and (2) construction. They also provide some specific recommendations about incorporating activities, thereby giving students opportunities to learn about similarity. (ERIC)",

We assess RD by defining a simple coding scheme of psychological transformations for the experimental materials. In two experiments, this \"concrete\" version of RD provides compelling fits of the data and compares favourably with SA. Finally, stepping back from particular models, we argue that perceptual theory suggests that transformations and alignment processes should generally be viewed as complementary, in contrast to the current distinction in the literature. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis was performed using two widely applied two-dimensional (2D) fingerprints that mark opposite ends of the current performance spectrum of these types of fingerprints, i.e., MACCS structural keys and the extended connectivity fingerprint with bond diameter four (ECFP4). For each fingerprint, three nearest neighbor search strategies were applied. On the basis of these search calculations, a similarity search profile of the ChEMBL database was generated. Overall, the fingerprint search campaign was surprisingly successful. In 203 of 266 test cases (\u223c76%), a compound recovery rate of at least 50% was observed with at least the better performing fingerprint and one search strategy. The similarity search profile also revealed several general trends. For example, fingerprint searching was often characterized by an early enrichment of active compounds in database selection sets. In addition, compound activity classes have been categorized according to different similarity search performance levels, which helps to put the results of benchmark calculations into perspective. Therefore, a compendium of activity classes falling into different search performance categories is provided. On the basis of our large-scale investigation, the performance range of state-of-the-art 2D fingerprinting has been delineated for compound data sets directed against a wide spectrum of pharmaceutical targets.",

At the same time, several new similarity measures are proposed and the relationships between some similarity measures are proved. Finally a comparison is made to show the proposed similarity measures are more reasonable than some existing similarity measures in general cases.

        "abstract": "We have developed a method for determination of the similarity of pairs of protein-RNA complexes, which we refer to as SIMA (Similarity by Identity and Motif Alignment). The key element in the SIMA method is the description of the protein-RNA interface in terms of motifs (salt bridges, aromatic stacking interactions, nonaromatic stacks, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen-bonded motifs), in addition to single hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. Based on a pairwise scoring function combining motif alignment with identity of the protein and RNA sequences, we define a SIMA score for any pair of protein-RNA complexes. A positive score indicates similarity between the complexes. We used the SIMA method to identify 284 nonredundant binary protein-RNA complexes out of 776 such complexes in 382 nonribosomal protein-RNA structure files obtained from the RCSB database. SIMA allows rapid and quantitative comparison of protein-RNA interfaces and may be useful for interface classification with potential functional and evolutionary implications.",

        "abstract": "The use of small inhibitors' fragment frequencies for understanding kinase potency and selectivity is described. By quantification of differences in the frequency of occurrence of fragments, similarities between small molecules and their targets can be determined. Naive Bayes models employing fragments provide highly interpretable and reliable means for predicting potency in individual kinases, as demonstrated in retrospective tests and prospective selections that were subsequently screened. Statistical corrections for prospective validation allowed us to accurately estimate success rates in the prospective experiment. Selectivity relationships between kinase targets are substantially explained by differences in the fragment composition of actives. By application of fragment similarities to the broader proteome, it is shown that targets related by sequence exhibit similar fragment preferences in small molecules. Of greater interest, certain targets unrelated by sequence are shown to have similar fragment preferences, even when the chemical similarity of ligands active at each target is low.",

Validation of local support vector regression models based on this kernel has been preformed with three publicly available datasets from the DSSTox project.

        "abstract": "Conceptual density functional theory (DFT) offers an elegant way to predict and interpretthe outcome of a chemical reaction in terms of the properties of the reactants. The properties of interest are usually response functions with respect to perturbations, with the perturbations of greatest interest being changes in the external potential, in the number of electrons,... capturing the essential chemical characteristics of the relevant reactive agent. Within DFT, the electron density function \u03c1(r) has always been considered as the (simplest) carrier of information on the system. In recent years, however, the shape function, \u03c3(r) (defined as \u03c1(r)/N, i.e. the density per particle; N being the number of electrons), has been invoked as an even simpler function characterizing a given system. In this contribution, the properties of this function are reviewed. Its importance for understanding molecular structure and reactivity is highlighted, linking variations in the shape function to more conventional reactivity descriptors in {DFT} and providing explicit methods for describing chemical reactivity using the shape function only. Applications in the field of atomic and molecular similarity analysis are given, and a shape function-based analogue of Mezey's holographic electron density theorem is discussed.",

T. pallescens collected from various regions showed a great similarity in their compositions and were characterised by carvacrol (44.4-57.7%), p-cymene (10.3-17.3%) and \u03b3-terpinene (10.8-14.2%) as the major components for four samples; only one sample was thymol-rich (49.3%) with a small amount of carvacrol (9.0%). On the other hand, T. algeriensis showed a chemical polymorphism, even for samples from the same location, and two new chemotypes for this species were proposed. Oxygen-containing monoterpenes were the predominant class (76.3%) in T. dreatensis oil, with linalool (30.4%), thymol (20.2%) and geraniol (19.6%) as the principal constituents. The oils were screened for their possible antioxidant activities by four complementary assays, namely DPPH free radical scavenging, hydroxyl radical scavenging, inhibition of lipid peroxidation and reducing power. The two new chemotypes of T. algeriensis exhibited strong hydroxyl radical scavenging (IC50 = 2.2-3.3 \u03bcg/ml), but were not or only slightly active against the other radicals and exhibited a weak reducing power. Despite their chemical similarity, T. pallescens oils sometimes produced significant differences in their antioxidant activities. The essential oils were also screened for their antimicrobial activity against five bacteria (three Gram-positive and two Gram-negative) and one yeast (Candida albicans). The tested essential oils showed antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms used, in particular against two important pathogens, C. albicans and Helicobacter pylori. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, similarity measures for clusterings are not readily applicable to biclusterings, since each bicluster is a tuple of two sets (of rows and columns), whereas a cluster is only a single set (of rows). Some biclustering similarity measures have been defined as minor contributions in papers which primarily report on proposals and evaluation of biclustering algorithms or comparative analyses of biclustering algorithms. The consequence is that some desirable properties of such measures have been overlooked in the literature. We review 14 biclustering similarity measures. We define eight desirable properties of a biclustering measure, discuss their importance, and prove which properties each of the reviewed measures has. We show examples drawn and inspired from important studies in which several biclustering measures convey misleading evaluations due to the absence of one or more of the discussed properties. We also advocate the use of a more general comparison approach that is based on the idea of transforming the original problem of comparing biclusterings into an equivalent problem of comparing clustering partitions with overlapping clusters.",

Unfortunately all commonly used multimodal similarity measures are inherently global and cannot be directly used to estimate local image properties. We have derived a local similarity measure based on joint entropy, which can operate on extremely small image regions, e.g. individual voxels. Using such small image regions reflects in higher sensitivity to noise and partial volume voxels, consequently reducing registration speed and accuracy. To cope with these problems we enhance the similarity measure with image segmentation. Image registration and image segmentation are related tasks, as segmentation can be performed by registering an image to a pre-segmented reference image, while on the other hand registration yields better results when the images are pre-segmented. Because of these interdependences it was anticipated that simultaneous application of registration and segmentation should improve registration as well as segmentation results. Several experiments based on synthetic images were performed to test this assumption. The results obtained show that our method can improve the registration accuracy and reduce the required number of registration steps.",

Typically, the plausibility of a semantic space is explored by sampling the nearest neighbors to a target word and evaluating the neighborhood on the basis of the modeler's intuition. Tools for visualization of these large-scale similarity spaces are nearly nonexistent. We present a new open-source tool to plot and visualize semantic spaces, thereby allowing researchers to rapidly explore patterns in visual data that describe the statistical relations between words. Words are visualized as nodes, and word similarities are shown as directed edges of varying strengths. The \"Word-2-Word\" visualization environment allows for easy manipulation of graph data to test word similarity measures on their own or in comparisons between multiple similarity metrics. The system contains a large library of statistical relationship models, along with an interface to teach them from various language sources. The modularity of the visualization environment allows for quick insertion of new similarity measures so as to compare new corpus-based metrics against the current state of the art.

        "abstract": "Characterization of chemical libraries is an essential task in everyday chemoinformatics practice. This study describes some potential uses of network visualization and analysis methods to identify distinguished members of compound libraries. Molecules were ordered into networks by their structural similarity defined by molecular fingerprints. Various properties of such networks were examined. It was shown, that the correlation methods used to calculate the similarity between two structures radically determined the topology of networks. From the same set of molecules, the Russel-Rao and the Baroni-Urbani methods created sparser and denser networks, respectively, than using the Tanimoto method. Central nodes, corresponding to central compounds in the libraries, were determined for some example data sets. It was shown by the case of adenosine A1, A2, and dual antagonists that the methods used to identify central nodes could be divided into two groups: (1) centrality methods, exemplified by the centroid centrality, which could pick up structures that were the most similar to the largest number of other molecules and (2) group, exemplified by betweenness centrality, that could identify molecules that had intermediate structures between some homogeneous subsets of the library. The latter method gave significantly higher ranks to dual adenosine antagonists, hinting the suitability of this measure to identify molecules with multiple activities. Some practical applications of the method for clustering of and sample selection from chemical libraries are presented. In the frame of the study, a Jchem plug-in has been developed to the Cytoscape network visualization software, which makes the visual observation of molecular networks more convenient.

The average correlation between ATA and individual human solutions was greater than IAR. N-gram length influenced the strength of association, but optimum string length depended on the nature of the text (technical vs. nontechnical). We conclude that the methodology applied in previous studies may have led to overoptimistic views on human reliability, but that an optimal n-gram solution can provide a good approximation of the average human assessment of document similarity, a result that has important implications for future development of document visualization systems.",

For example, we study a system composed from an interdependent world wide port network and a world wide airport network and show that well connected ports tend to couple with well connected airports. We introduce two quantities for measuring the level of inter-similarity between networks (i) Inter degree-degree correlation (IDDC) (ii) Inter-clustering coefficient (ICC).

For this reason we create topographic space, a 2D space derived from multidimensional measurements of geomorphometric characteristics at toponym locations and dimensionally reduced by the use of machine learning algorithms (SOM). Topographic similarity between toponyms in topographic space is a measurement of distance. For toponyms of the same type (e.g. cities or mountains), although distributed all over Switzerland, we observe strong autocorrelation in terms of topography. Comparisons across types of toponyms, for instance between mountains and rivers, indicate that euclidean distance between such toponyms, on a comparable scale, is more proximate than their topographic distance. Additionally the mapping of topographic peculiarities of toponyms to topographic space allows us to visually explore topographic relations.

The common practice is to use \" simulants,\" namely, analogous chemicals that closely resemble the CWAs but are less toxic, with the expectation that the results attained for simulants can be correlated to how the CWAs would perform. Simulants have been traditionally chosen by experts, by means of intuition, using similarity in one or more physical properties (such as vapor pressure or aqueous solubility) or in the molecular structural features (such as functional groups) between the stimulant and the CWA. This work is designed to automate the simulant identification process backed by quantitative metrics, by means of chemical similarity search software routinely used in pharmaceutical drug discovery. The question addressed here is: By the metrics of such software, how similar are traditional simulants to CWAs? That is, what is the numerical \" distance\" between each CWA and its customary simulants in the quantitative space of molecular descriptors? The answers show promise for finding close but less toxic simulants for the ever-increasing numbers of CWAs objectively and fast. ?? 2011.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Orthologous protein detection software mostly uses pairwise comparisons of amino-acid sequences to assert whether two proteins are orthologous or not. Accordingly, when the number of sequences for comparison increases, the number of comparisons to compute grows in a quadratic order. A current challenge of bioinformatic research, especially when taking into account the increasing number of sequenced organisms available, is to make this ever-growing number of comparisons computationally feasible in a reasonable amount of time. We propose to speed up the detection of orthologous proteins by using strings of domains to characterize the proteins.\\n\\nRESULTS: We present two new protein similarity measures, a cosine and a maximal weight matching score based on domain content similarity, and new software, named porthoDom. The qualities of the cosine and the maximal weight matching similarity measures are compared against curated datasets. The measures show that domain content similarities are able to correctly group proteins into their families. Accordingly, the cosine similarity measure is used inside porthoDom, the wrapper developed for proteinortho. porthoDom makes use of domain content similarity measures to group proteins together before searching for orthologs. By using domains instead of amino acid sequences, the reduction of the search space decreases the computational complexity of an all-against-all sequence comparison.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: We demonstrate that representing and comparing proteins as strings of discrete domains, i.e. as a concatenation of their unique identifiers, allows a drastic simplification of search space. porthoDom has the advantage of speeding up orthology detection while maintaining a degree of accuracy similar to proteinortho. The implementation of porthoDom is released using python and C++ languages and is available under the GNU GPL licence 3 at http://www.bornberglab.org/pages/porthoda .",

Both ligand and its binding site are essential components for understanding how the protein-ligand complex functions. Until now, there have been many studies about protein function and evolution, but they usually lacked ligand information. Accordingly, in this study, we tried to answer the following questions: how much ligand and binding site are associated with protein function, and how ligands themselves are related to each other in terms of binding site. To answer the questions, we presented binding similarity network of ligand. Through the network analysis, we attempted to reveal systematic relationship between the ligand and binding site. The results showed that ligand binding site and function were closely related (conservation ratio, 81%). We also showed conservative tendency of function in line with ligand structure similarity with some exceptional cases. In addition, the binding similarity network of ligand revealed scale-free property to some degree like other biological networks. Since most nodes formed highly connected cluster, a clustering coefficient was very high compared with random. All the highly connected ligands (hubs) were involved in various functions forming large cluster and tended to act as a bridge between modular clusters in the network.",

        "abstract": "Sibling studies have been widely used to analyze the impact of family background on socioeconomic and, to a lesser extent, demographic outcomes. We contribute to this literature with a novel research design that combines sibling comparisons and sequence analysis to analyze longitudinal family-formation trajectories of siblings and unrelated persons. This allows us to scrutinize in a more rigorous way whether sibling similarity exists in family-formation trajectories and whether siblings' shared background characteristics, such as parental education and early childhood family structure, can account for similarity in family formation. We use Finnish register data from 1987 through 2007 to construct longitudinal family-formation trajectories in young adulthood for siblings and unrelated dyads (N = 14,257 dyads). Findings show that family formation is moderately but significantly more similar for siblings than for unrelated dyads, also after controlling for crucial parental background characteristics. Shared parental background characteristics add surprisingly little to account for sibling similarity in family formation. Instead, gender and the respondents' own education are more decisive forces in the stratification of family formation. Yet, family internal dynamics seem to reinforce this stratification such that siblings have a higher probability to experience similar family-formation patterns. In particular, patterns that correspond with economic disadvantage are concentrated within families. This is in line with a growing body of research highlighting the importance of family structure in the reproduction of social inequality.",

        "abstract": "Although it has long been studied as a pure sensory irritant, the ability of capsaicin to evoke, mask, and desensitize bitter taste suggests that burning sensations and bitter taste might be closely related perceptually. The current study investigated the psychophysical relationship between bitterness and burning using 2 different approaches. In Experiment 1, spatial discrimination of 4 taste stimuli was measured in the presence or absence of capsaicin. The subjects' task was to report which of 3 swabs, spaced 1 cm apart and presented to the tongue tip, contained a taste stimulus when 1) water was presented on the other 2 swabs or 2) when 10 muM capsaicin was presented on all 3 swabs. The presence of capsaicin did not change performance on the 3 alternative forced-choice (3-AFC) task for sweet, sour, and salty stimuli, while the localization error for 1.8 mM quinine sulfate (QSO(4)) increased significantly. In Experiment 2, the perceptual similarity/dissimilarity of taste stimuli and capsaicin was measured directly using pairs of stimuli applied to opposite sides of the tongue tip on swabs separated by 2 cm. Multidimensional scaling analyses showed that capsaicin fell nearer to QSO(4) than to any other taste stimulus. Cluster analysis corroborated this finding: capsaicin was closely linked with QSO(4) and the capsaicin-QSO(4) group was separated from the other taste stimuli. The latter result indicated that bitterness was more similar to burning than to the other tastes. These findings imply that despite being mediated by different sensory modalities, bitterness and burn are qualitatively similar. We speculate that this similarity reflects a common function of these 2 sensations as sensory signals of potentially harmful stimuli.",

        "abstract": "Similarity plays a central role in spectral library search. The goal of spectral library search is to identify those spectra in a reference library of known materials that most closely match an unknown query spectrum, on the assumption that this will allow us to identify the main constituent(s) of the query spectrum. The similarity measures used for this task in software and the academic literature are almost exclusively metrics, meaning that the measures obey the three axioms of metrics: (1) minimality; (2) symmetry; (3) triangle inequality. Consequently, they implicitly assume that the query spectrum is drawn from the same distribution as that of the reference library. In this paper, we demonstrate that this assumption is not necessary in practical spectral library search and that in fact it is often violated in practice. Although the reference library may be constructed carefully, it is generally impossible to guarantee that all future query spectra will be drawn from the same distribution as the reference library. Before evaluating different similarity measures, we need to understand how they define the relationship between spectra. In spectral library search, we often aim to find the constituent(s) of a mixture. We propose that, rather than asking which reference library spectra are similar to the mixture, we should ask which of the reference library spectra are contained in the given query mixture. This question is inherently asymmetric. Therefore, we should adopt a nonmetric measure. To evaluate our hypothesis, we apply a nonmetric measure formulated by Tversky [Psychol. Rev. 1977, 84, 327-352] known as the Contrast Model and compare its performance to the well-known Jaccard similarity index metric on spectroscopic data sets. Our results show that the Tversky similarity measure yields better results than the Jaccard index.",

All of these need time, and many studies report that the time needed to compare two stimuli correlates inversely with the perceived distance between them. We developed a behavioral assay in which we tested the time that a honeybee needs to discriminate between odors consisting of mixtures of two components, and included both very similar and very different stimuli spanning four log-concentration ranges. Bees learned to discriminate all odors, including very similar odors and the same odor at different concentrations. Even though discriminating two very similar odors appears to be a more difficult task than discriminating two very distinct substances, we found that the time needed to make a choice for or against an odor was independent of odor similarity. Our data suggest that, irrespective of the nature of the olfactory code, the bee olfactory system evaluates odor quality after a constant interval. This may ensure that odors are only assessed after the olfactory network has optimized its representation.",

We apply the method to all-by-all comparisons two sets of human protein kinases, a very diverse set of ATP-bound proteins from multiple species, and three heterogeneous benchmark protein binding site data sets. Cases of disagreement between sequence-based similarity and binding site similarity yield informative examples. Where sequence similarity is very low, high pocket similarity can reliably identify important binding motifs. Where sequence similarity is very high, significant differences in pocket similarity are related to ligand binding specificity and similarity. Local protein binding pocket similarity provides qualitatively complementary information to other approaches, and it can yield quantitative information in support of functional annotation.",

Hence she can, by mistake, choose an inferior option because it is similar to the best. We characterize this boundedly rational behavior by suitably weakening the rationalizability axiom of Arrow (1959). We also characterize a variation where the decision maker chooses alternatives on the basis of their similarities to attractive yet infeasible options. We show that similarity-based mistakes of either kind lead to cyclical behavior. Finally, we reinterpret our procedure as a method for choosing a bundle given a set of individual items, in which the decision maker combines the best feasible item with those that complement it.",

        "abstract": "The problem of performing similarity queries on compressed data is considered. We focus on the quadratic similarity measure, and study the fundamental tradeoff between compression rate, sequence length, and reliability of queries performed on the compressed data. For a Gaussian source, we show that the queries can be answered reliably if and only if the compression rate exceeds a given threshold-the identification rate-which we explicitly characterize. Moreover, when compression is performed at a rate greater than the identification rate, responses to queries on the compressed data can be made exponentially reliable. We give a complete characterization of this exponent, which is analogous to the error and excess-distortion exponents in channel and source coding, respectively. For a general source, we prove that, as with classical compression, the Gaussian source requires the largest compression rate among sources with a given variance. Moreover, a robust scheme is described that attains this maximal rate for any source distribution.",

        "abstract": "A common problem in decision-making is to analyze a tuple of numerical values associated with options, such as the degree of satisfaction assigned by experts to alternatives or probability values for hypotheses computed from data. With no loss of generality, it is assumed that the tuple contains values in the unit interval. For post-processing of typical value(s), singular values that may arise from noise in the data, or from unreliable experts, must not be taken into account. We present the concept of block similarity to address the problem of detecting subset(s) of typical values instead of extracting singular ones. The concept relies on suitable aggregation operators that combine the tuple components. Three different block similarity operators are proposed and discussed. These rely on Sugeno integrals of the tuple with respect to three different measures, namely cardinal weighting, symmetric kernel weighting and non-linear weighting. Numerical examples demonstrate their behaviors and their ability to detect blocks of similar values. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

We experimentally tested 20 of these unexpected drug-drug relations and validated 13 implied drug-target relations by in vitro binding assays, of which 11 reveal inhibition constants equal to less than 10 micromolar. Nine of these were tested and confirmed in cell assays, documenting the feasibility of using phenotypic information to infer molecular interactions and hinting at new uses of marketed drugs.",

We further point out that any feature selection criteria covered by this framework cannot handle redundant features, a common drawback of these criteria. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new \"Similarity Preserving Feature Selection&#x201D; framework in an explicit and rigorous way. We show, through theoretical analysis, that the proposed framework not only encompasses many widely used feature selection criteria, but also naturally overcomes their common weakness in handling feature redundancy. In developing this new framework, we begin with a conventional combinatorial optimization formulation for similarity preserving feature selection, then extend it with a sparse multiple-output regression formulation to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. A set of three algorithms are devised to efficiently solve the proposed formulations, each of which has its own advantages in terms of computational complexity and selection performance. As exhibited by our extensive experimental study, the proposed framework achieves superior feature selection performance and attractive properties.",

Virtual screening experiments using the MDL Drug Data Report and World of Molecular Bioactivity databases show that the use of such inverse frequency weighting schemes can result, in some circumstances, in marked increases in screening effectiveness when compared with the use of conventional, unweighted fingerprints. Analysis of the characteristics of the various schemes demonstrates that such weights are best used to weight the fingerprint of the reference structure in a similarity search, with the database structures' fingerprints unweighted. However, the increases in performance resulting from such weights are only observed with structurally homogeneous sets of active molecules; when the actives are diverse, the best results are obtained using conventional, unweighted fingerprints for both the reference structure and the database structures.",

Furthermore, while many novel hosts for guest ions and molecules have been developed through metal directed self-assembly, as these products tend to be kinetically labile, very few electrochemical studies have been reported. Herein, we report that the interplay between the binding properties and redox activity of a self-assembled trinuclear Ru-II macrocycle leads to an hitherto unreported phenomenon, in which access to specific MV states can be gated by host-guest chemistry. Thus, this system is the first in which MV states and the extent of electron delocalisation are switched by an ion without any change in electrochemical potential.",

We concentrate on a Bayesian formulation for statistical shape analysis. We generalize the model introduced by Green and Mardia for the pairwise alignment of two unlabeled configurations to full similarity transformations by introducing a scaling factor to the model. The generalization is not straight-forward, since the model needs to be reformulated to give good performance when scaling is included. We illustrate our method on the alignment of rat growth profiles and a novel application to the alignment of protein domains. Here, scaling is applied to secondary structure elements when comparing protein folds; additionally, we find that one global scaling factor is not in general sufficient to model these data and, hence, we develop a model in which multiple scale factors can be included to handle different scalings of shape components.",

        "abstract": "Given a time stamped transaction database and a user-defined reference sequence of interest over time, similarity-profiled temporal association mining discovers all associated item sets whose prevalence variations over time are similar to the reference sequence. The similar temporal association patterns can reveal interesting relationships of data items which co-occur with a particular event over time. Most works in temporal association mining have focused on capturing special temporal regulation patterns such as cyclic patterns and calendar scheme-based patterns. However, our model is flexible in representing interesting temporal patterns using a user-defined reference sequence. The dissimilarity degree of the sequence of support values of an item set to the reference sequence is used to capture how well its temporal prevalence variation matches the reference pattern. By exploiting interesting properties such as an envelope of support time sequence and a lower bounding distance for early pruning candidate item sets, we develop an algorithm for effectively mining similarity-profiled temporal association patterns. We prove the algorithm is correct and complete in the mining results and provide the computational analysis. Experimental results on real data as well as synthetic data show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than a sequential method using a traditional support-pruning scheme.",

        "abstract": "Context: Access control is among the most important security mechanisms, and XACML is the de facto standard for specifying, storing and deploying access control policies. Since it is critical that enforced policies are correct, policy testing must be performed in an effective way to identify potential security flaws and bugs. In practice, exhaustive testing is impossible due to budget constraints. Therefore the tests need to be prioritized so that resources are focused on their most relevant subset. Objective: This paper tackles the issue of access control test prioritization. It proposes a new approach for access control test prioritization that relies on similarity. Method: The approach has been applied to several policies and the results have been compared to random prioritization (as a baseline). To assess the different prioritization criteria, we use mutation analysis and compute the mutation scores reached by each criterion. This helps assessing the rate of fault detection. Results: The empirical results indicate that our proposed approach is effective and its rate of fault detection is higher than that of random prioritization. Conclusion: We conclude that prioritization of access control test cases can be usefully based on similarity criteria.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of scientific workflows, public repositories are gaining importance as a means to share, find, and reuse such workflows. As the sizes of these repositories grow, methods to compare the scientific workflows stored in them become a necessity, for instance, to allow duplicate detection or similarity search. Scientific workflows are complex objects, and their comparison entails a number of distinct steps from comparing atomic elements to comparison of the workflows as a whole. Various studies have implemented methods for scientific workflow comparison and came up with often contradicting conclusions upon which algorithms work best. Comparing these results is cumbersome, as the original studies mixed different approaches for different steps and used different evaluation data and metrics. We contribute to the field (i) by disecting each previous approach into an explicitly defined and comparable set of subtasks, (ii) by comparing in isolation different approaches taken at each step of scientific workflow comparison, reporting on an number of unexpected findings, (iii) by investigating how these can best be combined into aggregated measures, and (iv) by making available a gold standard of over 2000 similarity ratings contributed by 15 workflow experts on a corpus of almost 1500 workflows and re-implementations of all methods we evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Shepard has argued that a universal law should govern generalization across different domains of perception and cognition, as well as across organisms from different species or even different planets. Starting with some basic assumptions about natural kinds, he derived an exponential decay function as the form of the universal generalization gradient, which accords strikingly well with a wide range of empirical data. However, his original formulation applied only to the ideal case of generalization from a single encountered stimulus to a single novel stimulus, and for stimuli that can be represented as points in a continuous metric psychological space. Here we recast Shepard's theory in a more general Bayesian framework and show how this naturally extends his approach to the more realistic situation of generalizing from multiple consequential stimuli with arbitrary representational structure. Our framework also subsumes a version of Tversky's set-theoretic model of similarity, which is conventionally thought of as the primary alternative to Shepard's continuous metric space model of similarity and generalization. This unification allows us not only to draw deep parallels between the set-theoretic and spatial approaches, but also to significantly advance the explanatory power of set-theoretic models.",

        "abstract": "We present a method to predict products, transition states, and reaction paths of unimolecular chemical reactions such as dissociation or rearrangement reactions of small to medium sized molecules. The method thus provides the necessary input for established procedures to compute barrier heights and reaction rates, which conventionally have to be assumed heuristically. The method is an extension of the force field based conformational flooding procedure, but here aims at an accelerated barrier crossing of chemical reactions rather than conformational motions. Accordingly, it is now coupled to density functional molecular dynamics, such that the chemical reaction under study takes place at the picoseconds time scale set by todays computer technology. Barrier crossings are accelerated by means of an additional energy term (flooding potential) that locally destabilizes the educt conformation without affecting possible transition states or product states. The method is applied to two test systems, bicyclopropylidene and methylenecyclopropane, for which the reaction paths are predicted correctly. New details of reaction pathways are found, such as a transient concerted, but asynchronous rotation of the two methylene groups for the bicyclopropylidene --> methylenespiropentane reaction. Our method can be applied to simulations in the gas phase as well as in solution and can be combined with force field simulations, e.g., in hybrid density functional/force field (QM/MM) computations.

Nonisomorphic fragments extracted in the matching process were considered to obtain dissimilarity values employed for correcting similarity measurements, thus, leading to finer chemical information. The purpose was to correlate similarity and dissimilarity matrices with pharmacological activities of drugs (the inhibitory capacity presented by 30 benzoxazinone derivatives for the NPY Y5 receptor). Wiener and hyper-Wiener descriptors computed over distance and weighted distance matrices were used for the calculation of dissimilarity values. A comparison with classical and fingerprints-based similarity was also carried out. The best approaches were achieved by means of dissimilarity and of fusion data spaces that take into account isomorphic and nonisomorphic information (Q2 = 0.88, SECV = 0.18, slope = 1.06, and intercept = 0.09). The study of anomalous behavior presented by some compounds was also undertaken.",

        "abstract": "There is a debate on the folding of proteins with inverted sequences. Theoretical approaches and experiments give contradictory results. Many proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) show conspicuous inverse sequence similarity (ISS) to each other. Here we analyze whether this ISS is related to structural similarity. For the first time, we performed a large scale three-dimensional (3-D) superposition of corresponding C\u03b1 atoms of forwardly and inversely aligned proteins and tested the degree of secondary structure identity between them. Comparing proteins of less than 50% pairwise sequence identity, only 0.5% of the inversely aligned pairs had similar folds (99 out of 19 073), whereas about 9% of forwardly aligned proteins in the same score and length range show similar 3-D structures (1731 out of 19 248). This observation strongly supports the view that the inversion of sequences in almost all cases leads to a different folding property of the protein. Inverted sequences are thus suitable as protein-like sequences for control purposes without relations to existing proteins. \u00a9 2003 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

        "abstract": "Myrmecophiles are animals that live in close association with ants and that frequently develop elaborate mechanisms to infiltrate their well-defended host societies. We compare the social integration strategies of two myrmecophilic species, the spider, Gamasomorpha maschwitzi, and the newly described silverfish, Malayatelura ponerophila gen. n. sp. n., into colonies of the ponerine army ant, Leptogenys distinguenda (Emery) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Both symbionts use chemical mimicry through adoption of host cuticular hydrocarbons. Exchange experiments between L. distinguenda and an undetermined Leptogenys species demonstrate that reduced aggression toward alien ants and increased social acceptance occurred with individuals of higher chemical similarity in their cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. We found striking differences in chemical and behavioral strategies between the two myrmecophiles. Spider cuticular hydrocarbon profiles were chemically less similar to the host than silverfish profiles were. Nevertheless, spiders received significantly fewer attacks from host ants and survived longer in laboratory colonies, whereas silverfish were treated with high aggression and were killed more frequently. When discovered and confronted by the host, silverfish tended to escape and were chased aggressively, whereas spiders remained in contact with the confronting host ant until aggression ceased. Thus, spiders relied less on chemical mimicry but were nevertheless accepted more frequently by the host on the basis of behavioral mechanisms. These findings give insights into the fine tuning of social integration mechanisms and show the significance of qualitative differences among strategies.",

A high-throughput screening (HTS) data set containing cathepsin B inhibitors was analyzed to evaluate the effects of potency scaling. Sets of template compounds were randomly selected from the HTS data and used to search for hits having varying potency levels in the presence or absence of potency scaling. Enrichment of potent compounds in small subsets of the HTS data set was observed as a consequence of potency scaling. In part, observed enrichments could be rationalized as a result of recentering chemical reference space on a subspace populated by potent compounds. Our findings suggest that VS calculations using multiple reference compounds can be directed toward the preferential detection of potent database hits by scaling compound contributions according to potency differences.",

This inference requires a deep understanding of the interaction between colors, and the involvement of image local geometry. Although quite successful in making such inferences with very small relative error, state-of-the-art demosaicking methods fail when the local geometry cannot be inferred from the neighboring pixels. In such a case, which occurs when thin structures or fine periodic patterns were present in the original, state-of-the-art methods can create disturbing artifacts, known as zipper effect, blur, and color spots. The aim of this paper is to show that these artifacts can be avoided by involving the image self-similarity to infer missing colors. Detailed experiments show that a satisfactory solution can be found, even for the most critical cases.

In these models, individuals cooperate based on an aribtrary signal (or tag) such as the famous green beard. Here, two different models for such tag based cooperation are analysed. As neutral drift is important in both models, a finite population framework is applied. The first model, which we term \u201ccooperative tags\u201d considers a situation in which groups of cooperators are formed by some joint signal. Defectors adopting the signal and exploiting the group can lead to a breakdown of cooperation. In this case, conditions are derived under which the average abundance of the more cooperative strategy exceeds 50%. The second model considers a situation in which individuals start defecting towards others that are not similar to them. This situation is termed \u201cdefective tags\u201d. It is shown that in this case, individuals using tags to cooperate exclusively with their own kind dominate over unconditional cooperators.",

Computer systems are self-similar if certain ratios of computational forces, also known as computational intensities, are equal. Two machines with different computational power, different network bandwidth and different inter-processor latency behave the same way if they have the same ratios of forces. For the parallel conjugate gradient algorithm studied in this paper, two machines are self-similar if and only if the ratio of one force describing latency effects to another force describing bandwidth effects is the same for both machines. For the two machines studied in this paper, this ratio, which we call the mixing coefficient, is invariant as problem size and processor count change. The two machines have the same mixing coefficient and belong to the same equivalence class. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

It is evident, that efficient and effective query processing techniques need to be developed, in order to provide acceptable response times in query processing. In this paper, we study the processing of similarity nearest neighbor queries in large distributed multidimensional databases, where objects are represented as vectors in a vector space, and are distributed in a multi-computer environment. The departure from the centralized case embodies a number of advantages and (unfortunately) a number of difficulties that need to be successfully overcome. In this perspective, four query evaluation strategies are presented, namely Concurrent Processing (CP) , Selective Processing (SP) , Two-Phase Processing (2PP) and Probabilistic Processing (PRP) . The proposed techniques are compared analytically and experimentally, in order to discover the advantages of each one, as well as the best cases where each one should be applied. Experimental results are presented, demonstrating the performance of each method under different parameters values. Also, we investigate the impact of derived data that should be maintained in order to process similarity queries efficiently.",

The dependence between elements of the dissimilarity matrix, if not accounted for, results in underestimation of the variance in comparisons between groups of strains which are differentiated according to the possession of an attribute. We examine a previously proposed statistic for determining whether a group of strains is more similar than expected. We show the limitations of this statistic and propose a new statistic which better addresses the hypotheses that are usually considered in this field of study. The statistic proposed is based on similarity between strains within the group of interest and with those outside. This statistic also needs to account for the dependence in the raw data, and we use the correlation between elements of the dissimilarity matrix to investigate how this dependence affects the underestimation of the variance. Using examples involving the pathogenic yeast Candida, we show how permutation tests can be applied to the differentiation of groups of strains.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for calculating spectroscopic properties in the framework of response theory utilizing a sequence of similarity transformations (STs). The STs are preformed using the coupled cluster (CC) and Fock-space coupled cluster operators. The linear and quadratic response functions of the new similarity transformed CC response (ST-CCR) method are derived. The poles of the linear response yield excitation-energy (EE) expressions identical to the ones in the similarity transformed equation-of-motion coupled cluster (STEOM-CC) approach. ST-CCR and STEOM-CC complement each other, in analogy to the complementarity of CC response (CCR) and equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC). ST-CCR/STEOM-CC and CCR/EOM-CC yield size-extensive and size-intensive EEs, respectively. Other electronic-properties, e.g., transition dipole strengths, are also size-extensive within ST-CCR, in contrast to STEOM-CC. Moreover, analysis suggests that in comparison with CCR, the ST-CCR expressions may be confined to a smaller subspace, however, the precise scope of the truncation can only be determined numerically. In addition, reformulation of the time-independent STEOM-CC using the same parameterization as in ST-CCR, as well as an efficient truncation scheme, is presented. The shown convergence of the time-dependent and time-independent expressions displays the completeness of the presented formalism. \u00a9 2013 AIP Publishing LLC",

Regression analyses revealed these to be related to some of the objective measures of similarity that have previously been implicated in categorization decisions. In Experiment 2 participants made grammaticality decisions and rated either their confidence in the accuracy of their decisions or the similarity of the test items to the study items. Regression analyses showed that the grammaticality decisions were predicted by the similarity ratings obtained in Experiment 1. Points on the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for the similarity and confidence ratings were closely matched. These data suggest that meta-cognitive judgments of confidence are predicated on structural knowledge of similarity. Experiment 3 confirmed this by showing that confidence ratings to median similarity probe items changed according to the similarity of preceding items.",

However, in most of the previous work, similarity-aware operations are studied in isolation from other regular or similarity-aware operations. Furthermore, most of the previous research in the area considers a standalone implementation, i.e., without any integration with a database system. In this demonstration we present SimDB, a similarity-aware database management system. SimDB supports multiple similarity-aware operations as first-class database operators. We describe the architectural changes to implement the similarity-aware operators. In particular, we present the way conventional operators' implementation machinery is extended to support similarity-aware operators. We also show how these operators interact with other similarity-aware and regular operators. In particular, we show the effectiveness of multiple equivalence rules that can be used to extend cost-based query optimization to the case of similarity-ware operations.",

Experiment 1 used a web-based task to collect visual similarity rankings between two target categories, teddy bears and butterflies, and random-category objects, from which we created search displays in Experiment 2 having either high-similarity distractors, low-similarity distractors, or \"mixed\" displays with high-, medium-, and low-similarity distractors. Analysis of target-absent trials revealed faster manual responses and fewer fixated distractors on low-similarity displays compared to high-similarity displays. On mixed displays, first fixations were more frequent on high-similarity distractors (bear = 49%; butterfly = 58%) than on low-similarity distractors (bear = 9%; butterfly = 12%). Experiment 3 used the same high/low/mixed conditions, but now these conditions were created using similarity estimates from a computer vision model that ranked objects in terms of color, texture, and shape similarity. The same patterns were found, suggesting that categorical search can indeed be guided by purely visual similarity. Experiment 4 compared cases where the model and human rankings differed and when they agreed. We found that similarity effects were best predicted by cases where the two sets of rankings agreed, suggesting that both human visual similarity rankings and the computer vision model captured features important for guiding search to categorical targets.",

The new product-oriented chemical industry has three categories of products with different key characteristics. The first obvious category is commodities, where the key is their manufacturing cost. Styrene produced by Dow and styrene produced by BASF are chemically identical; the issue is who can produce larger quantities at the lowest possible price. The second and third categories of products are less familiar. The second category is molecules, exemplified by pharmaceuticals. The key to the production of pharmaceuticals is not cost, but time to market, that is, the speed of their discovery and production. These products are normally not made using dedicated equipment, but rather in whatever reactors are available. The third category includes products where value is added by a specific microstructure. The key to the success of these products is their function. For example, we do not care why our shoes shine after we have applied polish; we only care that they do shine. It is the shine - not the molecule that produces the shine - that is important. Customers will pay a premium for enhanced function. This paper will review the skill sets of chemical professionals appropriate for this altered chemical industry.

        "abstract": "A chemical or DNA fingerprint can be treated as a multi-dimensional vector. Correlation coefficient between two fingerprints which is easy to understand and simple to compute has been widely used to assess the similarity of fingerprints in chemical and Chinese Medicine. In the process of fingerprint examination, we are often confronted with such question on how to assess whether a new tested fingerprint is qualified or not. Usually, the mean or median fingerprint of a group of representative fingerprints measured accurately is regarded as a standard fingerprint, then correlation coefficient between the standard fingerprint and a new tested fingerprint is calculated. The critical value for the correlation coefficient is for assessment of a new tested fingerprint whether it is qualified or not. In this study, a bootstrap method is used to estimate the sampling distribution of the correlation coefficient between the standard fingerprint and a new tested fingerprint under the hypothesis that the new tested fingerprint belongs to the same group with the fingerprints used to construct standard fingerprint. Furthermore, using the simulated distribution we obtain the corresponding critical value as the criteria for fingerprint examination. This method is illustrated using Chinese Angelica (CA) fingerprint data. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "A statistical method to predict protein pK(a) has been developed by using the 3D structure of a protein and a database of 434 experimental protein pK(a) values. Each pK(a) in the database is associated with a fingerprint that describes the chemical environment around an ionizable residue. A computational tool, MoKaBio, has been developed to identify automatically ionizable residues in a protein, generate fingerprints that describe the chemical environment around such residues, and predict pK(a) from the experimental pK(a) values in the database by using a similarity metric. The method, which retrieved the pK(a) of 429 of the 434 ionizable sites in the database correctly, was crossvalidated by leave-one-out and yielded root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.95, a result that is superior to that obtained by using the Null Model (RMSE 1.07) and other well-established protein pK(a) prediction tools. This novel approach is suitable to rationalize protein pK(a) by comparing the region around the ionizable site with similar regions whose ionizable site pK(a) is known. The pK(a) of residues that have a unique environment not represented in the training set cannot be predicted accurately, however, the method offers the advantage of being trainable to increase its predictive power.",

The recognition process involves decisions based on the face measurement results. The reliability and robustness of the recognition procedure are critical factors, strongly affected by influence quantities, such as face-camera relative orientation and position, illumination and expression. To improve performance it makes sense to imitate the recognition process in humans, who succeed in recognising faces even from poor quality images. It is therefore interesting to investigate the perception of similarity between faces, with the aim of gaining insight into the process of human face recognition. We report on an investigation that has been carried out by original methods developed in our laboratory for the direct measurement of perceptual quantities. Such methods have been implemented for two complementary recognition procedures, based either on the global appearance of a face or on the detection of specific repere points. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To answer this question, my research group has computationally enumerated all possible organic molecules up to a certain size to gain an unbiased insight into the entire chemical space. Our latest database, GDB-17, contains 166.4 billion molecules of up to 17 atoms of C, N, O, S, and halogens, by far the largest small molecule database reported to date. Molecules allowed by valency rules but unstable or nonsynthesizable due to strained topologies or reactive functional groups were not considered, which reduced the enumeration by at least 10 orders of magnitude and was essential to arrive at a manageable database size. Despite these restrictions, GDB-17 is highly relevant with respect to known molecules. Beyond enumeration, understanding and exploiting GDBs (generated databases) led us to develop methods for virtual screening and visualization of very large databases in the form of a \u201cperiodic system of molecules\u201d comprising six different fingerprint spaces, with web-browsers for nearest neighbor searches, and the MQN- and SMIfp-Mapplet application for exploring color- coded principal component maps of GDB and other large databases. Proof-of-concept applications of GDB for drug discovery were realized by combining virtual screening with chemical synthesis and activity testing for neurotransmitter receptor and transporter ligands. One surprising lesson from using GDB for drug analog searches is the incredible depth of chemical space, that is, the fact that millions of very close analogs of any molecule can be readily identified by nearest-neighbor searches in the MQN-space of the various GDBs. The chemical space project has opened an unprecedented door on chemical diversity. Ongoing and yet unmet challenges concern enumerating molecules beyond 17 atoms and synthesizing GDB molecules with innovative",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The chemical property and biological function of a protein is a direct consequence of its primary structure. Several algorithms have been developed which determine alignment and similarity of primary protein sequences. However, character based similarity cannot provide insight into the structural aspects of a protein. We present a method based on spectral similarity to compare subsequences of amino acids that behave similarly but are not aligned well by considering amino acids as mere characters. This approach finds a similarity score between sequences based on any given attribute, like hydrophobicity of amino acids, on the basis of spectral information after partial conversion to the frequency domain. RESULTS: Distance matrices of various branches of the human kinome, that is the full complement of human kinases, were developed that matched the phylogenetic tree of the human kinome establishing the efficacy of the global alignment of the algorithm. PKCd and PKCe kinases share close biological properties and structural similarities but do not give high scores with character based alignments. Detailed comparison established close similarities between subsequences that do not have any significant character identity. We compared their known 3D structures to establish that the algorithm is able to pick subsequences that are not considered similar by character based matching algorithms but share structural similarities. Similarly many subsequences with low character identity were picked between xyna-theau and xyna-clotm F/10 xylanases. Comparison of 3D structures of the subsequences confirmed the claim of similarity in structure. CONCLUSION: An algorithm is developed which is inspired by successful application of spectral similarity applied to music sequences. The method captures subsequences that do not align by traditional character based alignment tools but give rise to similar secondary and tertiary structures. The Spectral Similarity Score (SSS) is an extension to the conventional similarity methods and results indicate that it holds a strong potential for analysis of various biological sequences and structural variations in proteins.",

In this article, we (i) review existing approaches to define hydrologic similarity and to catchment classification; (ii) discuss outstanding components or characteristics that should be included in a classification scheme; and provide a basic framework for catchment classi- fication as a starting point for further analysis. Possible metrics to describe form, hydro-climate, and function are suggested and discussed. We close the discussion with a list of requirements for the classification framework and open questions that require addressing in order to fully implement it. Open questions include: How can we best represent characteristics of form and hydro-climatic conditions? How does this representation change with spatial and temporal scale? What functions (partition, storage, and release) are relevant at what spatial and temporal scale? At what scale do internal structure and heterogeneity become important and need to be considered?",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel molecular description--topological (2D) fuzzy pharmacophore triplets, 2D-FPT--using the number of interposed bonds as the measure of separation between the atoms representing pharmacophore types (hydrophobic, aromatic, hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor, cation, and anion). 2D-FPT features three key improvements with respect to the state-of-the-art pharmacophore fingerprints: (1) The first key novelty is fuzzy mapping of molecular triplets onto the basis set of pharmacophore triplets: unlike in the binary scheme where an atom triplet is set to highlight the bit of a single, best-matching basis triplet, the herein-defined fuzzy approach allows for gradual mapping of each atom triplet onto several related basis triplets, thus minimizing binary classification artifacts. (2) The second innovation is proteolytic equilibrium dependence, by explicitly considering all of the conjugated acids and bases (microspecies). 2D-FPTs are concentration-weighted (as predicted at pH=7.4) averages of microspecies fingerprints. Therefore, small structural modifications, not affecting the overall pharmacophore pattern (in the sense of classical rule-based assignment), but nevertheless triggering a pKa shift, will have a major impact on 2D-FPT. Pairs of almost identical compounds with significantly differing activities (\"activity cliffs\" in classical descriptor spaces) were in many cases predictable by 2D-FPT. (3) The third innovation is a new similarity scoring formula, acknowledging that the simultaneous absence of a triplet in two molecules is a less-constraining indicator of similarity than its simultaneous presence. It displays excellent neighborhood behavior, outperforming 2D or 3D two-point pharmacophore descriptors or chemical fingerprints. The 2D-FPT calculator was developed using the chemoinformatics toolkit of ChemAxon (www.chemaxon.com).",

Most of similarities are defined based on the geographic features of mobile users' trajectories. However, trajectories geographically close may not necessarily be similar because the activities implied by nearby landmarks they pass through may be different. In this paper, we argue that a better similarity measurement should have taken into account the semantics of trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for recommending potential friends based on users' semantic trajectories for location-based social networks. The core of our proposal is a novel trajectory similarity measurement, namely, Maximal Semantic Trajectory Pattern Similarity (MSTP-Similarity), which measures the semantic similarity between trajectories. Accordingly, we propose a user similarity measurement based on MSTP-Similarity of user trajectories and use it as the basis for recommending potential friends to a user. Through experimental evaluation, the proposed friend recommendation approach is shown to deliver excellent performance. Copyright 2010 ACM.",

        "abstract": "We define a genetic similarity rule that predicts how genetic variation in a dominant plant affects the structure of an arthropod community. This rule applies to hybridizing cottonwood species where plant genetic variation determines plant-animal interactions and structures a dependent community of leaf-modifying arthropods. Because the associated arthropod community is expected to respond to important plant traits, we also tested whether plant chemical composition is one potential intermediate link between plant genes and arthropod community composition. Two lines of evidence support our genetic similarity rule. First, in a common garden experiment we found that trees with similar genetic compositions had similar chemical compositions and similar arthropod compositions. Second, in a wild population, we found a similar relationship between genetic similarity in cottonwoods and the dependent arthropod community. Field data demonstrate that the relationship between genes and arthropods was also significant when the hybrids were analysed alone, i.e. the pattern is not dependent upon the inclusion of both parental species. Because plant-animal interactions and natural hybridization are common to diverse plant taxa, we suggest that a genetic similarity rule is potentially applicable, and may be extended, to other systems and ecological processes. For example, plants with similar genetic compositions may exhibit similar litter decomposition rates. A corollary to this genetic similarity rule predicts that in systems with low plant genetic variability, the environment will be a stronger factor structuring the dependent community. Our findings argue that the genetic composition of a dominant plant can structure higher order ecological processes, thus placing community and ecosystem ecology within a genetic and evolutionary framework. A genetic similarity rule also has important conservation implications because the loss of genetic diversity in one species, especially dominant or keystone species that define many communities, may cascade to negatively affect the rest of the dependent community.",

Previous work creates only a single, static query plan to be used by all queries. In contrast, our approach creates a new plan for each query. We introduce the novel problem of query planning for similarity search, i.e., selecting for each query the plan that maximizes completeness of the results with cost below a query-specific limit. By regarding the frequencies of attribute values we are able to better estimate plan completeness and cost, and thus to better distribute our similarity comparisons. Evaluation on a large real-world dataset shows that our approach significantly reduces cost variance and increases overall result completeness compared to static query plans. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

As a result, it may be beneficial to use different similarity measures in different image regions. We present an adaptive stereo similarity measure that achieves this via a weighted combination of measures, in which the weights depend on the local image structure. Specifically, the weights are defined as a function of a confidence measure on the stereo similarities: similarity measures with a higher confidence at a particular image location are given higher weight. We evaluate the performance of our adaptive stereo similarity measure in both local and global stereo algorithms on standard benchmarks such as the Middlebury and KITTI data sets.

Typically, these approaches involve either rapid injection of reagents into hot surfactant solution followed by aging at high temperature, or the mixing of reagents at a low temperature and slow heating under controlled conditions. Spherical cobalt nanoparticles with various crystal structures have been synthesized by thermally decomposing dicobalt octacarbonyl or by reducing cobalt salts. Nanoparticles of Fe-Pt and other related iron or cobalt containing alloys have been made by simultaneously reacting their constituent precursors. Many different ferrite nanoparticles have been synthesized by the thermal decomposition of organometallic precursors followed by oxidation or by low-temperature reactions inside reverse micelles. Rod-shaped iron nanoparticles have been synthesized from the oriented growth of spherical nanoparticles, and cobalt nanodisks were synthesized from the thermal decomposition of dicobalt octacarbonyl in the presence of a mixture of two surfactants.",

The aging reaction is modelled by the chemical reaction: \"2 resins \u2192 1 asphaltene.\" Molecular dynamic simulations of four bitumen compositions, obtained by a repeated application of the aging reaction, are performed. The stress autocorrelation function, the fluid structure, the rotational dynamics of the plane aromatic molecules, and the diffusivity of each molecule are determined for the four different compositions. The aging reaction causes a significant dynamics slowdown, which is correlated to the aggregation of asphaltene molecules in larger and dynamically slower nanoaggregates. Finally, a detailed description of the role of each molecule types in the aggregation and aging processes is given.",

Our proposed framework, coined SmartTrace+, provides an effective solution without disclosing any part of the crowd traces to the query processor. SmartTrace+, relies on an in-situ data storage model and intelligent top-K query processing algorithms that exploit distributed trajectory similarity measures, resilient to spatial and temporal noise, in order to derive the most relevant answers to Q. We evaluate our algorithms on both synthetic and real workloads. We describe our prototype system developed on the Android OS. The solution is deployed over our own SmartLab testbed of 25 smartphones. Our study reveals that computations over SmartTrace+ result in substantial energy conservation; in addition, results can be computed faster than competitive approaches.",

In this study, we have encoded a three-dimensional pharmacophore matching similarity (FMS) scoring function into the structure-based design program DOCK. Validation and characterization of the method are presented through pose reproduction, crossdocking, and enrichment studies. When used alone, FMS scoring dramatically improves pose reproduction success to 93.5% (\u223c20% increase) and reduces sampling failures to 3.7% (\u223c6% drop) compared to the standard energy score (SGE) across 1043 protein-ligand complexes. The combined FMS+SGE function further improves success to 98.3%. Crossdocking experiments using FMS and FMS+SGE scoring, for six diverse protein families, similarly showed improvements in success, provided proper pharmacophore references are employed. For enrichment, incorporating pharmacophores during sampling and scoring, in most cases, also yield improved outcomes when docking and rank-ordering libraries of known actives and decoys to 15 systems. Retrospective analyses of virtual screenings to three clinical drug targets (EGFR, IGF-1R, and HIVgp41) using X-ray structures of known inhibitors as pharmacophore references are also reported, including a customized FMS scoring protocol to bias on selected regions in the reference. Overall, the results and fundamental insights gained from this study should benefit the docking community in general, particularly researchers using the new FMS method to guide computational drug discovery with DOCK.",

We propose new measures that exploit a hierarchical domain structure in order to produce more intuitive similarity scores. We extend our similarity measures to provide appropriate results in the presence of multisets (also handled unsatisfactorily by traditional measures), for example, to correctly compute the similarity between customers who buy several instances of the same product (say milk), or who buy several products in the same category (say dairy products).

In sum, the experiments demonstrated a noninversion of similarity and difference that was caused by thematic relations and exhibited primarily by a subgroup of participants.

Every new study unveils an extra piece of the puzzle in our search for an understanding of allostery that allows us to make predictions on the response of a protein to medically relevant stimuli such as pathological mutations or drug binding. This review summarizes recent advances in the analysis of mechanisms of allosteric communication in proteins, and combines this new knowledge to offer a perspective of allostery which is consistent with chemical views of molecular processes. First, we review recent work, particularly computational, on the characterization of signal propagation and conformational changes in allosteric proteins. We then compare different models of allostery, and discuss the significance of the concept of an allosteric pathway. We argue that allostery can be rationalized in terms of pathways of residues that efficiently transmit energy between different binding sites. We then provide examples that show how this picture could account for most of the observed data, since energy flow may be manifested as changes in both structure and dynamics. We conclude by acknowledging that the proposed view is still a simplification and should not be taken as a rigorous model of allosteric communication in proteins. Nevertheless, simple pictures like this can go a long way in improving our understanding of many complex phenomena observed in nature.",

The new curriculum was introduced in stages, commencing in 2004. Each unit of study comprises several modules, most supported by problem-based learning. Integration within, and between semesters is vitally important, and is enhanced by team teaching, which has also helped to provide a sense of peer-support. Assessment against sets of competencies rather than differentiated grading was introduced for core technical courses. Students progress between years of study with a greater understanding of the inter-relationship between the analytical, synthesis and practice components of the curriculum. There are a few issues to resolve, but several positive features have emerged so far. The positive reviews of the new curriculum by the Accreditation Panels of both Engineers Australia and the Institution of Chemical Engineers, as well as comments from student representatives, have been significant confirmations of our approach.",

This capability also depends on common genomics standards, protocol description, and functional linkages of diverse public Internet data resources. We present a survey of public genomics resources from these vantage points and conclude that, despite progress in many areas, the current state of the majority of public microarray databases is inadequate for supporting these objectives, particularly with regard to chemical indexing. To begin to address these inadequacies, we focus chemical annotation efforts on experimental content contained in the two primary public genomic resources: ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus. Automated scripts and extensive manual review were employed to transform free-text experiment descriptions into a standardized, chemically indexed inventory of experiments in both resources. These files, which include top-level summary annotations, allow for identification of current chemical-associated experimental content, as well as chemical-exposure-related (or \"Treatment\") content of greatest potential value to toxicogenomics investigation. With these chemical-index files, it is possible for the first time to assess the breadth and overlap of chemical study space represented in these databases, and to begin to assess the sufficiency of data with shared protocols for chemical similarity inferences. Chemical indexing of public genomics databases is a first important step toward integrating chemical, toxicological and genomics data into predictive toxicology.",

The wavelet-based measures were more successful in discriminating these patterns in contrast to the current state-of-art similarity measures. We also present the validity of wavelet-based similarity measures through the hierarchical clustering of two protein datasets consisting of families of homologous domains and alanine scan mutants.

        "abstract": "No other study has had as great an impact on the development of the similarity literature as that of Tversky (1977), which provided compelling demonstrations against all the fundamental assumptions of the popular, and extensively employed, geometric similarity models. Notably, similarity judgments were shown to violate symmetry and the triangle inequality and also be subject to context effects, so that the same pair of items would be rated differently, depending on the presence of other items. Quantum theory provides a generalized geometric approach to similarity and can address several of Tversky's main findings. Similarity is modeled as quantum probability, so that asymmetries emerge as order effects, and the triangle equality violations and the diagnosticity effect can be related to the context-dependent properties of quantum probability. We so demonstrate the promise of the quantum approach for similarity and discuss the implications for representation theory in general.",

This paper presents a novel measure of calculating the similarity between sentences or between documents using ontology. The similarity is assessed using sentence or document concept vector forming from finding the linkage between ontology terms and sentence or document content, the linage can be used to generate semantic indexes of sentences or document and apply them to implement highly efficient searching algorithms to compute sentence or document similarity, and the difference between the sentence and document similarity measurement is articulated. Results were verified through experiments. Experiments show that this technique is efficient and compares favorably to other similarity measures, and it is flexible enough to allow the user to make comparisons without any additional dictionary or corpus information. We believe that this method can be applied in a variety of text knowledge representation and discovery applications.",

Semantic similarity measures are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). This paper presents a new Web-based method for measuring the semantic similarity between words. Different from other methods which are based on taxonomy or search engine in Internet, our method uses snippets from Wikipedia1 to calculate the semantic similarity between words by using cosine similarity and TF-IDF. Also, the stemmer algorithm and stop words are used in preprocessing the snippets from Wikipedia. We set different threshold to evaluate our results in order to decrease the interference from noise and redundancy. Our method was empirically evaluated using Rubenstein-Good enough benchmark dataset. It gives higher correlation value (with 0.615) than some existing methods.

The two types of thermoplastic starch-based nano-biocomposites (S/CHNC and S/CHNF) were characterized and compared in terms of morphology, chemical and crystal structure, thermal and mechanical properties, and water resistance. In general, all thermoplastic starch-based nano-biocomposites showed better thermal stability, mechanical properties, and storage modulus than thermoplastic starch matrix without chitin nano-size fillers. This can be linked to the good dispersion of the nano-size fillers in the matrix, resulting from their chemical similarity, and also to the strong nano-size fillers-matrix adhesion by hydrogen bonding interactions. The results showed that the final properties of the nano-biocomposites were dependent of the concentration and type of chitin nano-size filler introduced in the thermoplastic starch matrix. In general, the thermoplastic starch-based nano-biocomposites prepared with chitin nanofibers showed better thermal and mechanical properties and storage modulus than those prepared with chitin nanocrystals. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

Much of the attention has historically focused on structural similarity, which can be defined in many forms and flavors. A concept that is frequently overlooked in the realm of the QSAR applicability domain is how the local activity landscape plays a role in how accurate a prediction is or is not. In this work, we describe an approach that pairs information about both the chemical similarity and activity landscape of a test compound's neighborhood into a single calculated confidence value. We also present an approach for converting this value into an interpretable confidence metric that has a simple and informative meaning across data sets. The approach will be introduced to the reader in the context of models built upon four diverse literature data sets. The steps we will outline include the definition of similarity used to determine nearest neighbors (NN), how we incorporate the NN activity landscape with a similarity-weighted root-mean-square distance (wRMSD) value, and how that value is then calibrated to generate an intuitive confidence metric for prospective application. Finally, we will illustrate the prospective performance of the approach on five proprietary models whose predictions and confidence metrics have been tracked for more than a year.",

We evaluate alternative strategies to select subsets of these fragments, with the aim of maximizing the coverage of known druglike chemical space with a strongly reduced set of fragments. For these evaluations, we use the Ftrees fragment space method.

        "abstract": "It is well-known that both similarity and contrast play an important role in language. What is much less clear, however, is why one aspect of language is sensitive to similarity while another is under the sway of contrast. This article develops a theory that allows one to predict under which circumstances similarity wins out over contrast and vice versa. Five diverse areas of language, to wit language structure, change, use, acquisition, and loss are scrutinized in an effort to erect this theory on a fairly broad empirical basis. In all of these areas, the paradigmatic axis is found to generate similarity effects whereas the syntagmatic axis gives rise to both similarity and contrast. Whether similarity or contrast prevails on the syntagmatic dimension depends on the linear distance between the critical units. When these are very close together, contrast predominates. With increasing distance, however, contrast gives way to similarity, with a hypersimilarity effect occurring briefly in between. These results are interpreted within a model in which linguistic structure and change are understood as a response to processing strategies and biases. The representational side of the model provides a measure of determining similarity and contrast relationships between linguistic units, whereas the processing side is responsible for the strength of similarity and contrast in specific constellations. While the theory is detailed for the phonological domain, it holds the potential of being more widely applicable.",

The model does not lump customer demand into zones, but rather deals with individual customer demand to directly address customer preferred mode of transport at each location. Historical records can be used to fix decision variables in the model so that a base case can be computed to validate the model and contrast it against the optimized network. The details inherent in this approach allow the optimization results to be partitioned and prioritized for implementation. The model results are processed to assign cost components to individual customer records. A simple case study is presented to illustrate the method and actual industrial results are reviewed.",

        "title": "A novel approach for measuring hyperspectral similarity",
        "abstract": "Hyperspectral measures are used to capture the degree of similarity between two spectra. Spectral angle mapper (SAM) is an example of such measures. SAM similarity values range from 0 to 1. These values do not indicate whether the two spectra are similar or not. A static similarity threshold is imposed to recognize similar and dissimilar spectra. Adjusting such threshold is a troublesome process. To overcome this problem, the proposed approach aims to develop learnable hyperspectral measures. This is done through using hyperspectral measures values as similarity patterns and employing a classifier. The classifier acts as an adaptive similarity threshold. The derived similarity patterns are flexible, as they are able to capture the specific notion of similarity that is appropriate for each spectral region. Two similarity patterns are proposed. The first pattern is the cosine similarity vector for the second spectral derivative pair. The second pattern is a composite vector of different similarity measures values. The proposed approach is applied on full hyperspectral space and subspaces. Experiments were conducted on a challenging benchmark dataset. Experimental results showed that, classifications based on second patterns were far better than first patterns. This is because first patterns were concerned only with the geometrical features of the spectral signatures, while second patterns combined various discriminatory features such as: orthogonal projections information, correlation coefficients, and probability distributions produced by the spectral signatures. The proposed approach results are statistically significant. This implies that using simple learnable measures outperforms complex and manually tuned techniques used in classification. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an explosion in the availability of publicly accessible chemical information, including chemical structures of small molecules, structure-derived properties and associated biological activities in a variety of assays. These data sources present us with a significant opportunity to develop and apply computational tools to extract and understand the underlying structure-activity relationships. Furthermore, by integrating chemical data sources with biological information (protein structure, gene expression and so on), we can attempt to build up a holistic view of the effects of small molecules in biological systems. Equally important is the ability for non-experts to access and utilize state of the art cheminformatics method and models. In this review we present recent developments in cheminformatics methodologies and infrastructure that provide a robust, distributed approach to mining large and complex chemical datasets. In the area of methodology development, we highlight recent work on characterizing structure-activity landscapes, Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) model domain applicability and the use of chemical similarity in text mining. In the area of infrastructure, we discuss a distributed web services framework that allows easy deployment and uniform access to computational (statistics, cheminformatics and computational chemistry) methods, data and models. We also discuss the development of PubChem derived databases and highlight techniques that allow us to scale the infrastructure to extremely large compound collections, by use of distributed processing on Grids. Given that the above work is applicable to arbitrary types of cheminformatics problems, we also present some case studies related to virtual screening for anti-malarials and predictions of anti-cancer activity.",

In silico prediction of chemical liabilities is an important approach which can reduce costs and animal testing by complementing or replacing in vitro and in vivo liability models. There is a lack of integrated, extensible decision support systems for chemical liability assessment which run quickly and have easily interpretable results. Here we present a method which integrates similarity searches, structural alerts, and QSAR models which all are available from the Bioclipse workbench. Emphasis has been placed on interpretation of results, and substructures which are important for predictions are highlighted in the original chemical structures. This allows for interactively changing chemical structures with instant visual feedback and can be used for hypothesis testing of single chemical structures as well as compound collections. The system has a clear separation between methods and data, and the extensible architecture enables straightforward extension via addition of more plugins (such as new data sets and computational models). We demonstrate our method on three important safety end points: mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation.

        "abstract": "Computing the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of a partially folded protein structure from the folded state requires the two structures to be translationally and rotationally aligned. We examine the constraint matrix L that preserves orthogonality of the rotation matrix during minimization of the RMSD. L is proportional to the sensitivity of the RMSD to the rotational alignment matrix. Its trace yields an isotropic reaction coordinate, while its off-diagonal matrix elements are related to the moment of inertia derivative tensor that encodes anisotropic information about the structure. We use L to compare ??-repressor fragment 6-85 (?? 6-85) to several partially folded structures obtained from molecular dynamics simulation (MD), and find that L as a reaction coordinate indeed encodes some information about protein topology. We also apply C ?? RMSD, L and tryptophan sidechain mobility as criteria for native state structural fluctuations of several ?? 6-85 mutants. The mutants' denaturation curves and fluorescence quenching are measured experimentally for comparison. The results are in accord with a recent proposal that structural fluctuations near the chromophore can induce increased native state fluorescence or hyperfluorescence during unfolding of proteins. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, wear protection and friction modification by engine oil is provided by zinc dithiophosphate (ZDDP) or other phosphorus compounds. These additives provide effective wear protection and friction control on engine parts through formation of a glassy polyphosphate antiwear film. However, the deposition of phosphorus species on automotive catalytic converters from lubricants has been known for some time to have a detrimental effect of poisoning the catalysts. To mitigate the situation, the industry has been making every effort to find ZDDP-replacement additives that are friendly to catalysts. Toward this goal we have investigated a titanium additive chemistry as a ZDDP replacement. Fully formulated engine oils incorporating this additive component have been found to be effective in reducing wear and controlling friction in a high-frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR), 4-ball bench wear, Sequence IIIG, and Sequence IVA engine tests. Surface analysis of the tested parts by Auger electron spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have shown that Ti species have been incorporated into the wear tracks and can only be found on the wear tracks. We used synchrotron based near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) to investigate the chemical bonding mechanism of the Ti additive with the metal surface that affects the wear improvement mechanism. We postulate that Ti provides antiwear enhancement through inclusion in the metal/metal oxide structure of the ferrous surface by forming FeTiO3.",

Replicated analyses across samples, designs, and manipulations showed that actual security and self similarity predicted attraction. With regard to perceptual factors, ideal similarity, self similarity, and security all were significant predictors. Whereas perceptual ideal and self similarity had incremental predictive power, perceptual security's effects were subsumed by perceptual ideal similarity. Perceptual self similarity fully mediated actual attachment similarity effects, whereas ideal similarity was only a partial mediator.",

Our idea is to break down the molecular conformation into the local conformations of neighbor atoms with respect to core atoms. This local geometry can be implicitly accessed by the trajectories of the neighboring atoms, which are emerge by rotatable bonds. In our approach, the physicochemical atomic similarity, which can be used in structured similarity measures, is augmented by a local flexibility similarity, which gives a rough estimate of the similarity of the local conformational space. We incorporated this new type of encoding the flexibility into the optimal assignment molecular similarity approach, which can be used as a pseudokernel in support vector machines. The impact of the local flexibility was evaluated on several published QSAR data sets. This lead to an improvement of the model quality on 9 out of 10 data sets compared to the unmodified optimal assignment kernel.",

        "abstract": "The 4D-QSAR paradigm has been used to develop a formalism to estimate molecular similarity measures as a function of conformation, alignment, and atom type. It is possible to estimate the molecular similarity of pairs of molecules based upon the entire ensemble of conformational states each molecule can adopt at a given temperature, normally room temperature. Molecular similarity can be measured in terms of the types of atoms composing each molecule leading to multiple measures of molecular similarity. Multiple measures of molecular similarity can also arise from using different alignment rules to perform relative molecular similarity, RMS, analysis. An alignment independent method of determining molecular similarity measures, referred to as absolute molecular similarity, AMS, analysis has been developed. Various sets and libraries of compounds, including the amino acids, are analyzed using 4D-QSAR molecular similarity analysis to demonstrate the features of the formalism. Exploration of molecular similarity as a function of chirality, identification of common embedded 3D pharmacophores in compounds, and elucidation of 3D-isosteric compounds from structurally diverse libraries are carried out in the application studies.",

With the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies, research on measuring mobile user similarity based on their trajectories has attracted a lot of attention. However, trajectories imply only short-term mobile regularities, and thus users' long-term activity similarity is difficult to be captured. In this paper, we address the problem of mining users' long-term activity similarity based on their trajectories. To solve this problem, we propose a two-stage approach. At the first stage, the notion of routine activity is proposed to capture users' long-term activity regularities. The routine activities of a user are extracted from his/her daily trajectories. At the second stage, user similarity is calculated hierarchically based on the extracted routine activities. Finally, we evaluated our approach based on both real and artificial datasets. The experimental results show that users with different profiles can be discriminated on the basis of our similarity metric, and thus demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

It is based on the detection of bit patterns in keyed fingerprints that are signatures of specific compound classes. Application of scaling factors to consensus bits that are mostly set on emphasizes signature bit patterns during similarity searching and has been shown to improve search results for different fingerprints. Similarity search profiling has recently been introduced as a method to analyze similarity search calculations. Profiles separately monitor correctly identified hits and other detected database compounds as a function of similarity threshold values and make it possible to estimate whether virtual screening calculations can be successful or to evaluate why they fail. This similarity search profile technique has been applied here to study fingerprint scaling in detail and better understand effects that are responsible for its performance. In particular, we have focused on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of similarity search profiles under scaling conditions. Therefore, we have carried out systematic similarity search calculations for 23 biological activity classes under scaling conditions over a wide range of scaling factors in a compound database containing approximately 1.3 million molecules and monitored these calculations in similarity search profiles. Analysis of these profiles confirmed increases in hit rates as a consequence of scaling and revealed that scaling influences similarity search calculations in different ways. Based on scaled similarity search profiles, compound sets could be divided into different categories. In a number of cases, increases in search performance under scaling conditions were due to a more significant relative increase in correctly identified hits than detected false-positives. This was also consistent with the finding that preferred similarity threshold values increased due to fingerprint scaling, which was well illustrated by similarity search profiling.",

In this Account, we discuss systems whose behavior is governed by oscillations in the concentration of hydrogen ion. The first chemical oscillators driven by changes in pH were developed a quarter century ago. Since then, about two dozen new pH oscillators, systems in which the periodic variation in pH is not just an indicator but an essential prerequisite of the oscillatory behavior, have been discovered. Mechanistic understanding of their behavior has grown, and new ideas for their practical application have been proposed and, in some cases, tested. Here we present a catalog of the known pH oscillators, divide them into mechanistically based categories based on whether they involve a single oxidant and reductant or an oxidant and a pair of reductants, and describe general mechanisms for these two major classes of systems. We also describe in detail the chemistry of one example from each class, hydrogen peroxide-sulfide and ferricyanide-iodate-sulfite. Finally, we consider actual and potential applications. These include using pH oscillators to induce oscillation in species that would otherwise be nonoscillatory, creating novel spatial patterns, generating periodic transitions between vesicle and micelle states, stimulating switching between folded and random coil states of DNA, building molecular motors, and designing pulsating drug delivery systems. We point out the importance for future applications of finding a batch pH oscillator, one that oscillates in a closed system for an extended period of time, and comment on the progress that has been made toward that goal.",

Results show that increasing chemical similarity between monomer and organoclay dispersant as well as enhanced polar/nonpolar interaction facilitates exfoliation. Organoclays modified with nonpolar dispersants only intercalates in polar polymers. Conversely, exfoliation of the nonpolar organoclay is facilitated in increasingly nonpolar polymers. A set of quaternary ammonium surfactants modified with methacrylate or thiol functionalities were used as dispersants for new organoclays. These polymerizable organoclays exfoliate more readily in a number of monomer systems as compared to nonpolymerizable organoclays. For polymerizable organoclays, the position of the reactive functional group and the type of functionality influence the degree of exfoliation. Methacrylate functionalized organoclays in which the reactive moiety is located away from the clay surface exfoliates before photopolymerization. Thiol functionalized organoclays disperse in a mixture of intercalated and exfoliated domains but exfoliate to a larger degree due to copolymerization of thiol and acrylate species in the clay galleries. Polymerizable organoclay systems exhibit higher storage modulus, glass transition temperatures, and enhanced photopolymerization behavior when compared to the nonpolymerizable analogues.",

A useful classification that covers a wide range of chemical products consists of basic chemicals, industrial products and consumer-configured products. Another classification focused on usage properties makes the distinction between homogeneous and structured products. In this chapter, a framework is proposed for integrating product development with process design and manufacturing. A powerful systematic method for managing new product projects is Quality Function Development. The formalisation is achieved by the concept of House of Quality. A central issue in product development is the assessment of product properties, and the impact on the environment. The prediction of properties in a broad sense is assisted today by sophisticated computer methods such as QSPR (Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship) and QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship).

In the past, several approaches to assess similarity by evaluating the knowledge modelled in an ontology have been proposed. However, in many domains, knowledge is dispersed through several partial and/or overlapping ontologies. Because most previous works on semantic similarity only support a unique input ontology, we propose a method to enable similarity estimation across multiple ontologies. Our method identifies different cases according to which ontology/ies input terms belong. We propose several heuristics to deal with each case, aiming to solve missing values, when partial knowledge is available, and to capture the strongest semantic evidence that results in the most accurate similarity assessment, when dealing with overlapping knowledge. We evaluate and compare our method using several general purpose and biomedical benchmarks of word pairs whose similarity has been assessed by human experts, and several general purpose (WordNet) and biomedical ontologies (SNOMED CT and MeSH). Results show that our method is able to improve the accuracy of similarity estimation in comparison to single ontology approaches and against state of the art related works in multi-ontology similarity assessment.",

        "abstract": "Music similarity underlies a large part of a listener's experience, as it relates to familiarity and associations between different pieces or parts. Rhythmic similarity has received scant research attention in comparison with other aspects of music similarity such as melody or harmony. Mathematical measures of rhythmic similarity have been proposed, but none of them has been compared to human judgments. We present a first study consisting of two listening tests conducted to compare two mathematical similarity measures, the chronotonic distance and the directed swap distance, to perceptual measures of similarity. In order to investigate the effect of expertise on the perception of rhythmic similarity, we contrasted three groups of participants, namely non-musicians, classically trained percussionists and flamenco musicians. Results are presented in terms of statistical analysis of the raw ratings, phylogenetic analysis of the dissimilarity matrices, correlation with mathematical measures and qualitative analysis of spontaneous verbal descriptions reported by participants. A main effect of expertise was observed on the raw ratings, but not on the dissimilarity matrices. No effect of tempo was observed. Results of both listening tests converge to show that the directed-swap distance best matches human judgments of similarity regardless of expertise. The analysis of verbal descriptions indicates that novice listeners focused on 'surface' features, while musicians focused on the underlying rhythmic structure and used more specialized vocabulary.",

        "abstract": "The unprecedented evolution of social media has led to the exploitation of the new technologies with the purpose of encouraging closer social relationships at the individual and group levels. One of the most prolific cooperation forms was objectified through the online social networks, a catalytic form of interaction that allows individuals to stay constantly connected and to exploit the complex nature of the communication devices and services. Starting from this point, the paper discusses the main forms of similarity which stand for the basis of interaction and communication among the members of Facebook social networks. The proposed approaches to similarity address the mechanisms which encourage the formation and the development of strong online social networks: the similarity as a condition, the similarity as a context, the similarity as a catalyzer, the similarity as a consequence and the similarity as a connection. The configuration of these dimensions in the context of the online social networks was tested by analyzing the case of Facebook online social networks. Each of the five dimensions was marked out from the perspective of a sociological interview-based inquiry conducted with fourteen students from a communication college. With a view to better illustrate certain findings, an online social network analysis was performed. As the preliminary results showed, Facebook, as an online social network, is used by the respondents especially for social searching and bonding social capital rather than social browsing which concerns the initiation of new contacts with unknown individuals in the direct interaction. In fact, the most important function of these communities is to allow members to discover other sources of similarity and to potentiate the similarity discovered in the offline environment through consistent communication and interaction.",

        "abstract": "Similarity testing is an important methodology in sensory and consumer research. It is of practical and theoretical significance. In many comparative experiments in sensory and consumer field, the objective is not to demonstrate difference but to demonstrate equivalence or similarity between treatments. It is widely acknowledged that the conventional hypothesis test with the null hypothesis of \"no difference\" between two treatments is appropriate for difference testing but inappropriate for similarity testing. Schuirmann [Biometrics 37 (1981) 617] introduced the use of interval hypotheses testing in the context of bioequivalence. For the interval hypotheses testing, the null hypothesis is that the difference between two treatments is larger than a specified non-zero value defining equivalence or similarity and the alternative hypothesis is that the difference is smaller than the specified value. If the null hypothesis is rejected, equivalence or similarity is then concluded. Based on this concept and approach, the present paper discusses some statistical procedures of similarity testing used for different situations in sensory and consumer research. The procedures include similarity testing for hedonic or intensity rating means, similarity testing using conventional discrimination methods (forced choice methods and the methods with response bias) and similarity testing for preference proportions. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It is concluded that the phase aberration resulting from thermal deformation and thermo-optic effects comply completely with similarity-based scaling, while the phase aberration resulting from elasto-optic effects scales approximately.

Previous attempts to model similarity have captured effects of either featural or structural similarity, but typically not both. We simulated both by fitting similarity data with the LISA model of relational reasoning [Hummel, J. E., & Holyoak, K. J. (1997). Distributed representations of structure: A theory of analogical access and mapping. Psychological Review, 104, 427-466, Hummel, J. E., & Holyoak, K. J. (2003a). A symbolic-connectionist theory of relational inference and generalization. Psychological Review, 110, 220-264]. The same mechanisms LISA uses to simulate analogy also provide a natural account of feature-based similarity effects (e.g., violations of symmetry), structural effects (e.g., the advantage of alignable over non-alignable differences), and the combined effects of featural and structured information (i.e., MIPs and MOPs; \"Matches In/Out of Place\") on similarity judgments. Our approach differs from most models of similarity in that LISA was not originally designed to simulate similarity judgments, but rather analogical reasoning. LISA's incidental ability to simulate diverse similarity effects speaks to the plausibility of the model's account of human knowledge representation. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Location Israel. Methods Data on species composition of land snails and land birds were recorded in 27 sites of 1 x 1 km scattered across a rainfall gradient in Israel. Matrices of similarity in species composition between all pairs of sites were computed and analysed with respect to corresponding matrices of geographical distance and rainfall distance (defined as the difference in mean annual rainfall between sites, and used as a measure of environmental distance). Mantel tests were applied to determine the correlation between species similarity and each type of distance. Factors affecting the decay in species similarity were investigated by comparing different subsets of the data using randomization tests. Results Both rainfall distance and geographical distance had negative effects on species similarity. The effect of rainfall distance was statistically significant even after controlling for differences in geographical distance, and vice versa. The per-unit effect of rainfall distance on species similarity decreased with increasing geographical distance, indicating that the two types of distances interacted in determining the similarity in species composition. Snails showed a higher rate of decay in species similarity with geographical distance than birds, and large snails showed a higher rate of decay than small snails, which are better passive dispersers. The per-unit effects of both rainfall distance and geographical distance on species similarity were higher in the desert region than in the Mediterranean region. Analyses focusing on a grain size of 10 x 10 m showed a lower similarity in species composition and a lower rate of decay in species similarity with rainfall distance than analyses carried out at a grain size of 1 x 1 km. Main conclusions Patterns of similarity in species composition are influenced by the combined effects of environmental variation, the position of the area along environmental gradients, the dispersal properties of the component species, and the scale (both spatial extent and grain size) at which the patterns are examined.",

The technique matches all compounds from the infrared (IR) spectral database against all compounds from the mass-spectral database using their structural similarity. The structural similarity is estimated by comparing of structural fragment sets obtained for each database using preliminarily decomposing of all molecular graphs to exhaustive sets of structural fragments with 2-7 nodes.

High degree of structural similarity overlap provides new possibilities for structure elucidation using two spectral databases simultaneously. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

To verify that our descriptors capture musically relevant information, we incorporate our descriptors into similarity rating prediction and song year prediction tasks. We base our evaluation on a dataset of 15500 track excerpts of Western popular music, for which we obtain 7800 web-sourced pairwise similarity ratings. To assess the agreement among similarity ratings, we perform an evaluation under controlled conditions, obtaining a rank correlation of 0.33 between intersected sets of ratings. Combined with bag-of-features descriptors, we obtain performance gains of 18.5% and 9.9% for similarity rating prediction and song year prediction. For both tasks, analysis of selected descriptors reveals that representing features at multiple time scales benefits prediction accuracy.",

The best similarity algorithms compared to human experts were chosen and optimised by statistical means according to different contexts. A multidimensional scaling model of the algorithmic similarity measures is constructed to give an overiew over the different musical dimensions reflected by these measures.

Three experiments demonstrated consistent effects of phonological similarity on listening span. These effects appeared relatively insensitive to manipulations of task materials (Experiment 1) and differences in processing task demands (Experiments 2 and 3). The results were interpreted as reflecting a significant role for the phonological loop in supporting verbal complex span and a multicomponent view of working memory, as tapped by these tests. Phonological similarity did not significantly interact with aspects of the tasks varied across Experiments 1 to 3, suggesting a relative robustness of the effect. However, variation in the phonological similarity effect sizes across Experiments 1 to 3 supports the suggestion that task demands and characteristics have the potential to disrupt the phonological similarity effect and, by implication, the reliance on a phonological code.",

This paper proposes two similarity measures that can be used to evaluate the quality of a mid-surface model by comparing it to a solid model of the same part. Two similarity measures are proposed; firstly a geometric similarity evaluation technique based on the Hausdorff distance and secondly a topological similarity evaluation method which uses geometry graph attributes as the basis for comparison. Both measures are able to provide local and global similarity evaluation for the models. The proposed methods have been implemented in a software demonstrator and tested on a selection of representative models. They have been found to be effective for identifying geometric and topological errors in mid-surface models and are applicable to a wide range of practical thin-walled designs. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting profiles make it possible to determine whether a virtual screening trial can in principle succeed for a given compound class, search tool, similarity metric, and selection criterion. As a test case, we have analyzed virtual screening calculations using a recently designed fingerprint on 23 different biological activity classes in a compound source database containing approximately 1.3 million molecules.

These vital steps serve to highlight not only the great potential but just how much more remains to be done. The vast chemical and functional space of glycans remains to be truly explored. Top-down full-scale glycomic and glycoproteomic studies coupled with hypothesis-driven, bottom-up innovative chemical strategies will be required to properly realize the potential impact of glycoscience on human health, energy, and economy.

The analytical results were compared with those previously published for related Iranian sage species in order to identify chemical markers for these species. Salvia eremophila, S. hypoleuca, and S. reuteriana are endemic, while S. atropatana, S. chloroleuca, S. santolinifolia, S. aegyptiaca, and S. macrosiphon also grow wild in neighboring countries. We categorized the Iranian Salvia species into four main chemotypes according to their essential-oil constituents: those which are dominated by 1) monoterpenes, 2) mono- and sesquiterpenes, or 3) sesquiterpenes as the major constituents, and 4) those containing low-molecular-weight acids, aldehydes, and esters, and green-leaf volatiles (GLVs). Likely due to the chemical diversity of different Salvia chemotypes, this categorization was supported by principal component analysis (PCA) for the group sampled here, but not for the values reported in the literature. We identified the following chemical markers: \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, 1,8-cineol, linalool, and borneol in monoterpene-rich species, or \u03b2-caryophyllene, germacrene D, bicyclogermacrene, spathulenol, and caryophyllene oxide in sesquiterpene-rich species. Among these, \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-caryophyllene, and germacrene D are the most common and abundant in the Salvia species investigated. In accordance with their close biological taxonomy, the chemical similarity of the essential oils of S. santolinifolia and S. eremophila is so high that we may consider them chemically identical.",

Unlike LSA, we assume that similarity between features is known (say, from a synonym dictionary) and does not need to be learned from the data.We call the proposed similarity measure soft similarity. Similarity between features is common, for example, in natural language processing: words, n-grams, or syntactic n-grams can be somewhat different (which makes them different features) but still have much in common: for example, words \u201cplay\u201d and \u201cgame\u201d are different but related. When there is no similarity between features then our soft similarity measure is equal to the standard similarity. For this, we generalize the well-known cosine similarity measure in VSM by introducing what we call \u201csoft cosine measure\u201d. We propose various formulas for exact or approximate calculation of the soft cosine measure. For example, in one of them we consider for VSM a new feature space consisting of pairs of the original features weighted by their similarity. Again, for features that bear no similarity to each other, our formulas reduce to the standard cosine measure. Our experiments show that our soft cosine measure provides better performance in our case study: entrance exams question answering task at CLEF. In these experiments, we use syntactic n-grams as features and Levenshtein distance as the similarity between n-grams, measured either in characters or in elements of n-grams.",

In addition to the usual considerations of membrane science and technology, and of membrane materials or membrane cells per se, another item of interest lies in establishing the derivations and process-type calculations involved in predicting the degree of membrane separation that can be attained. It is a matter more complicated than ordinarily thought or expected, and is allied with the unit operations concept as embodied in chemical and process engineering. Some recent developments in membrane processes for the separation of organic liquids have been previously noted, as has the use of hyperfiltration as applied in ethanol recovery. Filtration per se is of relevance in the processing of nonpasteurized beers, for example in the separation of spent yeasts after fermentation. The more modern embodiment for the membrane separation notably of gases is the diffusion-type mechanism, whereby the gases actually dissolve in the material and pass through by molecular diffusion. Another embodiment is the facilitated transport membrane, which acts as an absorber on the high-pressure side and as an absorbent regenerator on the low-pressure side. Investigations have also been made concerning liquid membranes. Metal or metallic membranes are also under study, as are ceramics, whereas the usual materials are polymeric in nature. Metallic and ceramic membranes can be used at higher temperatures and may also serve as membrane reactors\u2014that is, permit the concurrent removal of reaction products so as to enhance the conversion.",

Due to random projection, SketchSort misses a certain fraction of neighbors (i.e., false negatives). Nevertheless, the expected fraction of false negatives is theoretically derived and can be kept under a very small value. Experiments show that SketchSort is much faster than other similarity search methods and enables us to obtain a PubChem-scale similarity network quickly.",

Since the basic analytical theory is now available to treat the transitions, it is possible to comprehend the dynamics of realistic chemical and biological systems with the effects of transitions taken into account properly. Another important quantum mechanical effect of tunneling can also be taken into account. Furthermore, it becomes feasible to control chemical dynamics by controlling the non-adiabatic transitions at conical intersections, and also to develop new molecular functions by using peculiar properties of non-adiabatic transitions. These may be realized, if we apply appropriately designed laser fields. This perspective review article explains the above mentioned ideas based on the authors' recent activities.

In an application of QSM to atoms, the new QSM and its corresponding quantum similarity index (QSI) are evaluated throughout the periodic table, using the atomic electron densities and shape functions calculated in the Hartree-Fock approximation. The periodicity of Mendeleev's table is regained for the first time through the evaluation of a QSM. Evaluation of the information theory based QSI demonstrates, however, that the patterns of periodicity are lost due to the renormalization of the QSM, yielding chemically less appealing results for the QSI. A comparison of the information content of a given atom on top of a group with the information content of the elements in the subsequent rows reveals another periodicity pattern. Relativistic effects on the electronic density functions of atoms are investigated.

However, in previous studies, the indexes were always isolated and the candidate proteins were often limited to a small subset of the human genome.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Based on the correlations observed in pharmacological and genomic spaces, we develop a computational framework, drugCIPHER, to infer drug-target interactions in a genome-wide scale. Three linear regression models are proposed, which respectively relate drug therapeutic similarity, chemical similarity and their combination to the relevance of the targets on the basis of a protein-protein interaction network. Typically, the model integrating both drug therapeutic similarity and chemical similarity, drugCIPHER-MS, achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.988 in the training set and 0.935 in the test set. Based on drugCIPHER-MS, a genome-wide map of drug biological fingerprints for 726 drugs is constructed, within which unexpected drug-drug relations emerged in 501 cases, implying possible novel applications or side effects.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings demonstrate that the integration of phenotypic and chemical indexes in pharmacological space and protein-protein interactions in genomic space can not only speed the genome-wide identification of drug targets but also find new applications for the existing drugs.",

The increasing availability of large amounts of spatio-temporal data pertaining to an individual\u2019s trajectories has given rise to a variety of geographic information systems, and also brings us opportunities and challenges to automatically discover valuable knowledge from these trajectories. In this paper, we move towards this direction and aim to geographically mine the similarity between users based on their location histories. Such user similarity is significant to individuals, communities and businesses by helping them effectively retrieve the information with high relevance. A framework, referred to as hierarchical- graph-based similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed for geographic information systems to consistently model each individual\u2019s location history and effectively measure the similarity among users. In this framework, we take into account both the sequence property of people\u2019s movement behaviors and the hierarchy property of geographic spaces. We evaluate this framework using the GPS data collected by 65 volunteers over a period of 6 months in the real world. As a result, HGSM outperforms related similarity measures, such as the cosine similarity and Pearson similarity measures",

        "abstract": "Humans are attracted to similar others. As a consequence, social networks are homogeneous in sociodemographic, intrapersonal, and other characteristics--a principle called homophily. Despite abundant evidence showing the importance of interpersonal similarity and homophily for human relationships, their behavioral correlates and cognitive foundations are poorly understood. Here, we show that perceived similarity substantially increases altruistic punishment, a key mechanism underlying human cooperation. We induced (dis)similarity perception by manipulating basic cognitive mechanisms in an economic cooperation game that included a punishment phase. We found that similarity-focused participants were more willing to punish others' uncooperative behavior. This influence of similarity is not explained by group identity, which has the opposite effect on altruistic punishment. Our findings demonstrate that pure similarity promotes reciprocity in ways known to encourage cooperation. At the same time, the increased willingness to punish norm violations among similarity-focused participants provides a rationale for why similar people are more likely to build stable social relationships. Finally, our findings show that altruistic punishment is differentially involved in encouraging cooperation under pure similarity vs. in-group conditions.",

        "abstract": "Learning an appropriate (dis)similarity function from the available data is a central problem in machine learning, since the success of many machine learning algorithms critically depends on the choice of a similarity function to compare examples. Despite many approaches to similarity metric learning that have been proposed, there has been little theoretical study on the links between similarity metric learning and the classification performance of the resulting classifier. In this letter, we propose a regularized similarity learning formulation associated with general matrix norms and establish their generalization bounds. We show that the generalization error of the resulting linear classifier can be bounded by the derived generalization bound of similarity learning. This shows that a good generalization of the learned similarity function guarantees a good classification of the resulting linear classifier. Our results extend and improve those obtained by Bellet, Habrard, and Sebban (2012). Due to the techniques dependent on the notion of uniform stability (Bousquet & Elisseeff, 2002), the bound obtained there holds true only for the Frobenius matrix-norm regularization. Our techniques using the Rademacher complexity (Bartlett & Mendelson, 2002) and its related Khinchin-type inequality enable us to establish bounds for regularized similarity learning formulations associated with general matrix norms, including sparse L1-norm and mixed (2,1)-norm.",

        "abstract": "Formal computational models of human memory posit a central role of feature representations in episodic memory encoding and retrieval [1-4]. Correspondingly, fMRI studies have found that, in addition to activity level [5, 6], the neural activation pattern similarity across repetitions (i.e., self-similarity) was greater for subsequently remembered than forgotten items [7-9]. This self-similarity has been suggested to reflect pattern reinstatement due to study-phase retrieval [7, 10, 11]. However, the low temporal resolution of fMRI measures could determine neither the temporal precision of study-phase reinstatement nor the processing stage at which the reinstatement supported subsequent memory [12]. Meanwhile, although self-similarity has been shown to correlate with the activity level in the left lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) [10, 13], a causal link between left LPFC function and pattern similarity remains to be established. Combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and EEG, we found that greater spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS) across repetitions of the same item (i.e., self-STPS) during encoding predicted better subsequent memory. The self-STPS located in the right frontal electrodes occurred approximately 500 ms after stimulus onset, reflected item-specific encoding, and contributed to memory above and beyond the effects of ERP amplitude and global pattern similarity (i.e., similarity to all other items in memory space). Anodal stimulation over the left LPFC specifically enhanced memory performance and item-specific STPS in the right frontal electrodes. These results support a causal role of LPFC in enhancing STPS and memory and contribute to a mechanistic understanding of memory formation.",

        "abstract": "A key task in social network and other complex network analysis is role analysis: describing and categorizing nodes according to how they interact with other nodes. Two nodes have the same role if they interact with equivalent sets of neighbors. The most fundamental role equivalence is automorphic equivalence. Unfortunately, the fastest algorithms known for graph automorphism are nonpolynomial. Moreover, since exact equivalence may be rare, a more meaningful task is to measure the role similarity between any two nodes. This task is closely related to the structural or link-based similarity problem that SimRank attempts to solve. However, SimRank and most of its offshoots are not sufficient because they do not fully recognize automorphically or structurally equivalent nodes. In this paper we tackle two problems. First, what are the necessary properties for a role similarity measure or metric? Second, how can we derive a role similarity measure satisfying these properties? For the first problem, we justify several axiomatic properties necessary for a role similarity measure or metric: range, maximal similarity, automorphic equivalence, transitive similarity, and the triangle inequality. For the second problem, we present RoleSim, a new similarity metric with a simple iterative computational method. We rigorously prove that RoleSim satisfies all the axiomatic properties. We also introduce an iceberg RoleSim algorithm which can guarantee to discover all pairs with RoleSim score no less than a user-defined threshold $\\theta$ without computing the RoleSim for every pair. We demonstrate the superior interpretative power of RoleSim on both both synthetic and real datasets.",

Here we present similarity maps, a straightforward and general strategy to visualize the atomic contributions to the similarity between two molecules or the predicted probability of a ML model.

        "abstract": "The governing equations for the two-point velocity correlations in the far field of the axisymmetric jet are examined and it is shown that these equations can have equilibrium similarity solutions for jets with finite Reynolds number that retain a dependence on the growth rate of the jet. The two-point velocity correlation can be written as the product of a scale that depends on the downstream position of the two points and a function that only depends on the similarity variables. Physically, this result implies that the turbulent processes producing and dissipating energy at the different scales of motion, as well as transferring energy between the different scales of motion, are in equilibrium as the flow evolves downstream. A particularly interesting prediction from the analysis is that the two-point similarity solutions depend only on the separation distance between the points in the streamwise similarity coordinate (i.e. N = - ), that is, the logarithm of the streamwise coordinate itself (i.e. = ln x1, where x1 is measured from a virtual origin). Thus, the measures of the turbulence are homogeneous in the streamwise similarity coordinate. The predictions from the similarity analysis forthe streamwise two-point velocity correlation were compared with combined hot-wire and LDA measurements on the centreline of a round jet at a Reynolds number of 33000, and with two-point velocity correlations computed from PIV measurements in a round jet at a Reynolds number of 2000 performed by Fukushima et al. In both cases, the measured two-point velocity correlations in the streamwise direction collapsed when they were scaled in the manner predicted by the similarity analysis. The results provide further evidence that the equilibrium similarity hypothesis does describe the development of the flow in fully developed turbulent round jets and that the two-point correlations are statistically homogeneous in the streamwise similarity coordinate. 2007 Cambridge University Press.",

        "title": "Surface similarity-based molecular query-retrieval.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Discerning the similarity between molecules is a challenging problem in drug discovery as well as in molecular biology. The importance of this problem is due to the fact that the biochemical characteristics of a molecule are closely related to its structure. Therefore molecular similarity is a key notion in investigations targeting exploration of molecular structural space, query-retrieval in molecular databases, and structure-activity modelling. Determining molecular similarity is related to the choice of molecular representation. Currently, representations with high descriptive power and physical relevance like 3D surface-based descriptors are available. Information from such representations is both surface-based and volumetric. However, most techniques for determining molecular similarity tend to focus on idealized 2D graph-based descriptors due to the complexity that accompanies reasoning with more elaborate representations. RESULTS: This paper addresses the problem of determining similarity when molecules are described using complex surface-based representations. It proposes an intrinsic, spherical representation that systematically maps points on a molecular surface to points on a standard coordinate system (a sphere). Molecular surface properties such as shape, field strengths, and effects due to field super-positioning can then be captured as distributions on the surface of the sphere. Surface-based molecular similarity is subsequently determined by computing the similarity of the surface-property distributions using a novel formulation of histogram-intersection. The similarity formulation is not only sensitive to the 3D distribution of the surface properties, but is also highly efficient to compute. CONCLUSION: The proposed method obviates the computationally expensive step of molecular pose-optimisation, can incorporate conformational variations, and facilitates highly efficient determination of similarity by directly comparing molecular surfaces and surface-based properties. Retrieval performance, applications in structure-activity modeling of complex biological properties, and comparisons with existing research and commercial methods demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the approach.",

In particular, given a policy P, the similarity measure assigns a ranking (similarity score) to each policy compared with P.

        "abstract": "All clustering methods have to assume some cluster relationship among the data objects that they are applied on. Similarity between a pair of objects can be defined either explicitly or implicitly. In this paper, we introduce a novel multiviewpoint-based similarity measure and two related clustering methods. The major difference between a traditional dissimilarity/similarity measure and ours is that the former uses only a single viewpoint, which is the origin, while the latter utilizes many different viewpoints, which are objects assumed to not be in the same cluster with the two objects being measured. Using multiple viewpoints, more informative assessment of similarity could be achieved. Theoretical analysis and empirical study are conducted to support this claim. Two criterion functions for document clustering are proposed based on this new measure. We compare them with several well-known clustering algorithms that use other popular similarity measures on various document collections to verify the advantages of our proposal.",

We are investigating whether it benefits users to have sets of thumbnails arranged according to their mutual similarity, so images that are alike are placed together. There are, of course, many possible definitions of \u201csimilarity\u201d: so far we have explored measurements based on low-level visual features, and on the textual captions assigned to the images. Here we describe two experiments, both involving designers as the participants, examining whether similarity-based arrangements of the candidate images are helpful for a picture selection task. Firstly, the two types of similarity-based arrangement were informally compared. Then, an arrangement based on visual similarity was more formally compared with a control of a random arrangement. We believe this work should be of interest to anyone designing a system that involves presenting sets of images to users.",

We examine the use of simple readily available syntactic\\nimage features combined with other multimodal features to derive a\\nsimilarity measure that captures the weak semantics of an image. The\\nweak semantics can be seen as an intermediate step between low level\\nimage understanding and full semantic image understanding. We\\ninvestigate the use of single modalities alone and see how the\\ncombination of modalities affect the similarity measures.

In large-scale genre classification experiments carried out on real-world artist collections, we analyze several thousand combinations of settings/parameters that influence the similarity calculation process, and investigate in which way they impact the quality of the similarity estimates. Accurate similarity measures for music are vital for many applications, such as automated playlist generation, music recommender systems, music information systems, or intelligent user interfaces to access music collections by means beyond text-based browsing.

PBC provides a quantitative characterization of the texture's structuredness and directionality for browsing application, and the SRC characterizes the distribution of texture energy in different subbands, and supports similarity retrieval.

        "abstract": "Question: The utility of beta (beta-) diversity measures that incorporate information about the degree of taxonomic (dis) similarity between species plots is becoming increasingly recognized. In this framework, the question for this study is: can we de. ne an ecologically meaningful index of beta-diversity that, besides indicating simple species turnover, is able to account for taxonomic similarity amongst species in plots? Methods: First, the properties of existing measures of taxonomic similarity measures are briefly reviewed. Next, a new measure of plot-to-plot taxonomic similarity is presented that is based on the maximal common subgraph of two taxonomic trees. The proposed measure is computed from species presences and absences and include information about the degree of higher-level taxonomic similarity between species plots. The performance of the proposed measure with respect to existing coefficients of taxonomic similarity and the coefficient of Jaccard is discussed using a small data set of heath plant communities. Finally, a method to quantify beta-diversity from taxonomic dissimilarities is discussed. Results: The proposed measure of taxonomic beta-diversity incorporates not only species richness, but also information about the degree of higher-order taxonomic structure between species plots. In this view, it comes closer to a modern notion of biological diversity than more traditional measures of beta-diversity. From regression analysis between the new coefficient and existing measures of taxonomic similarity it is shown that there is an evident nonlinearity between the coefficients. This nonlinearity demonstrates that the new coefficient measures similarity in a conceptually different way from previous indices. Also, in good agreement with the findings of previous authors, the regression between the new index and the Jaccard coefficient of similarity shows that more than 80% of the variance of the former is explained by the community structure at the species level, while only the residual variance is explained by differences in the higher-order taxonomic structure of the species plots. This means that a genuine taxonomic approach to the quanti. cation of plot-to-plot similarity is only needed if we are interested in the residual system's variation that is related to the higher-order taxonomic structure of a pair of species plots.",

        "abstract": "The emerging concept of the activity landscape has been widely applied for structure-activity relationships (SAR) characterization. Since chemical space representation plays a crucial role in activity landscape modeling, an adequate selection of similarity measures is desirable. Herein a set of 658 cyclooxygenase inhibitors were structurally analyzed using 12 molecular similarity representations and two levels of chemotype classification. Then, three uncorrelated similarity measures and mean similarity (obtained with data fusion) were combined with chemotype information using the herein proposed chemotype-similarity graphs. Chemotype-similarity graphs showed the cumulative distribution of molecular pairs with the same and different chemotype along similarity values; leading to establish an interpretable, quantitative and activity independent threshold in similarity measures based on chemotype distributions. This approach gave additional information to similarity measures and can be considered as an interpretable criterion to define high and low similar compounds. The results were applied to model the activity landscape using Structure-Activity Similarity (SAS)-like maps. Some examples of pairs in each region of the SAS-like maps were analyzed which showed valuable SAR information for cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Copyright \u00a9 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Fuzzy tricentric pharmacophore (FPT) and ISIDA substructure counts are herein explored examples. Similarity search speed-up was achieved by positioning compounds on a SOM, then searching for analogues only in the neurons neighbouring the ones in which the query compounds reside. Smaller neighbourhood means shorter virtual screening (VS) time, but lower analogue retrieval rates. An enhancement criterion, conciliating the opposite trends is defined. It depends on map definition and build-up protocol (training set choice, map size, convergence criteria, ...). The main goal is to discover and validate SOMs of optimal quality with respect to this criterion. Increasing the size of the training set beyond a certain limit is shown to be unnecessary and even detrimental, suggesting that one SOM built on a relatively small but diverse training set may be an effective VS enhancer of a much larger database. Also, using an excessively large number of training iterations may lead to over-fitting. Gradual training with en-route checking of VS enhancement propensity is the best strategy to follow. Maps were successfully challenged to accelerate the large-scale VS of 12,000 queries against 160,000 compounds, and shown to provide a meaningful mapping of activity-annotated compounds in chemical space. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The appropriate QSAR models for the toxicity data were obtained separately employing partial least squares (PLS) regression combined with genetic algorithms (GA), as a variable selection method. The resulting QSAR models were used to identify molecular fragments of phenol derivatives whose electronic properties contribute significantly to the observed toxicities. Using this information, it was feasible to discriminate between the mechanisms of action of phenol toxicity to the studied strains. It was found that toxicities of phenols to all strains, except with L1210 Leukemia, are significantly affected by electronic features of the phenolic hydroxyl group (C-O-H). Meanwhile, the resulting models can describe the inductive and resonance effects of substituents on various toxicities.",

        "abstract": "Here, we introduce the DynaMAD algorithm that is designed to map database compounds to combinations of activity-class-dependent descriptor value ranges in order to identify novel active molecules. The method combines and extends key features of two previously developed algorithms, MAD and DMC. These methods were first described as compound-mapping algorithms for large-scale virtual screening applications. DynaMAD and DMC operate in chemical spaces of stepwise increasing dimensionality. However, in contrast to DMC, which utilizes binary transformed descriptors, DynaMAD uses unmodified descriptor value distributions. The performance of these mapping methods was compared in detail in virtual screening trials on 24 different compound activity classes against a background of about 2 million database compounds. In these calculations, all three approaches produced results of considerable predictive value, and the enrichment of active molecules in small selection sets consisting of only about 20 or fewer database compounds emerged as a common feature. Furthermore, mapping methods were capable of recognizing remote molecular similarity relationships. Overall, DynaMAD performed better than MAD and DMC, producing average hit and recovery rates of 55% and 33%, respectively, over all 24 classes. Taken together, our findings suggest that dynamic compound mapping to combinations of activity-class-selective descriptor settings has significant potential for molecular similarity analysis and ligand-based virtual screening.",

As a result, these measurements provide means to validate how well search engines acquire content from the web. In this paper, we propose five similarity schemes: three of them we adapted from existing graph similarity measures, and two we adapted from well-known document and vector similarity methods (namely, the shingling method and random projection based method).

A recursive definition of similarity arises naturally: two nodes are judged to be similar if they have similar neighbours. Quantifying similarity defined in this manner is challenging due to the tendency of the system to converge to a single point (i.e. all pairs of nodes are completely similar). We present an embedding of undirected graphs into R n based on recursive node similarity which solves this problem by defining an iterative procedure that converges to a non-singular embedding. We use the spectral decomposition of the normalized adjacency matrix to find an explicit expression for this embedding, then show how to compute the embedding efficiently by solving a sparse system of linear equations.",

Results from a three-wave field investigation of newcomer proactive behavior show that newcomer perceptions of surface-level similarity to the rest of the work group in education and gender increased proactive adjustment behavior. Contrary to our expectations, perceived similarity in terms of age decreased proactive adjustment behavior-in other words, newcomers who were significantly different from their co-workers in age engaged in more proactive adjustment behaviors. Deep-level similarity in terms of work style was associated with higher levels of role clarity, but this relationship was not mediated by proactive adjustment behavior. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

The use of similarity matrices instead of classical topological ones has been adopted according to the connection between molecular topology and the general theory of Quantum Similarity. Afterwards, the molecular descriptors, which include the structural information necessary to properly describe the system, are employed to derive numerical correlation with toxicities.

Similarity-based surface modelling provides intelligent surface manipulation by simultaneously applying a modification to all similar areas of the surface. We demonstrate similarity-based painting, deformation, and filtering of surfaces, and show how to vary our similarity measure to encompass geometry, textures, or other arbitrary signals. Geodesic fans are neighbourhoods uniformly sampled in the geodesic polar coordinates of a point on a surface. We show how geodesic fans offer fast approximate alignment and comparison of surface neighbourhoods using simple spoke reordering. As geodesic fans offer a a structurally equivalent definition of neighbourhoods everywhere on a surface, they are amenable to standard acceleration techniques and are well-suited to extending image domain methods for modelling by example to surfaces.",

We use data from listening tests, and instrument class labels to evaluate the models. Our results show that the model based on auditory images yields a very high average correlation with human similarity ratings and clearly outperforms the MPEG-7 recommendation. The average correlations range from 0.89-0.96 depending on the instrument class.

The method describes the qualitative similarity between surfaces defined in the same region in both quantitative and qualitative ways. Given a location and a direction in the region, mathematical functions evaluate the similarity between Surfaces. Integrals of the functions with respect to location and direction give quantitative measures of the total similarity between surfaces. A qualitative method uses spatial characteristics shared by surfaces: alpha-peak regions, alpha-pit regions, and beta-monotonic lines. alpha-peak and alpha-pit regions indicate approximate locations where many surfaces have peaks and pits, respectively. beta-monotonic lines are line segments on which most surfaces change monotonically in the same direction. Those spatial objects reveal the spatial structure shared by surfaces. The method is applied to the analysis of the daily market structure of a supermarket in Japan as an empirical study.",

Analogical reasoning suggests to combine past observations of x and y with the current values of x to generate an assessment of y by similarity-weighted averaging. Specifically, the predicted value of y, yts, is the weighted average of all previously observed values yi, where the weight of y i, for every i=1,...,n, is the similarity between the vector x t1,...,xtd, associated with y t, and the previously observed vector, xi1,...,xid. The \"empirical similarity\" approach suggests estimation of the similarity function from past data. We discuss this approach as a statistical method of prediction, study its relationship to the statistical literature, and extend it to the estimation of probabilities and of density functions. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To overcome this shortcoming, it is important to develop formalisms and methods to segment, categorize and cluster formal concepts. The first step in achieving these aims is to define suitable similarity and dissimilarity measures of formal concepts. In this paper we propose three similarity measures based on existent set-based measures in addition to developing the completely novel zeros-induced measure.

Results suggest that site similarity, at least across some dimensions, influences the validity of choice experiment benefits transfers.

With the introduction of novel behavior-aware protocols, services and architectures, there is a pressing need to understand and realistically model mobile users behavioral characteristics, their similarity and clustering. Such models are essential for the analysis, performance evaluation, and simulation of future DTNs. This paper addresses issues related to mobile user similarity, its definition, analysis and modeling. To define similarity, we adopt a behavioral-profile based on users location preferences using their on-line association matrix and its SVD, then calculate the behavioral distance to capture user similarity. This measures the difference of the major spatio-temporal behavioral trends and can be used to cluster users into similarity groups or communities. We then analyze and contrast similarity distributions of mobile user populations in two settings: (i) based on real measurements from four major campuses with over ten thousand users for a month, and (ii) based on existing mobility models, including random direction and time-varying community models. Our results show a rich set of similar communities in real mobile societies with distinct behavioral clusters of users. This is true for all the traces studied, with the trend being consistent over time. Surprisingly, however, we find that the existing mobility models do not explicitly capture similarity and result in homogeneous users that are all similar to each other. Thus the richness and diversity of user behavioral patterns is not captured to any degree in the existing models. These findings strongly suggest that similarity should be explicitly captured in future mobility models, which motivates the need to re-visit mobility modeling to incorporate accurate behavioral models in the future.",

In this article, we propose new association tests based on haplotype similarities. These new tests compare the average similarities within cases and controls with the average similarity between cases and controls. These methods can be applied to either phase-known or phase-unknown data. We compare the performance of the proposed methods with Pearson's chi2 test and the existing similarity-based tests by simulation studies under a variety of scenarios and by analyzing a real data set. The simulation results show that, in most cases, the new proposed methods are more powerful than both Pearson's chi2 test and the existing similarity-based tests. In one extreme case where the disease mutant induced at a very rare haplotype (<or=3%), Pearson's chi2 is slightly more powerful than the new proposed methods, and in this case, the existing similarity-based tests have almost no power. In another extreme case where the disease mutant was introduced at the most common haplotype, the existing similarity-based methods are slightly more powerful than the new proposed methods, and in this case Pearson's chi2 test is least powerful.

This paper proposes an improved dynamical similarity measure to predict epileptic seizures in electroencephalographic (EEG). First, mutual information and Cao's method are employed to reconstruct a phase space of preprocessed EEG recordings by using the positive zero crossing method. Second, a Gaussian function replaces the Heavyside function within correlation integral at calculating a similarity index. The crisp boundary of the Heavyside function is eliminated because of the Gaussian function's smooth boundary. Third, an adaptive detection method based on the similarity index is proposed to predict the epileptic seizures. In light of test results of EEG recordings of rats, it is found that the new dynamical similarity index is insensitive to the selection of the radius value of Gaussian function and the size of segmented EEG recordings. Comparing with the dynamical similarity index proposed by Le Van Quyen et al. [Anticipating epileptic seizures in real time by a non-linear analysis of similarity between EEG recordings, NeuroReport 10 (1999) 2149-2155], the tests of twelve rats show the new dynamical similarity index is better to predict the epileptic seizures. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This similarity is typically assessed by a windowed distance of the patches pixels. Inspired by the human visual system, we introduce a patch foveation operator and measure patch similarity through a foveated distance, where each patch is blurred with spatially variant point-spread functions having standard deviation increasing with the spatial distance from the patch center. In this way, we install a di\u00a4erent form of self-similarity in images: the foveated self-similarity. We consider the Nonlocal Means algorithm (NL-means) for the removal of additive white Gaussian noise as a simple prototype of nonlocal image \u2026ltering and derive an explicit construction of its corresponding foveation operator, thus yielding the Foveated NL-means algorithm. Our analysis and experimental study show that, to the purpose of image denoising, the foveated self-similarity can be a far more e\u00a4ective regularity assumption than the conventional windowed self-similarity. In the comparison with NL-means, the proposed foveated algorithm achieves a substantial improvement in denoising quality, according to both objective criteria and visual appearance, particularly due to better contrast and sharpness.

To survey and explore the basis of these relationships, we present a general sequence/structure map that covers all combinations of similarity/dissimilarity relationships and provide novel energetic analyses of these relationships. To aid our analysis, we divide protein relationships into four categories: expected/unexpected similarity (S and S(?)) and expected/unexpected dissimilarity (D and D(?)) relationships. In the expected similarity region S, we show that trends in the sequence/structure relation can be derived based on the requirement of protein stability and the energetics of sequence and structural changes. Specifically, we derive a formula relating sequence and structural deviations to a parameter characterizing protein stiffness; the formula fits the data reasonably well. We suggest that the absence of data in region S(?) (high structural but low sequence similarity) is due to unfavorable energetics. In contrast to region S, region D(?) (high sequence but low structural similarity) is well-represented by proteins that can accommodate large structural changes. Our analyses indicate that there are several categories of similarity relationships and that protein energetics provide a basis for understanding these relationships.",

By mapping each node in the suffix tree of STD model into a unique feature term in the vector space document (VSD) model, the phrase-based document similarity naturally inherits the term tf-idf weighting scheme in computing the document similarity with phrases. We apply the phrase-based document similarity to the group-average Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm and develop a new document clustering approach. Our evaluation experiments indicate that, the new clustering approach is very effective on clustering the documents of two standard document benchmark corpora OHSUMED and RCV1. The quality of the clustering results significantly surpass the results of traditional single-word textit{tf-idf} similarity measure in the same HAC algorithm, especially in large document data sets. Furthermore, by studying the property of STD model, we conclude that the feature vector of phrase terms in the STD model can be considered as an expanded feature vector of the traditional single-word terms in the VSD model. This conclusion sufficiently explains why the phrase-based document similarity works much better than the single-word tf-idf similarity measure.",

In particular, we analyse the export flows toward the EU market of four of the so-called \"accession\" countries of Central and Eastern Europe by comparing them to those of the pre-2004 members of the European Union (EU15). From a methodological point of view, we evaluate the appropriateness of different classes of similarity indices - correlation indices and distance metrics - opting for the use of the Bray-Curtis semi-metric to assess changes in the trade similarity. We examine its evolution over time - from 1989 to 2001 - considering both self-similarity (how the export composition of a CEEC has changed with respect to the beginning of the transition process) and EU-similarity (if and how the export composition of a CEEC has changed with respect to the EU15 export composition). Finally, we use EU-similarity matrices to test if the dynamics of sectoral distribution of total exports of Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria to the EU is related to the role acquired by processed trade in the 1990s. Using a nonparametric Mantel test we give evidence that: (1) processed trade is crucial in explaining changes in the overall structure of exports of transition countries, and (2) that greater economic integration in terms of trade flows and processing trade does not always lead to greater export similarity between the CEECs and the EU15 member States.",

TIMI is an extension of two existing methodologies: (1) Latent Semantic Structure Indexing (LaSSI), a method for calculating chemical similarity using two-dimensional topological descriptors, and (2) Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), a method for generating correlations between textual terms. The singular value decomposition (SVD) of a feature/object matrix is the fundamental mathematical operation underlying LSI, LaSSI, and TIMI and is used in the identification of associations between textual and chemical descriptors. We present the results of our studies with a database containing 11,571 PubMed/MEDLINE abstracts which show the advantages of merging textual and chemical descriptors over using either text or chemistry alone. Our work demonstrates that searching text-only databases limits retrieved documents to those that explicitly mention compounds by name in the text. Similarly, searching chemistry-only databases can only retrieve those documents that have chemical structures in them. TIMI, however, enables search and retrieval of documents with textual, chemical, and/or text- and chemistry-based queries. Thus, the TIMI system offers a powerful new approach to uncovering the contextual scientific knowledge sought by the medical research community.",

The second principle emphasizes consistency among similarities: not only are actors similar if they have similar relationships to similar objects, but at the same time objects are similar if similar actors relate to them similarly. We examine the behavior of the proposed similarity model through simulations, and re-analyze two classic datasets: the Davis et al. (1941) data on club membership and the roll-call data of the U.S. Senate.

This work is reporting how we uncovered networked structures that reflected the structural similarities among protein binding sites. First, a 211 binding sites dataset has been compiled by removing the redundant proteins in the Protein Ligand Database (PLD) (http://www-mitchell.ch.cam.ac.uk/pld/). Using a clique detection algorithm we have performed all-against-all binding site comparisons among the 211 available ones. Within the set of nodes representing each binding site an edge was added whenever a pair of binding sites had a similarity higher than a threshold value. The generated similarity networks revealed that many nodes had few links and only few were highly connected, but due to the limited data available it was not possible to definitively prove a scale-free architecture. Within the same dataset, the binding site similarity networks were compared with the networks of sequence and fold similarity networks. In the protein world, indications were found that structure is better conserved than sequence, but on its own, sequence was better conserved than the subset of functional residues forming the binding site. Because a binding site is strongly linked with protein function, the identification of protein binding site similarity networks could accelerate the functional annotation of newly identified genes. In view of this we have discussed several potential applications of binding site similarity networks, such as the construction of novel binding site classification databases, as well as the implications for protein molecular design in general and computational chemogenomics in particular.",

Consequently, cross-correlation, or cross-correlation-like procedures have been used in a range of models of disparity measurement. Using such procedures as the basis for disparity measurement creates a preference for correspondence solutions that maximize the similarity between local left and right eye image regions. Here, we examine how observers' perception of depth in an ambiguous stereogram is affected by manipulations of luminance and orientation-based image similarity. Results show a strong effect of coarse-scale luminance similarity manipulations, but a relatively weak effect of finer-scale manipulations of orientation similarity. This in contrast to the measurements of depth obtained from a standard cross-correlation model. This model shows strong effects of orientation similarity manipulations and weaker effects of luminance similarity. In order to account for these discrepancies, the standard cross-correlation approach may be modified to include an initial spatial frequency filtering stage. The performance of this adjusted model most closely matches human psychophysical data when spatial frequency filtering favors coarser scales. This is consistent with the operation of disparity measurement processes where spatial frequency and disparity tuning are correlated, or where disparity measurement operates in a coarse-to-fine manner.",

Although similarity searches based on Euclidean distance have been extensively studied in the database community, processing of angular similarity searches has been relatively untouched. Problems due to a mismatch in the underlying geometry as well as the high dimensionality of the data make current techniques either inapplicable or their use results in poor performance. This brings up the need for effective indexing methods for angular similarity queries. We first discuss how to efficiently process such queries and propose effective access structures suited to angular similarity measures. In particular, we propose two classes of access structures, namely, angular-sweep and cone-shell, which perform different types of quantization based on the angular orientation of the data objects. We also develop query processing algorithms that utilize these structures as dense indices. The proposed techniques are shown to be scalable with respect to both dimensionality and the size of the data.

        "abstract": "Without quantum theory any understanding of molecular interactions is incomplete. In principal, chemistry, and even biology, can be fully derived from non-relativistic quantum mechanics. In practice, conventional quantum chemical calculations are computationally too intensive and time consuming to be useful for drug discovery on more than a limited basis. A previously described, original, quantum-based computational process for drug discovery and design bridges this gap between theory and practice, and allows the application of quantum methods to large-scale in silico identification of active compounds. Here, we show the results of this quantum-similarity approach applied to the discovery of novel liver-stage antimalarials. Testing of only five of the model-predicted compounds in vitro and in vivo hepatic stage drug inhibition assays with P. berghei identified four novel chemical structures representing three separate quantum classes of liver-stage antimalarials. All four compounds inhibited liver-stage Plasmodium as a single oral dose in the quantitative PCR mouse liver-stage sporozoites-challenge model. One of the newly identified compounds, cethromycin [ABT-773], a macrolide-quinoline hybrid, is a drug with an extensive (over 5,000 people) safety profile warranting its exploitation as a new weapon for the current effort of malaria eradication. The results of our molecular modeling exceed current state-of-theart computational methods. Drug discovery through quantum similarity is data-driven, agnostic to any particular target or disease process that can evaluate multiple phenotypic, target-specific, or co-crystal structural data. This allows the incorporation of additional pharmacological requirements, as well as rapid exploration of novel chemical spaces for therapeutic applications.",

The adhesive strength of as-coated (AC) material increased from 8.3MPa to 12.2, 16.8 and 19.8MPa after sintering at 500, 600 and 700\u00b0C, respectively. The corrosion rate of the as-coated material reduced sharply from 0.405 to 0.094\u03bcAcm<sup>-2</sup> after sintering at 700\u00b0C.",

Biochemical and genetic approaches have been fundamental for clarifying small-molecule modes of action. Genomic technologies have permitted the use of chemical-genetic strategies that comprehensively study compound-target relationships in the context of a living cell, providing a systems biology view of both the cellular targets and the interdependent networks that respond to chemical stress. These studies highlight the fact that in vitro determinations of mechanism rarely translate into a complete understanding of drug behavior in the cell. Here, we review key discoveries that gave rise to the field of chemical genetics, with particular attention to chemical-genetic strategies developed for bakers' yeast, their extension to clinically relevant microbial pathogens, and the potential of these approaches to affect antimicrobial drug discovery.",

The use of the Burrows-Wheeler similarity distribution needs a suitable representation which can reflect some interesting properties of the proteins. For the comparison of the primary protein sequences we convert the protein sequences into digital codes by the Ponnuswamy hydrophobicity index, and for the comparison of the structure of the proteins we adjust the topology of protein structure strings, which are simple but useful representation of the secondary structure of proteins to match the Burrows-Wheeler similarity distribution. At last, some experiments show that the approach proposed in this paper is a powerful and useful tool for the comparison of proteins.",

D 49, 4214 (1994)] to the formulation of useful many-body theories of electron correlation are considered. In addition to presenting a production-level implementation of the SRG based on a single-reference formalism, a novel integral version of the SRG is reported, in which the flow of the Hamiltonian is driven by a source operator. It is shown that this driven SRG (DSRG) produces a Hamiltonian flow that is analogous to that of the SRG. Compared to the SRG, which requires propagating a set of ordinary differential equations, the DSRG is computationally advantageous since it consists of a set of polynomial equations. The equilibrium distances, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and vibrational anharmonicities of a series of diatomic molecules computed with the SRG and DSRG approximated with one- and two-body normal ordered operators are in good agreement with benchmark values from coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. Particularly surprising results are found when the SRG and DSRG methods are applied to C2 and F2. In the former case, both methods fail to converge, while in the latter case an unbound potential energy curve is obtained. A modified commutator approximation is shown to correct these problems in the case of the DSRG method.",

Existing databases contain very few experimentally validated drug-target interactions and formulating successful computational methods for predicting interactions remains challenging.\\n\\nRESULTS: In this study, we consider four different drug-target interaction networks from humans involving enzymes, ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors and nuclear receptors. We then propose a novel Bayesian formulation that combines dimensionality reduction, matrix factorization and binary classification for predicting drug-target interaction networks using only chemical similarity between drug compounds and genomic similarity between target proteins. The novelty of our approach comes from the joint Bayesian formulation of projecting drug compounds and target proteins into a unified subspace using the similarities and estimating the interaction network in that subspace. We propose using a variational approximation in order to obtain an efficient inference scheme and give its detailed derivations. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our proposed method in three different scenarios: (i) exploratory data analysis using low-dimensional projections, (ii) predicting interactions for the out-of-sample drug compounds and (iii) predicting unknown interactions of the given network.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY: Software and Supplementary Material are available at http://users.ics.aalto.fi/gonen/kbmf2k.\\n\\nCONTACT: mehmet.gonen@aalto.fi\\n\\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

One of the top scoring hits in this library was synthesized and characterized for MCHr1 antagonism, where it exhibited at least a threefold improvement in binding affinity and cellular potency relative to the parent MCHr1 ligand.

Many scores, including the commonly used root mean square deviation, have therefore been developed to quantify the similarities of different protein conformations. However, instead of examining individual conformations it is in many cases more relevant to analyse ensembles of conformations that have been obtained either through experiments or from methods such as molecular dynamics simulations. We here present three approaches that can be used to compare conformational ensembles in the same way as the root mean square deviation is used to compare individual pairs of structures. The methods are based on the estimation of the probability distributions underlying the ensembles and subsequent comparison of these distributions. We first validate the methods using a synthetic example from molecular dynamics simulations. We then apply the algorithms to revisit the problem of ensemble averaging during structure determination of proteins, and find that an ensemble refinement method is able to recover the correct distribution of conformations better than standard single-molecule refinement.",

In this paper, we present an efficient image retrieval system with high performance of accuracy based on two novel features, the composite sub-band gradient vector and the energy distribution pattern string. Both features are generated from the sub-images of a wavelet decomposition of the original image. A fuzzymatching mechanism based on energy distribution pattern strings serves as a filter to quickly remove undesired images in the database from further consideration. The images passing the filter will be compared with the query image based on composite sub-band gradient vectors which are extremely powerful for discriminating detailed textures. Through several extensive experiments by exercising our prototype system with a database of 2400 images, we demonstrated that both high accuracy and high efficiency can be achieved at the same time by our approach. ?? 2002 Pattern Recognition Society.

Among the related works, k-means quantizers are possibly the most adaptive methods, and have shown the superiority on search accuracy than the others. However, a common problem shared by the traditional quantizers is that during the out-of-sample extension process, the naive strategy considers only the similarities in Euclidean space without taking into account the statistical and geometrical properties of the data. To cope with this problem, in this paper a novel approach is proposed by formulating a generalized likelihood ratio analysis. In particular, the proposed method takes a physically meaningful discrimination on the affiliations of the new samples with respect to the obtained Voronoi cells. This discrimination essentially imposes the measure of statistical consistency on out-of-sample extension. The experimental studies on two large data sets show that the proposed method is more effective than the benchmark algorithms. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The standard response by champions of the HPC approach is to say that all members of a polymorphic species have things in common, namely dispositions or conditional properties. I argue that this response fails. Instances of an HPC kind need not all be similar in their exhibited properties. Instead, HPCs should instead be understood as unified by the underlying causal mechanism that maintains them. The causal mechanism can both produce and explain some systematic differences between a kind\u2019s members. An HPC kind is best understood not as a single cluster of prop- erties maintained in stasis by causal forces, but as a complex of related property clusters kept in relation by an underlying causal process.

        "abstract": "Complex networks have been studied extensively owing to their relevance to many real systems such as the world-wide web, the Internet, energy landscapes and biological and social networks. A large number of real networks are referred to as 'scale-free' because they show a power-law distribution of the number of links per node. However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not invariant or self-similar under a length-scale transformation. This conclusion originates from the 'small-world' property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the 'diameter' of the network, rather than the power-law relation expected for a self-similar structure. Here we analyse a variety of real complex networks and find that, on the contrary, they consist of self-repeating patterns on all length scales. This result is achieved by the application of a renormalization procedure that coarse-grains the system into boxes containing nodes within a given 'size'. We identify a power-law relation between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box, defining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties help to explain the scale-free nature of complex networks and suggest a common self-organization dynamics.",

The factorization consists in grouping those fuzzy sets which are pairwise similar at least to a prescribed degree a. An obstacle to such factorization, well known in fuzzy set theory, is the fact that \"being similar at least to degree a\" is not an equivalence relation because, in general, it is not transitive. As a result, ordinary factorization using equivalence classes cannot be used. This obstacle can be overcome by considering maximal blocks of fuzzy sets which are pairwise similar at least to degree a. We show that one can introduce a natural complete lattice structure on the set of all such maximal blocks and study this lattice. This lattice plays the role of a factor structure for the original system of fuzzy sets. Particular examples of our approach include factorization of fuzzy concept lattices and factorization of residuated lattices. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The main idea is to match skeleton graphs by comparing the shortest paths between skeleton endpoints. In contrast to typical tree or graph matching methods, we completely ignore the topological graph structure. Our approach is motivated by the fact that visually similar skeleton graphs may have completely different topological structures. The proposed comparison of shortest paths between endpoints of skeleton graphs yields correct matching results in such cases. The skeletons are pruned by contour partitioning with Discrete Curve Evolution, which implies that the endpoints of skeleton branches correspond to visual parts of the objects. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to produce correct results in the presence of articulations, stretching, and occlusion.",

        "abstract": "The properties and behavior of solvents and solutes inside a nanofluidic structure are not the same as in the bulk solution, but instead are strongly determined by the interactions of solvent and solute molecules with the walls of the structure. These interactions give rise to nanometre-scale boundary layers where the properties can strongly differ from the bulk. The chemical potential provides a convenient tool to describe these boundary layers, and as such is the focus of this tutorial review. The chemical potential of a solution component describes its energy level, which in this boundary layer is strongly influenced by the various interfacial forces between molecules in the wall and in the solution. These forces vary with distance and have a certain limited spatial range, which is reflected in the composition and thickness of the boundary layer in which both solute and solvent concentrations differ from their bulk values. We will consider a variety of solutes such as ions, uncharged molecules and gases, and surfaces that are both hydrophilic and hydrophobic. The boundary layer is oriented normal to the surface, but external forces can also be applied in parallel to the surface. Many interesting different nanofluidic transport phenomena then result, which will also be briefly mentioned in this tutorial review. By this common approach of using the chemical potential for nanofluidic systems of different composition, we aim to bring out the conceptual similarity between the different types of boundary layers and the different transport processes they can give rise to.

For this purpose, cell-permeant, fluorescent styryl molecules were synthesized by condensation of 168 aldehyde with 8 pyridinium/quinolinium building blocks. Images of cells incubated with fluorescent molecules were acquired with a high content screening instrument. Chemical and image feature analysis revealed how variation in one or the other building block of the styryl molecules led to variations in the molecules' visual signals. Across each pair of probes in the library, chemical similarity was significantly associated with spectral and total signal intensity similarity. However, chemical similarity was much less associated with similarity in subcellular probe fluorescence patterns. Quantitative analysis and visual inspection of pairs of images acquired from pairs of styryl isomers confirm that many closely-related probes exhibit different subcellular localization patterns. Therefore, idiosyncratic interactions between styryl molecules and specific cellular components greatly contribute to the subcellular distribution of the styryl probes' fluorescence signal. These results demonstrate how machine vision and cheminformatics can be combined to analyze the targeting properties of bioimaging probes, using large image data sets acquired with automated screening systems.",

This can be done by looking at known target binding profiles of similar compounds using chemical similarity searching. The purpose of this study was to construct and evaluate the performance of chemical fingerprints based on the molecular signature descriptor for performing target binding predictions. For the comparison we used the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) complemented with net reclassification improvement (NRI). We created two open source signature fingerprints, a bit and a count version, and evaluated their performance compared to a set of established fingerprints with regards to predictions of binding targets using Tanimoto-based similarity searching on publicly available data sets extracted from ChEMBL. The results showed that the count version of the signature fingerprint performed on par with well-established fingerprints such as ECFP. The count version outperformed the bit version slightly; however, the count version is more complex and takes more computing time and memory to run so its usage should probably be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The NRI based tests complemented the AUC based ones and showed signs of higher power.",

A modified kernel function based on the similarity metric and Riemannian metric is applied to the support vector machine. In general, it is believed that the similarity of homogeneous samples is higher than that of inhomogeneous samples. Therefore, in Riemannian geometry, Riemannian metric can be used to reflect local property of a curve. In order to enlarge the similarity metric of the homogeneous samples or reduce that of the inhomogeneous samples in the feature space, Riemannian metric is used in the kernel function of the SVM. Simulated experiments are performed using the databases including an artificial and the UCI real data. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through the comparison with four typical kernel functions without similarity metric.",

        "abstract": "Measuring semantic similarity among concepts is the core method for assessing the degree of semantic interoperability within and between ontologies. In this paper, we propose to extend current semantic similarity measures by accounting for the spatial relations between different geospatial concepts. Such integration of spatial relations, in particular topologic and metric relations, leads to an enhanced accuracy of semantic similarity measurements. For the formal treatment of similarity the theory of conceptual vector spaces\u2014sets of quality dimensions with a geometric or topologic structure for one or more domains\u2014is utilized. These spaces allow for the measurement of semantic distances between concepts. A case study from the geospatial domain using Ordnance Survey\u2019s MasterMap is used to demonstrate the usefulness and plausibility of the approach.",

Specifically, we examined the effects of avatar appearance similarity, homophily and private self-awareness on immersion. Data from 196 users of Second Life were collected through a web-based survey. The results revealed an important role of self-awareness in mediating the effect of avatar similarity on immersion. More specifically, appearance similarity was found to affect homophily, which heightened self-awareness. Self-awareness, in turn, influenced immersion.

A laboratory study was conducted to analyze the effect of different resolution levels on human judgment of image similarity. The results show that the impact of quantization resolutions on perceived image similarity is not linear. In fact, a logarithm relationship fits the data very well. Furthermore, there is a surprising result that the objective measure of colorloss can predict perceived image quite well. The study provides accurate data for content-based image retrieval researchers to decide on the tradeoff between processing speed (which is affected by the choice of resolution level) and perceived image similarity. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed approach argues that case base building can be based on both similarity relations and fuzzy similarity relations, which are both defined on the possible world of problems and solutions respectively. Thus case base building is a form of similarity-based reasoning. This approach is an extension for the logical and fuzzy approach to case based reasoning.

Then, we derive generalization bounds for metric/similarity learning with different matrix-norm regularisers by estimating their specific Rademacher complexities. Our analysis indicates that sparse metric/similarity learning with $L^1$-norm regularisation could lead to significantly better bounds than those with Frobenius-norm regularisation. Our novel generalization analysis develops and refines the techniques of U-statistics and Rademacher complexity analysis.",

We show empirically that similarity measures with higher robustness are more effective in registering degraded images and are also more successful in performing intermodal image registration. Further, we introduce a new similarity measure, called normalized spatial mutual information, for 3D brain image registration whose robustness is shown to be much higher than the existing ones. Consequently, it tolerates greater image degradation and provides more consistent outcomes for intermodal brain image registration.",

We propose a probabilistic framework of SBR which is based on a formal model of this assumption. This model, called a similarity profile, provides a probabilistic characterization of the similarity relation between observed cases (instances). A probabilistic approach seems reasonable since it adequately captures the heuristic (and hence uncertain) nature of the above hypothesis. Taking the concept of a similarity profile as a point of departure, we develop an inference scheme in which instance-based evidence is represented in the form of belief functions. The combination of evidence derived from individual cases can then be considered as a problem of information fusion. In this connection, we also address the problem of rating individual cases, and of modulating their influence on the prediction which is finally derived.",

This exercise provides a valuable opportunity for researchers to test their docking programs, methods, and protocols in a blind testing environment. In the CSARdock2014 benchmark exercise, we have implemented an approach that uses ligand 3D shape similarity to facilitate docking-based pose selection and virtual screening. We showed here that ligand 3D shape similarity between bound poses could be used to identify the native-like pose from an ensemble of docking-generated poses. Our method correctly identified the native pose as the top-ranking pose for 73% of test cases in a blind testing environment. Moreover, the pose selection results also revealed an excellent correlation between ligand 3D shape similarity scores and RMSD to X-ray crystal structure ligand. In the virtual screening exercise, the average RMSD for our pose prediction was found to be 1.02 A\u030a, and it was one of the top performances achieved in CSARdock2014 benchmark exercise. Furthermore, the inclusion of shape similarity improved virtual screening performance of docking-based scoring and ranking. The coefficient of determination (r2) between experimental activities and docking scores for 276 spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors was found to be 0.365 but reached 0.614 when the ligand 3D shape similarity was included.",

        "abstract": "The similarity/diversity measures play a fundamental role in library searching, virtual screening, and quantitative structure-activity relationship/quantitative structure-property relationship modeling as well as in genomics and proteomics. In this paper, a new similarity/diversity measure is proposed as a new approach for the analysis of sequential data, where useful information can be also obtained by the ordering relationships between the sequence elements. This methodology can be applied for evaluating molecular similarity/diversity, using sets of sequential descriptors, and for evaluating the similarity between spectra, sensor arrays, and other sequential data such as DNA and protein sequences. The new proposed distance (weighted standardized Hasse distance) is evaluated between pairs of Hasse matrices derived from the classical partial-ordering rules. It can be naturally standardized, thus allowing the interpretation of these distances as absolute values (e.g., percentage) and deriving simple similarity and correlation indices. A simple example is taken to highlight the behavior of the new similarity/diversity measure on DNA sequences taken from the first exons of the beta-globins for eight different species. Sensitivity analysis has been also performed, showing the high capability of this measure to take into account small modifications of the DNA sequences. Finally, a comparison with results obtained from the literature is given, together with a comparison with matrix invariants derived from the Hasse matrix.",

Visual similarity estimates were obtained using multidimensional scaling based on the independent observer similarity ratings. A linear mixed-effects model demonstrated that both visual and semantic similarity influenced the probability that distractors would be fixated. However, the visual similarity effect was substantially larger than the semantic similarity effect. We close by discussing the potential value of using this novel methodological approach and the implications for both simple and complex visual search displays.",

Relationship quality and perceived similarity then provide psychological benefits for the perceiver. Across 3 studies, relationship quality positively predicted perceptions of similarity.

That is, attraction (i.e., satisfaction) leads to perceptions of similarity. Two studies tested this hypothesis in same-sex friendships. Study 1 correlated individuals' satisfaction with an ongoing friendship with perceptions of similarity on traits and behaviors. Study 2 used a priming method to manipulate satisfaction in an ongoing friendship and then tested for perceptions of similarity. Consistent with the attraction-similarity hypothesis, the more satisfied individuals were with their friendships the more similar they perceived their friends to be to themselves. These perceptions of similarity were not predicted by the duration or closeness of the friendship. Finally, perceptions of similarity were made in a self-serving fashion. The implications for close relationships are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Oscillatory flow reactors (OFRs) are a novel type of continuous reactor, in which tubes fitted with orifice plate baffles have an oscillatory motion superimposed upon the net flow of the process fluid. The combination of baffles and the oscillatory motion creates a flow pattern conducive to efficient heat and mass transfer while maintaining plug flow. Unlike conventional tubular reactors, where a minimum Reynolds number must be maintained, tube-side mixing is independent of the net flow, allowing long residence times to be achieved in a reactor of greatly reduced length-to-diameter ratio. We have evaluated a pilot-scale OFR as a method for continuous production of sterols in an ester saponification reaction. The OFR achieved the required product specification, in a residence time one-eighth that of a full-scale batch reactor. To better understand the effect of the process variables on the reactor performance, the OFR was modeled using a tanks-in-series residence time distribution, combined with the saponification reaction kinetics, giving a \u201cflow-conversion\u201d model which predicted conversion based on flow and feed parameters. This simple model has led to a number of insights into the optimal operation of the OFR, one of which was that the OFR could give desired conversion selectivity at a lower reaction temperature without significant alteration to other process variables. Also, the current product specification could be surpassed, if necessary. These predictions were verified by experiment. A full-scale OFR design based on these results would be less than one-hundredth the volume of a full-scale batch reactor, assuming the same production rate and product quality. The construction of such an industrial-scale OFR for the saponification reaction is now being considered by an industrial collaborator",

        "abstract": "Despite great advances in the efficiency of analytical and synthetic chemistry, time and available starting material still limit the number of unique compounds that can be practically synthesized and evaluated as prospective therapeutics. Chemical diversity analysis (the capacity to identify finite diverse subsets that reliably represent greater manifolds of drug-like chemicals) thus remains an important resource in drug discovery. Despite an unproven track record, chemical diversity has also been used to posit, from preliminary screen hits, new compounds with similar or better activity. Identifying diversity metrics that demonstrably encode bioactivity trends is thus of substantial potential value for intelligent assembly of targeted screens. This paper reports novel algorithms designed to simultaneously reflect chemical similarity or diversity trends and apparent bioactivity in compound collections. An extensive set of descriptors are evaluated within large NCI screening data sets according to bioactivity differentiation capacities, quantified as the ability to co-localize known active species into bioactive-rich K-means clusters. One method tested for descriptor selection orders features according to relative variance across a set of training compounds, and samples increasingly finer subset meshes for descriptors whose exclusion from the model induces drastic drops in relative bioactive colocalization. This yields metrics with reasonable bioactive enrichment (greater than 50% of all bioactive compounds collected into clusters or cells with significantly enriched active/inactive rates) for each of the four data sets examined herein. A second method replaces variance by an active/inactive divergence score, achieving comparable enrichment via a much more efficient search process. Combinations of the above metrics are tested in 2D rectilinear diversity models, achieving similarly successful colocalization statistics, with metrics derived from the active/inactive divergence score typically outperforming those selected from the variance criterion and computed from the DiverseSolutions software.",

        "abstract": "Kernel functions have become an extremely popular tool in machine learning, with an attractive theory as well. This theory views a kernel as implicitly mapping data points into a possibly very high dimensional space, and describes a kernel function as being good for a given learning problem if data is separable by a large margin in that implicit space. However, while quite elegant, this theory does not necessarily correspond to the intuition of a good kernel as a good measure of similarity, and the underlying margin in the implicit space usually is not apparent in \u201cnatural\u201d representations of the data. Therefore, it may be difficult for a domain expert to use the theory to help design an appropriate kernel for the learning task at hand. Moreover, the requirement of positive semi-definiteness may rule out the most natural pairwise similarity functions for the given problem domain. In this work we develop an alternative, more general theory of learning with similarity functions (i.e., sufficient conditions for a similarity function to allow one to learn well) that does not require reference to implicit spaces, and does not require the function to be positive semi-definite (or even symmetric). Instead, our theory talks in terms of more direct properties of how the function behaves as a similarity measure. Our results also generalize the standard theory in the sense that any good kernel function under the usual definition can be shown to also be a good similarity function under our definition (though with some loss in the parameters). In this way, we provide the first steps towards a theory of kernels and more general similarity functions that describes the effectiveness of a given function in terms of natural similarity-based properties.",

Kowalski and P. Piecuch, J. Chem. Phys. 113, 18 (2000)], are reformulated in terms of the left eigenstates Phimid R:L of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian of CC theory. The resulting CR-CCSD(T)(L) or CR-CC(2,3) and other CR-CC(L) methods are derived from the new biorthogonal form of the method of moments of CC equations (MMCC) in which, in analogy to the original MMCC theory, one focuses on the noniterative corrections to standard CC energies that recover the exact, full configuration-interaction energies. One of the advantages of the biorthogonal MMCC theory, which will be further analyzed and extended to excited states in a separate paper, is a rigorous size extensivity of the basic ground-state CR-CC(L) approximations that result from it, which was slightly violated by the original CR-CCSD(T) and CR-CCSD(TQ) approaches. This includes the CR-CCSD(T)(L) or CR-CC(2,3) method discussed in this paper, in which one corrects the CCSD energy by the relatively inexpensive noniterative correction due to triples. Test calculations for bond breaking in HF, F(2), and H(2)O indicate that the noniterative CR-CCSD(T)(L) or CR-CC(2,3) approximation is very competitive with the standard CCSD(T) theory for nondegenerate closed-shell states, while being practically as accurate as the full CC approach with singles, doubles, and triples in the bond-breaking region. Calculations of the activation enthalpy for the thermal isomerizations of cyclopropane involving the trimethylene biradical as a transition state show that the noniterative CR-CCSD(T)(L) approximation is capable of providing activation enthalpies which perfectly agree with experiment.",

This method involves specifying a global ordinary differential equation (ODE) model structure capable of representing an entire set of possible chemical reactions. Mathematical and statistical tests are then used to reduce the ODE model structure to a subset of reactions. Finally, a model rationalisation procedure, relying on exploiting the basic rules of reaction chemistry, is used to obtain a consistent set of reactions which are combined to give the overall reaction network. The identification procedure is demonstrated for pure batch operation with a worked example using simulated noisy data from an extended Van de Vusse reaction network consisting of five species and four elementary reactions [Van de Vusse, J.G., 1964. Plug-flow type reactor versus tank reactor. Chemical Engineering Science 19, 994\u2013997]. A further case study of a semi-batch (fed batch) system using simulated data from a simplified biodiesel system, with six chemical species involved in three elementary reactions, is provided. It is shown that the method is able to correctly identify the underlying structure of the network of chemical reactions and provide accurate estimates of the network rate constants.",

The scaling of the field signaling environment to laboratory conditions recreates essential features of the dynamics and establishes ecological relevance. If appropriately scaled, laboratory simulations of physical regimes, coupled with natural rates of chemical cue/signal emission, facilitate interpretation of field results. From a meta-analysis of papers published in 11 journals over the last 22 years (1984-1986, 1994-1996, 2004-2006), complete dynamic scaling was rare in both field and laboratory studies. Studies in terrestrial systems often involved chemical determinations, but rarely simulated natural aerodynamics in laboratory wind tunnels. Research in aquatic (marine and freshwater) systems seldom scaled either the chemical or physical environments. Moreover, nearly all research, in all environments, focused on organism-level processes without incorporating the effects of individual-based behavior on populations, communities, and ecosystems. As a result, relationships between chemosensory-mediated behavior and ecological function largely remain unexplored. Outstanding exceptions serve as useful examples for guiding future research. Advanced conceptual frameworks and refined techniques offer exciting opportunities for identifying the ecological significance of chemical cues/signals in behavioral interactions and for incorporating individual effects at higher levels of biological organization.",

The unique \u03b2-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (\u03b2-NAD(+) or NAD(+))-dependent nature of the sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation reaction has also engendered extensive mechanistic studies, resulting in a mechanistic view of the enzyme chemistry supported by several lines of experimental evidence. On the journey toward these knowledge advances, chemical biological means have constituted an important functional arsenal; technically, a variety of chemical probes and modulators (inhibitors and activators) have been developed and some of them have been employed toward an enhanced mechanistic and functional (pharmacological) understanding of the sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation reaction. On the other hand, an enhanced mechanistic understanding has also facilitated the development of a variety of chemical probes and modulators. This article will review the tremendous accomplishments achieved during the past few years in the field of sirtuin chemical biology. It is hoped that this would also help to set a stage for how outstanding mechanistic and functional questions for the sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation reaction could be addressed in the future from the chemical biology perspective.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of catalytically active RNA enzymes (ribozymes) is widely believed to have been an important transition in the origin of life. In the context of a likely heterogeneous chemical environment, substrate specificity and selectivity of these primordial enzymes would have been critical for function. Here we have explored the chemical fidelity, i.e. substrate selectivity and specificity for both single and multiple catalytic steps of the Z RNA polymerase ribozyme \u2013 a modern day analogue of the primordial RNA replicase. Using a wide range of nucleotide analogues and ionic conditions, we observe strong energetic but weak geometric discrimination at the incorporation step, indicative of an open active site. In contrast, stringent selectivity is exerted at the extension steps through specific down and upstream interactions with the 3\u2032-terminal nucleoside as well as nascent product and template strands. Our results indicate specificity mechanisms that are found in functionally analogous forms in natural polymerases. They also reveal a level of chemical fidelity over multiple catalytic steps that is remarkable for a comparatively unoptimized enzyme developed de novo from a random sequence pool. The convergent evolution of specificity mechanisms in phylogenetically unrelated proteinaceous polymerases and polymerase ribozymes suggests that chemical as well as informational fidelity are emergent properties of polymerase enzymes.",

We define a similarity matrix whose (i, j)-th real entry expresses how similar vertex j (in G_A) is to vertex i (in G_B. The similarity matrix can be obtained as the limit of the normalized even iterates of a linear transformation. In the special case where G_A=G_B=G, the matrix is square and the (i, j)-th entry is the similarity score between the vertices i and j of G. We point out that Kleinberg's \"hub and authority\" method to identify web-pages relevant to a given query can be viewed as a special case of our definition in the case where one of the graphs has two vertices and a unique directed edge between them. In analogy to Kleinberg, we show that our similarity scores are given by the components of a dominant eigenvector of a non-negative matrix. Potential applications of our similarity concept are numerous. We illustrate an application for the automatic extraction of synonyms in a monolingual dictionary.",

        "abstract": "Feature-rich data, such as audio-video recordings, digital images, and results of scientific experiments, nowadays constitute the largest fraction of the massive data sets produced daily in the e-society. Content-based similarity search systems working on such data collections are rapidly growing in importance. Unfortunately, similarity search is in general very expensive and hardly scalable. In this paper we study the case of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems, and focus on the problem of increasing the throughput of a large-scale CBIR system that indexes a very large collection of digital images. By analyzing the query log of a real CBIR system available on the Web, we characterize the behavior of users who experience a novel search paradigm, where content-based similarity queries and text-based ones can easily be interleaved. We show that locality and self-similarity is present even in the stream of queries submitted to such a CBIR system. According to these results, we propose an effective way to exploit this locality, by means of a similarity caching system, which stores the results of recently/frequently submitted queries and associated results. Unlike traditional caching, the proposed cache can manage not only exact hits, but also approximate ones that are solved by similarity with respect to the result sets of past queries present in the cache. We evaluate extensively the proposed solution by using the real query stream recorded in the log and a collection of 100 millions of digital photographs. The high hit ratios and small average approximation error figures obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "To understand the brain mechanisms of olfaction we must understand the rules that govern the link between odorant structure and odorant perception. Natural odors are in fact mixtures made of many molecules, and there is currently no method to look at the molecular structure of such odorant-mixtures and predict their smell. In three separate experiments, we asked 139 subjects to rate the pairwise perceptual similarity of 64 odorant-mixtures ranging in size from 4 to 43 mono-molecular components. We then tested alternative models to link odorant-mixture structure to odorant-mixture perceptual similarity. Whereas a model that considered each mono-molecular component of a mixture separately provided a poor prediction of mixture similarity, a model that represented the mixture as a single structural vector provided consistent correlations between predicted and actual perceptual similarity (r\u22650.49, p<0.001). An optimized version of this model yielded a correlation of r\u200a=\u200a0.85 (p<0.001) between predicted and actual mixture similarity. In other words, we developed an algorithm that can look at the molecular structure of two novel odorant-mixtures, and predict their ensuing perceptual similarity. That this goal was attained using a model that considers the mixtures as a single vector is consistent with a synthetic rather than analytical brain processing mechanism in olfaction.",

In this paper, we propose a new measurement of similarity based on local structures for the purpose of detecting communities in complex networks. Compared to the similarity measures based on the entire network, the proposed similarity measure requires less computation and produces good descriptions of the structural characteristics of the networks. Meanwhile, it reverses the tendency of under-estimating produced by some existing similarity measures based on local structures. To utilize our measurement of similarity to the detection of community structures, we also generalize the Ward hierarchical clustering algorithm so that it is applicable to any object that has similarity measurement. And as an application we particularly employ this algorithm to detect community structures in complex networks. The proposed method is tested on both computer-generated and real-world networks, and is compared with the typical algorithms in community detection. Experimental results verify and confirm the feasibility and validity of the proposed method. Copyright \u00a9 2011 Acta Automatica Sinica. All rights reserved.",

Additionally, an index of search engines has to be updated on most recent information as it is constantly changed over time. Particularly, information retrieval results as documents are typically too extensive, which affect on accessibility of the required results for searchers . Consequently , a similarity measurement between keywords and index term s is essentially performed to facilitate searchers in accessing the required results promptly . Thus, this paper proposed the similarity measurement method between words by deploying Ja ccard Coefficient . Technically, we developed a measure of similarity Jaccard with Prolog programming language to compare similarity between sets of data. Furthermore, the performance of this proposed similarity measurement method was accomplished by employing precision, recall, and F-measure . Precisely, the test results demonstrated the awareness of advantage and disadvantages of the measurement which were adapted and applied to a search for meaning by using Jaccard similarity coefficient.",

Assuming normality in the RKHS, we derive analytic expressions for probabilistic distance measures that are commonly used in many applications, such as Chernoff distance (or the Bhattacharyya distance as its special case), Kullback-Leibler divergence, etc. Since the reproducing kernel implicitly embeds a nonlinear mapping, our approach presents a new way to study these distances whose feasibility and efficiency is demonstrated using experiments with synthetic and real examples. Further, we extend the ensemble similarity to the reproducing kernel for ensemble and study the ensemble similarity for more general data representations.",

        "abstract": "We introduce the concepts of hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) interactions and derive parameters to characterise a magma that consists either of a solid rock, a melt or its exsolved gaseous phase. Those parameters are the electronegativity, i.e. the chemical potential changed of sign, hardness, electrophilicity and polarisability. They determine the chemical reactivity of each individual element, or its equivalence in the case of a complex system of elements or compounds. The parameter values result from equalisation methods for complex systems, i.e. the equalisation of the respective chemical potentials, or from direct computation through density functional theory (DFT). They help in characterising magma by a single value. They also provide insights into the reactivity of the melt or its fluid phase when in contact with another magma, or when considering the affinity of elements for each phase. The description leads to a better understanding on the mechanisms that control sequestration and transport of metals within the different phases during igneous activity. The presence of halogens tends to reinforce hardness, making the fluid phase attractive for hard metals such as Sn or W. Conversely, the presence of S decreases hardness of the fluid phase that becomes attractive for soft metals such as Au, Ag and Cu. Theoretical principles of maximum hardness and minimum electrophilicity can be used to identify the poles toward which the reactions should naturally evolve. The trends observed during magma evolution are also observed using these parameters, indicating two different trends toward a pole of greater stability. One pole consists in increasing the hardness at constant electrophilicity as observed for felsic magmas toward a silica-rich pole. Conversely mantle-derived magmas evolve at a constant hardness and decreasing electrophilicity in between the two poles of iron-rich and alkali-rich minerals. They respectively correspond to the Bowen and Fenner trends, though the experimental and field evidences have now some chemical explanation. \u00a9 2011.",

In this paper we present a quantitative approach to modeling and capturing the similarity and dissimilarity between different workflow designs, focusing on similarity and dissimilarity between the block structures of different workflow designs. We derive the distance-based similarity measures by analyzing the workflow block structure of the participating workflow processes in four consecutive phases. We first convert each workflow dependency graph into a block tree by using our block detection algorithm. Second, we transform the block tree into a binary tree to provide a normalized reference structure for distance based similarity analysis. Third, we construct a binary branch vector by encoding the binary tree. Finally, we calculate the distance metric between two binary branch vectors.",

        "abstract": "A large number of 3D models are created and available on the Web, since more and more 3D modelling and digitizing tools are developed for ever increasing applications. The techniques for content-based 3D model retrieval then become necessary. In this paper, a visual similarity-based 3D model retrieval system is proposed. This approach measures the similarity among 3D models by visual similarity, and the main idea is that if two 3D models are similar, they also look similar from all viewing angles. Therefore, one hundred orthogonal projections of an object, excluding symmetry, are encoded both by Zernike moments and Fourier descriptors as features for later retrieval. The visual similarity-based approach is robust against similarity transformation, noise, model degeneracy etc., and provides 42%, 94% and 25% better performance (precision-recall evaluation diagram) than three other competing approaches: (1)the spherical harmonics approach developed by Funkhouser et al., (2)the MPEG-7 Shape 3D descriptors, and (3)the MPEG-7 Multiple View Descriptor. The proposed system is on the Web for practical trial use (http://3d.csie.ntu.edu.tw), and the database contains more than 10,000 publicly available 3D models collected from WWW pages. Furthermore, a user friendly interface is provided to retrieve 3D models by drawing 2D shapes. The retrieval is fast enough on a server with Pentium IV 2.4GHz CPU, and it takes about 2 seconds and 0.1 seconds for querying directly by a 3D model and by hand drawn 2D shapes, respectively.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the problem of improving performance in distributional word similarity systems trained on sparse data, focusing on a family of similarity functions we call Dice-family functions (Dice 1945 Ecology 26(3): 297\u2013302), including the similarity function introduced in Lin (1998 Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Machine Learning, 296\u2013304), and Curran (2004 PhD thesis, University of Edinburgh. College of Science and Engineering. School of Informatics), as well as a generalized version of Dice Coefficient used in data mining applications (Strehl 2000, 55). We propose a generalization of the Dice-family functions which uses a weight parameter \u03b1 to make the similarity functions asymmetric. We show that this generalized family of functions (\u03b1 systems) all belong to the class of asymmetric models first proposed in Tversky (1977 Psychological Review 84: 327\u2013352), and in a multi-task evaluation of ten word similarity systems, we show that \u03b1 systems have the best performance across word ranks. In particular, we show that \u03b1-parameterization substantially improves the correlations of all Dice-family functions with human judgements on three words sets, including the Miller\u2013Charles/Rubenstein Goodenough word set (Miller and Charles 1991 Language and Cognitive Processes 6(1): 1\u201328; Rubenstein and Goodenough 1965 Communications of the ACM 8: 627\u2013633).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) is essential to most biological processes. Abnormal interactions may have implications in a number of neurological syndromes. Given that the association and dissociation of protein molecules is crucial, computational tools capable of effectively identifying PPI are desirable. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to detect PPI based on pairwise similarity and using only the primary structure of the protein. The PPI based on Pairwise Similarity (PPI-PS) method consists of a representation of each protein sequence by a vector of pairwise similarities against large subsequences of amino acids created by a shifting window which passes over concatenated protein training sequences. Each coordinate of this vector is typically the E-value of the Smith-Waterman score. These vectors are then used to compute the kernel matrix which will be exploited in conjunction with support vector machines. RESULTS: To assess the ability of the proposed method to recognize the difference between \"interacted\" and \"non-interacted\" proteins pairs, we applied it on different datasets from the available yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae protein interaction. The proposed method achieved reasonable improvement over the existing state-of-the-art methods for PPI prediction. CONCLUSION: Pairwise similarity score provides a relevant measure of similarity between protein sequences. This similarity incorporates biological knowledge about proteins and it is extremely powerful when combined with support vector machine to predict PPI.",

        "abstract": "There are many settings in which users of a social media applica- tion provide evaluations of one another. In a variety of domains, mechanisms for evaluation allow one user to say whether he or she trusts another user, or likes the content they produced, or wants to confer special levels of authority or responsibility on them. Ear- lier work has studied how the relative status between two users that is, their comparative levels of status in the groupaffects the types of evaluations that one user gives to another. Here we study how similarity in the characteristics of two users can affect the evaluation that one user provides of another. We an- alyze this issue under a range of natural similarity measures, show- ing how the interaction of similarity and status can produce strong effects. Among other consequences, we find that evaluations are less status-driven when users are more similar to each other; and we use effects based on similarity to provide a plausible mechanism for a complex phenomenon observed in studies of user evaluation, that evaluations are particularly low among users of roughly equal status. Our work has natural applications to the prediction of evaluation outcomes based on user characteristics, and the use of similarity information makes possible a novel application that we introduce here to estimate the chance of a favorable overall evaluation from a group knowing only the attributes of the groups members, but not their expressed opinions.",

        "abstract": "Image alignment refers to finding the best transformation from a fixed reference image to a new image of a scene. This process is often optimizing a similarity measure between images, computed based on the image data. However, in time-critical applications state-of-the-art methods for computing similarity are too slow. Instead of using all the image data to compute similarity, one could use only a subset of pixels to improve the speed, but often this comes at the cost of reduced accuracy. These kinds of tradeoffs between the amount of computation and the accuracy of the result have been addressed in the field of real-time artificial intelligence as deliberation control problems. We propose that the optimization of a similarity measure is a natural application domain for deliberation control using the anytime algorithm framework. In this paper, we present anytime versions for the computation of two common image similarity measures: mean squared difference and mutual information. Off-line, we learn a performance profile specific to each measure, which is then used on-line to select the appropriate amount of pixels to process at each optimization step. When tested against existing techniques, our method achieves comparable quality and robustness with significantly less computation. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The accuracy of large-eddy simulation (LES) of a turbulent premixed Bunsen flame is investigated in this paper. To distinguish between discretization and modeling errors, multiple LES, using different grid sizes h but the same filterwidth \u0394, are compared with the direct numerical simulation (DNS). In addition, LES using various values of \u0394 but the same ratio \u0394/h are compared. The chemistry in the LES and DNS is parametrized with the standard steady premixed flamelet for stochiometric methane-air combustion. The subgrid terms are closed with an eddy-viscosity or eddy-diffusivity approach, with an exception of the dominant subgrid term, which is the subgrid part of the chemical source term. The latter subgrid contribution is modeled by a similarity model based upon 2\u0394, which is found to be superior to such a model based upon \u0394. Using the 2\u0394 similarity model for the subgrid chemistry the LES produces good results, certainly in view of the fact that the LES is completely wrong if the subgrid chemistry model is omitted. The grid refinements of the LES show that the results for \u0394 = h do depend on the numerical scheme, much more than for h = \u0394/2 and h = \u0394/4. Nevertheless, modeling errors and discretization error may partially cancel each other; occasionally the \u0394 = h results were more accurate than the h \u2264 \u0394 results. Finally, for this flame LES results obtained with the present similarity model are shown to be slightly better than those obtained with standard \u03b2-pdf closure for the subgrid chemistry.",

For one class of drugs the correlation between structural resemblance and similar action was analyzed in detail. In general Tanimoto coefficients and 3D scores give similar results, but we find that 2D similarity measures neglect important structural/funtional features. Examples for both over- and underestimation of similarity by 2D metrics are discussed. The required additional effort for 3D superpositions is assessed by implementation of a fast algorithm with a processing time below 0.01 s and a more sophisticated approach (0.5 s per superposition). According to the improvement of similarity detection compared to 2D screening and the pleasant rapidity on a desktop PC, full-atom 3D superposition will be an upcoming method of choice for library prioritization or similarity screening approaches.",

The evaluation of fingerprint similarity, that is, quantification of fingerprint overlap, is known to be biased by differences in molecular complexity and size. For example, similarity searching using optimized lead compounds that are typically more complex and larger than average database compounds often leads to the artificial selection of large molecules. A modified version of the Tversky coefficient has been introduced to balance such complexity effects. In addition, compound class-directed fingerprint bit position-dependent weight vectors have been designed to aid in the assessment of Tanimoto similarity. We show that by merging weight vectors with the modified Tversky coefficient, a class-directed similarity metric is obtained that effectively balances complexity effects and further improves the accuracy of fingerprint search calculations.",

        "abstract": "We present a chemometrics study in which we show the identity or degree of similarity of 3D protein structures of various G-CSF (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor) isolates. The G-CSF isolates share the same amino acid sequence, but the preparation was carried out by somehow diverse technologies. The comparison of 3D structures was made on the basis of 2D NMR NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement Spectroscopy) spectra of proteins. In searching for the most appropriate criteria to determine the identity or degree of similarity of selected spectral regions of different isolates, two methods for quantitative evaluation of identity/similarity were used. The first method compares all peaks in the two investigated protein spectral regions; the extent of peaks that overlap is determined. The second method includes spectral invariants originating from graph theory. The criteria of identity/similarity were calculated from graphs, derived from a collection of up to 200 peaks of investigated 2D NMR spectral region. The peaks were linked into a graph according to the sequential nearest neighborhoods. According to the first method all peaks were relevant, considering that spectral noise was previously removed; the largest similarity was found between the protein of a commercially available G-CSF drug and one of the three new isolates produced in the laboratory. The second method indicated that the pairwise similarity of the three new isolates is larger than the similarity of any of the new isolates with the commercially available drug. This is an expected result taking into account that the new isolates are produced by the same technology, while the commercial product has additives for long-term storage that could not be completely compensated. The proposed measure of similarity may help the developers of biosimilar products to optimize the controllable parameters of the production technology and eventually to argue the identity of the new isolate in comparison with the originator commercial product.",

        "abstract": "The Closest Substring Problem is one of the most important problems in the field of computational biology. It is stated as follows: given a set of t sequences s1, S2,...,St over an alphabet \u03a3, and two integers k, d with d \u2264 k, can one find a string s of length k and, for all i= 1,2,...,t, substrings oi of si, all of length k, such that d(s, oi) \u2264 d (for all i-1,2,...,t)? (here, d(.,.) represents the Hamming distance). Closest Substring was shown to be NP-hard (Proceedings of 10th SODA, 1999, pp. 633-642) and W[1]-hard with respect to the number t of input sequences (Proceedings of STACS'02, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 2285, 2002, pp. 262-273); recently, an important number of results concerning the parameterized computational complexity of Closest Substring has been added in Evans et al. (Theoret. Comput. Sci. 306 (1-3) (2003) 407). In this paper we introduce and analyze two variants of the Closest Substring Problem, obtained by imposing restrictions on the pairwise distances between the substrings oi: The bounded Hamming distance constraint asks that d(oi, oj) p, for all i, j \u2208 {1,2,...,t} (where p < 2d is a given constant) and yields the problem called BCCS; The sum-of-pairs constraint asks that \u03a3 1\u2264i\u2264j\u2264t d(oi, oj) \u2264 P (where P < dt(t - 1) is a given constant) and yields the problem called SCCS. We motivate the introduction of these problems, and we show that while SCCS is very close to Closest Substring, BCCS is a non-trivial restriction of Closest Substring more suitable to use in certain practical applications. We then concentrate on BCCS and show that all the hardness results available for Closest Substring remain valid for BCCS even when the parameter p is restricted to a certain range. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The first user study analysis concerns the most preferred distance function between two values of a dimension.

        "abstract": "Commenting on perceptual similarities between objects stands out as an important linguistic achievement, one that may pave the way towards noticing and commenting on more abstract relational commonalities between objects. To explore whether having a conventional linguistic system is necessary for children to comment on different types of similarity comparisons, we observed four children who had not been exposed to usable linguistic input - deaf children whose hearing losses prevented them from learning spoken language and whose hearing parents had not exposed them to sign language. These children developed gesture systems that have language-like structure at many different levels. Here we ask whether the deaf children used their gestures to comment on similarity relations and, if so, which types of relations they expressed. We found that all four deaf children were able to use their gestures to express similarity comparisons (point to cat + point to tiger) resembling those conveyed by 40 hearing children in early gesture + speech combinations (cat + point to tiger). However, the two groups diverged at later ages. Hearing children, after acquiring the word like, shifted from primarily expressing global similarity (as in cat/tiger) to primarily expressing single-property similarity (as in crayon is brown like my hair). In contrast, the deaf children, lacking an explicit term for similarity, continued to primarily express global similarity. The findings underscore the robustness of similarity comparisons in human communication, but also highlight the importance of conventional terms for comparison as likely contributors to routinely expressing more focused similarity relations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Municipal digested sludge is a dispersion of agglomerated particles or flocs in a liquid medium which exhibits yield stress, shear thinning behaviour and high irreversible temperature dependence. In this study, the rate of solubilisation of organic matter in digested sludge was investigated when sludge (at different solid concentrations) was exposed to thermal treatment between 50 and 80. ??C for 1 to 60. min. The organic matter solubilisation was measured using chemical oxygen demand (COD) analysis on liquor of the thermally treated sludge. The effects of the abovementioned temperature range and heating duration on yield stress and the apparent viscosity of sludge at different solid concentrations have also been investigated. The results showed that the irreversible effect of temperature was much higher at higher concentrations, higher temperatures and longer duration of treatment. It was also observed that for any sludge concentration the kinetic of COD solubilisation, yield stress and apparent viscosity reductions followed a logarithmic correlation with duration of thermal treatment. This similarity was also pronounced in the linear relationship between solubilised COD and yield stress and apparent viscosity reductions in all tested concentrations and the durations of heat treatment. Modified form of Herschel-Bulkley was used to obtain a master curve, independent of temperature, concentration and duration of thermal treatment. Furthermore, a new model was proposed for the impact of temperature and the duration of thermal treatment on yield stress and apparent viscosity reduction.",

        "abstract": "This paper concerns the use of similarities based on geometric distance in models of categorization. Two problematic implications of such similarities are outlined. First, in a comparison between two stimuli, geometric distance implies that matching features are not taken into account. Second, missing features are assumed not to exist. Only nonmatching features enter into calculations of similarity. A new model is constructed that is based on the ALCOVE model (Kruschke, 1992), but it uses a feature-matching similarity measure (see, e.g., Tversky, 1977) rather than a geometric one. It is an on-line model in the sense that both dimensions and exemplars are constructed during the categorization process. The model accounts better than ALCOVE does for data with missing features (Experiments 1 and 2) and at least as well as ALCOVE for a data set without missing features (Nosofsky, Kruschke, & McKinley, 1992). This suggests that, at least for some stimulus materials, similarity in categorization is more akin to a feature-matching procedure than to geometric distance calculation.",

In addition, the similarity of the types of passages (narrative or expository) in a pair was manipulated. Performance was measured with self-paced reading time of the sentences and with accuracy in answering comprehension questions. In two experiments, interruption slowed the reading of text sentences; this effect of interruption was greatest when the interrupting text was of the same style as the primary text (an interruption-similarity effect). We discuss these results with respect to current models of the role of working memory in discourse processing.",

Outsourcing offers the data owner scalability and a low-initial investment. The need for privacy may be due to the data being sensitive (e.g., in medicine), valuable (e.g., in astronomy), or otherwise confidential. Given this setting, the paper presents techniques that transform the data prior to supplying it to the service provider for similarity queries on the transformed data. Our techniques provide interesting trade-offs between query cost and accuracy. They are then further extended to offer an intuitive privacy guarantee. Empirical studies with real data demonstrate that the techniques are capable of offering privacy while enabling efficient and accurate processing of similarity queries.",

The clustering effect by using such spectral method, however, depends heavily on the description of similarity between instances of the datasets. In this paper, we defined the adjustable line segment length which can adjust the distance in regions with different density. It squeezes the distances in high density regions while widen them in low density regions. And then a density sensitive distance measure satisfied by symmetric, non-negative, reflexivity and triangle inequality was present, by which we can define a new similarity function for spectral clustering. Experimental results show that compared with conventional Euclidean distance based and Gaussian kernel function based spectral clustering, our proposed algorithm with density sensitive similarity measure can obtain desirable clusters with high performance on both synthetic and real life datasets. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although all are constructed to correctly reproduce the basic subdiffusive property of this phenomenon, using similarity methods it becomes very clear that this is far from sufficient to confirm their validity. The similarity group that they all have in common is the natural basis for making comparisons between these otherwise different equations, and a practical basis for comparisons between the very different modelling assumptions that their solutions each represent. Similarity induces a natural space in which to compare these solutions both with one another and with data from numerical experiments on fractals. It also reduces the differential equations to (extra-) ordinary ones, which are presented here for the first time. It becomes clear here from this approach that the proposed equations cannot agree even qualitatively with either each other or the data, suggesting that a new approach is needed.",

We distinguish this from the greenbeard effect, in which cooperation evolves through fixed phenotypic tags and genetically linked cooperative behaviour with others displaying the same tag. Our agent-based simulations show that the evolution of cooperation through similarity discrimination, in contrast to the greenbeard effect, does not depend on population viscosity or other restrictive conditions. Similarity discrimination evolves spontaneously in well mixed populations, not only in the Prisoner's Dilemma game but also across a range of different binary-choice strategic interactions, provided that agents can distinguish reliably between similar and dissimilar co-players. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The similarity measures are equivalent to the Euclidean distance between points in that space. Only the distances between the potentials at corresponding atoms in different molecules are included. The distances for benzene rings were very similar, regardless of whether they were calculated in para-substituted acids or in monosubstituted benzenes. As reference reactions, dissociation of benzoic acids and nitration of monosubstituted benzenes have been used. The effects of reduction of dimensionality of the potential space on the comparison of similarity measures with the free energies of the reference reactions have been investigated. It became obvious that the potentials at individual atoms in molecules of the acids and monosubstituted benzenes are mutually correlated to a high degree. ",

The difference between the two spectra is defined by a difference vector, which is one spectrum minus the other. The spectral similarity measure is transformed into a hypothesis test of the similarities and differences between the two spectra. The scalar mean of the difference vector is used as the statistical variable for the hypothesis test. A threshold for the hypothesis that the spectra are different was proposed. The Bayesian prior odds ratio was estimated from multiple spectra of the same sample. The posterior odds ratio was used to quantity the spectral similarity measure of the two spectra.

Anti-resemblism plays crucial roles in the philosophy of David Lewis. For instance, Lewis has argued that his counterpart theory is anti-essentialist on the grounds that counterpart relations are relations of comparative overall similarity and that anti-resemblism is true. After Lewis committed himself to a form of realism about natural properties he maintained that anti-resemblism is true about the relations of overall similarity that enter his counterpart theory and his analysis of counterfactuals. However, in this article I argue that Lewis\u2019s account of degrees of naturalness for properties combined with his modal realism entails that anti-resemblism is false. The Lewisian must amend Lewis\u2019s system if she aims to benefit from the alleged virtues of anti-resemblism. I consider two ways of amending it, neither of which is a free lunch.",

Unlike many existing methods, our method compares the source codes indirectly using reference vectors instead of using the original source codes. Elements of the vectors are textural features of token-cooccurrence matrices generated from the source codes. Since similarity is simply defined as a distance between two reference vectors, it can be calculated in a very short time. Another advantage is that we do not need to retain a huge storage area for source codes when applying this method to a source code retrieval system. We implemented the proposed method on a simple source code retrieval system and made experiments with Java program source codes submitted as assignments for a programming class. Results confirmed that our method can effectively find reasonable similarity between pairs of source codes in a short time.",

Subjects memorized portraits, landscapes, and abstract compositions by six painters with a unique style, and later performed a memory recognition task. The prototypes were presented with new exemplars that were either visually similar or dissimilar. Behaviorally, novel, dissimilar items were detected faster and more accurately. We found activation in a distributed cortical network that included face- and object-selective regions in the visual cortex, where familiar prototypes evoked stronger responses than new exemplars; attention-related regions in parietal cortex, where responses elicited by new exemplars were reduced with decreased similarity to the prototypes; and the hippocampus and memory-related regions in parietal and prefrontal cortices, where stronger responses were evoked by the dissimilar exemplars. Our findings suggest that recognition memory is mediated by classification of novel exemplars as a match or a mismatch, based on their visual similarity to familiar prototypes. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Texture features are then extracted from these filters and passed into a dynamic clustering procedure, which is called visual similarity clustering.

The relationship between the distinguishing terms of the short text snippets can be discovered by examining their probabilities under each topic.

We present a solution using approximation, which can perform nearest-neighbour searches using distance metrics different from the one used to build the index tree without the need of rebuilding the tree.

We rst dene an expressive model of directed labeled graph, allowing multiple labels on vertices and edges. Then we dene the similarity problem as the search of a best mapping, where a mapping is a correspondence between vertices of the graphs. A key point of our approach is that this mapping does not have to be univalent, so that a vertex in a graph may be associated with several vertices of the other graph. Another key point is that the quality of the mapping is determined by generic functions, which can be tuned in order to implement domain-dependant knowledge. We discuss some computational issues related to this problem, and we describe a greedy algorithm for it. Finally, we show that our approach provides not only a quantitative measure of the similarity, but also qualitative information which can prove valuable in the adaptation phase of CBR. 1",

The results show that the influence of sub-syllabic mechanisms on STM performance is independent of speech production processes, and similarity in the pattern of results suggests that the same mechanisms subserve the recall of words and nonwords in STM.

Not only are there many thousands of proteins of unknown function, current approaches for predicting function must be improved upon. One problem in particular is overly-specific function predictions which we address here with a new statistical model of the relationship between protein sequence similarity and protein function similarity.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY: Our statistical model is based on sets of proteins with experimentally validated functions and numeric measures of function specificity and function similarity derived from the Gene Ontology. The model predicts the similarity of function between two proteins given their amino acid sequence similarity measured by statistics from the BLAST sequence alignment algorithm. A novel aspect of our model is that it predicts the degree of function similarity shared between two proteins over a continuous range of sequence similarity, facilitating prediction of function with an appropriate level of specificity.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE: Our model shows nearly exact function similarity for proteins with high sequence similarity (bit score >244.7, e-value >1e(-62), non-redundant NCBI protein database (NRDB)) and only small likelihood of specific function match for proteins with low sequence similarity (bit score <54.6, e-value <1e(-05), NRDB). For sequence similarity ranges in between our annotation model shows an increasing relationship between function similarity and sequence similarity, but with considerable variability. We applied the model to a large set of proteins of unknown function, and predicted functions for thousands of these proteins ranging from general to very specific. We also applied the model to a data set of proteins with previously assigned, specific functions that were electronically based. We show that, on average, these prior function predictions are more specific (quite possibly overly-specific) compared to predictions from our model that is based on proteins with experimentally determined function.",

Going beyond three or four targets, the complexity of underlying activity spaces is difficult to capture in conventional activity landscape views. Previous attempts to generate multitarget activity landscapes have predominantly utilized extensions of molecular network representations or plots of activity versus chemical similarity for pairs of active compounds. Herein, we introduce a three-dimensional multitarget activity landscape design that is based upon principles of radial coordinate visualization. Circular representations of multitarget activity and chemical reference space are combined to generate a spherical view into which compound sets are projected for interactive analysis. Interpretation of landscape content is facilitated by following three canonical views of activity, chemical, and combined activity/chemical space, respectively. These views focus on different planes of the underlying coordinate system. From the activity and combined views, compounds with well-defined target selectivity and structure-activity profile relationships can be extracted. In the activity landscape, such compounds display characteristic spatial arrangements and target activity patterns.",

We combined behavioral habituation experiments with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of glandular secretions from the left and right flank gland and midventral gland of the rat-like hamster, Tscheskia triton. We found that females became habituated to one scent and then could discriminate individuals via another scent source from the same individual only when familiar with the scent donor. However, this prior social interaction was not required for females to discriminate different individuals in single-stimulus habituation-dishabituation tests. Chemical analyses revealed a similarity in volatile compounds between the left and right flank gland and midventral gland scents. It appears that individually distinctive cues are integratively coded by a combination of both flank gland and midventral gland secretions, instead of a single scent, albeit animals show different preferences to the novel scent. Our results suggest that odors from the flank and midventral glands may provide information related to individuality and aid individual recognition in this species and confirm that prior interaction between individuals is a prerequisite for rat-like hamsters to form multi-odor memory of a particular conspecific.",

        "abstract": "Animals of different sizes tend to move in a dynamically similar manner when travelling at speeds corresponding to equal values of a dimensionless parameter (DP) called the Froude number. Consequently, the Froude number has been widely used for defining equivalent speeds and predicting speeds of locomotion by extinct species and on other planets. However, experiments using simulated reduced gravity have demonstrated that equality of the Froude number does not guarantee dynamic similarity. This has cast doubt upon the usefulness of the Froude number in locomotion research. Here we use dimensional analysis of the planar spring-mass model, combined with Buckingham's Pi-Theorem, to demonstrate that four DPs must be equal for dynamic similarity in bouncing gaits such as trotting, hopping and bipedal running. This can be reduced to three DPs by applying the constraint of maintaining a constant average speed of locomotion. Sensitivity analysis indicates that all of these DPs are important for predicting dynamic similarity. We show that the reason humans do not run in a dynamically similar manner at equal Froude number in different levels of simulated reduced gravity is that dimensionless leg stiffness decreases as gravity increases. The reason that the Froude number can predict dynamic similarity in Earth gravity is that dimensionless leg stiffness and dimensionless vertical landing speed are both independent of size. In conclusion, although equal Froude number is not sufficient for dynamic similarity, it is a necessary condition. Therefore, to detect fundamental differences in locomotion, animals of different sizes should be compared at equal Froude number, so that they can be as close to dynamic similarity as possible. More generally, the concept of dynamic similarity provides a powerful framework within which similarities and differences in locomotion can be interpreted. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional measures are brittle: They estimate the surface overlap between documents based on the words they mention and ignore deeper semantic connections. We propose a new measure that assesses similarity at both the lexical and semantic levels, and learns from human judgments how to combine them by using machine-learning techniques. Experiments show that the new measure produces values for documents that are more consistent with people's judgments than people are with each other. We also use it to classify and cluster large document sets covering different genres and topics, and find that it improves both classification and clustering performance.",
