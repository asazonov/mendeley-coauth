        "abstract": "With the publication of draft maps of the human genome and an interim agreement that the human genome comprises approximately 21000 genes, there has been considerable anticipation that many novel disease-specific molecular targets will be rapidly identified and that these will form the basis of many new drug discovery programs. Genes associated with a given disease can thus be identified using genotyping and microarray approaches. However, transitioning from the identification to the subsequent validation and prioritization of their cognate proteins as bona fide drug targets using proteomic techniques \u2013 a process that could appropriately be termed targetomics \u2014 is still very much in its infancy, with expectations far exceeding present capabilities. The criteria for target validation have yet to be determined and the timing to success has been underestimated. Integrated pharmacological approaches that involve the use of the traditional null hypothesis approach and statistically validated replication have been largely overlooked in the enthusiasm to be the first to find new targets. Inevitably, the only useful measure of target validation occurs when a drug-like molecule, selective for the identified target, is advanced to the clinic where it can be shown to be efficacious in the appropriate human disease state.",

Often, the full consequences of inhibiting a chosen drug target do not emerge until late in the development process. One option is to use hammerhead ribozymes as highly specific ribonucleases targeted exclusively at the mRNA encoding the target protein. The first part of this review is concerned with the mechanism and design of hammerhead ribozymes. This includes the chemistry of their action, specificity of cleavage and ability to discriminate between different mRNAs and selection of suitable cleavage sites. In considering their use for target validation, hammerhead ribozymes are divided into two categories. Endogenous ribozymes are transcribed inside the cell where they act whilst exogenous are introduced into the cell from outside. Exogenous ribozymes are synthesised chemically and must be protected against cellular nucleases. Information is provided on transfection methods and vectors that have been used with endogenous ribozymes as well as synthesis and chemical modification of exogenous ribozymes. Of proteins inhibited in cells or whole organisms, those in animal experiments are emphasised. Comparisons are made with other approaches, especially the use of antisense oligonucleotides or RNA.",

Precise mapping of miRNA-directed cleavage sites within target transcripts is, therefore, possible using RNA ligase-mediated 5' amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE). Here, we provide a comprehensive RLM-RACE-based protocol for the amplification of 5' ends derived from cleaved transcripts resulting from miRNA-guided cleavage events. Novel strategies for high-throughput analysis of miRNA cleavage products have emerged as powerful tools for the novo identification of miRNA targets in a genomic perspective. In this work, we also describe a novel methodology for genome-wide identification of miRNA targets that exploits RLM-RACE for non-sequence-specific enrichment of cleaved transcripts, T7 RNA polymerase-mediated amplification of target products, and microarray hybridization.",

Cancer biology is widely studied and translating these findings into efficacious targeted therapies requires more than just target validation. Targets identified pre-clinically must be reproducible in other models that harbor the target. In addition, the extent and duration with which the target is modulated is at times essential for efficacy. Further, not only the target is of focus but also any inherent feedback mechanisms or mechanisms of acquired resistance should be understood to optimize chemistry of agents in development to target the tumor biology and to inform on combination approaches. Another element of a target that will likely contribute to successful clinical validation include the impact of target intra-tumor and inter-tumor heterogeneity on clinical efficacy.

To accomplish this goal, significant resources are invested into automation of the screening process or HTS. Robotic systems capable of handling thousands of data points per day are implemented across the pharmaceutical sector. Many of these systems are amenable to handling cell-based screening protocols as well. On the other hand, as companies strive to develop innovative products based on novel mechanisms of action(s), one of the current bottlenecks of the industry is the target validation process. Traditionally, bioinformatics and HTS groups operate separately at different stages of the drug discovery process. The authors describe the convergence and integration of HTS and bioinformatics to perform high-throughput target functional identification and validation. As an example of this approach, they initiated a project with a functional cell-based screen for a biological process of interest using libraries of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules. In this protocol, siRNAs function as potent gene-specific inhibitors. siRNA-mediated knockdown of the target genes is confirmed by TaqMan analysis, and genes with impacts on biological functions of interest are selected for further analysis. Once the genes are confirmed and further validated, they may be used for HTS to yield lead compounds.",

Here we show using CRISPR-Cas9-based target validation in lung and colorectal cancer that the activity of nutlin, which blocks the p53-binding pocket of Mdm2, strictly depends on functional p53. In contrast, sensitivity to the drug RITA, which binds the Mdm2-interacting N terminus of p53, correlates with induction of DNA damage. Cells with primary or acquired RITA resistance display cross-resistance to DNA crosslinking compounds such as cisplatin and show increased DNA cross-link repair. Inhibition of FancD2 by RNA interference or pharmacological mTOR inhibitors restores RITA sensitivity. The therapeutic response to p53-reactivating compounds is therefore limited by compound-specific resistance mechanisms that can be resolved by CRISPR-Cas9-based target validation and should be considered when allocating patients to p53-reactivating treatments.",

        "abstract": "A review. With the completion of sequencing of the human genome, a great deal of interest has been shifted toward functional genomics-based research for identification of novel drug targets for treatment of various diseases. The major challenge facing the pharmaceutical industry is to identify disease-causing genes and elucidate addnl. roles for genes of known functions. Gene functionalization and target validation are probably the most important steps involved in identifying novel potential drug targets. This review focuses on recent advances in antisense technol. and its use for rapid identification and validation of new drug targets. The significance and applicability of this technol. as a beginning of the drug discovery process are underscored by relevant cell culture-based assays and pos. correlation in specific animal disease models. Some of the antisense inhibitors used to validate gene targets are themselves being developed as drugs. The current clin. trials based on such leads that were identified in a very short time further substantiate the importance of antisense technol.-based functional genomics as an integral part of target validation and drug target identification.

One challenge is target validation, proving the usefulness of a specific target in an animal model. In this paper, we demonstrate a new approach to validation and assay development. We selected in vitro specific peptide binders to a potential pathogen target. By inducing the expression of a selected peptide in pathogen cells causing a lethal infection in mice, the animals were rescued. Thus, by combining in vitro selection methods for peptide binders with inducible expression in animals, the target's validity was rigorously tested and demonstrated. This approach to validation can be generalized and has the potential to become a valuable tool in the drug discovery process.

BRDs are present in diverse proteins that play key functions in chromatin organization and regulation of gene transcription. Aberrant transcription is a hallmark of many diseases in particular cancer and inflammation. The complexity of molecular processes regulating gene transcription identified transcriptional regulators as interesting target for the development of specific chemical tool molecules (chemical probes) that help to understand the molecular mechanisms of transcription and to explore the potential of BRD mediated interactions as sites for pharmaceutical intervention. Recently a number of highly specific inhibitors have been developed against the BET (bromo and extra terminal) family of bromodomains. The availability of selective BRD inhibitors had a significant impact on the validation of bromodomain containing protein as targets for drug development and for our understanding of the biological roles of these proteins. In this review we will summarize the discovery of BET bromodomain inhibitors and their roles in target validation.",

        "abstract": "In the simplest view, aptamers can be thought of as nucleic acid analogs to antibodies. They are able to bind specifically to proteins, and, in many cases, that binding leads to a modulation of protein activity. New aptamers are rapidly generated through the SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment) process and have a very high target affinity and specificity (picomoles to nanomoles). Furthermore, aptamers composed of modified nucleotides have a long in vivo half-life (hours to days), are nontoxic and nonimmunogenic, and are easily produced using standard nucleic acid synthesis methods. These properties make aptamers ideal for target validation and as a new class of therapeutics. As a target validation tool, aptamers provide important information that complements that provided by other methods. For example, siRNA is widely used to demonstrate that protein knock-out in a cellular assay can lead to a biological effect. Aptamers extend that information by showing that the dose-dependent modulation of protein activity can be used to derive a therapeutic benefit. That is, aptamers can be used to demonstrate that the protein is a good target for drug development. As a new class of therapeutics, aptamers bridge the gap between small molecules and biologics. Like biologics, biologically active aptamers are rapidly discovered, have no class-specific toxicity, and are adept at disrupting protein-protein interaction. Like small molecules, aptamers can be rationally engineered and optimized, are nonimmunogenic, and are produced by scalable chemical procedures at moderate cost. As such, aptamers are emerging as an important source of new therapeutic molecules.",

        "abstract": "In the context of combining Radar and Vision sensors for a fusion application in dense city traffic situations, one of the major challenges is to be able to validate Radar targets. We take a high-level fusion approach assuming that both sensor modalities have the capacity to independently lo- cate and identify targets of interest. In this context, Radar targets can either correspond to a Vision target\u2014in which case the target is validated without further processing \u2014 or not. It is the latter case that drives the focus of this pa- per. A non-matched Radar target can correspond to some solid object which is not part of the objects of interest of the Vision sensor (such as a guard-rail) or can be caused by reflections in which case it is a ghost target which does not match any physical object in the real world. We describe a number of computational steps for the deci- sion making of non-matched Radar targets. The computa- tions combine both direct motion parallax measurements and indirect motion analysis \u2014 which are not sufficient for computing parallax but are nevertheless quite effective \u2014 and pattern classification steps for covering situations which motion analysis are weak or ineffective. One of the major advantages of our high-level fusion approach is that it allows the use of simpler (low cost) Radar technology to create a combined high performance system.",

The causal association of candidate targets with AD is of paramount importance in current drug discovery, as a lack of efficacy of many candidate drugs is often due to inadequate validation of their pharmacological target. In Alzheimer's as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases, in vitro target validation is hampered by the difficulty of transfecting primary neuronal cultures and assaying the effects of genes on neuronal viability. Here we describe a rapid, sensitive and simple reporter-based assay for the validation of genes putatively associated with A??-mediated neurotoxicity, which can in principle be extended to the validation of targets in the context of other neuronal insults. The assay is suitable for the generation of robust and reproducible data in primary neuronal cultures allowing the dissection at a molecular level of complex pathways activated by the toxic insult in a cellular context that more closely represents the real disease situation. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Concerns over the possibility of resistance developing to praziquantel (PZQ), has stimulated efforts to develop new drugs for schistosomiasis. In addition to the development of improved whole organism screens, the success of RNA interference (RNAi) in schistosomes offers great promise for the identification of potential drug targets to initiate drug discovery. In this study we set out to contribute to RNAi based validation of putative drug targets. Initially a list of 24 target candidates was compiled based on the identification of putative essential genes in schistosomes orthologous of C. elegans essential genes. Knockdown of Calmodulin (Smp_026560.2) (Sm-Calm), that topped this list, produced a phenotype characterised by waves of contraction in adult worms but no phenotype in schistosomula. Knockdown of the atypical Protein Kinase C (Smp_096310) (Sm-aPKC) resulted in loss of viability in both schistosomula and adults and led us to focus our attention on other kinase genes that were identified in the above list and through whole organism screening of known kinase inhibitor sets followed by chemogenomic evaluation. RNAi knockdown of these kinase genes failed to affect adult worm viability but, like Sm-aPKC, knockdown of Polo-like kinase 1, Sm-PLK1 (Smp_009600) and p38-MAPK, Sm-MAPK p38 (Smp_133020) resulted in an increased mortality of schistosomula after 2-3 weeks, an effect more marked in the presence of human red blood cells (hRBC). For Sm-PLK-1 the same effects were seen with the specific inhibitor, BI2536, which also affected viable egg production in adult worms. For Sm-PLK-1 and Sm-aPKC the in vitro effects were reflected in lower recoveries in vivo. We conclude that the use of RNAi combined with culture with hRBC is a reliable method for evaluating genes important for larval development. However, in view of the slow manifestation of the effects of Sm-aPKC knockdown in adults and the lack of effects of Sm-PLK-1 and Sm-MAPK p38 on adult viability, these kinases may not represent suitable drug targets.",

        "abstract": "Target identification for tractography studies requires solid anatomical knowledge validated by an extensive literature review across species for each seed structure to be studied. Manual literature review to identify targets for a given seed region is tedious and potentially subjective. Therefore, complementary approaches would be useful. We propose to use text-mining models to automatically suggest potential targets from the neuroscientific literature, full-text articles and abstracts, so that they can be used for anatomical connection studies and more specifically for tractography. We applied text-mining models to three structures: two well-studied structures, since validated deep brain stimulation targets, the internal globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus and, the nucleus accumbens, an exploratory target for treating psychiatric disorders. We performed a systematic review of the literature to document the projections of the three selected structures and compared it with the targets proposed by text-mining models, both in rat and primate (including human). We ran probabilistic tractography on the nucleus accumbens and compared the output with the results of the text-mining models and literature review. Overall, text-mining the literature could find three times as many targets as two man-weeks of curation could. The overall efficiency of the text-mining against literature review in our study was 98% recall (at 36% precision), meaning that over all the targets for the three selected seeds, only one target has been missed by text-mining. We demonstrate that connectivity for a structure of interest can be extracted from a very large amount of publications and abstracts. We believe this tool will be useful in helping the neuroscience community to facilitate connectivity studies of particular brain regions. The text mining tools used for the study are part of the HBP Neuroinformatics Platform, publicly available at http://connectivity-brainer.rhcloud.com/.",

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive disease of cartilage degradation that significantly impacts quality of life. There are currently no effective treatments and, while a large number of potential therapeutic targets exist, most have not been validated in vivo. The range of OA models in the mouse has dramatically expanded in the last decade, beyond spontaneous models, to include genetically modified transgenic, knockout (KO) and knock-in (KI) mice that can develop premature cartilage degeneration reminiscent of OA. In addition, instability models of OA, either induced by intra-articular (IA) collagenase or surgery, are providing a set of tools to assist in the identification of disease-modifying OA drug (DMOAD) targets. These models are now vital tools to dissect the pathways essential to the pathogenesis of OA. Two targets, ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-like motifs)-5 and IL-1beta (interleukin-1 beta), have been validated in the surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus model (DMM) in KO mice. Other potential targets evaluated in instability models, either showed no disease modification or a worsening of disease, suggesting that those targets have no role, a protective role or that other, more destructive enzymes etc., can overcompensate. Development of small molecule or protein antagonist inhibitors of therapeutic targets require many years to bring to clinical trials and often confront potency and safety issues which impede successful progress. Validation, or confirmation of therapeutic targets in vivo is most clearly and efficiently obtained by using KO studies, than by creating potent and selective DMOADs to multiple potential targets. While the results in the mouse will not always transpose to the human condition, the track record of mouse knockouts corresponding to the human phenotype have been excellent. These results indicate that the evaluation of genetically modified mice will become increasingly important as we unravel the genes contributing to OA.",

In this process, the function of a gene is inhibited and the consequence of its loss on a desired biological function, such as tumor growth and metastasis, is monitored. RNA interference (RNAi) has been found to be the most effective method to specifically inhibit gene expression. Notably, interactions between cancer cells, stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) are crucial to angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Tumor cells and the surrounding stroma are the principle source of growth factors and cytokines, which induce remodeling of the ECM mediated by metalloproteases (MMPs) secreted by macrophages. The production of macrophages is regulated by colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1, which is overexpressed in several tumors. When short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting either the CSF-1 or its receptors were delivered into colon and breast cancer xenografts in mice, tumor growth was inhibited. Associated with this suppression, we observed decreased tumor vascularity, reduced expression of angiogenic factors and MMPs, and decreased macrophage recruitment to the tumors.

Current transient siRNA and stable shRNA systems, however, have limited utility in accurately assessing the cancer dependency due to their short-lived effects and limited in vivo utility, respectively. In this study, a single-vector lentiviral, Tet-inducible shRNA system (pLKO-Tet-On) was generated to allow for the rapid generation of multiple stable cell lines with regulatable shRNA expression. We demonstrate the advantages and versatility of this system by targeting two polycomb group proteins, Bmi-1 and Mel-18, in a number of cancer cell lines. Our data show that pLKO-Tet-On-mediated knockdown is tightly regulated by the inducer tetracycline and its derivative, doxycycline, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, target gene expression is fully restored upon withdrawal of the inducing agent. An additional, 17 distinct gene products have been targeted by inducible shRNAs with robust regulation in all cases. Importantly, we functionally validate the ability of the pLKO-Tet-On vector to reversibly silence targeted transcripts in vivo. The versatile and robust inducible lentiviral RNAi system reported herein can therefore serve as a powerful tool to rapidly reveal tumor cell dependence.",

The pathway structure is characterized by a T(SH)(2) synthetic module of low flux and low catalytic capacity, and another more catalytically efficient T(SH)(2) -dependent antioxidant/regenerating module. The model allowed quantification of the contribution of each enzyme to the control of T(SH)(2) synthesis and concentration (flux control and concentration control coefficients, respectively). The main control of flux was exerted by \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase (\u03b3ECS) and trypanothione synthetase (TryS) (control coefficients of 0.58-0.7 and 0.49-0.58, respectively), followed by spermidine transport (0.24); negligible flux controls by trypantothione reductase (TryR) and the T(SH)(2)-dependent antioxidant machinery were determined. The concentration of reduced T(SH)(2) was controlled by TryR (0.98) and oxidative stress (-0.99); however, \u03b3ECS and TryS also exerted control on the cellular level of T(SH(2)) when they were inhibited by more than 70%. The model predicted that in order to diminish the T(SH)(2) synthesis flux by 50%, it is necessary to inhibit \u03b3ECS or TryS by 58 or 63%, respectively, or both by 50%, whereas more than 98% inhibition was required for TryR. Hence, simultaneous and moderate inhibition of \u03b3ECS and TryS appears to be a promising multi-target therapeutic strategy. In contrast, use of highly potent and specific inhibitors for TryR and the antioxidant machinery is necessary to affect the antioxidant capabilities of the parasites.",

In addition, cardiac arrhythmias and epileptic activity can be treated with sodium channel blockers. As we have learned more about the sub-types of sodium channels and their distribution, new therapeutic opportunities have suggested themselves. There are indications that sodium channel blockers may also be useful in affective disorders and schizophrenia. The production of tissue-specific and eventually inducible knock out mice as well as genetic studies has proved useful in understanding the specialised role of individual types of sodium channels. The development of sub-type specific blockers has proved slower than anticipated, although the properties of naturally occurring toxin blockers suggest that subtype-specific blockers of sodium channels could be very useful clinically in the treatment of pain.",

        "abstract": "Our approach aims to optimize postscreening target validation strategies using viral vector-driven RNA interference (RNAi) cell models. The RNAiONE validation platform is an array of plasmid-based expression vectors that each drives tandem expression of the gene of interest (GOI) with one small hairpin RNA (shRNA) from a set of computed candidate sequences. The best-performing shRNA (>85% silencing efficiency) is then integrated in an inducible, all-in-one lentiviral vector to transduce pharmacologically relevant cell types that endogenously express the GOI. VariCHECK is used subsequently to combine the inducible knockdown with an equally inducible rescue of the GOI for ON-target phenotype verification. The complete RNAiONE-VariCHECK system relies on three key elements to ensure high predictability: (1) maximized silencing efficiencies by a focused shRNA validation process, (2) homogeneity of the RNAi cell pools by application of sophisticated viral vector technologies, and (3) exploiting the advantages of inducible expression systems. By using a reversible expression system, our strategy adds critical information to hot candidates from RNAi screens and avoids potential side effects that may be caused by other, irreversible genomic manipulation methods such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas). This approach will add credibility to top-hit screening candidates and protect researchers from costly misinterpretations early in the preclinical drug development process.",

Hypoxia resulted in transcriptional activation of the S100C promoter through hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). Taurine suppressed HIF-1-mediated increases in S100C transcription. Moreover, oral taurine administration attenuated vascular remodeling in hypoxic rat lung, whereas depletion of endogenous taurine by administration of beta-alanine resulted in increased vascular remodeling. Inhibition of HIF transcription by taurine may be of therapeutic benefit in preventing hypoxia-induced vascular remodeling. In conclusion, we used transcriptome and metabolome analysis to identify a therapeutic low-molecular-weight ligand that plays a critical role in hypoxia-induced vascular remodeling.

To do this, we have characterized fluorophore-assisted light inactivation (FALI) which uses coherent or diffuse light targeted by fluorescein-labeled probes to inactivate specific proteins. We have shown that it is spatially restricted and tested its efficacy in living cells. FALI is efficient using conventional antibodies and single chain variable fragment phage display antibodies (that are compatible with high-throughput applications). We have shown that singlet oxygen is one of the major components required for FALI-mediated damage. The half-maximal radius of damage is approximately 40 A. FALI causes the specific loss of function of beta 1 integrin in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells resulting in a reduction in invasiveness. The efficacy of diffuse light sources (such as a desk lamp) with FALI to inactivate many samples in parallel provides an inexpensive, high-throughput method of wide general applicability for functional proteomics.",

Treatment options for cryptosporidiosis are limited, with the current therapeutic nitazoxanide, only partly efficacious in immunocompetent individuals. The parasite lacks de novo purine synthesis, and is exclusively dependant on purine salvage from its host. Inhibition of the inosine 5' monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a purine salvage enzyme that is essential for DNA synthesis, thereby offers a potential drug target against this parasite. In the present study, a yeast-two-hybrid system was used to identify Phylomer peptides within a library constructed from the genomes of 25 phylogenetically diverse bacteria that targeted the IMPDH of Cryptosporidium parvum (IMPcp) and Cryptosporidium hominis (IMPch). We identified 38 unique interacting Phylomers, of which, 12 were synthesised and screened against C. parvum in vitro. Two Phylomers exhibited significant growth inhibition (81.2-83.8% inhibition; P < 0.05), one of which consistently exhibited positive interactions with IMPcp and IMPch during primary and recapitulation yeast two-hybrid screening and did not interact with either of the human IMPDH proteins. The present study highlightsthe potential of Phylomer peptides as target validation tools for Cryptosporidium and other organisms and diseases because of their ability to bind with high affinity to target proteins and disrupt function.",

        "abstract": "The attempt to develop novel antibiotics, active against organisms resistant to current therapies, has led researchers to seek and explore new drug targets. The rapid sequencing and analysis of entire microbial genomes has identified large numbers of genes that may be sufficiently different from their human counterparts to be exploited as targets for antimicrobial treatment. As a first step, the importance of the various putative targets for microbial growth and survival must be assessed. Emerging validation technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated and, in certain cases, allow prioritisation of the best targets. In this paper, genetically assisted target evaluation (GATE) is introduced as a versatile target validation technology. GATE concomitantly manipulates both synthesis and stability of the targeted protein using copper ions as an effector. This technology allows rapid quantitation of the lethal consequences of inactivation of targeted gene products in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Additional tools can then be applied to extend these results into pathogenic organisms, such as Candida albicans.",

        "abstract": "We previously identified a cross-tick species conserved tick feeding stimuli responsive Amblyomma americanum (Aam) AV422 gene. This study demonstrates that AamAV422 belongs to a novel group of arthropod proteins that is characterized by 14 cysteine amino acid residues: C23-X7/9-C33-X23/24-C58-X8-C67-X7-C75-X23-C99-X15-C115-X10-C126-X24/25/33-C150C151-X7-C159-X8-C168-X23/24-C192-X9/10-C202 predicted to form seven disulfide bonds. We show that AamAV422 protein is a ubiquitously expressed protein that is injected into the host within the first 24h of the tick attaching onto the host as revealed by Western blotting analyses of recombinant (r)AamAV422, tick saliva and dissected tick organ protein extracts using antibodies to 24 and 48h tick saliva proteins. Native AamAV422 is apparently involved with mediating tick anti-hemostasis and anti-complement functions in that rAamAV422 delayed plasma clotting time in a dose responsive manner by up to \u223c160s, prevented platelet aggregation by up to \u223c16% and caused \u223c24% reduction in production of terminal complement complexes. Target validation analysis revealed that rAamAV422 is a potential candidate for a cocktail or multivalent tick vaccine preparation in that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of AamAV422 mRNA caused a statistically significant (\u223c44%) reduction in tick engorgement weights, which is proxy for amounts of ingested blood. We speculate that AamAV422 is a potential target antigen for development of the highly desired universal tick vaccine in that consistent with high conservation among ticks, antibodies to 24h Ixodes scapularis tick saliva proteins specifically bound rAamAV422. We discuss data in this study in the context of advancing the biology of tick feeding physiology and discovery of potential target antigens for tick vaccine development. \u00a9 2013 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.",

        "abstract": "A Biochemical Pharmacology Discussion Group Conference, was held at the headquarters of the New York Academy of Sciences on December 4, 2001 as part of an ongoing series designed to highlight and review areas important to modern drug development (Figure 1). Briefly introduced by Tom Kost (GlaxoSmithKline) and Michael Lotze (University of Pittsburgh), the focus was on the intersection of genomics, proteomics, and now \"viromics.\" The latter term refers to the use of viruses and viral gene transfer to explore the complexity arising from the vast array of new targets available from the human and murine genomes. Indeed, access to large numbers of genes using viral vectors is a key tool for drug discovery and drug delivery. With 38,000 genes identified within the human genome, only 5000 are considered readily druggable. Generating tools such as these to validate targets represents a major part of the armamentarium of the postgenomic scientist. During the last 12 years alone, there have been over 26,000 publications on virus vectors. Many of them have been found useful in target validation, assay development, and evaluation in in vivo models and gene therapy. Thus, there is now an extensive knowledge base for several viral vectors, with unique attributes within each of them providing versatility, efficiency, and ease of use. The individual scientists presenting at the meeting illustrated many of the unique and useful characteristics of such vector systems including retrovirus, adenovirus, herpes virus, simbis virus, and baculovirus.",

        "abstract": "With the completion of the sequence of the human genome, emphasis is now switching to the human proteome. However, the number of proteins is not only larger than mRNAs in the transcriptome, proteins need often to be in complex with other proteins to be functional. A favourable option to study proteins in their natural context is with a combination of biochemical and microscopic techniques using specific antibodies. Therefore, we designed a fast, reliable and controllable selection and screening of single-domain antibody fragments (VHH) from a Camelid non-immune library. We isolated VHH for four muscle disease related proteins; emerin, actin, tropomyosin-1, and nuclear poly(A)-binding protein. Important features of antibodies for target validation studies are recognition of the antigen in natural conformations and biologically relevant complexes. We show that selected antibody fragments are functional in various immunological techniques and prove useful in diagnostic applications. Our selection strategy is amenable to automation and to the establishment of proteomics platforms. It opens the way to quickly and cost-effectively obtain multiple antibody fragments for many antigens that can detect changes in their localization, level, and modification as well as subtle changes in supramolecular structures, which often associate with disease. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "The discovery of drugs is a lengthy, high-risk and expensive business taking at least 12 years and is estimated to cost upwards of US$800 million for each drug to be successfully approved for clinical use. Much of this cost is driven by the late phase clinical trials and therefore the ability to terminate early those projects destined to fail is paramount to prevent unwanted costs and wasted effort. Although neglected diseases drug discovery is driven more by unmet medical need rather than financial considerations, the need to minimise wasted money and resources is even more vital in this under-funded area. To ensure any drug discovery project is addressing the requirements of the patients and health care providers and delivering a benefit over existing therapies, the ideal attributes of a novel drug needs to be pre-defined by a set of criteria called a target product profile. Using a target product profile the drug discovery process, clinical study design, and compound characteristics can be defined all the way back through to the suitability or druggability of the intended biochemical target. Assessment and prioritisation of the most promising targets for entry into screening programmes is crucial for maximising chances of success.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Target driven drug discovery is a long and arduous task requiring a huge investment of time, energy and resources. Therefore, it is very important to select targets which provide the maximum chance of obtaining inhibitors that will be efficacious in animal models and finally in tuberculosis (TB) patients. Areas covered: The article discusses the necessity for new targets in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) drug discovery and how the functional redundancy of putative targets in Mtb adds a new dimension to the complexity of validation. The article also reviews survival kinetics using conditional knockout (KO) or knockdown (KD) strains and discusses how this has provided crucial information on target vulnerability. Furthermore, the article also comments on how the chemical validation of new targets using specific inhibitors has greatly supplemented the genetic validation efforts. Expert opinion: Because of complexity of pathogenesis of TB, the putative drug targets need to be validated under multiple physiological conditions. Target protein depletion can mimic chemical inhibition and, therefore, will be a valuable tool in predicting the vulnerability of a target. Conditional KO or KD makes it possible to study the phenotypes of Mtb strains under a variety of physiological states. The phenotype of these strains should also be tested in animal models which mimic human TB more closely. Finally, inhibitors with confirmed mode of action can be important tools for validating Mtb drug targets.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Based on in vitro and animal data, PI3K\u03b2 is given an important role in platelet adhesion and aggregation but its role in insulin signaling is unclear.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: To strengthen the PI3K\u03b2 target validation using the novel, short-acting inhibitor AZD6482.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: AZD6482 is a potent, selective and ATP competitive PI3K\u03b2 inhibitor (IC(50) 0.01 \u03bcm). A maximal anti-platelet effect was achieved at 1 \u03bcm in the in vitro and ex vivo tests both in dog and in man. In dog, in vivo AZD6482 produced a complete anti-thrombotic effect without an increased bleeding time or blood loss. AZD6482 was well tolerated in healthy volunteers during a 3-h infusion. The ex vivo anti-platelet effect and minimal bleeding time prolongation in the dog model translated well to data obtained in healthy volunteers. AZD6482 inhibited insulin-induced human adipocyte glucose uptake in vitro (IC(50) of 4.4 \u03bcm). In the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp model, in rats, glucose infusion rate was not affected at 2.3 \u03bcm but reduced by about 60% at a plasma exposure of 27 \u03bcm. In man, the homeostasis model analysis (HOMA) index increased by about 10-20% at the highest plasma concentration of 5.3 \u03bcm.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first human target validation for PI3K\u03b2 inhibition as anti-platelet therapy showing a mild and generalized antiplatelet effect attenuating but not completely inhibiting multiple signaling pathways with an impressive separation towards primary hemostasis. AZD6482 at 'supratherapeutic' plasma concentrations may attenuate insulin signaling, most likely through PI3K\u03b1 inhibition.",

        "abstract": "This study reports on the first characterization of the alternative NADH:dehydrogenase (also known as alternative complex I or type II NADH:dehydrogenase) of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, known as PfNDH2. PfNDH2 was shown to actively oxidize NADH in the presence of quinone electron acceptors CoQ1 and decylubiquinone with an apparent Km for NADH of approximately 17 and 5 ?M, respectively. The inhibitory profile of PfNDH2 revealed that the enzyme activity was insensitive to rotenone, consistent with recent genomic data indicating the absence of the canonical NADH:dehydrogenase enzyme. PfNDH2 activity was sensitive to diphenylene iodonium chloride and diphenyl iodonium chloride, known inhibitors of alterna- tive NADH:dehydrogenases. Spatiotemporal confocal imaging of parasite mitochondria revealed that loss of PfNDH2 function provoked a collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (?m ), leading to parasite death. As with other alternative NADH:dehydrogenases, PfNDH2 lacks transmembrane domains in its protein structure, and therefore, it is proposed that this enzyme is not directly involved in mitochondrial transmem- brane proton pumping. Rather, the enzyme provides reducing equivalents for downstream proton-pumping enzyme complexes. As inhibition of PfNDH2 leads to a depolarization of mitochondrial ?m , this enzyme is likely to be a critical component of the electron transport chain (ETC). This notion is further supported by proof-of-concept experiments revealing that targeting the ETC\u2019s Q-cycle by inhibition of both PfNDH2 and the bc1 complex is highly synergistic. The potential of targeting PfNDH2 as a chemotherapeutic strategy for drug development is discussed.",

Phosphorothioate modification of the ASO backbone has resulted in an increased stability of ASO in vivo without compromising, in general, their target selectivity. Although the power of antisense technology remains unsurpassed, dose-limiting side effects of modified ASO and inadequate penetration into the tumor tissue have necessitated further improvements in ASO chemistry and delivery systems. Oligonucleotide delivery systems may increase stability of the unmodified or minimally modified ASO in plasma, enhance uptake of ASO by tumor tissue, and offer an improved therapy response. Here, we provide an overview of ASO design and in vivo delivery systems, and focus on preclinical validation of a liposomal nanoparticle containing minimally modified raf antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (LErafAON). Intact rafAON (15-mer) is present in plasma and in normal and tumor tissues of athymic mice systemically treated with LErafAON. Raf-1 expression is decreased in normal and tumor tissues of LErafAON-treated mice. Therapeutic benefit of a combination of LErafAON and radiation or an anticancer drug exceeds radiation or drug alone against human prostate, breast, and pancreatic tumors grown in athymic mice. Further improvements in ASO chemistry and nanoparticles are promising avenues in antisense therapy of cancer.",

The capacity for brown adipose tissue (BAT) to protect against obesity and metabolic disease is recognized, yet information about which signals activate BA, besides \u03b23-adrenergic receptor stimulation, is limited. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we confirmed the presence of mRNAs encoding traditional BAT markers (i.e., UCP1, expressed in 100% of BAs Adrb3, expressed in <50% of BAs) in mouse and have shown single-cell variability (>1000-fold) in their expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. We further identified mRNAs encoding novel markers, orphan GPCRs, and many receptors that bind the classic neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, chemokines, cytokines, and hormones. The transcriptome variability between BAs suggests a much larger range of responsiveness of BAT than previously recognized and that not all BAs function identically. We examined the in vivo functional expression of 12 selected receptors by microinjecting agonists into live mouse BAT and analyzing the metabolic response. In this manner, we expanded the number of known receptors on BAs at least 25-fold, while showing that the expression of classic BA markers is more complex and variable than previously thought.-Spaethling, J.

Identification of the 'right' target(s) is now a critical part of the process because of the cost of drug discovery. Compounding this situation is the fact that the pharmaceutical industry faces a further challenge of being able to sustain current and historical growth rates. Hence, the discovery of new drug targets is important for developing new drug leads that can become preclinical drug candidates. Proteomics is the next phase of the effort whereby the human genome can be understood. However, mapping the human proteome presents a daunting challenge. Proteomics involves several essential components with the most significant being the discovery and description of all protein-protein interactions. Once this compendium is available, a secondary and equally important initiative will be to decipher proteins that are differentially expressed in any given disease condition. At this point, the critical focus will be to select the most relevant proteins, understand their partner interactions and then further winnow them to the point where they are relevant pharmaceutical target candidates. This paradigm can be compared to finding the relevant 'needle in the proteome haystack'. This review describes the use of genomic and protein-protein interaction technologies to identify and validate these 'needles' as the first step in the drug discovery process.",

        "abstract": "Mitotic kinesins are essential for faithful chromosome segregation and cell proliferation. Therefore, in humans, kinesin motor proteins have been identified as anti-cancer drug targets and small molecule inhibitors are now tested in clinical studies. Phylogenetic analyses have assigned five of the approximately fifty kinesin motor proteins coded by Trypanosoma brucei genome to the Kinesin-13 family. Kinesins of this family have unusual biochemical properties because they do not transport cargo along microtubules but are able to depolymerise microtubules at their ends, therefore contributing to the regulation of microtubule length. In other eukaryotic genomes sequenced to date, only between one and three Kinesin-13s are present. We have used immunolocalisation, RNAi-mediated protein depletion, biochemical in vitro assays and a mouse model of infection to study the single mitotic Kinesin-13 in T. brucei. Subcellular localisation of all five T. brucei Kinesin-13s revealed distinct distributions, indicating that the expansion of this kinesin family in kinetoplastids is accompanied by functional diversification. Only a single kinesin (TbKif13-1) has a nuclear localisation. Using active, recombinant TbKif13-1 in in vitro assays we experimentally confirm the depolymerising properties of this kinesin. We analyse the biological function of TbKif13-1 by RNAi-mediated protein depletion and show its central role in regulating spindle assembly during mitosis. Absence of the protein leads to abnormally long and bent mitotic spindles, causing chromosome mis-segregation and cell death. RNAi-depletion in a mouse model of infection completely prevents infection with the parasite. Given its essential role in mitosis, proliferation and survival of the parasite and the availability of a simple in vitro activity assay, TbKif13-1 has been identified as an excellent potential drug target.",

        "abstract": "Objectives of the study: Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an intracellular adaptor and kinase that links the cell adhesion receptors, integrins and growth factors to the actin cytoskeleton and is a component of multiple signaling pathways. Recent studies have demonstrated that ILK is highly expressed in various cancers, and that inhibition of ILK expression and activity may serve as an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. An important substrate of ILK is protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, which ILK phosphorylates at the S473 site, thereby contributing to its activation. The objective of our work is to develop a novel potent small molecule inhibitor of ILK. Methodology: Previously, we developed AR12 (formerly OSU-03012), a novel celecoxib-derived inhibitor of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) that downregulates PKB/Akt phosphorylation at T308 (known as the PDK1 site) and induces apoptosis and growth inhibition in cancer cells by blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway. However, to become fully activated, PKB/Akt requires both phosphorylation at two sites_T308/S473. Using OSU-03012 as a lead, we synthesized a series of derivatives to generate a small kinase inhibitor library, which was screened for compounds that could specifically downregulate PKB/Akt phosphorylation at S473, which is known as the PDK2 target site. The MTT assay was used to examine cancer cell viability after drug treatment. A radiometric ILK kinase assay was used to assess the ILK kinase inhibitory activities of the compounds. Cellular protein levels and phosphorylation status of ILK downstream targets were determined in drug-treated cells by western blot analysis. Results & Conclusions: The screening of our focused AR12-derived kinase inhibitor library identified T315 as an efficient inhibitor of PKB/Akt phosphorylation at S473 without altering phosphorylation at the T308 site. Moreover, T315 demonstrated strong cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and LNCaP cells; IC50, 2.0 and 1.8 M, respectively), but not primary nonmalignant prostate epithelial cells. To date, the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at its PDK2 site has been attributed to at least ten candidate kinases, including PKC/{beta}II, mTORC2, ILK, and ATM. After examination of several signaling pathways by western blotting, two downstream signaling effectors of ILK, GSK-3{beta} and MLC2, were shown to be downregulated by T315 in a dose-dependent manner, while downstream targets of mTORC2, another PDK2 candidate, were unchanged by T315 treatment. Importantly, T315 also dose-dependently inhibited ILK kinase activity (IC50 < 1 M) as determined by radiometric kinase assay. Together, these findings indicate that T315 is a putative ILK inhibitor.

        "abstract": "Systemic life-threatening fungal infections represent a significant unmet medical need. Cell-based, phenotypic screening can be an effective means of discovering potential novel antifungal compounds, but it does not address target identification, normally required for compound optimization by medicinal chemistry. Here, we demonstrate a combination of screening, genetic, and biochemical approaches to identify and characterize novel antifungal compounds. We isolated a set of novel non-azole antifungal compounds for which no target or mechanism of action is known, using a screen for inhibition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae proliferation. Haploinsufficiency profiling of these compounds in S. cerevisiae suggests that they target Erg11p, a cytochrome P450 family member, which is the target of azoles. Consistent with this, metabolic profiling in S. cerevisiae revealed a buildup of the metabolic intermediates prior to Erg11p activity, following compound treatment. Further, human cytochrome P450 is also inhibited in in vitro assays by these compounds. We modeled the Erg11p protein based on the human CYP51 crystal structure, and in silico docking of these compounds suggests that they interact with the heme center in a manner similar to that of azoles. Consistent with these docking observations, Candida strains carrying azole-resistant alleles of ERG11 are also resistant to the compounds in this study. Thus, we have identified non-azole Erg11p inhibitors, using a systematic approach for ligand and target characterization.",

        "abstract": "Studying the effects of pharmacological agents on human endothelium includes the routine use of cell monolayers cultivated in multi-well plates. This configuration fails to recapitulate the complex architecture of vascular networks in vivo and does not capture the relationship between shear stress (i.e. flow) experienced by the cells and dose of the applied pharmacological agents. Microfluidic platforms have been applied extensively to create vascular systems in vitro; however, they rely on bulky external hardware to operate, which hinders the wide application of microfluidic chips by non-microfluidic experts. Here, we have developed a standalone perfusion platform where multiple devices were perfused at a time with a single miniaturized peristaltic pump. Using the platform, multiple micro-vessel networks, that contained three levels of branching structures, were created by culturing endothelial cells within circular micro-channel networks mimicking the geometrical configuration of natural blood vessels. To demonstrate the feasibility of our platform for drug testing and validation assays, a drug induced nitric oxide assay was performed on the engineered micro-vessel network using a panel of vaso-active drugs (acetylcholine, phenylephrine, atorvastatin, and sildenafil), showing both flow and drug dose dependent responses. The interactive effects between flow and drug dose for sildenafil could not be captured by a simple straight rectangular channel coated with endothelial cells, but it was captured in a more physiological branching circular network. A monocyte adhesion assay was also demonstrated with and without stimulation by an inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1.",

Existing treatments have associated toxicities and hypersensitivity and do not eliminate encysted bradyzoites that recrudesce. New, improved medicines are needed. Transductive peptides carry small molecule cargos across multiple membranes to enter intracellular tachyzoites and encysted bradyzoites. They also carry cargos into retina when applied topically to eyes, and cross blood brain barrier when administered intravenously. Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) inhibit gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. Herein, effect of transductive peptide conjugated PMO (PPMO) on tachyzoite protein expression and replication in vitro and in vivo was studied. Initially, sequence-specific PPMO successfully reduced transfected T. gondii's fluorescence and luminescence. PPMO directed against T. gondii's dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme necessary for folate synthesis, limited tachyzoite replication. Rescue with exogenous folate demonstrated DHFR PPMO's specificity. PPMO directed against enoyl-ACP reductase (ENR), an enzyme of type II fatty acid synthesis that is structurally distinct in T. gondii from ENR in mammalian cells was investigated. PPMO directed against plant-like Apetela 2 (AP2) domain transcription factor XI-3 (AP2XI-3), not present in human cells, was characterized. ENR and AP2XI-3 PPMO each restricted intracellular parasite replication validating these molecular targets in tachyzoites. DHFR-specific PPMO administered to infected mice diminished parasite burden. Thus, these antisense oligomers are a versatile approach to validate T. gondii molecular targets, reduce essential T. gondii proteins in vitro and in vivo, and have potential for development as curative medicines.",

We investigated ATR, CHEK1 and phosphorylated CHEK1 Ser345 protein (pCHEK1) levels in 1712 breast cancers. ATR and CHEK1 mRNA expression was evaluated in 1950 breast cancers. Pre-clinically, biological consequences of ATR gene knock down or ATR inhibition by the small molecule inhibitor (VE-821) were investigated in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines and in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells (MCF10A). High ATR and high cytoplasmic pCHEK1 levels were significantly associated with higher tumour stage, higher mitotic index, pleomorphism and lymphovascular invasion. In univariate analyses, high ATR and high cytoplasmic pCHEK1 levels were associated with poor breast cancer specific survival (BCSS). In multivariate analysis, high ATR level remains an independent predictor of adverse outcome. At the mRNA level, high CHEK1 remains associated with aggressive phenotypes including lymph node positivity, high grade, Her-2 overexpression, triple negative, aggressive molecular phenotypes and adverse BCSS. Pre-clinically, CHEK1 phosphorylation at serine345 following replication stress was impaired in ATR knock down and in VE-821 treated breast cancer cells. Doxycycline inducible knockdown of ATR suppressed growth, which was restored when ATR was re-expressed. Similarly, VE-821 treatment resulted in a dose dependent suppression of cancer cell growth and survival (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) but was less toxic in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells (MCF10A).

T. brucei and T. cruzi G6PDHs, but not their Leishmania spp. counterpart, are inhibited, in an uncompetitive way, by steroids such as dehydroepiandrosterone and derivatives. The Trypanosoma enzymes are more susceptible to inhibition by these compounds than the human G6PDH.

In this chapter, we describe a method permitting the expression of shRNA from lentiviral vectors in primary murine myogenic cells. We designed shRNAs targeted to the muscular glycogen synthase isoform (shGYS1), a highly regulated enzyme responsible for glycogen synthesis, in order to modulate the muscle glycogen biosynthetic pathway and to improve the phenotype in primary myogenic cells from a murine model of glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII).

PAK-1 and Src kinases phosphorylate specific serine and tyrosine residues within the activation loop of Raf-1 kinase.

        "abstract": "During its intraerythrocytic phase, the most lethal human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, digests host cell hemoglobin as a source of some of the amino acids required for its own protein synthesis. A number of parasite endopeptidases (including plasmepsins and falcipains) process the globin into small peptides. These peptides appear to be further digested to free amino acids by aminopeptidases, enzymes that catalyze the sequential cleavage of N-terminal amino acids from peptides. Aminopeptidases are classified into different evolutionary families according to their sequence motifs and preferred substrates. The aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin can disrupt parasite development, suggesting that this group of enzymes might be a chemotherapeutic target. Two bestatin-susceptible aminopeptidase activities, associated with gene products belonging to the M1 and M17 families, have been described in blood-stage P. falciparum parasites, but it is not known whether one or both are required for parasite development. To establish whether inhibition of the M17 aminopeptidase is sufficient to confer antimalarial activity, we evaluated 35 aminoalkylphosphonate and phosphonopeptide compounds designed to be specific inhibitors of M17 aminopeptidases. The compounds had a range of activities against cultured P. falciparum parasites with 50% inhibitory concentrations down to 14 muM. Some of the compounds were also potent inhibitors of parasite aminopeptidase activity, though it appeared that many were capable of inhibiting the M1 as well as the M17 enzyme. There was a strong correlation between the potencies of the compounds against whole parasites and against the enzyme, suggesting that M17 and/or M1 aminopeptidases may be valid antimalarial drug targets.",

        "abstract": "To accomplish their life cycle, lentiviruses make use of host proteins, the so-called cellular cofactors. Interactions between host cell and viral proteins during early stages of lentiviral infection provide attractive new antiviral targets. The insertion of lentiviral cDNA in a host cell chromosome is a step of no return in the replication cycle, after which the host cell becomes a permanent carrier of the viral genome and a producer of lentiviral progeny. Integration is carried out by integrase (IN), an enzyme playing also an important role during nuclear import. Plenty of cellular cofactors of HIV-1 IN have been proposed. To date, the lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) is the best studied cofactor of HIV-1 IN. Moreover, small molecules that block the LEDGF/p75-IN interaction have recently been developed for the treatment of HIV infection. The nuclear import factor transportin-SR2 (TRN-SR2) has been proposed as another interactor of HIV IN-mediating nuclear import of the virus. Using both proteins as examples, we will describe approaches to be taken to identify and validate novel cofactors as new antiviral targets. Finally, we will highlight recent advances in the design and the development of small-molecule inhibitors binding to the LEDGF/p75-binding pocket in IN (LEDGINs).",

In contrast, the object location memory task, also a spatial learning paradigm, results in a less robust memory that decays quickly. We demonstrate for the first time how these two paradigms can be used together to assess hippocampal cognitive impairments before and after pharmacological or genetic manipulations in rodents. Rats were first segregated into superior learning and learning impaired groups using the object location memory task, and their performance was correlated with future outcome on this task and on the Morris water maze.

PfNDH2 was shown to actively oxidize NADH in the presence of quinone electron acceptors CoQ(1) and decylubiquinone with an apparent K(m) for NADH of approximately 17 and 5 muM, respectively. The inhibitory profile of PfNDH2 revealed that the enzyme activity was insensitive to rotenone, consistent with recent genomic data indicating the absence of the canonical NADH:dehydrogenase enzyme. PfNDH2 activity was sensitive to diphenylene iodonium chloride and diphenyl iodonium chloride, known inhibitors of alternative NADH:dehydrogenases. Spatiotemporal confocal imaging of parasite mitochondria revealed that loss of PfNDH2 function provoked a collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Psi(m)), leading to parasite death. As with other alternative NADH:dehydrogenases, PfNDH2 lacks transmembrane domains in its protein structure, and therefore, it is proposed that this enzyme is not directly involved in mitochondrial transmembrane proton pumping. Rather, the enzyme provides reducing equivalents for downstream proton-pumping enzyme complexes. As inhibition of PfNDH2 leads to a depolarization of mitochondrial Psi(m), this enzyme is likely to be a critical component of the electron transport chain (ETC). This notion is further supported by proof-of-concept experiments revealing that targeting the ETC's Q-cycle by inhibition of both PfNDH2 and the bc(1) complex is highly synergistic. The potential of targeting PfNDH2 as a chemotherapeutic strategy for drug development is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Genomic approaches are providing a wealth of information on differential gene expression in cancer. To identify the most interesting genes amongst the many identified, high-throughput methods for analysis of genes at the translational level are required. We have used a rapid method for the in vitro selection of antibodies to peptide antigens for the generation of probes to 5 gene products that we have found to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer. The rationale of our study was to select a non-immune phage displayed human antibody library on peptides designed from the coding regions of the gene sequences and to verify whether such antibodies would be suitable probes for the parental protein in immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis. After the generation of a profile of genes overexpressed in primary colorectal cancer (CRC) we selected 5 genes, Ese-3b, Fls353, PBEF, SPARC and Smad5 for a more detailed analysis using phage display-derived antibodies. For these 5 antigens we designed 14-20 amino acid peptides predicted to be exposed on the surface of the parental protein. Selection of a large phage displayed antibody library resulted in specific antibodies for 6 of 8 different peptides with between 2 and 15 different antibodies isolated per peptide. Of 20 antibodies tested, 2 antibodies recognized the putative parental protein from primary CRC tissue. An antibody specific for a PBEF-derived peptide (Fab/PBEF-D4) was shown to recognize a protein product of the expected molecular weight in Western blotting and showed overexpression in n = 6/8 matched tumor/normal protein lysates. Furthermore, in immunohistochemistry this antibody showed restricted staining of the tumor stromal compartment with no detectable staining of epithelial cells. The discovery that PBEF is overexpressed in cancer is unexpected given that the normal function of PBEF is as a cytokine required for the maturation of B cell precursors. We also report on the isolation of an antibody (Fab/SMAD-50) specific for a Smad5-derived peptide that showed cytoplasmic staining of epithelial cells in both CRC tumor and matched normal mucosa. Fab/SMAD-50 also bound to a group of proteins in Western blotting with molecular weights consistent with belonging to the Smad family. These antibodies may be suitable probes for further investigation of the roles of PBEF and Smad5 in cancer. The amenability of phage display to automation suggests that this approach may be developed for implementation on a genomics scale. Indeed, the large-scale generation of antibody probes that can be used to study protein expression in situ would be of great value in target validation for functional genomics.",

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

        "abstract": "As the field of proteomics expands, the need for functional annotation of the proteome increases to allow the rational choice of particular targets from amongst a bewildering and increasing set of candidates. Similarly, the description of the interactome will continue to generate a plethora of candidate interactions that will need to be validated in functional assays. Although knockout mice and RNAi knockdowns have proven to be invaluable as primary tools in functional genomics, it should be remembered that these techniques apply at the gene and transcript level respectively and are, therefore, not always suitable for true functional proteomics investigations. Protein levels do not always correlate with RNA levels, particularly where active protein levels are regulated by protein stability or post-translational modifications. Moreover, off-target regulation of genes by RNAi/siRNA can complicate the validation of targets using this approach. In recent years, a myriad of potential protein targets including complexes has been emerging from high-throughput proteomics. Thus, the dilemma facing many investigators is having too many potential targets and too few means of validating them. Therefore, there is an unmet need for the development of technologies which allow the targeted disruption of particular proteins. Intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) and peptide aptamers are beginning to be applied in this area. A new class of peptide, known as Phylomers(\u00ae), also has significant potential in the area of disruption of protein-protein interactions. Phylomers, which are derived from protein subdomains, are small enough to synthesise and are of a suitable size for delivery to tissues and even into cells, making them an ideal candidates for a next-generation tool for functional validation of the proteome.",

To assess the feasibility of using a biopsy specimen for a personalized selection of an imaging agent, the chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) was used as a reference biomarker.\\n\\nMETHODS: A hybrid CXCR4 targeting peptide (MSAP-Ac-TZ14011) containing a fluorescent dye and a chelate for radioactive labeling was used to directly compare initial flow cytometry-based target validation in fresh tumor tissue to in vivo single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging.\\n\\nRESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis of mouse tumor derived cell suspensions enabled discrimination between 4T1 control tumor lesions (with low levels of CXCR4 expression) and CXCR4 positive early, intermediate and late stage MIN-O lesions based on their CXCR4 expression levels; CXCR4(basal), CXCR4(+) and CXCR4(++) cell populations could be accurately discriminated. Mean fluorescent intensity ratios between expression in MIN-O and 4T1 tissue found with flow cytometry were comparable to ratios obtained with in vivo SPECT/CT and fluorescence imaging, ex vivo fluorescence evaluation and standard immunohistochemistry.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The hybrid nature of a targeting imaging agent like MSAP-Ac-TZ14011 enables integration of target selection, in vivo imaging and ex vivo validation using a single agent.

An intensive research effort over the past decade has led to the discovery of chemically distinct families of small molecule Aurora kinase inhibitors, many of which have demonstrated therapeutic potential in model systems. These agents are also important tools to help dissect signaling pathways that are orchestrated by Aurora kinases, and the antiproliferative target of pan-Aurora inhibitors such as VX-680 has been validated using chemical genetic techniques. In many cases the nonspecific nature of Aurora inhibitors toward unrelated kinases is well established, potentially broadening the spectrum of cancers to which these compounds might be applied. However, unambiguously demonstrating the molecular target(s) for clinical kinase inhibitors is an important challenge, one that is absolutely critical for deciphering the molecular basis of compound specificity, resistance, and efficacy. In this paper, we have investigated amino acid requirements for Aurora A sensitivity to the benzazepine-based Aurora inhibitor MLN8054 and the close analogue MLN8237, a second-generation compound that is in phase II clinical trials. A crystallographic analysis facilitated the design and biochemical investigation of a panel of resistant Aurora A mutants, a subset of which were then selected as candidate drug-resistance targets for further evaluation. Using inducible human cell lines, we show that cells expressing near-physiological levels of a functional but partially drug-resistant Aurora A T217D mutant survive in the presence of MLN8054 or MLN8237, authenticating Aurora A as a critical antiproliferative target of these compounds.",

        "abstract": "Several approaches have been developed over the past decade to study the complex interactions that occur in biological system. The ability to carry out a comprehensive genetic analysis of an organism becomes more limited and difficult as the complexity of the organism increases because complex organisms are likely to have not only more genes than simple organisms but also more elaborate networks of interactions among those genes. The development of technologies to systematically disrupt protein networks at the genomic scale would greatly accelerate the comprehensive understanding of the cell as molecular machinery. Intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) can be targeted to different intracellular compartments to specifically interfere with function of selected intracellular gene products in mammalian cells. This technique should prove important for studies of mammalian cells, where genetic approaches are more difficult. In the context of large-scale protein interaction mapping projects, intracellular antibodies (ICAbs) promise to be an important tool to knocking out protein function inside the cell. In this context, however, the need for speed and high throughput requires the development of simple and robust methods to derive antibodies which function within cells, without the need for optimization of each individual ICAb. The successful inhibition of biological processes by intrabodies has been demonstrated in a number of different cells. The performance of antibodies that are intracellularly expressed is, however, somewhat unpredictable, because the reducing environment of the cell cytoplasm in which they are forced to work prevents some antibodies, but not others, to fold properly. For this reason, we have developed an in vivo selection procedure named Intracellular Antibody Capture Technology (IACT) that allows the isolation of functional intrabodies. The IAC technology has been used for the rapid identification of antigen-antibody pairs in intracellular compartments and for the in vivo identification of epitopes recognized by the selected intracellular antibodies. Several optimizations of the IAC technology for protein knock-out have been developed so far. This system offers a powerful and versatile proteomic tool to dissect diverse functional properties of cellular proteins in different cell lines. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "This article describes recent advances in the development and biological evaluation of small molecule inhibitors for the serine/threonine kinase Akt (PKB). Akt plays a pivotal role in cell survival and proliferation through a number of downstream effectors. Recent studies indicate that unregulated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is a prominent feature of many human cancers and Akt is over-expressed or activated in all major cancers. Akt is considered an attractive target for chemotherapy and it has been postulated that inhibition of Akt alone or in combination with standard cancer chemotherapeutics will reduce the apoptotic threshold and preferentially kill cancer cells. The development of specific and potent inhibitors will allow this hypothesis to be tested in animals. The majority of small molecule inhibitors in this nascent field are classic ATP-competitive inhibitors which provide little specificity. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) analogs have been reported to inhibit Akt, but these inhibitors may also have specificity problems with respect to other PH domain containing proteins and may have poor bioavailability. None of the inhibitors in these classes have been reported to have Akt isozyme specificity. Recently, novel allosteric inhibitors have been reported which are pleckstrin homology domain dependent and exhibit Akt isozyme selectivity. Inhibitors in this class may have sufficient potency and specificity to test for tumor efficacy in animal models and recently reported preliminary experiments are reviewed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is overwhelming evidence that in vitro three-dimensional tumor cell cultures more accurately reflect the complex in vivo microenvironment than simple two-dimensional cell monolayers, not least with respect to gene expression profiles, signaling pathway activity and drug sensitivity. However, most currently available three-dimensional techniques are time consuming and/or lack reproducibility; thus standardized and rapid protocols are urgently needed.\\n\\nRESULTS: To address this requirement, we have developed a versatile toolkit of reproducible three-dimensional tumor spheroid models for dynamic, automated, quantitative imaging and analysis that are compatible with routine high-throughput preclinical studies. Not only do these microplate methods measure three-dimensional tumor growth, but they have also been significantly enhanced to facilitate a range of functional assays exemplifying additional key hallmarks of cancer, namely cell motility and matrix invasion. Moreover, mutual tissue invasion and angiogenesis is accommodated by coculturing tumor spheroids with murine embryoid bodies within which angiogenic differentiation occurs. Highly malignant human tumor cells were selected to exemplify therapeutic effects of three specific molecularly-targeted agents: PI-103 (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor), 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor) and CCT130234 (in-house phospholipase C (PLC)\u03b3 inhibitor). Fully automated analysis using a Celigo cytometer was validated for tumor spheroid growth and invasion against standard image analysis techniques, with excellent reproducibility and significantly increased throughput. In addition, we discovered key differential sensitivities to targeted agents between two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures, and also demonstrated enhanced potency of some agents against cell migration/invasion compared with proliferation, suggesting their preferential utility in metastatic disease.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We have established and validated a suite of highly reproducible tumor microplate three-dimensional functional assays to enhance the biological relevance of early preclinical cancer studies. We believe these assays will increase the translational predictive value of in vitro drug evaluation studies and reduce the need for in vivo studies by more effective triaging of compounds.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Novel personalized therapeutic approaches are urgently needed for patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Methods and materials: We combined the development of a primary patient-derived ccRCC cell line with a phenotypic drug screen consisting of 101 approved anticancer compounds. Results: We identified the MNNG HOS transforming gene (MET)-anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) inhibitor crizotinib as the top hit of our drug screen, whereas compounds targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway showed no or only minor in vitro activity. Among the known major crizotinib targets MET, ALK, and ROS-1, only MET was expressed in our ccRCC cell line. Subsequent sequence analysis revealed a heterozygous R988C mutation of the MET gene and a VHL deletion in both the primary tumor and the tumor-derived ccRCC cell line. However, we were unable to show an activation of MET and, further, MET knockdown did not result in increased apoptosis or cytotoxicity. Therefore, our results suggest that MET R988C does not function as a major oncogenic driver mutation but rather represents a sequence variant. However, we provide evidence that the cytotoxic effect of crizotinib in our cell line model correlates with its ability to inhibit P-glycoprotein (ABCB1)-associated transport functions. Conclusions: Our study shows that a phenotypic screen of a patient-derived tumor cell line can identify compounds with antitumor activity but with an unexpected mode of action. Our results underscore that target validation and phenotype-genotype correlations remain a major experimental challenge. The implications of our findings for a personalized management of patients with cancer are discussed. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance and has complex pharmacological actions in brain. In this study, we employed a novel drug target validation strategy to uncover the multiple molecular targets of caffeine using combined A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) knockouts (KO) and microarray profiling. Caffeine (10 mg/kg) elicited a distinct profile of striatal gene expression in WT mice compared with that by A(2A)R gene deletion or by administering caffeine into A(2A)R KO mice. Thus, A(2A)Rs are required but not sufficient to elicit the striatal gene expression by caffeine (10 mg/kg). Caffeine (50 mg/kg) induced complex expression patterns with three distinct sets of striatal genes: 1) one subset overlapped with those elicited by genetic deletion of A(2A)Rs; 2) the second subset elicited by caffeine in WT as well as A(2A)R KO mice; and 3) the third subset elicited by caffeine only in A(2A)R KO mice. Furthermore, striatal gene sets elicited by the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor rolipram and the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicucullin, overlapped with the distinct subsets of striatal genes elicited by caffeine (50 mg/kg) administered to A(2A)R KO mice. Finally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis reveals that adipocyte differentiation/insulin signaling is highly enriched in the striatal gene sets elicited by both low and high doses of caffeine. The identification of these distinct striatal gene populations and their corresponding multiple molecular targets, including A(2A)R, non-A(2A)R (possibly A(1)Rs and pathways associated with PDE and GABA(A)R) and their interactions, and the cellular pathways affected by low and high doses of caffeine, provides molecular insights into the acute pharmacological effects of caffeine in the brain.",

        "abstract": "The membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinase-regulator RECK is often downregulated in various types of cancers; the levels of residual RECK in resected tumors often correlate with better prognosis. Forced expression of RECK in cancer cells suppresses tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis in xenograft models. RECK is therefore a promising marker for benignancy and a potential effector in cancer therapy. We established a cell line containing two transgene systems: (1) the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene fused to Reck promoter and (2) the HRAS(12V) oncogene driven by the Tet-off promoter system. This cell line exhibits transformed phenotype in regular medium and flat morphology with increased SEAP activity in the presence of doxycycline, allowing the assessment of RECK-inducing activity of chemicals in the contexts of both transformed and untransformed cells. Our pilot experiments with 880 known bioactive compounds detected 34 compounds that activate RECK promoter; among these, 10 were authentic anticancer drugs. Four selected compounds up-regulated endogenous RECK protein in several human cancer cell lines. The top-ranking compound, disulfiram, strongly suppressed spontaneous lung-metastasis of human fibrosarcoma cells in nude mice. Our data demonstrate the value of this screen in discovering effective cancer therapeutics.",

Although the same RGS4 N terminus domain was present in chimeras generated, the GTPase accelerating protein (GAP) function observed was not similar, suggesting differences in the RGS domain function. In conclusion, the use of RGS4 N terminus chimeric constructs enabled us to develop a selectivity assay for different RGS proteins. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The present study aims to analyse wordplay translation on the basis of the three aspects mentioned in the title \u2014 wordplay typology, translation techniques and relevant factors. The theoretical framework is eclectic but draws particularly on Delabastita (1996, 1997) and Llad\u00f3 (2002). Empirical analysis is based on three English source texts and six Catalan translations, and focuses on two main issues: the frequency distribution of pairs of ST + TT segments across translation techniques, and the possible correlation(s) between translation techniques and factors influencing decision-making. It is observed that translators tend to use techniques implying a negative punning balance, i.e. resulting in some degree of loss of punning activity. Moreover, some factors identified in the literature are seen to correlate with the use of particular translation techniques. Finally, in the last section an attempt is made to go beyond description and explanation and to assess wordplay translation techniques in terms of their suitability as translation solutions.",

Tis proposition is particularly evident in the case of classics: when translators have to work on literary creations occupying a pivotal position in the source/target cultures, they adopt strategies of literalness and ennoblement which betray a quasi-religious awe \u2014 on the one hand, a desire to ruffle the surface of the re- vered original as little as possible; and on the other, a determination to reproduce the supposed \u2018classical qualities\u2019 of the classic even when they are not present in the source. In the following article, I examine how the \u2018idea of classic\u2019 influences translation theory and practice, substantiating my theoretical observations by looking at Italian translations of English classics. A marked \u2014 and historically determined \u2014 disparity between source and target readerships, and the transla- tors\u2019 reverence for their prestigious originals, conspire to produce Italian versions which are much more \u2018wooden\u2019 and \u2018elegant\u2019 than their English counterparts.",

Microarrays have been well utilized in genomics/proteomics approaches for gene/protein expression profiling and tissue/cell-scale target validation. Besides being used as an essential step in analyzing high-throughput experiments such as those involving microarrays, bioinformatics can also contribute to the processes of target identification and validation by providing functional information about target candidates and positioning information to biological networks. Antisense technologies (including RNA interference technology, which is recently very 'hot') enable sequence-based gene knockdown at the RNA level. Zinc finger proteins are a DNA transcription-targeting version of knockdown. Chemical genomics and proteomics are emerging tools for generating phenotype changes, thus leading to target and hit identifications. NMR-based screening, as well as activity-based protein profiling, are trying to meet the requirement of high-throughput target identification.",

        "abstract": "This paper argues that the question of theoretical translatability is crucial both to source-oriented & target-oriented approaches. Reflecting on translatability requires a discussion of Toury's notion of \"adequate translation,\" which has two senses: the general or ideal approximation to source-text norms, & the tertium comparationis represented by a source-text-oriented translation (ie, showing how the original can be translated). It is argued that both senses have heuristic value in Translation Studies. The explanatory power of target-orientedness is demonstrated by discussing the various strategies pursued by seven Anglo-American translators of Dante who either recreate or avoid rewriting grotesque onomastic wordplay in Inferno. Zero-translation policy of Dante's names is not considered to be evidence of their inherent \"untranslatability\" since, for an empiricist, nothing is untranslatable. Evocative names may be translated in a creative way provided the rewriter is willing (or allowed) to be innovative. 47 References. Adapted from the source document",

Three philosophical issues are found relevant to the proposed resolution: collective intentionality, the division of intellectual labor in a society, & the historical development of institutional facts. From this it follows that translations are institutional facts of target cultures, which accept or reject them as such; texts identified as translations by experts who perform translation within the target culture are accepted as translations by members of the culture, whereas absorption of the institutional fact of translation into the background of a culture leads to nonidentification of such texts as translations. 20 References.

Our results indicate that while source and target languages do not globally influence explicitation, specific connectives have a significant impact on this phenomenon. We also show that in English and French, the most frequently used connectives for explicitation share a similar semantic profile. Finally, we demonstrate that explicitation also varies across different discourse relations, even when they are conveyed by a single connective.",

However, different patterns of behaviour can be observed, depending on the hegemonic relations between source and target cultures. In the West, martial arts fiction in English translation is being relegated to an extremely peripheral position. But martial arts fiction is able to make inroads into Asian countries, to the extent of stimulating a new literary form or (re)writing martial arts fiction in some indigenous languages.",

        "abstract": "Poems have often been turned into songs, notably as German Lieder. Classical singers use translations of these in several different ways: as cribs for themselves, in printed programmes for their audiences, as singable versions, etc. Since no single target-text is ideal for all of these purposes, the Skopostheorie of Hans J. Vermeer may help translators to match their strategy with the particular skopos (\"goal or purpose\") of their translation. The author identifies five specific functions which a song-translation may serve, and proposes a range of five translation strategies intended to match these particular skopoi. A demonstration is given of how these strategies produce different English versions of a few lines from a Baudelaire poem.",

        "abstract": "The transfer of sound from one language into another is not a uniform process, but rather, takes different forms depending on the orthographies and phonological properties of source and target languages, the less common of which involve processes significantly different from transliteration between European phonetic scripts. This paper pools techniques commonly used in loanword phonology and second language acquisition to illustrate complications that arise when translating names from English into languages such as Japanese and Chinese, which differ significantly from the source language in syllable structure and orthographic convention. Competing strategies of adaptation and accommodation are placed in the context of lexical retrieval and compared with experimental studies of nativization in interlanguage. It will be shown that for names to be perceived as similar-sounding across language boundaries, it would be desirable to look beyond segmental equivalence and consider stress, syllable count and other suprasegmental factors that play a greater role in phonological memory.",

The framework that I adopt is that of cognitive grammar, and my claim is that all of the above arise from the existence of asymmetries in the cognitive organization of semantic information. I also propose that the converse case is true: cases involving a lack of conspicuous cognitive asymmetries will demonstrate the opposite effect in translated text. In closing, I place the argument in a larger perspective by adopting Croft's (1990) scalar notion of generalization in a discussion of explanation in translation studies.",

        "abstract": "The present descriptive study considers different translation strategies adopted by Italian translators of Oscar Wilde's The importance of being Earnest (1895). The focus of attention is on the phenomenon of the pun involving the speaking name Ernest, whose homophony with earnest is exploited in the play's title. Italian translators of The importance have thus been faced with the bind of having to decide on whether to render the said wordplay, even though only unsatisfactorily, by replacing the transparent name Ernest with a target language 'equivalent', or safeguard the cultural-onomastic 'reality' of the play, i.e. leave the Victorian given name Ernest in its source text form. It turns out that the latter policy is generally compensated for - as part of the metatextual/metalinguistic discourse - within prefaces, glosses &, more significantly, via intratextual additions. The translators opting for replacing Ernest with an Italian counterpart, in turn, have, as a direct consequence of their basic choice, been able to enrich their versions of The importance with unprecedented puns, which underlines the 'creative' dimension involved in producing literary translations. Besides the two core translation policies described above, the translators have also opted for introducing the nativized form Ernesto, thus showing little concern with the questions of 'cultural purity' or punning, respectively. The present paper suggests that translators make very different demands on themselves & have very different ideas of what constitutes the 'optimal' strategy with regard to punning & the representation of the source cultural world.

From a theoretical point of view the study is based on our model of the nature, the function and the acquisition of subjective theories of translation. The analysis of metaphors is based on conceptual metaphor theory and on empirical research on metaphor in applied linguistics. Both the model and the research method have proved to be useful for the investigation of implicit theories about translation. ",

        "abstract": "Currently, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) has drawn great attention for being part of the ubiquitous network. Unlike the conventional network, MANETs have many unique features such as node resource constraint. That is why several efficient routing protocols have been proposed specifically for MANETs. Among these protocols, optimized link state routing (OLSR) is one of the four important routing protocol identified by IETF. The current OLSR protocol assumes that all nodes are trusted. However, in hostile environment, the OLSR is known to be vulnerable to various kinds of malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a new security aware optimized link state routing (SA-OLSR) which is a secured version of current OLSR. Our approach is based on exchanging acknowledgement between 2-hop neighbors when the control traffic is successfully received. The main advantage of our approach is that it can protect against many sophisticated attacks such as link spoofing, colluding misrelay attack, and wormhole attack without requiring any location information as well as the knowledge of complete network topology. Our simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve higher packet delivery ratio compared to the network using the standard OLSR in the presence of malicious nodes.",

Both versions were translated by Rivka Meshulach, with approximately 25 years between them. In the first version word order conforms to the norms of Classical Hebrew. In the second version, however, the translator changed word order so that the language would be closer to contemporary spoken Hebrew. This is illustrated through examples related to various syntactic constituents, including subject-predicate, predicate complements, parentheme and address forms. The reasoning behind this tendency focuses on the change in the norms of written language. As opposed to the normative restrictions which were widely accepted in written Hebrew just a generation ago, the current trend is for features of contemporary spoken language to be used in literature and theater.",

A new linguistic approach can produce such a practical account, provided that the pragmatic level of analysis is given a prominent role and that a touch of non-scientific skepticism is maintained.",

Industrial standards like the ISO family provide the basis of many such systems; however, for several reasons, such process-based standards are regarded by many as inappropriate for translation businesses. One common factor considered in this article is their failure to emphasise the role of people both in the definition of the processes & in their implementation. The present article proposes a new model for translation businesses, accepting the importance of people in the translation industry & recognising that process-driven quality systems may be inadequate in maintaining consistent levels of quality. The model is based on identifying the capabilities that incorporate the processes of an organisation & the behaviours embodied in the people involved in these processes.

        "abstract": "The tension between domesticating and foreignising translation strategies is particularly strongly felt in the translation of children's literature, and has been a key issue in many studies of such literature. However, despite the pervasiveness of the concepts, there is little existing empirical research investigating how child (and adult) readers of translated children's books process and respond to foreignised elements in translation. This means that scholars' arguments in favour of either domestication or foreignisation in the translation of children's literature are often based on intuition and personal experience, with no substantial empirical basis. This article presents the findings of an experiment undertaken to investigate Afrikaans child and adult readers' processing of and responses to potentially linguistically and culturally foreign textual elements in translated children's picturebooks, against the background of postcolonial/neocolonial cultural and linguistic hybridity in South Africa. The paper reports the results relating to two of the research questions informing the study: 1. Does the use of foreignised elements in translated children's picturebooks have any significant effect on the cognitive effort involved in reading for child and adult readers? 2. Is the comprehension of child and adult readers affected by the use of foreignised elements in translated children's picturebooks? A reading study utilising eye-tracking was conducted, involving both child and adult participants reading manipulated domesticated and foreignised versions of pages from two picturebooks translated from English to Afrikaans. To answer research question (1), data obtained by means of eye-tracking were analysed for dwell time, fixation count, first fixation duration and glances count for areas of interest (AOIs) reflecting domesticating or foreignising translation strategies. In order to answer question (2), short structured questionnaires or interviews with participants were used, focusing on the degree of comprehension of the two texts. Overall, the findings of the experiment demonstrate that while there are perceptible effects on processing and comprehension associated with the use of foreignising strategies, these effects are not straightforward or uniform, with notable differences not only for different AOIs, but also for child and adult readers. \u00a9 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",

The translations, by Hans-Christian Oeser and Renate Orth-Gutt- mann, were both published in 1998. The study isolates the linguistic feature of modal particles in which the individual styles of the translators manifest them- selves on the textual level and investigates the influence the translators\u2019 microlev- el linguistic choices have on the macrolevel of the novel. An electronic corpus was compiled, comprising The Beautiful and Damned and its two translations, both entitled Die Scho\u0308nen und Verdammten. A quantitative analysis was carried out to discover potential patterns of the use of modal particles by the transla- tors, and the results showed that while both translators use modal particles to the extent and in the general context one would expect, they differ considerably in their choice and use of individual modal particles. The subsequent qualitative analysis takes a pragmatic approach, and discusses the selected modal particle wohl according to its communicative function, its role in speech and thought acts and in the narrative, and in the context of the respective narrative points of view. Finally it is argued that the two translators differ in their translation styles to an extent that affects the novel\u2019s macrolevel in that one translator provides a character study while the other focuses on societal issues.",

        "abstract": "This special issue combines the topics of voice and retranslation. The underlying rationale is that the study of voice can enhance our understanding of retranslation, and vice versa. Although scattered studies have appeared over the last twenty years, neither of these topics has been properly theorized in Translation Studies. Remarkably, the two have seldom been explicitly combined. This is curious since both diachronically and synchronically produced retranslations are a particularly fertile ground for the study of voice. The web of voices that are present in retranslations is quite complex. A retranslation may bear witness not only to a relation to the source text(s) and paratext(s), but also to previous translations and their paratexts. A retranslation is a text in which the voices of a multiplicity of agents may surface, but these other voices are always moulded by its retranslator. In order to contextualize the joint study of voice and retranslation, this introduction provides an overview of both areas and then introduces the articles of this special issue.",

Baker\u2019s strategies for word equivalence (1992) will be used to establish whether the use of negative terms such as \u2018marica\u2019 and \u2018maric\u00f3n\u2019 aptly replace the source language term, \u2018gay\u2019.

In the study four major sources of explanation are proposed: individual situations (the context of production of a particular translation and different translators' attitudes); textuality (the conditions governing textuality implied in translation); translators' norms; and intersecting fields (academic translation is envisaged as being situated at the intersection of three fields: academia, publishing, and professional translation). The paper makes a case for multiple causality in translation, and also considers the issue of relations between the different sources of explanation.",

Additionally, we want to examine whether the use of standard vs. non-standard language can be attributed to the variables text type and source language. In order to achieve that goal, we gath- ered a diverse set of linguistic variables and used a 10-million-word corpus that is parallel, comparable and bidirectional (the Dutch Parallel Corpus; Macken et al. 2011). Te frequency counts for each of the variables are used to determine the differences in standard language use by means of profile-based correspon- dence analysis (Plevoets 2008). Te results of our analysis show that (i) in gen- eral, there is indeed a standardizing trend among translations and (ii) text types with a lot of editorial control (fiction, non-fiction and journalistic texts) contain more standard language than the less edited text types (administrative texts and external communication) which adds support for the idea that the differences between translated and non-translated texts are text type dependent.",

        "abstract": "This dissertation is a comparative investigation of the work of two subtitlers of Swedish films translated into French in the last decade of 20th century. It is a look at how they try to render the illusion of spoken language in the written line that is a subtitle. This effect has to be created despite the constraints of time, synchronisation, readability, and the limited number of characters available to work with.We have shown that the subtitles examined in this work include many of the characteristics typical of spoken French. These characteristics can be classified as belonging to the Phonetic, the Lexical or the Syntactic level. At the lexical level we can see that the translators use expressions with a lower style-level than the originals but manage to avoid being too shocking, innovative or destabilizing for the audience. We have also shown diastratic language differences in translation: our subtitlers strengthen characters of social differences by using a different language style depending on the status that the person in question has.Because of the polysemiotic nature of film it is not the primary purpose of a subtitler to translate everything. Typically verbal speech characteristics such as repetition, hesitation, incomplete phrases and non-informational expressions that are often seen as less acceptable in the written word are normally sacrificed in subtitles.On the other hand, we could not show that the original language (Swedish) had a sizable impact on the style and construction of the subtitles.We also looked at possible stylistic differences between the two subtitlers translations and tried to find out if the \u201cvoice\u201d of the subtitler shone through. If so, we were interested in attempting to see if a difference could be caused by the fact that one of the subtitlers has French as her native language while the other translates from his second language. We were not able to relate the cause of the difference of style we observed to anything other than the original dialogue\u2019s changing style-levels.In which direction the verbal content in subtitles will develop is an interesting and relevant question. In this work we have identified a development of style that has taken place during recent years in French subtitles to Swedish films. This development goes from a previous situation where the style of the spoken word was practically unused compared to today\u2019s more frequent and systematic use.",

A similar desire for univocal terms can also be detected in the claims for the need of one, universally accepted term for the same phenomenon where various competing terms already exist and are in use. Although some linguists have already expressed their doubts in the justification of some of the fundamental linguistic concepts, as Rajogopalan has observed, a lot of them are still happy working with such discreet entities thus making linguistics perhaps the most \u201c19th century\u201d of the academic disciplines taught in universities today. Unfortunately, this could also be stated for some currents in Translation Studies, despite the fact that translation research can and should provide the most suitable field where such axiomatic truths are challenged. The article questions this desire for the univocal and argues that it is high time we all learn to live with more fuzzy definitions.",

The findings are based on a stylistic comparison of the Finnish, French and Russian subtitled versions of 8 Mile, a film that tells about Eminem's early breakthrough as a rap artist (UIP, 2002). The rap sections of the film present many 'text-specific translation problems' (Nord), which become even more troublesome in the context of subtitling, as the translator has space for less text. The worldwide subtitling and dubbing of 8 Mile was an especially well-supervised procedure. The translators were given a lot of material support (e.g., a detailed 'dialogue list') but their work was also strictly controlled and limited. According to this study, the severe policy of some local UIP offices may have hindered the quality of subtitling in some countries.",

The problem with this approach is that it does not allow the researcher to draw conclusions about the actual organisation of the cognitive processes and its effects on text quality. In writing research, functional dependency of cognitive processes -- the fact that the context, function and effect of different cognitive processes vary according to the moment in the process on which they occur -- was demonstrated by Rijlaarsdam and Van den Bergh (1996). In the present paper the idea is developed that in translation process research, the inclusion of time as a variable may prove to be useful in improving understanding of the effect of process characteristics on process outcome. A dynamic approach, in which a translation process is viewed and analysed as belonging to a changing task situation, is proposed.",

A sample of 1013 menu items from the Tarragona area suggests that there are differences in function between the menus translated in the 1970s/1980s and those translated in the 1990s. A possible reason for these differences is that all the menus from the 1970s/80s were translated by professional translators, and those from the 1990s, by non-professional translators. The study also suggests that the books on menu translations published by the Catalan government in 1991 did not seem to reach the restaurant owners and that official translation policy in this area has thus had little effect.",

Translation, as a mode of cross-cultural communication, is held to share those same features, as well as at least two specific representational maxims concerning discursive persons and textual quantity. It is argued that the related concepts of complexity, success conditions and risk can describe not only the act of translating as a mode of cross-cultural communication, but also certain features of the professional intercultures to which translators belong. Step-by-step propositions thus synthesize an approach that runs from an analysis of cross-cultural communication to a description of professional intercultures, their sources of power, and the reasons for their apparent lack of power in a globalizing age.",

        "abstract": "This is a study of a \u201cconcealed translation\u201d of Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula in Turkish. Ali Riza Seyfi, who was known as an author and translator of historical fiction and books on Turkish history, produced a version of the novel under the title Kazikli Voyvoda, which was published in 1928 and reprinted in 1946. Kazikli Voyvoda combines the original gothic aspects with a Turkish nationalist discourse, exemplifying the kind of role translation can assume in the making of national identities. The article traces the matricial norms employed by Seyfi to reveal those of his additions to Dracula that resulted in a highly nationalist text. It is further pointed out that Kazikli Voyvoda stands in a specific relationship with the notions of \u201cnational\u201d and \u201cnationalist\u201d literature, which were rather topical around the time the text was published.",

Analysis of the translation of fictional dialogues from a contemporary English novel reveals considerable diversity in the choice of Spanish verbs used to render 'said' in the context of impositive directive speech acts. While the choice of a speech act with similar illocutionary force to \"said\" may fulfil only stylistic objectives, a pragmatic dimension is introduced by the selection of a speech-act verb with a different force. In the context of impositive directive speech acts such a choice may be viewed as an aspect of \"pragmastylistics\", defined in Hickey et al. (1993) as \"the area where pragmatic and stylistic considerations converge.\"",

Thus, it makes use of theories related to such a type of dynamics (chaos theory and complexity science). This concern develops on two levels: firstly, the article argues that the abandonment of the traditional conception of translation and the raising of the current one actually agree with the evolution perceived in a great number of domains, such an evolution pointing to the rejection of deterministic positions. Secondly, it also defends the view that the translation process is entirely typical of the processes of nonlinear dynamics. Accordingly, key notions from nonlinear dynamics (such as sensitivity to initial conditions, phase transition, attractor or edge of chaos) are shown to apply to the nature of translation.",

While such a statement undoubtedly is a stand against national &#8212; or, in many instances, nationalistic &#8212; language cultures, it also raises a series of questions which can be discussed within a re-formulation of EST&#8217;s aims and scope: Which &#8216;Europe&#8217; is meant here? What sort of translation concept underpins this statement? In which way do migration movements shape today&#8217;s translation landscapes? What are the control mechanisms behind the phenomenon of translation understood in Eco&#8217;s sense? This paper discusses the limits of Europeanness and its potentially transgressive nature against the backdrop of EST&#8217;s founding moment in Vienna and the city&#8217;s central shaping force in pluricultural issues in the Habsburg Monarchy. It argues that translation has the task of breaking the deadlock of identitarian differences and the political practices based on them.

Results show that the tool exhibits good inter-rater reliability for all language groups and texts except Russian and suggest that the low reliability of the Russian raters' scores is unrelated to the tool itself.

        "abstract": "Analysis of 217 associations for translators and/or interpreters shows that, after the heroic age of the generalist national and international groupings in the 1950s and 1960s, there has been a progressive specialization of associations. In rough chronological order, separate institutions have been created for literary translators, sworn/authorized translators and interpreters, conference interpreters, public-service interpreters and audiovisual translators. This process might be seen as a division of labor, a normal result of increasing memberships. Analysis of the communication strategies employed by the associations nevertheless suggests that there has been a profound shift in their very nature: from a model where the association ideally vouches for the professional trustworthiness of several thousands of members, thus implicitly speaking to clients and other professions, we find a tendency toward communication patterns where the association becomes a place for social, pedagogical and political action between its members. The greater density and plexity of the interactions means that the newer associations involve smaller groups of people, selected on the basis of either professional specialization or geographical proximity. Similar interactive models are found in online marketplaces for translations and in communities of volunteer translators, which prove to be innovative not only in promoting interactive communication but also in inventing new ways of signaling translators&#8217; trustworthiness. A way forward for the traditional associations might be to adapt some of the communication strategies operative in the electronic marketplaces and among volunteers.",

As the cognitive processes underlying intercomprehensive language acquisition seem to have much in common with those underlying translation activity, intercomprehension didactics might contribute to developing efficient new methods for multilingual translator training. The paper provides empirical evidence for the feasibility of intercomprehensive language instruction in translator training. It addresses the following questions: Does the exploitation of knowledge of Russian promote the comprehension of Polish texts and the subsequent translation of these texts into learners&#8217; L1?

Te aim is to link translations to the broader context, highlighting modalities and expectations of reception that have evolved within the social structures through which the translation of contemporary Chinese poetry has been circulating: the publishing industry, universities, the periodical press, public intellectual debates, and the market. Te article does not try to establish if this or that expectation are either real or perceived features of the source texts. Nor does it deal with transla- tors\u2019 individual interpretations, their private readings.

It is hardly necessary for me to stress the mutual complementarity of these two scholars\u2019 methods: Having introduced (or re-introduced) translation into the cultural dynamics with the aid of the sociologically oriented concept of \u201cnorms\u201d, Toury left space for Even-Zohar and to others to deal with the general fluctuations on a variety of scales of cultural value of translated communication, as one among many forms of communication. Whether the conceptual tools that these two scholars have given us are in full harmony with each other, and whether all of their implications have been fully explored is not at issue here. Due to particular circumstances in the 1970\u2019s, their work has often been considered by translation scholars to be peculiarly relevant (only) for literary translation, though in fact the relevance of their concepts far transcends, and very explicitly so, the realms of literary scholarship (on translation). The perceived restriction to the particular sub-areas of translation studies may teach us more about the observers than about the observed.",

All these features concern translation, not only to the extent that they create social demands for translations but more importantly in that they give our research an ethical and political dimension, in addition to the demands of various markets. However, when the consequences of these commitments are compared with actual European research and public policies concerning translation, several shortcomings become apparent. The comparison suggests that future tasks for Translation Studies in Europe should include: (1) serious attention to far more than the large territorial languages; (2) enhanced exchange with neighboring disciplines, especially with scholars working on language acquisition; (3) an acceptance that translated communication should concern involvement and interaction, in addition to public information; (4) a questioning of the Western translation form as the model best suited to interactive cross-lingual governance; and (5) experimentation with technologies that stimulate citizen involvement.",

More specifically, it is also argued that these complex professional stances and positionings need to be taken into account if we are to gain a better understanding of translational norms (Toury 1995, 2000 and Chesterman 1993) or translational habitus (Simeoni 1998).

Consensus is deceptively inclusive, as the center is maintained at the expense of the periphery.

The paper focuses on the problems posed by French surrealist poetry, where the reader was held to be as important as the writer in creating interpretations, and argues that evaluations involving these poems inevitably require reader-response data. The paper explores empirically, in the context of Andr\u00e9 Breton's \"L'Union libre\", whether a modification of Think-Aloud procedure, called Note-Down, applied both to the original text and to three English translations, can contribute useful information to a traditional close reading approach.

In this article, my interest is in agency in the translation and production of James Morier's picaresque novel, The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan (1824) into Persian. Drawing on Persia's politics, society and culture of the 19th century, I contextualize both the English and the Persian texts and show how Mirza Habib Isfahani, the translator, intervened in the text in order to exercise his exilic agency. The translator's interventions in the text show that for him the ethics of political progress was more important than the ethics of fidelity to foreign text. The article also examines the agency of other translation agents: the English Major in charge of the editing and publication of the Persian translation in Calcutta; and a Persian dissident and copyist whose tragic death transformed his posthumous agency from a cross-border copyist to a misidentified translator for more than 50 years.

It also explores ways in which the translators position themselves with respect to the text. The study finds that the main tendency is one of distancing, whereby proximal deictics tend to become distals, with the effect that readers will be presented with a translation which elicits less involvement on their part than the original text did in its context.",

        "abstract": "While there are many types of purely linguistic differences between languages which students of translation can be explicitly taught to recognise during their formal training, it is a far bigger task to try to make future translators detect and appropriately cater to relevant cultural differences between a source text and its intended target text. Yet, snags of a cultural character are just as detrimental to translation quality as are linguistic mistakes. The problem with cultural differences between source and target environments in translation is further aggravated by the fact that, in contrast with the finite number of linguistic differences between language systems, the range of variation in differences between cultural environments is virtually infinite.",

Here, we evaluated the CD33/CD3-bispecific T cell engaging (BiTE) antibody (AMG 330) for its suitability as a therapeutic agent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We first assessed CD33 expression levels by flow cytometry and found expression in >99% of patient samples (n = 621). CD33 was highest expressed in AMLs with NPM1 mutations (P < .001) and lower in AMLs with complex karyotypes and t(8;21) translocations (P < .001). Furthermore, leukemic stem cells within the CD34(+)/CD38(-) compartment displayed CD33 at higher levels than healthy donor stem cells (P = .047). In MS-5 feeder cell-based long-term cultures that supported the growth of primary AML blasts for up to 36 days, AMG 330 efficiently recruited and expanded residual CD3(+)/CD45RA(-)/CCR7(+) memory T cells within the patient sample. Even at low effector to target ratios, the recruited T cells lysed autologous blasts completely in the majority of samples and substantially in the remaining samples in a time-dependent manner. This study provides the first correlation of CD33 expression levels with AML genotype in a comprehensive analysis of adult patients. Targeting CD33 ex vivo using AMG 330 in primary AML samples led to T cell recruitment and expansion and remarkable antibody-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting efficient therapeutic potential in vivo.",

When L3 appears in an audiovisual ST, we find a variety of solutions whereby L3 is deleted from or adapted to the TT. In the latter case, L3 might be rendered in a number of ways, depending on factors such as the audience\u2019s familiarity with L3, and the possibility that L3 in the ST is an invented language.",

Akt plays a pivotal role in cell survival and proliferation through a number of downstream effectors. Recent studies indicate that unregulated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is a prominent feature of many human cancers and Akt is over-expressed or activated in all major cancers. Akt is considered an attractive target for cancer therapy and inhibition of Akt alone or in combination with standard cancer chemotherapeutics has been postulated to reduce the apoptotic threshold and preferentially kill cancer cells. Recently, several series of small molecule, ATP-competitive inhibitors have been reported with a range of Akt potencies and selectivities. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) analogs have been reported to inhibit Akt, but these inhibitors may also have specificity problems with respect to other pleckstrin homology (PH) domain containing proteins and may have poor bioavailability. In addition, novel allosteric inhibitors have been reported which are PH domain dependent, exhibit selectivity for the individual Akt isozymes and inhibit the activity and the activation of Akt. Compounds within these classes Akt inhibitors have sufficient potency and specificity which have culminated in recent reports of efficacy in tumor xenograft models. Moreover, Merck just disclosed positive Phase I data with an oral allosteric Akt inhibitor (MK-2206).",

In leitmotif-conscious translating, it argues, the accountability between the source & target texts can be observed at this level of textual network, while the translation, as a literary text, may induce different perlocutionary effects when functioning in a different cultural milieu. 51 References.

It is demonstrated that the Polish context offers a rich repertoire of metaphorical depictions of translating, which reflects its distinctive historical and cultural setup.",

Through the analysis of a corpus of scientific articles in English, French and Spanish, this paper attempts to demonstrate that, due to constraints linked to textual progression, in some cases the translator will have to reproduce textual patterns more typical of the source text in the target text.",

It analyses eleven translators&#8217; &#8216;outputs&#8217; of Scots and English translations from Giuseppe Belli&#8217;s 19th-century regional-language sonnets, which are set in working-class Rome. Each output was coded for voice (space, community, tenor marking), text-world space, and poetic form (rhyme, rhythm), then analysed quantitatively and qualitatively; translator interviews and translators&#8217; written commentaries provided extra data. Translators ranged along a spectrum (apparently genre-specific) between two extremes: (1) &#8216;relocalising&#8217; voice into target regional language/dialect with similar working-class and informal features to Belli&#8217;s originals, whilst relocalising place and person names to target-country analogies, and recreating rhyme and rhythm; (2) translating into standard (supra-regional, literary/educated, neutral-to-formal) English, whilst preserving Belli&#8217;s Roman setting, but replacing rhyme and rhythm by free verse. This reflects a spectrum between two priorities: (1) creatively conveying poetic texture; (2) replicating surface semantics.",

The author explores to what extent traces of the primordial norm, as defined by Simeoni (2001), can be found in the first four French editions of this scholarly text produced over the period (1967&#8211;1981), two of which were signed by a professional translator and the others by a marketing scholar.",

Our case is that of existential there in English and existential il y a in French. Using corpus evidence, we first confirm previous claims that existential there is used more freely in English than existential il y a is in French. Drawing on extensive counts conducted in available corpora and self-compiled samples of translated English and French, intra-language comparisons of translated and non-translated language use show that existential there is under-represented in English translated from French while existential il y a is over-represented in French translated from English. It is suggested that source-language interference is responsible for these differences. In addition, counts of existentials in individual novels and their translations show that inter-language frequency shifts systematically occur in the direction of target-language norms, most clearly so for translations into French, which suggests that the observed usage constraint on il y a still applies to a noticeable extent in translated French. Methodologically, we argue the need for a large corpus of translated French. \u00a9 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",

        "abstract": "History, as Mark Twain famously put it, does not repeat itself but it does rhyme. The papers collected in this special issue of Target are based on talks delivered at the EST symposium Same place, different times, held at the University of Vienna on September 28, 2012. The symposium was an initiative of the Executive Board of the society to add luster to its twentieth anniversary by returning to the location where it had been held above the baptismal font two decades before. In this introduction, I will attempt to frame the contributions collected here by venturing a very rough sketch of the historical backdrop against which the European Society for Translation Studies came into being. Anniversaries are generally occasions for stocktaking when we tell ourselves (as in Irving Berlin's mellow ditty) to count our blessings instead of sheep. It is worth remarking, though, that a ritual dimension attaches to such moments of celebration; and as anthropologists remind us, rituals are means of excluding reflexivity. The repeated calls, interspersed in the following pages, for a more reflexive kind of Translation Studies should thus be understood in relation to the situational context from which they emanated. Apart from serving the traditional ritual function of a captatio benevolentiae, this introduction presents an attempt to provide the reader with some nuts and bolts (the metaphor will explain itself in a moment) for making sense of that context.

        "abstract": "This article deals with the beginnings of the translation of Modern Hebrew literature into Arabic, and at the same time with the beginnings of Arabic literary writing by Jewish intellectuals. We will focus on Salim al-Dawudi's translation of the first Hebrew novel, Avraham Mapu's Ahavat Tsiyon [The love of Zion] (1853), one of the most important texts to advocate the renewal of ties between Jews and Palestine. Al-Dawudi's translation was published in Egypt in two non-identical editions in 1899 and 1921\u00fb1922, and is probably the first Arabic translation of Modern Hebrew literature. When he declared that his translation was designed to remind his people that Hebrew was a living language, al-Dawudi accorded his translation Jewish national aspirations, which is perhaps the reason for the mixed aims of his translation's policy. On the one hand, there are phenomena that illustrate his desire to be accepted in the target culture, such as neglect of the integrity of the text, raising its stylistic register, preserving the ethical norms of the source text and even a tendency to paraphrase. On the other hand, there are places that display over-consideration of the source language and text, such as numerous deviations from the standard linguistic, syntactical and grammatical rules of Arabic, preservation of elements unique to Jewish culture and a multitude of Hebrew interferences in the Arabic translation. This unsystematic behavior apparently reflects a lack of literary skills, deep admiration of the source text (and language), and the fact that the translation was addressed mainly to a Jewish audience.",

        "abstract": "Discussions of translation often rely on the concept of meaning \u2014 not only the meaning of the words, but also the significance of the use of certain words in a certain text and context. Moreover, translation always involves a process of identifying the different components of the texts in order to establish a hierarchy of relevance of those elements (see Toury 1980: 38). The priority given to some elements to the detriment of others will have a decisive influence on the choice of certain strategies and the final outcome. The literary use of a dialect in literary texts seems to be a particularly good example of that balancing of meaning and prioritization of elements. Not only because of its very localised meaning (both in time and space), but also because it is always embedded in the source text with a communicative and semiotic significance. It can challenge the translator who, when faced with the impossibility of looking for referential equivalences and formal correspondences, is forced to decide on the importance and meaning of the use of a specific dialect in the text. That decision will define the strategies to be used, which can go from total normalization of the text to a recreation of a linguistic variety in the target text. The purpose of this article is threefold: To present for discussion a model summarising the strategies identified in a number of case-studies; to present and discuss the strategies identified in a corpus of 12 Portuguese translations of Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion and Alan Jay Lerner's My Fair Lady, as well as the contextual factors which might have influenced the translators' choices; and to establish whether there are regularities in the associations between media (translation for stage, page and screen) and strategies for dealing with non-standard language.",

        "abstract": "Background Accumulating evidence suggests an important role for interleukin 17 (IL-17) in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). IL-17A has been well studied in models of arthritis, but little is known about the relative expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, and their receptors in human synovial tissue. Objective To determine the expression of IL-17A, IL-17F and their receptors IL-17RA and IL-17RC in synovial tissues of patients with RA, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and osteoarthritis (OA). Methods Synovial biopsy specimens were obtained by arthroscopy from patients with RA (n=13), PsA (n=15) and inflammatory OA (n=14). For comparison synovial tissues from non-inflammatory controls (n=7) were included. Immunohistological analysis was performed using monoclonal antibodies specific for IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17RA and IL-17RC. Stained sections were evaluated by digital image analysis. Results Levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17RA and IL-17RC were abundantly present in synovial tissues of all patient groups and highly variable between patients. Digital image analysis showed a significant increase of IL-17A and IL-17RC, but not of IL-17F and IL-17RA in patients with arthritis compared to non-inflamed control tissues, while the expression of IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17RA was similar between the different patient groups. Expression of IL-17RC in the synovial lining was significantly increased in PsA compared to OA patients. Conclusions Increased expression of IL-17A is not restricted to synovial tissues of RA patients but also observed in other forms of inflammatory arthritis. In contrast, the expression of IL-17F is not significantly increased. IL-17A blockade could provide a novel therapeutic approach in a variety of arthritides.",

DHODH is an important target for antiparasitic and cytostatic drugs since rapid cell proliferation often depends on the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. We have cloned the pyr4 gene encoding mitochondrial DHODH from the basidiomycetous plant pathogen Ustilago maydis. We were able to show that pyr4 contains a functional mitochondrial targeting signal. The deletion of pyr4 resulted in uracil auxotrophy, enhanced sensitivity to UV irradiation, and a loss of pathogenicity on corn plants. The biochemical characterization of purified U. maydis DHODH overproduced in Escherichia coli revealed that the U. maydis enzyme uses quinone electron acceptor Q6 and is resistant to several commonly used DHODH inhibitors. Here we show that the expression of the human DHODH gene fused to the U. maydis mitochondrial targeting signal is able to complement the auxotrophic phenotype of pyr4 mutants. While U. maydis wild-type cells were resistant to the DHODH inhibitor brequinar, strains expressing the human DHODH gene became sensitive to this cytostatic drug. Such engineered U. maydis strains can be used in sensitive in vivo assays for the development of novel drugs specifically targeted at either human or fungal DHODH.",

In addition to conventional surtitles translating the source text delivered orally on stage, creative surtitles transmit new messages and thus multiply the possible readings generated by the performance.

Thus there is a good justification to discuss them openly every now and then, and we appreciate the initiative taken by Chesterman and Arrojo (2000).

It reports on a small-scale experiment carried out to see how such readers reacted to translations from English of samples of negative politeness and poses the question whether translators (continue to) translate the locutionary dimension (the words) of such texts rather than attempt to convey the illocutionary force (the acts of politeness being performed).",

The present article reports on a study whose aim was to elucidate translators&#8217; motivations for performing such shifts, focusing on the addition of connectives. The study was carried out on a bidirectional parallel corpus containing translations of business texts between English and German. Connective additions and omissions were identified, counted and analyzed taking into account the surrounding linguistic context of the shift in question, possibly associated shifts performed by the translator, alternative translation options, etc. It was found that the vast majority of identified shifts were attributable to previously established English-German contrasts in terms of syntax, lexis, and communicative norms. The findings suggest that it is unnecessary to assume that translators follow a &#8220;universal strategy&#8221; of explicitation, as it has often been done in the literature (cf. e.g. Blum-Kulka&#8217;s Explicitation Hypothesis).",

Feuerle The use of reality-based role-plays to provide a basis or road map to help interpreters address problematical professional and ethical issues is not new; however, using the Theater of the Oppressed as the frame of reference to structure and execute these exercises is indeed a fresh approach. In this work Mira Kadri\u0107 places this new approach to interpreter training in a historical perspective with roots reaching back to the works of the early pedagogical reformers Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Friedrich Herbart. In Martin Buber\u2019s philosophy of dialogue Kadri\u0107 traces an interdisciplinary route that leads her to the Brazilian thinkers and activists, Paulo Freire, author of the Pedagogy of the Oppressed, and Augusto Boal, theater practitioner and creator of the Theater of the Oppressed",

        "abstract": "Nearly all scholarly works about the encounter of Iran with European modernity emphasize the role of translation not only in introducing new literary forms into the Persian literary system, but also in becoming the main engine of change and modernization of the culture. This paper concerns itself with this constructivist narrative of the available historiographical discourse and the translational environment between 1851 and 1921 in Iran. After describing the field of translation in the period in question, I challenge the uncritical conception of translation as a positive force by, on the one hand, investigating hypothetical cultural and linguistic implications, and on the other hand, questioning the power of translation per se, as ascribed to it in the above mentioned historiographical discourse, in socio-cultural modernization. This will prioritize the individual and cultural translational effects over the supposed institutional ones.",

        "abstract": "Translingual writers, in attempting to navigate between languages and the associated social contexts, bring both linguistic and cultural translation into play as processes fostering encounter and transformation. This paper considers the thematic function of translation within recent translingual narrative, where it appears both as a literary topos and as an ideological subtext. It attempts to illustrate how, contrary to postcolonial writers whose narratives self-consciously engage with their own linguistic or cultural hybridity by thematizing the power relationships between different linguistic strands, the narratives of transnational/translingual writers explore new identities by constructing new dialogic spaces in which language choice is located outside the oppositional model set up by the traditional binaries of postcolonial theorizing. Through a reading of the work of Amara Lakhous, a contemporary Italian writer, born and educated in Algiers and writing in both Arabic and Italian, it is argued that translingual works suggest an understanding of translation as not only something that happens after the story ends, but is a crucial part of the narrative itself; one that generates plot and meaning, and is indispensable to an understanding of the concrete processes of cultural translation that shape relationships, identities, and interactions globally.",

        "abstract": "Ever since the 18th century revival of Hebrew literature, translation has been considered an efficient tool for ideological manipulation. Christianity has been a traditional candidate for such manipulation. Fear and hatred of the \"younger\" religion may have accounted for the subversive treatment of Christian elements in Hebrew texts. Strategies varied, depending on period and norm, mostly involving omission of undesirable material, but often converting the text into a more acceptable ideological type. Ben-Hur: A tale of the Christ (1880) by Lew Wallace is one of the novels most translated and most tampered with, and due to its predominantly Christian character, it can serve as an illuminating case study both for the subversion of Christian elements and for the more \"creative\" conversion into the \"Few against Many\" or \"Jewish bravura against the Roman Empire\" model.",

The debate between these different approaches is sometimes couched in terms of essentialism vs. non-essentialism. In general, essentialism claims that meanings are objective and stable, that the translator\u2019s job is to find and transfer these and hence to remain as invisible as possible. Non-essentialism, on the other hand, basically claims that meanings (including the meaning of the concept of \u2018translation\u2019) are inherently non-stable, that they have to be interpreted in each individual instance, and hence that the translator is inevitably visible.

Te paper reviews some existing work on gestural depiction methods, offers a working heuristics, and illustrates some of its categories.

        "abstract": "The influence of translational norms on the translation of humor manifested in prose fiction has not been a focus of much research. This paper will try to establish the existence of an institutionalized strategy of amplification, presumably born out of a wish to bridge the cultural gap reflected in two different national traditions of literary humor. The effect of amplification, as it is implemented in the various Hebrew translations of Charles Dickens's The Pickwick Papers and Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat, is analyzed on the basis of Attardo's General Theory of Verbal Humor (Attardo 2001, 2002). The use of amplification as a model for the translation of humor from the beginning of the 20th century, and its diminishing currency from the 1980s onwards are also discussed. ",

Te paper consid- ers a number of methodological recommendations and argues that the need to take full account of insights from metaphor studies and associated disciplines is of greatest importance. Another significant potential innovation is the use of a multilingual approach in respect of both product- and process-oriented studies in order to increase both the amount and the generality of data available for analysis. Tirdly, it is important to extend the current source-text (ST) oriented approach. Te paper concludes by suggesting some options for triangulating data gathered through a combination of methods.",

Previous research into the effect of foreign accent of witnesses indicated particular foreign accents negatively influence mock jurors' evaluations of the testimony. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of interpreters' foreign accents on the evaluation of witnesses' testimony. Contrary to previous research, our results indicated that participants rated the witness more favourably when testimony was interpreted by an interpreter with a foreign language accent. Accented versions were all rated as more credible, honest, trustworthy and persuasive than the non-accented versions.

One of the major problems affecting Spanish translation in this field derives from the high flexibility of English towards conversion, the process whereby a term belonging to a specific grammatical category can be used with different syntactic functions without requiring change in its form.

Of the few who have taken up the topic, Immanuel Wallerstein has argued that one of the distinguishing characteristics of social scientific texts is that they traffic in concepts. Wallerstein wants the translation of social science to further the possibility of a universal conversation in the social sciences. I argue that a universal conversation in the social sciences is neither possible nor desirable. Instead, this article proposes that translating social science can contribute to conceptual clarification and elaboration. In this way, the translation may complement and further the flowering of the 'original' concept. The essay concludes with an extended example - how 'bewilderment' might be translated into Spanish.",

Despite dramatic reduction of speech information encoded in a binary mask, the proposed system performs surprisingly well.

As referential cohesion is hypothesized to be affected by certain universals of translation, the explicitation and the repetition avoidance hypotheses are also tested. Analyses show considerable shifts of reference in translations, but these are not statistically significant. The corpus also fails to provide evidence for the universals of translation investigated; however, the in-depth analysis of optional shifts suggests that they are conditioned by the discursive features of the genre and contribute to a more explicit presentation of news content.",

By drawing on the experience of writing translations of Garc\u00eda Lorca for the Belgrade Theatre, Calder\u00f3n for the Royal Shakespeare Company, and Lope de Vega for the Watermill Theatre and the Washington Shakespeare Theatre, the article attempts to characterise such translation as an act of physical imagination, of a holistic understanding of both language and performance, into which textuality is incorporated and by which it is superseded.",

Readability formulas have been suggested to be a useful tool and yet this needs to be empirically tested. In this study, NASA Task Load Index, a multidimensional scale for measuring mental workload, was used to assess the level of translation difficulty for the translator. It was found that a text&#8217;s readability only partially accounts for its translation difficulty level. Translation quality score was found to be an unreliable indicator of translation difficulty level, while time-on-task was significantly, but weakly, related to translation difficulty level. A formula was developed to predict a text&#8217;s translation difficulty level for a translator by using the translator&#8217;s pre-translation rating.",

Building on the experi- mental paradigm of data triangulation in translation process research (Alves 2003; Jakobsen 2005), it analyses the translation processes of eight professional translators when performing a direct and an inverse translation task.

The analysis indicates that a character\u2019s voice as a whole can reflect the retranslator\u2019s voice and the purpose of his/her translation. In addition, translators\u2019 voices can recirculate in retranslation, but they do not necessarily do so if the purpose of the translation, the translator\u2019s choice of source texts, or translation ethics prevents this.",

However, the concept of culture as such has remained elusive. A number of questions remain unanswered: How can we define a culture?

Looking for answers, I start with a personal note, with my own previous attempt at conceptualizing translators work in the European Commission by defining the EU institutions as a (multilingual and institutional) culture of its own. Responses to this model convey varying views of the concept of culture. By analyzing and contextualizing these responses it is my aim to provide some answers to the question of what kind of a construction culture is.

Not surprisingly, the trend seems to arise from other audiovisual forms and media.

        "abstract": "Modes of Censorship and Translation articulates a variety of scholarly and disciplinary perspectives and offers the reader access to the widening cultural debate on translation and censorship, including cross-national forms of cultural fertilization. It is a study of censorship and its patterns of operation across a range of disciplinary settings, from media to cultural and literary studies, engaging with often neglected genres and media such as radio, cinema and theatre. Adopting an interdisciplinary and transnational approach and bringing together contributions based on primary research which often draws on unpublished archival material, the volume analyzes the multi-faceted relationship between censorship and translation in different national contexts, including Italy, Spain, Great Britain, Greece, Nazi Germany and the GDR, focusing on the political, ideological and aesthetic implications of censorship, as well as the hermeneutic play fostered by any translational act. By offering innovative methodological interpretations and stimulating case studies, it proposes new readings of the operational modes of both censorship and translation. The essays gathered here challenge current notions of the accessibility of culture, whether in overtly ideological and politically repressive contexts, or in seemingly 'neutral' cultural scenarios.",

Flow (Csikszentmihalyi 1975) is an optimal experience, characterized by intense focus, control, interest and skills-challenge balance that leads to enhanced performance on a task. Although investigated in areas such as professional sports, surgery, and music, Flow Theory has not yet been tested in the area of translation. This study aimed at identifying which discourse genre would induce most flow in trainee translators while translating. Fifty-six Iranian English Translation majors studying at the University of Kashan translated three 180-word texts of narrative, expository, and descriptive genres. After each translation, they responded to a Flow Perceptions Questionnaire (Egbert, 2003) in the Likert format to report their perceptions of flow. Using repeated measures ANOVA, the researchers investigated flow differences among genres. The results indicated that flow existed in the translation classroom and that there were significant differences in the flow scores engendered by different genres. To support the findings drawn from the numerical analysis, four participants, selected from the population of subjects from the first phase, were interviewed, and the analysis of the interviews generally corroborated the statistical findings.

        "abstract": "One of the themes that came up for debate at the Vic Forum on Training Translators and Interpreters: New Directions for the Millennium in May 1999 was the apparent conceptual or theoretical gap between those who approach translation studies from the perspective of postmodern cultural studies and textual theories and those who see it more as an empirical, descriptive field. The debate between these different approaches is sometimes couched in terms of essentialism vs. non-essentialism. In general, essentialism claims that meanings are objective and stable, that the translators job is to find and transfer these and hence to remain as invisible as possible. Non-essentialism, on the other hand, basically claims that meanings (including the meaning of the concept of translation) are inherently non-stable, that they have to be interpreted in each individual instance, and hence that the translator is inevitably visible. What follows below is first of all a set of 30 theses which represent our shared ground; we have written them together, and both of us accept the formulations used. Any of these theses could be expanded at some length, but we have tried to be brief. This shared list is followed by two codas, in which each of us comments on the shared ground and expands on selected points.",

The main focus of the study is transitivity shifts and their connection to ideological issues. This corpus has been chosen for various reasons. Amongst them, the paper sets out to test the conclusions reached by prior research (Trosborg 1997a; Koskinen 2000). Three basic questions are posed: 1.

Qualitative analyses then focus on the functional description of some contracted and non-contracted forms, and also consider the contraction practices of different translators.

Through reading Even-Zohar's texts closely and tracing the later developments of the theory, it attempts to explore the complexities of the theory, and clear up some misunderstandings, citing examples from polysystem-inspired case studies.

The debate over the `foreignness' or the `domesticity'\\nof a text or translation is usually conducted in a rather polarizing\\nfashion, as in the case of Venuti (1995). Venuti's conceptual framework\\nfails to provide adequate criteria for differentiating domesticating\\nand foreignizing translation strategies, which easily results in\\ninflated claims about the linguistic hegemony of the Anglo-American\\nworld. In reaction to this, the article reconceptualizes the two\\ntranslation strategies as part of the paradoxical internal logic\\nof culture in order to highlight how every culture is continually\\nin the process of (re-)translating itself. Therefore, the analysis\\nis broadened to include the domesticating aspects of the foreignizing\\nstrategy, and vice versa, the foreignizing potential of domesticating\\ntranslations. The domestication of the foreign is evident in the\\nambiguous inclusion of non-English or bilingual texts in American\\nliterary histories. The foreignization of the domestic, by contrast,\\nappears from a persistent tendency on the part of literary historians\\nto describe their forerunners or competitors as excessively Anglo-\\nor Eurocentric. Through this reflexive application of Venuti's strategies,\\nthe article draws attention to the paradoxical togetherness of the\\nforeign and the domestic inside American literary culture.",

        "abstract": "Research on the mental processes of written translation has benefited less from the findings of psycholinguistic and cognitive research than interpreting research has. This has left translation research relatively impoverished in the theoretical grounding of research methodology. While the performance speed of interpreting seems to make interpreting research closer to bilingual speech research, the shared features of interpreting and translation suggest that they are points on a continuum rather than discrete production modes. A Translation-Interpreting Continuum is proposed, which allows various production modes to be described in terms of psycholinguistic notions, and which includes a language development dimension to account for second language production. The Continuum allows some very basic questions about translation research methodology to be answered, and opens up the opportunity for a better integration of translation and interpreting research.",

I present the comparison theory of metaphor (Section 2), show how this can be integrated with the notions of lexicalization & non-lexicalization (Section 3) & consider the semantic purposes of metaphor (Section 4). The remainder of the paper focuses on the translation of metaphor, starting with more abstract langue-oriented notions. I offer a critique & revision of Newmark's (1988) metaphor typology (Section 5), & demonstrate how the revised typology can be integrated with the notions of lexicalization & non-lexicalization (Section 6). I then consider Lakoff & Johnson's (1980) model of metaphorical 'schemata', & propose ways in which this can also be integrated into an overall model (Section 7). I discuss the practical application of this model to Arabic-English translation (Section 8). In addition to langue-oriented notions, I suggest that a full account of metaphor for translation needs to take into account the more parole-oriented notion of the interaction of metaphors in texts. I consider the notions of metaphorical congruence (Section 9), & metaphorical exuberance & density. Illustrating my arguments with Arabic-English translation data, I suggest that in given registers, different languages may tolerate more or less metaphorical density & exuberance as well as different degrees of metaphorical mixing (Section 10). The paper concludes with a consideration of the kind of 'Full Model' one might build up for a detailed academic study of metaphor translation (Section 11). Figures, References.

Besides offering a model that incorporates the findings of previous scholarship, it casts new light on the motivation behind retranslation, using the case of translations of Shakespeare's Hamlet on the Dutch stage. The history of Dutch Hamlet performances shows a number of constants in the retranslation of the play. Since the establishment of a Hamlet tradition and the rise of the director's theatre, the retranslations that functioned within the community of Dutch theatre were the fruit of the collaboration of translators with directors. Each translator changed its strategy towards at least one cardinal norm to be different from his theatrical predecessor. This new strategy formed an intrinsic part of the strategy of the director, who used the new text to support a new interpretation of the play that also differed from his predecessor's. Staging a retranslation can therefore be said to be a strategy to differentiate a theatre production from previous theatre productions through the application of differing translational norms.",

Translation studies has explored many facets of the processes and products of translation and interpreting, ranging from the linguistic aspects to the textual aspects, from the politics of translation to implications from cognitive science, but little is known about the production and reception of translation at the level of the individual brain and the level of molecular biology.1 Much of this terra incognita will be explored and illuminated by neuroscience in the coming quarter century, and significant discoveries pertaining to language processing in translation will be made during the coming decade, linking observable behaviors at the macro level with knowledge of what happens in the production and reception of translation at the micro level of the neuron and the neuronal pathways of the brain. In the past two decades powerful new techniques for observing brain function in healthy living individuals have been devised. To a large extent neuroscience has become a rapidly developing field because of new technologies that make it possible to monitor the brain as it actually works, to document neural pathways, and even to track the activity of specific neurons. This article focuses on discoveries in neuroscience pertaining to perception, memory, and brain plasticity that have already achieved consensus in the field and that have durable implications for the ways we will think about translation in the future.

Applications of RNAi have gained increasing attention since the groundbreaking discovery that small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules can be used to inhibit gene expression in mammalian cells in a sequence-specific manner. Numerous meetings have recently been held in this field, but the organiser from EF International succeeded in bringing some of the leading academic scientists and company researchers together in London to present and discuss exciting new results. Major topics covered in the meeting included the recent progress in understanding the basic mechanism of RNAi, genome-wide RNAi-based screens for target discovery, and approaches to use RNAi for target validation in cell culture and in animal models. In addition, borders and caveats of the technology, such as off-target effects and a possible induction of the interferon response by siRNA, have been discussed intensively. The use of siRNAs can be regarded as a highly potent strategy to identify and validate new targets for therapeutic interventions against cancer, viral infections, chronic pain and other diseases. Finally, siRNAs themselves hold the promise to become therapeutic agents in the near future.",

Several factors make this level of accuracy difficult to achieve; the target is moving, is frequently >1 m away from the snake and the venom stream is released in approximately 50 ms. In the present study we show that spitting cobras can accurately track the movements of a potentially threatening vertebrate, and by anticipating its subsequent (short-term) movements direct their venom to maximize the likelihood of striking the target's eye. Unlike other animals that project material, in spitting cobras the discharge orifice (the fang) is relatively fixed so directing the venom stream requires rapid movements of the entire head. The cobra's ability to track and anticipate the target's movement, and to perform rapid cephalic oscillations that coordinate with the target's movements suggest a level of neural processing that has not been attributed to snakes, or other reptiles, previously.",

The authors developed a strategy of combining adenovirus-mediated gene transfer for efficient target functionality validation, both in vivo and in vitro, with baculovirus expression to produce sufficient quantities of protein for high-throughput screening (HTS). The incorporation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the adenovirus vectors accelerates recombinant adenovirus plaque purification, whereas the use of epitope and affinity tags facilitates the identification and purification of recombinant protein. In this generalized scheme, the flexible modular design of viral vectors facilitates the transition between target validation and HTS. In the example presented, functional target validation in vivo was achieved by overexpressing the target gene in cell-based models and in the mouse cortex following adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. In this context, target overexpression resulted in the accumulation of a disease-related biomarker both in vitro and in vivo. A baculovirus-based expressional system was then generated to produce enough target protein for HTS. Thus, the use of these viral expression systems represents a generalized method for rapid target functionality validation and HTS assay development, which could be applied to numerous target candidates being elucidated in gene discovery programs.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is a major public health problem causing more deaths than any other cancer. A better understanding of the biology of this disease and improvements in treatment are greatly needed. Increasing evidence supports the concept that a rare and specialized population of cancer cells, so-called cancer-initiating cells with stem cell-like characteristics, is responsible for tumor growth, maintenance, and recurrence. Cancer-initiating cells also exhibit characteristics that render them resistant to both radiation and chemotherapy, and therefore they are believed to play a role in treatment failure. This has led to the hypothesis that traditional therapies that indiscriminately kill tumor cells will not be as effective as therapies that selectively target cancer-initiating cells. Investigating putative cancer-initiating cells in lung cancer will greatly benefit the understanding of the origins of this disease and may lead to novel approaches to therapy by suggesting markers for use in either further isolating this population for study or for selectively targeting these cells. This review will discuss (1) lung cancer, (2) stem cells, and the role of cancer-initiating cells in tumorigenesis; (3) markers and functional characteristics associated with lung cancer-initiating cells; and (4) the potential to selectively target this subpopulation of tumor cells.",

        "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase that functions as a key regulator of cell growth, proliferation and differentiation, cell-cycle progression, angiogenesis, protein degradation, and apoptosis. Following activation by a number of oncogenic signals such as growth factors, energy and nutrients, mTOR stimulates several downstream effectors including the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70s6k) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E binding protein-1 (4 EBP-1), as well as a complex network of regulatory loops. Activation of the mTOR pathway plays a critical role in the development of many tumor types, including renal cell and breast carcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and sarcomas. Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are rare, heterogeneous tumors that are curable by local treatments if diagnosed at early stages; however advanced or metastatic sarcomas are rarely curable and very few drugs are efficacious in this setting. Several disruptions in phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mTOR signaling are associated with malignant transformation or progression in various sarcoma sub-types. The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway is therefore an exciting target for therapy of sarcomas, and its blockade represents an opportunity to improve outcomes in this poor-prognosis disease. Early studies with mTOR inhibitors have demonstrated promising antitumor activity in patients with metastatic sarcoma who have failed standard treatments. This article discusses the mTOR signaling pathway and summarizes the clinical experience with mTOR inhibitors in patients with advanced or metastatic sarcoma.",

The present discussion adds a further way to think about Lyons-Ruth's discussion of intersubjectivity, relating it to the work of the Hungarian developmentalists Csibra and Gergely, Their theory makes the intersubjective processes highlighted by Lyons-Ruth central in human evolution and individual development. The human mind is unique in that it learns about the meaning of the external world--especially the social and emotional world--through another subjectivity; that means that the other person must be available to \"teach.\" Lyons-Ruth's findings are compatible with the prediction, from Csibra and Gergely's theory, that the withdrawal of the caregiver would be crucial to later pathology. It means the absence of the essential source of information both about the self (through contingent mirroring) and about loved others and the rest of the world. Because the study sample size is small, the finding of an absence of interaction between genes and environmental influences cannot be conclusive. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

In the freely chosen, private world of psychoanalysis, these caricatures loom much less threateningly than in the world of public funding and donations, commissions and conditions, which affect many of us every day. We are right to insist that such therapeutic experiences are deeply precious and ultimately incommunicable. It is painful and offensive when they may be derided, not only by those outside with many motivations including misunderstanding, but also by insiders who have been hurt or disillusioned, sometimes damaged by their experiences in training, or since by personal/professional dynamics within psychotherapeutic organizations. Outcome research and process research present some risks but, having struggled to do these for many years, it seems to me that we can learn quite a lot that is genuinely interesting. We need to show that we are proud of our profession, which was always radical, and we have confidence that it can adapt and stay relevant in a quickly changing world. That world will need psychoanalysis, with its capacity to illuminate in depth, to understand and keep in view what is human no matter how much the world may change around us.

Significant clinical activity has led to their approval for the treatment of kidney cancer, mantle cell lymphoma, and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma; however, despite increasing knowledge about cancer cell biology, their activity in other malignancies is unclear.

So far, mTOR activity in PDECs has only been tested in cell lines. This study reviewed 36 mono-institutional PDECs to determine mTOR expression. Slides of normal kidney as positive control were used to optimize mTOR staining. To ensure antibody specificity, consecutive sections were incubated in the absence of primary antibody. Immunoreactivity was evaluated on a semi-quantitative scale scoring the extent and intensity of staining. The product of these two scores was used to obtain a total immunostaining score. The main primary site of disease was the pancreas, and 83% of patients had stage IV disease. In 80% of samples, mTOR expression was maintained at similar levels, with no relationship to tumor origin or proliferation rate determined by MIB-1. This study seems to demonstrate that mTOR is expressed in human PDECs regardless of tumor site. Its role in relation to the activity of everolimus in this subset of patients needs to be confirmed.",

Identifying biological factors that may predict efficacy or resistance to mTOR inhibitors represents an important challenge since rapalogs may exert antitumor effects through multiple mechanisms of action. Despite the fact that no such a factor is currently available, several molecular patterns are emerging, correlating with sensitivity and/or resistance to rapalogs. While activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, overexpression of cyclin D1, and functional apoptosis seem to sensitize tumor cells to rapalogs, Bcl2 overexpression or KRAS mutations are reported to be associated with resistance to mTOR inhibitors in several preclinical models. Translational research aimed at validating those parameters in clinical trials is ongoing.",

The second category includes inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), namely everolimus and temsirolimus. A pivotal trial of everolimus supports use of the agent in patients with mRCC refractory to VEGF- tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy, while pivotal data for temsirolimus supports use in poor-prognosis patients as first-line therapy. Multiple reviews exist to delineate the laboratory and clinical development of mTOR inhibitors. This paper will outline the future applications of these therapies. It will explore ongoing trials evaluating combinations of mTOR inhibitors with other targeted therapies, along with sequencing strategies and biomarker discovery efforts.

The CP (Cdc68p-Pob3p) complex, which is involved in transcription elongation, was evaluated as a putative antifungal target. In order to predict the consequences of inhibition of this complex, the largest CP subunit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc68p, was the first novel target to be tested in GATE, a recently described, quantitative target inactivation system. Depletion of the cell's pool of Cdc68p led to rapid cell death. Subsequently, the C. albicans orthologue of CDC68, CaCDC68, was cloned. Attempts to disrupt both alleles were unsuccessful, thus suggesting an essential role of CaCDC68 in this fungus also. Furthermore, CDC68 was proven to be present in Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus nidulans, thus suggesting that the CP complex is widespread among fungi and could serve as a broad range antifungal target. Analysis of Cdc68p and Pob3p sequences indicated significant structural differences between fungal CP complexes and those present in higher eukaryotes. These results predict that, in principle, fungal-specific ligands of CP complexes could be identified that could subsequently serve as chemical starting points towards the development of new antifungal therapeutic agents.",

Thus, recent high-throughput screening campaigns have been initiated using asexual intraerythrocytic stage cell-based assays of Plasmodium falciparum. These have led to the unprecedented identification of over 10,000 new antimalarial compounds. Inherently, novel compounds identified by cell-based assays will have poorly defined modes of action. While some of these compounds may have recognizable targets, the majority of cell-based hits are comprised of unique chemical scaffolds usually lacking cross-resistance with known drugs. It is likely that these novel antimalarial scaffolds will reveal new targets. A challenge for the community will be to assign these small molecules to their targets.

However, existing scoring functions may not accurately differentiate proteins to which the MOI binds from a larger set of macromolecules in a protein structural database. An MOI will most likely have varying degrees of predicted binding affinities to many protein targets. However, correctly interpreting a docking score as a hit for the MOI docked to any individual protein can be problematic. In our method, which we term \"Virtual Target Screening (VTS)\", a set of small drug-like molecules are docked against each structure in the protein library to produce benchmark statistics. This calibration provides a reference for each protein so that hits can be identified for an MOI. VTS can then be used as tool for: drug repositioning (repurposing), specificity and toxicity testing, identifying potential metabolites, probing protein structures for allosteric sites, and testing focused libraries (collection of MOIs with similar chemotypes) for selectivity. To validate our VTS method, twenty kinase inhibitors were docked to a collection of calibrated protein structures. Here, we report our results where VTS predicted protein kinases as hits in preference to other proteins in our database. Concurrently, a graphical interface for VTS was developed.",

A sampling programme involving three different techniques (split beam sonar, angling census and post-angling competition data collection) was conducted to examine methodologies suitable for target strength validation. This combination of techniques also assessed the relative merits of each method for best describing fish populations and the stocks exploited in a recreational coarse fishery. The sonar estimated the greatest number of fish of the three techniques, with a strong positive size correlation with the other two methods. The angling census and post-competition census accounted for more larger fish, >26 cm, than were detected acoustically, indicating a stratification of species that were exploited by angling but not detected by horizontal sonar. The combined techniques demonstrated a suitable, cost-effective, hydroacoustic validation method for large UK rivers, which supports recreational coarse fisheries management, with the added advantage of species identification.

A downspout generator is a small impeller-driven generator that hooks to the bottom of a downspout on a house or a building, and generates power when water flows down the downspout. The Failure Mode Verification Testing will identify failure modes effectively, and the design maturity will quantify if the design is robust; but no test quantifies a minimum life or reliability. The most suitable test for quantifying the time-to-failure versus stress on simple failure modes such as poly-coat failure is accelerated reliability. If only poly coat on the base material is taken into consideration, then the cost of conducting the test is not driven up by conducting the test well before the production ramp up.",

This study is motivated by two factors: first, to examine radar backscatter mechanism of standard small targets, and second, to extract pertinent scattering features that can be used in target recognition. Radar returns have been examined using time-frequency analysis techniques, particularly those targets with dispersive scattering behavior. The Fractional Fourier Transform provides an attractive alternative to time-frequency analysis. The motivation lies in the fact that fractional Fourier Transform features retain phase information, and, because of their linear structure, are potentially less susceptible to noise contamination compared to their time-frequency counterparts. The fractional Fourier Transform has its disadvantages as well which are addressed in this paper. The FrFT scattering analysis scheme is tested using real radar signatures of commercial aircraft recorded in the UHF range.",

This protocol is the extension of a recently published 'domain fishing model' (DFM), validating its predicted targets on a set of 42 common antitubercular drugs. For the 23 antiTB compounds of the set which are directly linked to targets (see text for definition), the DFM exhibited a very good target prediction accuracy of 95%. For 19 compounds indirectly linked to targets also, a reasonable pathway/embedded pathway prediction accuracy of 84% was achieved. Since mostly eukaryotic ligand binding data was used for the DFM generation, the high target prediction accuracy for prokaryotes (which is an extrapolation from the training data) was unexpected and provides an additional proof of concept of the DFM. To estimate the general applicability of the model, ligand-target coverage analysis was performed. Here, it was found that, although the DFM only modestly covers the entire TB proteome (32% of all proteins), it captures 70% of the proteome subset targeted by 42 common antiTB compounds, which is in agreement with the good predictive ability of the DFM for the targets of the compounds chosen here. In a prospective validation, the model successfully predicted the targets of new antiTB compounds, CBR-2092 and Amiclenomycin. Together, these findings suggest that in silico target prediction tools may be a useful supplement to existing, experimental target deconvolution strategies.",

        "abstract": "This guidance describes how the FDA evaluates patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments used as effectiveness endpoints in clinical trials. It also describes our current thinking on how sponsors can develop and use study results measured by PRO instruments to support claims in approved product labeling (see appendix point 1). It does not address the use of PRO instruments for purposes beyond evaluation of claims made about a drug or medical product in its labeling. By explicitly addressing the review issues identified in this guidance, sponsors can increase the efficiency of their endpoint discussions with the FDA during the product development process, streamline the FDA's review of PRO endpoint adequacy, and provide optimal information about the patient's perspective of treatment benefit at the time of product approval. A PRO is a measurement of any aspect of a patient's health status that comes directly from the patient (i.e., without the interpretation of the patient's responses by a physician or anyone else). In clinical trials, a PRO instrument can be used to measure the impact of an intervention on one or more aspects of patients' health status, hereafter referred to as PRO concepts, ranging from the purely symptomatic (response of a headache) to more complex concepts (e.g., ability to carry out activities of daily living), to extremely complex concepts such as quality of life, which is widely understood to be a multidomain concept with physical, psychological, and social components. Data generated by a PRO instrument can provide evidence of a treatment benefit from the patient perspective. For this data to be meaningful, however, there should be evidence that the PRO instrument effectively measures the particular concept that is studied. Generally, findings measured by PRO instruments may be used to support claims in approved product labeling if the claims are derived from adequate and well-controlled investigations that use PRO instruments that reliably and validly measure the specific concepts at issue. The glossary defines many of the terms used in this guidance. In particular, the term instrument refers to the actual questions or items contained in a questionnaire or interview schedule along with all the additional information and documentation that supports the use of these items in producing a PRO measure (e.g., interviewer training and instructions, scoring and interpretation manual). The term conceptual framework refers to how items are grouped according to subconcepts or domains (e.g., the item walking without help may be grouped with another item, walking with difficulty, within the domain of ambulation, and ambulation may be further grouped into the concept of physical ability). FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended but not required.

        "abstract": "Background: Automated microscopy and image analysis have progressed tremendously over the past 10 years and opened up a new era of high-content screening. In parallel, RNA interference (RNAi) has revolutionized the functional analysis of genes. Objective: The focus of this review is screening of RNAi libraries, and in particular in screening of short interfering RNA (siRNA) libraries for target identification and validation in mammalian cell systems. Methods: Recent literature of high-content siRNA screening in oncology, in intracellular trafficking and infection biology, and in neurobiology is reviewed and placed in the context of a discussion on hit verification. Results/conclusion: Various methods have been established for the application of RNAi in mammalian cells also, which allows efficient and reproducible silencing of individual genes to gain functional information on each individual gene. Complex multi-parametric cell-based assays, combined with both technologies, provide an extraordinary valuable tool to help understand biological and pathological processes in a systematic way and discover new targets for pharmaceutical exploitation.

METHODS: The affinity of LHRH-PE40 and LHRH binding to LHRHR on the membrane surface of target cells were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Morphological observations with light microscope were used to analyze its receptor pathway, with Spiegelmer, and cytotoxicity. IC(50) values of LHRH-PE40, which caused 50% inhibition of tumor cell growth were evaluated by MTT assay. The target cells were exposed to LHRH-PE40 and its cytotoxicity was analyzed by scanning and transmission electron microscopies, agarose gel electrophoresis, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: LHRH-PE40 killed target cells by LHRHR pathway. The morphological changes in these cells showed decreased cell size, cytoplasmic membrane blebbing, and chromatin condensation and margination. At a certain concentration and time point, HeLa cells were also induced to undergo programmed cell death. CONCLUSION: LHRH-PE40 induced target cells apoptosis via LHRHR.",

The inherent complexity of these models, with often multiple modified tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, has hampered their use as preclinical models for validating cancer genes and drug targets. In our newly developed approach for the fast generation of tumor cohorts we have overcome this obstacle, as exemplified for three GEMMs; two lung cancer models and one mesothelioma model. Three elements are central for this system; (i) The efficient derivation of authentic Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) from established GEMMs, (ii) the routine introduction of transgenes of choice in these GEMM-ESCs by Flp recombinase-mediated integration and (iii) the direct use of the chimeric animals in tumor cohorts. By applying stringent quality controls, the GEMM-ESC approach proofs to be a reliable and effective method to speed up cancer gene assessment and target validation.

Recurrence following surgery and adjuvant treatment and the metastatic disease are still a major problem with a median overall survival of approximately 24 months. Nevertheless, there has been an improvement in outcome due to the introduction into clinical practice of new cytotoxic and targeted agents. The targeted agents that have improved the efficacy of the available chemotherapeutic regimens in CRC are the ones that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In particular, bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF, cetuximab, and panitumumab, two monoclonal antibodies that target the EGFR, have been approved for the treatment of metastatic CRC (mCRC). While for anti-EGFR agents, predictive biomarkers have been found, no good biomarkers have been found yet for anti-VEGF agents. Aflibercept and regorafenib have recently also been approved in patients with mCRC. This article reviews in an extensive way the data of large randomized clinical trials for the use of anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR in CRC. Aim of this review is also to describe the current status of biomarkers discovery and highlight how to improve the therapeutic index of these targeted agents by selecting in advance the subgroup of patients who will benefit from these treatments.",

Patients with advanced GIST, who were once a subset of sarcoma with poor prognosis due to their lack of chemosensitivity, may now survive more than 5 years following treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib mesylate (IM) and sunitinib malate (SU). After ten years of active clinical and preclinical research, it has become clear that, although relatively homogeneous compared to other solid malignancies, there is still some heterogeneity in GISTs and most notably in regard to response to therapy.

However, the delivery of those macromolecules in or across the skin is undesirably limited due to its permeation property. To expand the number of macromolecules to be delivered to specific targeting tissue/cells, a unique biomedical device, the handheld powdered injection system, has been developed. It is a novel transdermal technology that disposes needles (and syringes), circumvents the need for refrigeration (of vaccines) and has the potential to revolutionise the treatment and prevention of major diseases. To further underwrite device characteristics, in this paper, an advanced computational fluid dynamics technology is utilised to model gas, particle dynamics and gas-particle-target interaction. The statistical analyses show that the microparticles can achieve a mean velocity of 704 m/s representative of intracellular macromolecular deliveries. Knowledge on the gas and particle dynamics can be applied to design effective and efficient handheld powdered delivery systems",

As evidence points to RCC being largely refractory to traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy strategies, immunotherapeutic approaches played a dominant role in the management of metastatic RCC for a quarter of a century. Management of this challenging tumor has been revolutionized by the incorporation of molecularly targeted therapies such as inhibitors of pathways involving tyrosine kinase signaling and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The improvements in disease stabilization and survival seen with these agents has meant that molecularly targeted therapy now forms the foundation for treating RCC and has resulted in a multitude of studies investigating similar compounds for efficacy in RCC. Despite this, the rationale for using immunomodulatory regimens remains strong and its ongoing place in this era of targeted treatments continues to pose interesting clinical questions. The challenge of maintaining durable responses from our current therapies persists and this review highlights the plethora of options now available in RCC treatment and the directions in which modern management are heading.",

        "abstract": "Solid tumors require blood vessels for growth, and many new cancer therapies are directed against the tumor vasculature. Antiangiogenic therapies should destroy the tumor vasculature, thereby depriving the tumor of oxygen and nutrients. According to Jain et al., an alternative hypothesis could be that certain antiangiogenic agents can also transiently \"normalize\" the abnormal structure and function of tumor vasculature to make it more efficient for oxygen and drug delivery. With emphasize on the research works of Jain et al., the aim of this review is to describe the impact of antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy on \"pseudo-normalization\" of tumor vasculature and tumor microenvironment, its role in early and metastatic breast cancer, and the clinical evidence supporting this original concept. The phase III clinical trials showed that extended tumors, metastatic or locally advanced, are likely to benefit from bevacizumab therapy in combination with chemotherapy, assuming that a high level of tumor neoangiogenesis as in triple-negative tumors is the best target. In adjuvant setting, the lower level of tumor vasculature could mask a potential benefit of anti-VEGF therapy. All these findings highlight the need to identify biomarkers to help in the selection of patients most likely to respond to anti-VEGF therapy, to better understand the mechanism of angiogenesis and of resistance to anti-VEGF therapy according to molecular subtypes.",

Smp_059340.1 is predicted to be a member of the G protein alpha-s subunit responsible for regulating adenylyl cyclase activity in S. mansoni and a possible drug target against the parasite. Our structural bioinformatics analyses identified key amino acid residues (Ser53, Thr188, Asp207 and Gly210) in the two molecular switches responsible for cycling the protein between active (GTP bound) and inactive (GDP bound) states. Residue Thr188 is located on Switch I region while Gly210 is located on Switch II region with Switch II longer than Switch I. The Asp207 is located on the G3 box motif and Ser53 is the binding residue for magnesium ion. These findings offer new insights into the dynamic and functional determinants of the Smp_059340.1 protein in regulating the S. mansoni life cycle.

We then compare image reconstruction quality of various convolution mask sizes, compression ratios, and reconstruction algorithms. We also expand the algorithm to derive a pattern recognition system which operates of a compressively sensed measurement stream. The developed compressive pattern recognition system reconstructions the detections map of the scene without the intermediate step of image reconstruction.

However, it remains unclear to what extent these new mechanistic insights will translate to animal models, an important step in the validation of new targets. Previously, we found that glia from mice carrying the SOD1G93A mutation, a model of ALS, were toxic to stem cell-derived human motor neurons. We use pharmacological and genetic approaches to demonstrate that the prostanoid receptor DP1 mediates this glial toxicity. Furthermore, we validate the importance of this mechanism for neural degeneration in vivo. Genetic ablation of DP1 in SOD1G93A mice extended life span, decreased microglial activation, and reduced motor neuron loss. Our findings suggest that blocking DP1 may be a therapeutic strategy in ALS and demonstrate that discoveries from stem cell models of disease can be corroborated in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are known for many years for their role in the recognition of microbial products and the subsequent activation of the immune system. The 2011 Nobel Prize for medicine indeed rewarded J. Hoffmann/B. Beutler and R. Steinman for their revolutionary findings concerning the activation of the immune system, thus stressing the significance of understanding the mechanisms of activation of the innate immunity. Such immunostimulatory activities are of major interest in the context of cancer to induce long-term antitumoral responses. Ligands for the toll-like receptors (TLRs), a well-known family of PRR, have been shown to have antitumoral activities in several cancers. Those ligands are now undergoing extensive clinical investigations both as immunostimulant molecules and as adjuvant along with vaccines. However, when considering the use of these ligands in tumor therapy, one shall consider the potential effect on the tumor cells themselves as well as on the entire organism. Recent data indeed demonstrate that TLR activation in tumor cells could trigger both pro- or antitumoral effect depending on the context. This review discusses this balance between the intrinsic activation of PRR in tumor cells and the extrinsic microenvironment activation in term of overall effect of PRR ligands on tumor development. We review recent advances in the field and underline appealing prospects for clinical development of PRR agonists in the light of our current knowledge on their expression and activation.",

We conducted a retrospective review of the data of 70 lung cancer patients with lymph node metastasis who underwent surgical resection. Analysis to detect EGFR mutations was performed by a peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction clamp method. EGFR mutations were detected in 15.7 % of both the PT and MLN and in 14.3 % of the PT only. The response rate to EGFR-TKI tended to be higher in patients with EGFR mutations in the MLN, as all patients with EGFR mutations in the MLN showed disease control to treatment with EGFR-TKI. Our results demonstrated that the EGFR mutation status of MLN is a predictive marker of the response to EGFR-TKI therapy in patients with recurrent NSCLC after surgical resection.",

Historically, information regarding prognosis has come from clinicopathologic variables, however in recent years much research has focused on the molecular basis of renal cell cancer. The discovery of reliable biomarkers in RCC could have an important impact on diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of therapeutic benefit. To date, most biomarker research has centered on byproducts of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) pathway including VHL mutations, vascular endothelial growth factor (ligands and receptors), hypoxia-inducible factor, and carbonic anhydrase IX. This review examines these potential biomarkers, biomarker prognostic models, and molecular expression profiles in the field of renal cell carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) status is a good prognostic factor for colorectal cancer (CRC), but its predictive value for chemosensitivity remains controversial. We recently performed a meta-analysis (MA) in adjuvant setting showing that MSI high (MSI-H) status did not predict the efficacy of chemotherapy. Studies were identified by electronic search through PubMed, Embase and ASCO proceedings online databases, using several keywords (colorectal cancer, chemotherapy, microsatellite instability). For each study, we calculated the ratio of response rate, complete and partial responses divided by stable disease and progression. Our MA dealt with the predictive value of MSI status on the effect of metastatic chemotherapy using various combinations of 5FU, oxaliplatin or CPT11. From 159 articles and 76 abstracts, we selected only seven independent studies. Data were analysed with a random-effect model (due to heterogeneity between studies) using EasyMA software. Statistical calculations were performed on five studies representing 860 patients (mean age 63 years; 87 MSI-H; 733 microsatellite stable [MSS] tumors). A total of 287 patients received 5FU-based chemotherapy, whereas 574 patients received combinations of 5FU or capecitabine with oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan. Our MA found no benefit of metastatic chemotherapy in terms of response rate for MSI-H patients compared with MSS patients. The global hazard ratio for response rate was 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.95; 0.65-1.05; p = 0.11). In conclusion, MSI status did not predict the effect of chemotherapy for metastatic CRC. Metastatic chemotherapy had a similar effect on both MSI-H or on MSS tumors.",

Cetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody, has been studied in combination with first-line chemotherapy in phase II and two phase III trials in patients with advanced NSCLC. The phase III FLEX trial demonstrated an increase in survival for cisplatin/vinorelbine plus cetuximab compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced EGFR-expressing NSCLC. Cetuximab added to carboplatin/paclitaxel failed to improve progression-free survival in the BMS099 phase III trial. However, a meta-analysis of four randomized trials confirmed a significant survival benefit for platinum-based chemotherapy plus cetuximab compared to chemotherapy alone. High EGFR expression of tumor cells was then shown to predict the benefit of cetuximab, whereas KRAS mutations and EGFR fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis were without predictive value. Matuzumab and panitumumab have also been studied in phase II trials. Necitumumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is currently evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in two phase III trials in patients with advanced NSCLC.

The establishment of KRAS mutation testing in this setting represents a significant change to standard diagnostic procedures and a major advance in the personalization of cancer care. Against a changing regulatory background, three cross-sectional surveys of physicians in 14 countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia were conducted in 2008, 2009, and 2010 to investigate the uptake and outcome of KRAS testing for patients with mCRC. Physicians in each year answered questions on four patients (last patient seen and last seen in first-, second- and third-line settings). Fieldwork was carried out February-May 2008, January-April 2009, and January-April 2010. Data from 3,819, 3,740 and 3,820 anonymized, uncoded patient records were collated. The frequency of KRAS testing in patients with mCRC increased from 3% in 2008 to 47% in 2009 and 69% in 2010.

Cetuximab was the most commonly administered targeted agent in tested patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC (798/1607 patients; 50%) and bevacizumab was the most commonly administered targeted agent in tested patients with KRAS mutant tumors (396/893; 44% overall).

Currently, they are approved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. Skin toxicity is a class-specific side effect that is typically manifested as a papulopustular rash in the majority (45-100%) of patients receiving EGFR inhibitors. The skin toxicity is related to the inhibition of EGFR in the skin, which is crucial for the normal development and physiology of the epidermis. Although rarely life-threatening, skin toxicity may cause significant physical and psycho-social discomfort. Nevertheless, the presence and severity of skin rash is associated with improved clinical efficacy in patients receiving EGFR inhibitors. The goal of managing EGFR inhibitor-associated skin toxicity is to minimize the detrimental effects of the rash on patients' quality of life and treatment course without antagonizing the clinical efficacy of EGFR inhibitors. There is currently no evidence-based treatment guideline to prevent or treat the EGFR inhibitor-associated skin toxicities. Expert panels recommend a proactive, multidisciplinary approach that includes patient education and the use of a grade-based treatment algorithm. Elucidation of the mechanisms of EGFR inhibitor-associated skin toxicity and development of mechanism-based novel therapies are urgently needed. Preclinical data suggest topical application of a potent phosphatase inhibitor menadione (Vitamin K3) can rescue the inhibition of EGFR and downstream signaling molecules in the skin of mice receiving systemic EGFR inhibitor erlotinib or cetuximab. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study has been initiated to evaluate the clinical efficacy of menadione topical cream, in the treatment or prevention of EGFR inhibitor-induced skin toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Although the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed and/or amplified in more than 50 % of all glioblastomas (GBM), therapeutic targeting of the EGFR has not yet been successful. Since histone deacetylases (HDAC) have been described as controlling EGFR expression, we combined the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib with different HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) and investigated the benefit of combinatorial therapy for glioblastoma cells. Using representative models of EGFR-amplified, erlotinib-sensitive and -resistant GBM with or without EGFRvIII expression, we determined proliferation, migration, and EGFR-dependent signaling in response to erlotinib and HDACi alone or in combination. HDACi significantly inhibited proliferation of erlotinib-resistant GBM cells, partially restored their sensitivity to erlotinib, and also significantly reduced proliferation of all treatment-naive cell lines tested. In combination with erlotinib, the development of resistance was prevented. The multitargeted EGFR/HDAC-inhibitor CUDC-101 exhibited similar effects. However, inhibition of cell migration was only achieved by targeting EGFR, and HDACi exhibited no additive effect. Mechanistically, we identified an HDACi-dependent decrease of EGFR/EGFRvIII protein expression underlying the anti-proliferative effects of HDACi. In conclusion, HDACi in combination with erlotinib might serve as a treatment option for newly diagnosed, treatment-naive tumors irrespective of their EGFR status, as well as for treatment-refractory, EGFR-overexpressing GBM.",

FINDINGS: In this study, 15 potential microRNAs in Citrus sinensis (csi-miRNAs) were identified and bioinformatically validated using miR-RACE, a newly developed method for determination of miRNAs prediction computationally. The expression of these fifteen C. sinensis miRNAs can be detected in leaves, stems, flowers and fruits of C. sinensis by QRT-PCR with some of them showed tissue-specific expression. Six potential target genes were identified for six csi-miRNAs and also experimentally verified by Poly (A) polymerase -mediated 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (PPM-RACE) and RNA ligase-mediated 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) which mapped the cleavage site of target mRNAs and detected expression patterns of cleaved fragments that indicate the regulatory function of the miRNAs on their target genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that small RNA-mediated regulation whereby all csi-miRNAs regulate their target genes by degradation.",

Both classifiers were trained in conjunction with circular fingerprints on a large data set of bioactive compounds extracted from ChEMBL, covering 894 human protein targets with more than 155,000 ligand-protein pairs. This data set is also provided as a benchmark data set for future target prediction methods due to its size as well as the number of bioactivity classes it contains. In addition to evaluating the methods, different performance measures were explored. This is not as straightforward as in binary classification settings, due to the number of classes, the possibility of multiple class memberships, and the need to translate model scores into \"yes/no\" predictions for assessing model performance. Both algorithms achieved a recall of correct targets that exceeds 80% in the top 1% of predictions. Performance depends significantly on the underlying diversity and size of a given class of bioactive compounds, with small classes and low structural similarity affecting both algorithms to different degrees. When tested on an external test set extracted from WOMBAT covering more than 500 targets by excluding all compounds with Tanimoto similarity above 0.8 to compounds from the ChEMBL data set, the current methodologies achieved a recall of 63.3% and 66.6% among the top 1% for Na\u00efve Bayes and Parzen-Rosenblatt Window, respectively. While those numbers seem to indicate lower performance, they are also more realistic for settings where protein targets need to be established for novel chemical substances.",

As DFMO is one of only two drugs used to treat patients with late-stage African trypanosomiasis, the requirement for additional drug targets is paramount. Here, we report the biochemical properties of TbSpSyn (Trypanosoma brucei spermidine synthase), the enzyme immediately downstream of ODC in this pathway. Recombinant TbSpSyn was purified and shown to catalyse the formation of spermidine from putrescine and dcSAM (decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine). To determine the functional importance of TbSpSyn in BSF (bloodstream form) parasites, we used a tetracycline-inducible RNAi (RNA interference) system. Down-regulation of the corresponding mRNA correlated with a decrease in intracellular spermidine and cessation of growth. This phenotype could be complemented by expressing the SpSyn (spermidine synthase) gene from Leishmania major in cells undergoing RNAi, but could not be rescued by addition of spermidine to the medium due to the lack of a spermidine uptake capacity. These results therefore genetically validate TbSpSyn as a target for drug development and indicate that in the absence of a functional biosynthetic pathway, BSF T. brucei cannot scavenge sufficient spermidine from their environment to meet growth requirements.",

The authors aim to extend a model from previous papers, bringing a developmental perspective to bear on self-representation and self-organisation. This model rests on an understanding of the child's experience of psychic reality in both normal and neurotic people. The authors explore the relevance of these developmental ideas in thinking about severe borderline and related disturbances seen in adult patients, from the point of view of both understanding the pathology and considering technique. Illustrations are given from a case that helped to prompt the formulation of these states in terms of persistent, pervasive distortions of the experience of psychic reality. There is then an attempt to elucidate the difficulties of borderline patients in tolerating both separation and intimacy, consideration of the way in which bodily experiences may be used as an equivalent of mental experience or contact, and a discussion of the impact of disturbances in the experience of psychic reality on the analytic process.",

Making this distinction enables these authors to suggest that it is less likely to be a refusal of romantic response that triggers the patient's relentless pursuit of love from the analyst than an earlier disorganization of the infantile attachment. Taking the transference situation as a whole, the patient's persistent demand for an unattainable gratification can then be seen as the patient's determination to create in the consulting room another person who is in beleaguered, defensive withdrawal from a relationship.

The objective of this investigation is to determine whether the Tf R can facilitate endocytosis of a (protein) model drug, using Tf as a targeting vector. Secondly, the mechanism of endocytosis was investigated. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP, 40 kDa) was chosen as a model drug, since it normally does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its concentration in biological media can be easily quantified. Tf-HRP conjugates (1:1) are actively and specifically endocytosed by BCEC in vitro in a concentration and time-dependent manner. At an applied concentration of 3 microg/ml, association (a combination of binding and endocytosis) of Tf-HRP reached equilibrium at a concentration of 2 ng/mg cell protein after 1 h of incubation at 37 degree C. This was approximately 3-fold higher compared to binding at 4 degree C (0.6 ng/mg cell protein). Association of Tf-HRP was compared to BSA-HRP. After 2 h of incubation at 37 degree C association levels were 5.2 and 2.5 ng/mg cell protein, for Tf-HRP and BSA-HRP, respectively. Under those conditions, association of Tf-HRP could be inhibited to approximately 30% of total association by an excess of non-conjugated Tf, but not with BSA, while association of BSA-HRP could be inhibited by both proteins. Furthermore, by using specific inhibitors of endocytotic processes, it was shown that association of Tf-HRP is via clathrin-coated vesicles. Association of Tf-HRP is inhibited by phenylarsine oxide (an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis) to 0.4 ng/mg cell protein, but not by indomethacin, which inhibits formation of caveolae. Finally, following iron scavenging by deferoxamine mesylate (DFO, resulting in a higher Tf R expression) a 5-fold increase in association of Tf-HRP to 15.8 ng/mg cell protein was observed. In conclusion, the Tf R is potentially suitable for targeting of a (protein) cargo to the BBB and to facilitate its endocytosis by the BCEC.",

Here we demonstrate by a gene silencing approach that LDH-A is critical for in vivo but not in vitro growth of HT29 colon carcinoma cells. We provide evidence that the suppression of the LDH-A gene leads to an increased level of hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) but in consequence not to an increase of HIF1 regulated proteins such as carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), prolyl-hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), and factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH) in cell cultures and tumor lysates. This effect is independent of LDH activity in vivo. We conclude that LDH-A has an influence on the activity of HIF1alpha and thus on the adaptation of cells to a hypoxic tumor microenvironment in HT29 colon cells. We suggest the use of LDH-M as a potential therapeutic target for anticancer treatment.",

It has not been fully validated whether the splicing impairment is a relevant mechanism for the potent antitumor activity of pladienolide. We established pladienolide-resistant clones from WiDr and DLD1 colorectal cancer cells that were insensitive to the inhibitory action of pladienolide on cell proliferation and splicing. An mRNA-Seq differential analysis revealed that these two cell lines have an identical mutation at Arg1074 in the gene for SF3B1, which encodes a subunit of the SF3b complex. Reverse expression of the mutant protein transferred pladienolide resistance to WiDr cells. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation analysis using a radiolabeled probe showed that the mutation impaired the binding affinity of paldienolide to its target. These results clearly demonstrate that pladienolide exerts its potent activity by targeting SF3b and also suggest that inhibition of SF3b is a promising drug target for anticancer therapy.",

Owing to lack of specific therapeutic regiment against the disease, we cloned and characterized B. microti lactate dehydrogenase (BmLDH) as a potential molecular drug receptor. The in vitro kinetic properties of BmLDH enzyme was evaluated using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) as a co-factor and lactate as a substrate. Inhibitory assay was also done using gossypol as BmLDH inhibitor to determine the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC<sub>50</sub>). The result showed that the 0.99 kbp BmLDH gene codes for a barely soluble 36 kDa protein (332 amino acids) localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of the parasite. In vitro enzyme kinetic studies further revealed that BmLDH is an active enzyme with a high catalytic efficiency at optimal pH of 10.2. The K<sub>m</sub> values of NAD<sup>+</sup> and lactate were 8.7 +/- 0.57 mM and 99.9 +/- 22.33 mM, respectively. The IC<sub>50</sub> value for gossypol was 0.345 muM, while at 2.5 muM, gossypol caused 100% inhibition of BmLDH catalytic activity. These findings, therefore, provide initial evidence that BmLDH could be a potential drug target, although further in vivo studies are needed to validate the practical application of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors against B. microti infection. \u00a9 the authors, publisher and licensee Libertas academica Limited.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate deformable mesh registration (DMR) as a tool for validating automatic target registration algorithms used during image-guided radiation therapy.\\n\\nMETHODS: DMR was implemented in a hierarchical model, with rigid, affine, and B-spline transforms optimized in succession to register a pair of surface meshes. The gross tumor volumes (primary tumor and involved lymph nodes) were contoured by a physician on weekly CT scans in a cohort of lung cancer patients and converted to surface meshes. The meshes from weekly CT images were registered to the mesh from the planning CT, and the resulting registered meshes were compared with the delineated surfaces. Known deformations were also applied to the meshes, followed by mesh registration to recover the known deformation. Mesh registration accuracy was assessed at the mesh surface by computing the symmetric surface distance (SSD) between vertices of each registered mesh pair. Mesh registration quality in regions within 5 mm of the mesh surface was evaluated with respect to a high quality deformable image registration.\\n\\nRESULTS: For 18 patients presenting with a total of 19 primary lung tumors and 24 lymph node targets, the SSD averaged 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 and 0.8 \u00b1 0.2 mm, respectively. Vertex registration errors (VRE) relative to the applied known deformation were 0.8 \u00b1 0.7 and 0.2 \u00b1 0.3 mm for the primary tumor and lymph nodes, respectively. Inside the mesh surface, corresponding average VRE ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 and 0.2 to 0.9 mm, respectively. Outside the mesh surface, average VRE ranged from 0.7 to 1.8 and 0.2 to 1.4 mm. The magnitude of errors generally increased with increasing distance away from the mesh.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Provided that delineated surfaces are available, deformable mesh registration is an accurate and reliable method for obtaining a reference registration to validate automatic target registration algorithms for image-guided radiation therapy, specifically in regions on or near the target surfaces.",

        "abstract": "The most challenging problem of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) is the extraction of robust and independent target features which describe the target unambiguously. These features have to be robust and invariant in different senses: in time, between aspect views (azimuth and elevation angle), between target motion (translation and rotation) and between different target variants. Especially for ground moving targets in military applications an irregular target motion is typical, so that a strong variation of the backscattered radar signal with azimuth and elevation angle makes the extraction of stable and robust features most difficult. For ATR based on High Range Resolution (HRR) profiles and / or Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) images it is crucial that the reference dataset consists of stable and robust features, which, among others, will depend on the target aspect and depression angle amongst others. Here it is important to find an adequate data grid for an efficient data coverage in the reference dataset for ATR. In this paper the variability of the backscattered radar signals of target scattering centers is analyzed for different HRR profiles and ISAR images from measured turntable datasets of ground targets under controlled conditions. Especially the dependency of the features on the elevation angle is analyzed regarding to the ATR of large strip SAR data with a large range of depression angles by using available (I) SAR datasets as reference. In this work the robustness of these scattering centers is analyzed by extracting their amplitude, phase and position. Therefore turntable measurements under controlled conditions were performed targeting an artificial military reference object called STANDCAM. Measures referring to variability, similarity, robustness and separability regarding the scattering centers are defined. The dependency of the scattering behaviour with respect to azimuth and elevation variations is analyzed. Additionally generic types of features (geometrical, statistical), which can be derived especially from (I) SAR images, are applied to the ATR-task. Therefore subsequently the dependence of individual feature values as well as the feature statistics on aspect (i.e. azimuth and elevation) are presented. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance will be used to show how the feature statistics is influenced by varying elevation angles. Finally, confusion matrices are computed between the STANDCAM target at all eleven elevation angles. This helps to assess the robustness of ATR performance under the influence of aspect angle deviations between training set and test set.",

The identification of every human gene by ongoing bioinformatic efforts has the potential, when combined with functional genomic approaches, to pinpoint the molecular basis of every human disease, and to discover appropriate intervention points. This exciting prospect is directly relevant to the successful development of effective therapeutics because the past record of drug discovery suggests that 30%-40% of experimental drugs fail because an inappropriate biological target was pursued. The major impact of genomic information may therefore be to reduce this biological failure rate by earlier definition of drug targets related to disease susceptibility or progression. This paper briefly reviews some of the approaches that can be used to identify biologically relevant drug targets.",

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer remains the single most prevalent cancer in men. Standard therapies are still limited and include androgen ablation that initially causes tumor regression. However, tumor cells eventually relapse and develop into a hormone-refractory prostate cancer. One of the current challenges in this disease is to define new therapeutic targets, which have been virtually unchanged in the past 30 years. Recent studies have suggested that the family of enzymes known as the proprotein convertases (PCs) is involved in various types of cancers and their progression. The present study examined PC expression in prostate cancer and validates one PC, namely PACE4, as a target. The evidence includes the observed high expression of PACE4 in all different clinical stages of human prostate tumor tissues. Gene silencing studies targeting PACE4 in the DU145 prostate cancer cell line produced cells (cell line 4-2) with slower proliferation rates, reduced clonogenic activity, and inability to grow as xenografts in nude mice. Gene expression and proteomic profiling of the 4-2 cell line reveals an increased expression of known cancer-related genes (e.g., GJA1, CD44, IGFBP6) that are downregulated in prostate cancer. Similarly, cancer genes whose expression is decreased in the 4-2 cell line were upregulated in prostate cancer (e.g., MUC1, IL6). The direct role of PACE4 in prostate cancer is most likely through the upregulated processing of growth factors or through the aberrant processing of growth factors leading to sustained cancer progression, suggesting that PACE4 holds a central role in prostate cancer.",

Throughout Earths history these collisions have played a significant role in shaping Earths biological and geological histories. The planetary defense community has been examining a variety of options for mitigating the impact threat of asteroids and comets that approach or cross Earths orbit, known as near-Earth objects (NEOs). This paper discusses the preliminary study results of selecting small (100-m class) NEO targets and mission analysis and design trade-offs for validating the effectiveness of a Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle (HAIV) concept, currently being investigated for a NIAC (NASA Advanced Innovative Concepts) Phase 2 study. In particular this paper will focus on the mission analysis and design for single spacecraft direct impact trajectories, as well as several mission types that enable a secondary rendezvous spacecraft to observe the HAIV impact and evaluate its effectiveness.\nHighlights We describe and show results from a highly capable trajectory optimization program.Our program incorporates gravity assists and uses a genetic algorithm.Our program produces very low \u0394V solutions even for complicated mission scenarios. \u00a9 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of IAA.",

Dis- turbances of attachment relationships will therefore disrupt the normal emergence of these key social-cognitive capacities and create profound vulnerabilities in the context of social relationships.

        "abstract": "Responding to Davies's extension of the classical psychoanalytic description of the Oedipus complex, the authors argue that, in theoretical thinking about the Oedipus complex, attachment and sexual relating must be carefully distinguished, although they ceaselessly interact and-in the end-their separate contributions may be hard to disentangle. Making this distinction enables these authors to suggest that it is less likely to be a refusal of romantic response that triggers the patient's relentless pursuit of love from the analyst than an earlier disorganization of the infantile attachment. Taking the transference situation as a whole, the patient's persistent demand for an unattainable gratification can then be seen as the patient's determination to create in the consulting room another person who is in beleaguered, defensive withdrawal from a relationship. The discussion further elaborates the similarities and differences between the authors' own theoretical position and Davies's relational perspective through a consideration of the case of Roberta presented by Davies in her paper.

The paper explores some critical obstacles in the way of psychodynamic research, including the fragmentation of psychoanalytic theory. the relative independence of theory from its clinical and empirical base, the predominance of inductive scientific logic, the polymorphous use of terms, the privacy of clinical data, the dominance of the reconstructionist stance, and the isolation of psychoanalysis from psychology and neurobiology. Notwithstanding these limitations, core psychoanalytic precepts are not only consistent with some of the most important advances of the last decade but may also be helpful in elaborating these new discoveries in the next century. Psychoanalysis is centered on the notion that complex, conflicting, unconscious representations of mental states constitute a key facet of normal and abnormal development. This notion retains its power, and deserves a prominent position among the major frames of reference to guide developmental science in the next century.",

Processes as fundamental as gene expression or changes in receptor densities can be seen as direct functions of the extent of understanding of mental states provided by the caregiving environment. If the attachment relationship is indeed a major organiser of brain development, it is even more important to understand the processes that underpin the transgenerational transmission of attachment patterns.

Detailed examination of a subset of data from this study suggests that personal therapy is valued as a vehicle for a genuine, often extremely intense relationship with the therapist, through which participants become able to establish authentic emotional contact with themselves and their clients. Whilst most participants felt that personal therapy should remain an obligatory part of the training curriculum, they were ambivalent about specifying its aims or evaluating its outcomes.

        "abstract": "The relationship between psychoanalysis and attachment theory is complex indeed. A brief review of the psychoanalytic literature as it concerns attachment theory and research, and of the attachment literature as it pertains to psychoanalytic ideas, demonstrates an increasing interest in attachment theory within psychoanalysis. Some of the difficulties that attachment theory faces in relation to psychoanalytic ideas are traced to its links to the now dated cognitive science of the 1960s and 1970s. Today, however, a second-generation cognitive neuroscience seeks neurobiologically plausible accounts in which links with brain and body are seen as shaping mind and consciousness, which increasingly are seen as \"embodied\", as emerging from or serving the needs of a physical being located in a specific time, place, and social context. This idea has also been at the core of much psychoanalytic thinking, which has historically affirmed the rootedness of symbolic thought in sensory, emotional, and enacted experience with objects. Now neurobiological advances supporting the concept of embodied cognition offer an opportunity to forge powerful links between the hitherto separate domains of attachment theory and psychoanalysis. Speculations about the nature of language are presented that emphasize the origin of internal working models (and of representations in general) in early sensorimotor and emotional experiences with a caregiver. It is argued that language and symbolic thought may be phylogenetically and ontogenetically embodied, built on a foundation of gestures and actions, and are thus profoundly influenced by the experience of early physical interaction with the primary object. Finally, the clinical and research implications of these ideas are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The authors explore the interpersonal aspects of the early development of an experience of external reality and the roots of this experience in primary intersubjectivity. They suggest some implications that this has for psychoanalytic work with the patient's experience of external reality. They argue that the external world is not an independently existing 'given', for the infant to discover, as is sometimes implicitly assumed. Infants acquire knowledge about the world not just through their own explorations of it but by using other minds as teachers. The experience of external reality is invariably shaped through subjectivities. The authors argue that at first the infant assumes that his knowledge is knowledge held by all, that what he knows is known by others and that what is known by others is accessible to him. Only slowly does the uniqueness of his own perspective differentiate so that a sense of mental self can develop. In clinical work we frequently observe the undoing of this process of differentiation, and understanding the underlying mechanisms can be helpful in managing the transference and countertransference consequences when the process has been derailed.",

Oncogenic fusion genes, including echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) and ALK, have been detected in approximately 2-7 % of NSCLC patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the recommended method for detecting ALK gene rearrangement. EML4-ALK fusion genes define a molecular subset of NSCLC with distinct clinical characteristic (lung adenocarcinoma, never or former smoker, usually mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations). Crizotinib (PF-02341066) is an orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive, small molecule inhibitor of both the receptor tyrosine kinases ALK and c-MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor). Crizotinib has been shown to yield important clinical benefit such as objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and anticipated improvements in quality of life when used in pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EML4-ALK gene rearrangement. Preliminary phase II data suggested that crizotinib is safe and well tolerated with rapid and robust antitumor activity. A phase III randomized trial in a second-line setting showed response rate and PFS (primary study endpoint) advantage for crizotinib as compared to second-line chemotherapy. Treatment-related adverse events, predominantly restricted to the gastrointestinal and visual systems, are generally self-limiting or easily managed. Crizotinib is a new standard of care for patients with advanced, ALK-positive, NSCLC. In this review, we will discuss the discovery of ALK rearrangements, the clinical epidemiology of lung cancer driven by ALK, the clinical data for ALK-targeted therapy in NSCLC, and ongoing ALK inhibitor-based clinical trials.",

Efficacy of this drug was documented in the BR.21 trial showing that adenocarcinoma, female gender, Asian ethnicity and never-smoker status are predictive of clinical response to erlotinib. Retrospective studies documented the same benefits for elderly patients as young patients in terms of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The primary aim of our trial was to confirm these findings in a prospective way; the secondary aim was to identify if the aforementioned clinical characteristics may be predictive of response even in elderly patients. The trial included 31 patients with pretreated stage IIIB (2) and IV (29) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Median age was 75 years (range: 65-85). Twenty-seven patients were current/former-smokers and four never-smokers. Twenty-three patients are evaluable for response. Objective response rates were reported in five patients (16%). Five patients had stable disease (16%) and 13 progressive disease (43%). Seven patients had a \"clinical benefit\" from erlotinib (22.5%; 95% C.I.: 7.9-37.2%). Grade 3 skin rash was recorded in three patients (10%). Median survival was 9 months (range 1-30). Median time to progression was 3 months (range: 1-24 months). Our study confirmed erlotinib activity and safety as second- and third-line treatment in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC, especially in terms of median survival. Even though this trial does not allow us to draw a definitive conclusion about the role of a particular clinical characteristic predictive of response, the \"clinical benefit\" was documented especially in females, in patients with adenocarcinoma histology and skin rash, confirming previous retrospective data.",

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\u03b1-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD \u2264 2.0 \u00c5 for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.",

Given the near ubiquity of derangements affecting at least part of this network in cancer, there is a strong and clear rationale for interrupting it. In recent times, in colorectal and lung cancer, Ras and EGFR mutant status have been shown to be critically important and mutually exclusive predictors of response to anti-EGFR therapies.

P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporin A, quinidine and verapamil, enhanced the apparent brain uptake of [3H]BNP by 1.5-fold. The increment of the BNP uptake by the brain suggests the involvement of a P-gp efflux mechanism of BNP transport at the BBB. [3H]BNP was eliminated with an apparent elimination half-life of 27.5 min after microinjection into the parietal cortex area 2 regions of the rat brain. The apparent efflux clearance of [3H]BNP across the BBB was 0.154 ml/min/g brain, which was calculated from the elimination rate constant (2.52 x 10- 2 min- 1) and the distribution volume in the brain (6.11 ml/g brain). The efflux transport of [3H]BNP was inhibited by range from 32 to 64% in the presence of P-gp inhibitors.

        "abstract": "Direct marketers have been managing consumer data for decades. But as technology has increased the ways consumers interact with brands, marketers are confronting the prospect of \"Big Data\" -- data sets that have grown so large and complex that they've become increasingly difficult to analyze, but offer greater rewards and competitive advantage for those who do. Big Data can be overwhelming for marketers trying to understand just who their customers really are and when they are likely to purchase a particular product says Tim Suther, chief marketing and strategy officer for the marketing and technology services firm Acxiom in Little Rock, AK. While developing tactical campaigns is absolutely important, Slavi Samardzija, EVP of marketing intelligence at the Richardson, TX-based marketing solutions provider KBM Group, says marketers should really be leveraging Big Data to drive innovation.",

In a pivotal phase III trial in patients with relapsed CLL who were not able to receive cytotoxic agents, recipients of idelalisib plus rituximab had significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, overall response and lymph node response, compared with recipients of placebo plus rituximab. In a pivotal phase II trial, idelalisib monotherapy was effective in patients with relapsed indolent NHL who were refractory to rituximab and an alkylating agent, including in the subgroups of patients with follicular lymphoma or SLL. Oral idelalisib had a generally manageable adverse event profile, although episodes of serious/fatal diarrhoea or colitis, hepatotoxicity, pneumonitis and intestinal perforation were reported.

In 2004, it was found that activated mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene were present in a subset of NSCLC and that tumors with EGFR mutations were highly sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Four phase III studies (North East Japan (NEJ) 002, West Japan Thoracic Oncology Group (WJTOG) 3405, OPTIMAL, and EUROTAC) prospectively compared TKI (gefitinib or erlotinib) with cytotoxic chemotherapy as first-line therapy in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. These studies confirmed that progression-free survival (PFS) with TKIs (as the primary endpoint) was significantly longer than that with standard chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.16-0.49) from 2009 to 2011. Although the NEJ 002 study showed identical overall survival (OS) between the arms (HR = 0.89), quality of life (QoL) was maintained much longer in patients treated with gefitinib. In conclusion, TKI should be considered as the standard first-line therapy in advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Since 2009, a new step has been introduced in the treatment algorithm for advanced NSCLC.",

These drugs, particularly anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, may induce electrolyte disorders, such as hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia. Early symptoms of magnesium deficiency can easily go unrecognized. However, hypomagnesaemia can in rare cases lead to serious clinical manifestations, including cardiac arrhythmias or convulsions. The elective tubular expression of renal EGF/EGFR explains the mechanism of this class-related drug side effect. Inhibition of the EGFR induces a mutated-like transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 6 (TRPM6) syndrome, characterized by urinary magnesium and calcium wasting. The risk of hypomagnesaemia is associated with treatment duration. It is a reversible toxicity; the recovery of magnesium serum levels is usually seen 4-6 weeks of stopping the anti-EGFR antibody. Using literature from peer-reviewed journals, this review reports the clinical trials findings and discusses the mechanisms and the treatment of hypomagnesaemia induced by anti-EGFR targeted agents.",

Several results suggest that the overexpression of either CK2 catalytic subunits or the CK2 holoenzyme contributes to cellular transformation. In a similar vein, experiments performed compromising the intracellular expression of CK2 has led to somehow contradictory results with respect to the ability of this enzyme to control survival and apoptosis. To better elucidate the role of CK2 in programmed cell death, we have depleted cells of CK2 catalytic subunits by the application of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and siRNAs techniques, respectively. Our results indicate that protein kinase CK2 is characterized by an extremely high stability that might be due to its association with other intracellular proteins, enhanced half-life or lower vulnerability towards proteolytic degradation. In addition, we show that despite the effectiveness of the methods applied in lowering CK2 kinase activity in all cells investigated, CK2 might not by itself be sufficient to trigger enhanced drug-induced apoptosis in cells.",

Despite providing similar improvements in siRNA uptake, these two formulations led to a approximately 10-fold variation in anti-EGFR siRNA activity. These data show that gene expression changes induced by DDS, separate from their ability to enhance cell uptake, determine 'apparent' siRNA potency and thus offer the possibility of tailoring delivery system-siRNA combinations for additive or synergistic effects on gene silencing.",

So, it is now a key concern to find a new drug target. Cysteine protease YopT enzyme is an important factor used by Yersinia pestis for pathogenesis in its host and it has the anti-phagocytic function of removal of C-termini lipid modification. The 3D structure of cysteine protease YopT of Yersinia pestis was determined by means of homology modeling through multiple alignments followed by intensive optimization and validation. The modeling was done by Phyre 2 and refined by ModRefiner. The obtained model was verified with structure validation programs such as PROCHECK, verify 3D and ERRAT for reliability. Interacting partners and active sites were also determined. PROCHECK analysis showed that 93% of the residues are in the most favored region, 5.9% are in the additional allowed region and 1.1% are in the generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The verify 3D value of 0.78 indicates that the environmental profile of the model is good. SOPMA is employed for calculation of the secondary structural features of cysteine protease YopT. Active site determination through CASTp proposes that this protein can be utilized as a potential drug target. However, these findings should further be confirmed by wet lab studies for a targeted therapeutic agent design against Yersinia pestis.",

        "abstract": "Since the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) as the causative agent of AIDS in the early eighties, its spread has been dramatic. Current therapeutic strategies for the inhibition of viral replication employ a combination of drugs targeted at the viral reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes. The clinical benefit of this combination therapy is considerable, although often only transient, partly due to the emergence of multiple drug-resistant viral strains. The addition of new anti-HIV drugs targeting a third step of the viral replication may help in preventing resistance development. During HIV replication, the integration of the genome into the cellular chromosome is a vital step, which is catalysed by the viral integrase. The search for antiviral compounds capable of selective inhibition of integrase during viral replication is laborious and the large-scale screening programs for integrase inhibitors have thus far led to only one series of compounds that selectively inhibit the integration step of HIV replication, the diketo acids. In this review we summarize the current knowledge about HIV-1 integrase and integrase inhibitors. We address the issue why it is so difficult to find potent and selective integrase inhibitors, suitable to be included in a therapeutic drug combination and we propose new strategies for the discovery of integration inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "For effective bioactive small molecule discovery and development into new therapeutic drug, a systematic screening and target protein identification is required. Different from the conventional screening system, herein phenotypic screening in combination with multi-omics-based target identification and validation (MOTIV) is introduced. First, phenotypic screening provides visual effect of bioactive small molecules in the cell or organism level. It is important to know the effect on the cell or organism level since small molecules affect not only a single target but the entire cellular mechanism within a cell or organism. Secondly, MOTIV provides systemic approach to discover the target protein of bioactive small molecule. With the chemical genomics and proteomics approach of target identification methods, various target protein candidates are identified. Then network analysis and validations of these candidates result in identifying the biologically relevant target protein and cellular mechanism. Overall, the combination of phenotypic screening and MOTIV will provide an effective approach to discover new bioactive small molecules and their target protein and mechanism identification. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, tumors are more than insular masses of proliferating cancer cells. Instead they are complex tissues composed of multiple distinct cell types that participate in homotypic and heterotypic interactions and depend upon each other for their growth.

        "abstract": "Antiepileptic therapy is aimed at the suppression of pathological neuronal synchronization. The drug targets of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are mostly voltage-gated ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors. In about 30% of epilepsy patients, however, treatment with currently available AEDs is not sufficient to prevent pathological synchronization and seizures. Two underlying cellular mechanisms for AED resistance are being discussed. First, increased expression of multidrug transporters at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may impair access of AEDs to their CNS targets (transporter hypothesis). Alternatively, a modification of the drug target may result in a loss of the AED's effects on that target (target hypothesis). Indeed, manifold changes in the molecular composition and pharmacology of known AED targets such as Na+ channels, GABA receptors, or hyperpolarization-activated ion channels have been described. Target and transporter hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and may have to be re-evaluated separately for each individual AED. For instance, a target-based resistance mechanism is probably present for carbamazepine, while at the same time this compound is not a substrate of many human multidrug transporters. Other AEDs are excellent substrates of multidrug transporters, and a target mechanism has not been described. A better understanding of the AED-specific mechanisms of pharmacoresistance is crucial for the development of new therapies. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2010.",

This rational approach to target discovery, as a prerequisite for lead discovery, ensures that new therapeutic targets fulfil a set of general criteria, as well as indication-specific, descriptive and functional ones.

DNA gyrase, an essential enzyme that introduces negative supercoils, is a clinically validated target. However, topoisomerase I (Topo I), an enzyme responsible for DNA relaxation has received less attention as an antibacterial target, probably due to the ambiguity over its essentiality in many organisms. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome harbors a single topA gene with no obvious redundancy in its function suggesting an essential role. The topA gene could be inactivated only in the presence of a complementing copy of the gene in M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, down-regulation of topA in a genetically engineered strain of M. tuberculosis resulted in loss of bacterial viability which correlated with a concomitant depletion of intracellular Topo I levels. The topA knockdown strain of M. tuberculosis failed to establish infection in a murine model of TB and was cleared from lungs in two months post infection. Phenotypic screening of a Topo I overexpression strain led to the identification of an inhibitor, thereby providing chemical validation of this target. Thus, our work confirms the attractiveness of Topo I as an anti-mycobacterial target.",

We identified one compound, PR3, that has significant parasite killing activity in vitro but dramatically reduced toxicity in host cells. We found that this parasite-specific toxicity is not due to selective targeting of the Plasmodium proteasome over the host proteasome, but instead is due to a lack of activity against one of the human proteasome subunits.

Depending on the underlying host defect, C. albicans causes a variety of infections, ranging from superficial mucocutaneous candidiasis to life-threatening disseminated infections. Both the limited spectrum of antifungal drugs currently in clinical use and the emergence of resistances make necessary the development of new effective antifungal drugs with minimal side effects; however, such a research is limited by the small number of specific target sites identified to date. The cell wall is a fungal specific dynamic structure essential to almost every aspect of the biology and pathogenicity of C. albicans. Its structure confers physical protection and shape to fungal cells, and as the most external part of the fungus, the cell wall mediates the interaction with the host, including adhesion to host tissues and modulation of the host anti-Candida immune response. Consequently, the fungal cell wall can be considered as a suitable target for development of new antifungal compounds. Therefore two distinct types of potential cell wall-related targets can be envisaged, according to their mode of action in inhibiting infection: (i) inhibition of cell wall biogenesis, which may impair cell wall integrity and thus cell viability, and (ii) modification of host-fungus interactions by inhibiting or blocking putative virulence factors, which may impair host colonization and progress of the infectious process. Antibodies specific to cell wall antigens may protect against infection by a variety of mechanisms and may evolve into save antifungal agents.",

It is very time-consuming and labor intensive as the number of phosphopeptide identifications increases greatly.

Only phosphopeptides identified from both MS2 and its corresponding MS3 were accepted for further filtering, which greatly improved the reliability in phosphopeptide identification. Before database searching, the spectra were validated for charge state and neutral loss peak intensity, and then the invalid MS2/MS3 spectra were removed, which greatly reduced the database searching time. It was found that the sensitivity was significantly improved in MS2/MS3 strategy as the number of identified phosphopeptides was 2.5 times that obtained by the conventional filter-based MS2 approach. Because of the use of the target-decoy database, the false-discovery rate (FDR) of the identified phosphopeptides could be easily determined, and it was demonstrated that the determined FDR can precisely reflect the actual FDR without any manual validation stage.",

        "abstract": "Model verification and validation (V&V) is an enabling methodology for the development of computational models that can be used to make engineering predictions with quantified confidence. Model V&V procedures are needed by government and industry to reduce the time, cost, and risk associated with full-scale test ing of products, materials, and weapon systems. Quantifying the confidence and predictive accuracy of model calculations provides the decision-maker with the information necessary for making high-consequence decisions. The development of guidelines and procedures for conducting a model V&V program are currently being defined by a broad spectrum of researchers. This report reviews the concepts involved in such a program. Model V&V is a current topic of great interest to both government and industry. In response to a ban on the production of new strategic weapons and nuclear testing, the Department of Energy (DOE) initiated the Science- Based Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP). An objective of the SSP is to maintain a high level of confidence in the safety, reliability, and performance of the existing nuclear weapons stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing. This objective has challenged the national laboratories to develop high-confidence tools and methods that can be used to provide credible models needed for stockpile certification via numerical simulation. There has been a significant increase in activity recent ly to define V&V methods and procedures. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) is working to develop fundamental concepts and terminology for V&V applied to high-level systems such as ballistic missile defense and battle management simulations. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has recently formed a Standards Committee for the development of V&V procedures for computational solid mechanics models. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) has been a proponent of model V&V for all safety-related nuclear facility design, analyses, and operations. In fact, DNFSB 2002-1 1 recommends to the DOE and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) that a V&V process be performed for all safety related software and analysis. Model verification and validation are the primary processes for quantifying and building credibility in numerical models. Verification is the process of determining that a model implementation accurately represents the developer\u2019s conceptual description of the model and its solution. Validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model. Both verification and validation are processes that accumulat e evidence of a model\u2019s correctness or accuracy for a specific scenario; thus, V&V cannot prove that a model is co rrect and accurate for all possible scenarios, but, rather, it can provide evidence that the model is sufficiently accurate for its intended use. vi Model V&V is fundamentally different from software V&V. Code developers developing computer programs perform software V&V to ensure code correctness, reliability, and robustness. In model V&V, the end product is a predictive model based on fundamental physics of the problem being solved. In all applications of practical interest, the calculations involved in obtaining solutions with the mode l require a computer code, e.g., finite element or finite difference analysis. Therefore, engineers seeking to devel op credible predictive models critically need model V&V guidelines and procedures. The expected outcome of the model V& V process is the quantified level of agreement between experimental data and model prediction, as well as the predictive accuracy of the model. This report attempts to describe the general philosophy, definitions, concepts, and processes for conducting a successful V&V program. This objective is motivated by the need for highly accurate numerical models for making predictions to support the SSP, and also by the lack of guidelines, standards and procedures for performing V&V for complex numerical models.",

        "abstract": "l-DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) is a multiply-regulated gene which encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of dopamine in humans. MicroRNAs comprise a novel class of endogenously transcribed small RNAs that can post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of various genes. Given that the mechanism of microRNA target recognition remains elusive, several genes, including DDC, have not yet been identified as microRNA targets. Nevertheless, a number of specifically designed bioinformatic algorithms provide candidate miRNAs for almost every gene, but still their results exhibit moderate accuracy and should be experimentally validated. Motivated by the above, we herein sought to discover a microRNA that regulates DDC expression. By using the current algorithms according to bibliographic recommendations we found that miR-145 could be predicted with high specificity as a candidate regulatory microRNA for DDC expression. Thus, a validation experiment followed by firstly transfecting an appropriate cell culture system with a synthetic miR-145 sequence and sequentially assessing the mRNA and protein levels of DDC via real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Our analysis revealed that miR-145 had no significant impact on protein levels of DDC but managed to dramatically downregulate its mRNA expression. Overall, the experimental and bioinformatic analysis conducted herein indicate that miR-145 has the ability to regulate DDC mRNA expression and potentially this occurs by recognizing its mRNA as a target.",

        "abstract": "In the search for new therapeutics for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis, many potential drug targets in Trypanosoma brucei have been validated by genetic means, but very few have been chemically validated. Trypanothione synthetase (TryS; EC 6.3.1.9; spermidine/glutathionylspermidine:glutathione ligase (ADP-forming)) is one such target. To identify novel inhibitors of T. brucei TryS, we developed an in vitro enzyme assay, which was amenable to high throughput screening. The subsequent screen of a diverse compound library resulted in the identification of three novel series of TryS inhibitors. Further chemical exploration resulted in leads with nanomolar potency, which displayed mixed, uncompetitive, and allosteric-type inhibition with respect to spermidine, ATP, and glutathione, respectively. Representatives of all three series inhibited growth of bloodstream T. brucei in vitro. Exposure to one of our lead compounds (DDD86243; 2 x EC(50) for 72 h) decreased intracellular trypanothione levels to <10% of wild type. In addition, there was a corresponding 5-fold increase in the precursor metabolite, glutathione, providing strong evidence that DDD86243 was acting on target to inhibit TryS. This was confirmed with wild-type, TryS single knock-out, and TryS-overexpressing cell lines showing expected changes in potency to DDD86243. Taken together, these data provide initial chemical validation of TryS as a drug target in T. brucei.",

        "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a pathogen of major global importance. Validated drug targets are required in order to develop novel therapeutics for drug-resistant strains and to shorten therapy. The Clp protease complexes provide a means for quality control of cellular proteins; the proteolytic activity of ClpP in concert with the ATPase activity of the ClpX/ClpC subunits results in degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins. Thus, the Clp system plays a major role in basic metabolism, as well as in stress responses and pathogenic mechanisms. M. tuberculosis has two ClpP proteolytic subunits. Here we demonstrate that ClpP1 is essential for viability in this organism in culture, since the gene could only be deleted from the chromosome when a second functional copy was provided. Overexpression of clpP1 had no effect on growth in aerobic culture or viability under anaerobic conditions or during nutrient starvation. In contrast, clpP2 overexpression was toxic, suggesting different roles for the two homologs. We synthesized known activators of ClpP protease activity; these acyldepsipeptides (ADEPs) were active against M. tuberculosis. ADEP activity was enhanced by the addition of efflux pump inhibitors, demonstrating that ADEPs gain access to the cell but that export occurs. Taken together, the genetic and chemical validation of ClpP as a drug target leads to new avenues for drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This was an external validation of the prognostic benefit of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) marker panel in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for 5 mTOR pathway markers was performed on tissue microarrays of patients with nonmetastatic ccRCC treated surgically at 4 centers. The markers employed were phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated-mTOR (p-mTOR), phosphorylated-S6 (p-S6), and phosphorylated 4E-binding protein-1 (p-4EBP1). Cox regression was used to correlate marker status and oncologic outcomes. Discrimination of the models was determined using area under the curve and net reclassification improvement. RESULTS: Five hundred twenty-eight patients with a median follow-up of 56.5 months were included. Expression of PI3K, PTEN, p-mTOR, p-4EBP1, and p-S6 was altered in 52%, 78%, 25%, 86%, and 30% of patients, respectively. The number of altered biomarkers predicted recurrence-free survival (RFS) in multivariate analysis adjusted for stage, grade, and lymph node status (HR, 3.20; P = .02 for patients with 4-5 altered biomarkers compared with 0-1 altered markers). A biomarker panel consisting of only 2 markers (p-S6 and p-4EBP1) independently predicted for worse RFS (HR, 4.38; P = .003 for patients with 2 altered markers compared to patients with 0 altered markers). The biomarker score increased predictive accuracy when added to the clinical Cox regression model. CONCLUSIONS: m-TOR pathway biomarkers add prognostic information in addition to standard clinicopathologic variables in ccRCC patients and may identify patients who could benefit from additional treatments or closer postoperative surveillance.",

The purposes of this study were to determine if heart rate reserve (HRreserve) is best described by aerobic capacity at peak exercise or by aerobic capacity reserve (VO2 reserve) and to develop and validate THR zones for light-intensity exercise (20%-39%VO2 reserve) in sedentary overweight and obese pregnant women. One hundred six women between 16 and 20 weeks gestation with medical clearance performed a progressive treadmill test to volitional fatigue (peak). Data from every 4th subject were used for cross-validation. Two linear regression equations were performed for each subject, then pooled to obtain mean group values (+/- SD): %HRreserve vs. %VO2 peak and %HRreserve vs. %VO2 reserve. THR zones equivalent to 20%-39%VO2 reserve were developed and validated based on the strongest relationship. %HRreserve had a stronger linear relationship with %VO2 reserve (y = 1.046x -7.561; R2 = 0.741) than %VO2 peak (y = 1.259x -28.795; R2 = 0.604). Validated THR ranges for sedentary overweight and obese pregnant women are 102-124 beats.min-1 (20-29 years of age) and 101-120 beats.min-1 (30-39 years of age), representing an exercise intensity of 20%-39%VO2 reserve as recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine for previously sedentary pregnant women. Overweight and obese women who are medically prescreened can exercise during pregnancy within our validated THR zones. The relationship between HR and VO2 remains strong, but the two are not equivalent in this population group.",

Furthermore, the semiology itself poses a problem throughout the intricate consensual relations between psychiatrists. New molecules with activity on the CNS are ever more specific as to molecular cognitive capabilities, reaching limits of individual genetic variability. Cultural mechanisms of neuronal adaptation also contribute significantly to representations and its correlation with feelings. Neuropeptides increase excitability in various different brain regions, with networks underlying optimal behaviour patterns. Therefore, the sole specification of target molecules yet does not lead directly to specific results, as insights from a systematic approach should conceal. Current validation methods generate insufficient data for discriminating successful treatable candidates. Instead of regarding the heuristics of empirically classified disease models, a new tendency to compromise scientia rationale with technical capabilities should be regarded. Some of the drugs that have obtained patents recently will be discussed in the framework of their rational and actual specificity. The molecular basis underlining function will be contrasted with an alternative approach, namely: how functional organization constrains molecular action. The categories comprising neurogenarative pathologies at one hand and the mood disorders at the other hand will be analysed separately as the procedures guiding drug design in each case seem to be different.",

        "abstract": "Oncogenesis occurs through the acquisition and selection of multiple somatic mutations--each contributing to the growth, survival and spread of the cancer. Key attributes of the malignant phenotype, such as unchecked proliferation and cell survival, can often be \"reversed\" by the selective diminution of dominant oncogenes by chemical or genetic means (e.g. beta-catenin in colorectal carcinomas; bcr-abl in chronic myelogenous leukemias (CMLs)). These observations suggest that the products of oncogenes, or of secondary genes that mediate and maintain tumor phenotypes, might be revealed through the systematic disruption of each and every gene in tumor-derived cells. Some of these genes may encode proteins amenable to therapeutic intervention, thus fueling the cancer drug discovery process. However, a functional assessment of each known or predicted gene in mammalian cells is a daunting task and represents the rate-limiting step in drug target identification and validation. In this regard, RNA interference (RNAi) by small interfering RNAs (siRNA) holds great promise as the \"tool of choice\" to mediate the selective attenuation of mammalian gene expression and protein function. Here, we review strategies by which RNAi might be used to determine the genetic alterations that contribute to malignant transformation via large-scale cell-based screens, and propose how this information can be used in conjunction with small molecule screens to identify pathways critical to cancer cell survival.",

        "abstract": "Temperature constrained cascade correlation networks (TCCCNs) are computational neural networks that configure their own architecture, train rapidly, and give reproducible prediction results. TCCCN classification models were built using the Latin-partition method for five classes of pathogenic bacteria. Neural networks are problematic in that the relationships among the inputs (i.e., mass spectra) and the outputs (i.e., the bacterial identities) are not apparent. In this study, neural network models were constructed that successfully classified the targeted bacteria and the classification model was validated using sensitivity and target transformation factor analysis (TTFA). Without validation of the classification model, it is impossible to ascertain whether the bacteria are classified by peaks in the mass spectrum that have no causal relationships with the bacteria, but instead randomly correlate with the bacterial classes. Multiple single output network models did not offer any benefits when compared to single network models that had multiple outputs. A multiple output TCCCN model achieved classification accuracies of 96 ?? 2% and exhibited improved performance over multiple single output TCCCN models. Chemical ionization mass spectra were obtained from in situ thermal hydrolysis methylation of freeze-dried bacteria. Mass spectral peaks that pertain to the neural network classification model of the pathogenic bacterial classes were obtained by sensitivity analysis. A significant number of mass spectral peaks that had high sensitivity corresponded to known biomarkers, which is the first time that the significant peaks used by a neural network model to classify mass spectra have been divulged. Furthermore, TTFA furnishes a useful visual target as to which peaks in the mass spectrum correlate with the bacterial identities. Copyright ?? 2002 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.",

We have devised a fluorescence technique to measure doses to liquid-filled compartments. Solutions containing 0.1 mM coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (CCA) with Y-90 (YA) and without Y-90 (NA) were prepared. We measured the self-absorbed dose in six spheres, three cylinders, and two shell-sphere geometries. Each shell-sphere geometry consisted of an inner sphere containing NA solution, surrounded by an outer shell containing YA solution. This enabled us to measure the self-dose to the source shell as well as the cross-dose to the target sphere. After a 24 or 48 hour exposure, the mean dose to each compartment was estimated by measurement of the induced fluorescence in the solutions. A calibration curve obtained using NA solution exposed in a Cs-137 irradiator (98.3 rads/min) for different times displayed a linear increase in fluorescence with increasing dose up to 1500 rads. The self-dose increased with sphere or cylinder size, and agreed within plusmn8.5% with values computed using a Y-90 dose point-kernel method. However, the dose delivered to the 'cold' sphere compartment from the adjacent 'hot' shell, which was a few percent of the self-dose to the hot compartment, showed a large discrepancy between measured and calculated values. CCA fluorescence dosimetry is a promising technique for verification of dose calculations",

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing has become a valuable tool for functional studies, reverse genomics, and drug discoveries. One major challenge of using RNAi is to identify the most effective short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) sites of a given gene. Although several published bioinformatic prediction models have proven useful, the process to select and validate optimal siRNA sites for a given gene remains empirical and laborious. Here, we developed a fluorescence-based selection system using a retroviral vector backbone, namely pSOS, which was based on the premise that candidate siRNAs would knockdown the chimeric transcript between GFP and target gene. The expression of siRNA was driven by the opposing convergent H1 and U6 promoters. This configuration simplifies the cloning of duplex siRNA oligonucleotide cassettes. We demonstrated that GFP signal reduction was closely correlated with siRNA knockdown efficiency of human ??-catenin, as well as with the inhibition of ??-catenin/Tcf4 signaling activity. The pSOS should not only facilitate the selection and validation of candidate siRNA sites, but also provide efficient delivery tools of siRNAs via viral vectors in mammalian cells. Thus, the pSOS system represents an efficient and user-friendly strategy to select and validate siRNA target sites. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Moreover, the potential possibility of drug-target prediction based on these properties is discussed. All proteins in the interaction network were ranked by their topological properties.

Understanding the expanding pool of potential miRNA targets has been hindered by the lack of tools for predicting target sites within these RNAs. Here, the principles for developing computational algorithms for identifying putative miRNA target sites outside of mRNA are discussed. Laboratory techniques for validating computational miRNA target predictions are described.",

        "abstract": "Inhibition of gene expression with antisense oligonucleotides or RNA interference (RNAi) mediated gene silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA) has tremendous potential to silence the expression of disease-causing genes in the clinic. A major hurdle to their widespread clinical use is the safe and efficient delivery to target cells in vivo. Delivery via the oral route is considered the holy grail for small molecule and macromolecular drug delivery as it has the advantages of ease of administration, increased patient compliance, and cost-effectiveness. However, the harsh biological milieu of the acidic stomach and enzyme-rich gastrointestinal tract make efficient delivery of oligonucleotides and siRNA via the oral route difficult. Nonetheless, the first studies on the oral delivery of siRNA in animals and antisense oligonucleotides in humans suggest that significant oral delivery of these nucleic acids can be achieved across the gut wall. This can occur either by encapsulating siRNA within biodegradable particles that protect them from degradation and target them to M cells in intestinal Peyer's patches or by using chemically stabilized antisense oligonucleotides together with a penetration enhancer. This article reviews these studies as they mark important advances in the delivery of gene silencing nucleic acids and have heralded a new wave of enthusiasm that might lead to a significant expansion of the therapeutic options available for gene silencing drugs in the clinic.",

To fully exploit such significantly higher mass accuracy, however, appropriate data analysis methods are required. Here, we present a new target-decoy strategy, called Target-Decoy with Mass Binning, utilizing high mass accuracy for peptide identification validation, which remains a challenging problem in MS-based proteomics.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In many eukaryotes, microRNAs (miRNAs) bind to complementary sites in the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and regulate their expression at the stage of translation. Recent studies have revealed that many miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved; however, the evolution of their target genes has yet to be systematically characterized. We sought to elucidate a set of conserved miRNA/target-gene pairs and to analyse the mechanism underlying miRNA-mediated gene regulation in the early stage of bilaterian evolution.\\n\\nRESULTS: Initially, we extracted five evolutionarily conserved miRNAs (let-7, miR-1, miR-124, miR-125/lin-4, and miR-34) among five diverse bilaterian animals. Subsequently, we designed a procedure to predict evolutionarily conserved miRNA/target-gene pairs by introducing orthologous gene information. As a result, we extracted 31 orthologous miRNA/target-gene pairs that were conserved among at least four diverse bilaterian animals; the prediction set showed prominent enrichment of orthologous miRNA/target-gene pairs that were verified experimentally. Approximately 84% of the target genes were regulated by three miRNAs (let-7, miR-1, and miR-124) and their function was classified mainly into the following categories: development, muscle formation, cell adhesion, and gene regulation. We used a reporter gene assay to experimentally verify the downregulation of six candidate pairs (out of six tested pairs) in HeLa cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The application of our new method enables the identification of 31 miRNA/target-gene pairs that were expected to have been regulated from the era of the common bilaterian ancestor. The downregulation of all six candidate pairs suggests that orthologous information contributed to the elucidation of the primordial set of genes that has been regulated by miRNAs; it was also an efficient tool for the elimination of false positives from the predicted candidates. In conclusion, our study identified potentially important miRNA-target pairs that were evolutionarily conserved throughout diverse bilaterian animals and that may provide new insights into early-stage miRNA functions.",

Purpose: We sought to investigate retargeting of adenovirus via E-selectin as a viable pathway of infection in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). METHODS: E1, E3-deleted Ad5 expressing cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV IE) promoter-driven luciferase (Adluc) was coated with an amino-reactive multivalent hydrophilic polymer based on poly [N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] to generate pHPMA-adenovirus (pcAdluc). This was then retargeted by covalent attachment of a mouse antihuman E-selectin monoclonal antibody (MHES mAb), purified from the H18/7 hybridoma cell line (MHESpcAdluc). RESULTS: MHESpcAdluc was efficiently taken up into HUVECs, generating a high level of transduction in TNF-\u03b1-treated E-selectin positive cells but not in untreated receptor-negative cells. Specific retargeting of MHESpcAdluc was demonstrated through reduced transduction of stimulated HUVEC when incubated in the presence of free E-selectin antibodies. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that E-selectin could be a valuable target for gene transfer strategies internalizing polymer-coated modified adenovirus particles through a viable receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway, generating adequate levels of transgene expression per virus genome copy without compromising the specific activity of the parental virus.",

        "abstract": "Hsp90 chaperone has been identified as an attractive pharmacological target to combat cancer. However, some metastatic tumors either fail to respond to Hsp90 inhibition or show recovery necessitating irreversible therapeutic strategies. In response to this enforced senescence has been proposed as an alternate strategy. Here, we demonstrate that inhibiting Hsp90 with 17AAG sensitizes human neuroblastoma to DNA damage response mediated cellular senescence. Among individual and combination drug treatments, 17AAG pre-treatment followed by doxorubicin treatment exhibited senescence-like characteristics such as increased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, cell cycle arrest, SA-\u03b2-gal staining and the perpetual increase in SAHF. Doxorubicin induced senescence signaling was mediated by p53-p21(CIP/WAF-1) and was accelerated in the absence of functional Hsp90. Sustained p16(INK4a) and H3K4me3 expressions correlating with unaffected telomerase activation annulled replicative senescence and appraised stress induced senescence. Despite increases in [(ROS)i] and [(Ca(2+))i], a concomitant increase in cellular antioxidant defense system suggested oxidation independent senescence activation. Sustained activation of survival (Akt) and proliferative (ERK1/2) kinases fosters robustness of cells. Invigorating senescent cells with growth factor or snooping with mTOR or PI3 kinase inhibitors compromised cell survival but not senescence. Intriguingly, senescence-associated secretory factors from the senescence cells manifested established senescence in neuroblastoma, which offers clinical advantage to our approach. Our study discusses tumor selective functions of Hsp90 and discusses irrefutable strategies of Hsp90 inhibition in anticancer treatments.",

METHODS: Tf modified DQAsomes (Tf-DQAsomes) were prepared by incubating preformed paclitaxel loaded DQAsomes with Tf in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride. Developed systems were characterized for size and size distribution, entrapment efficiency, and in vitro drug release. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry were performed to evaluate cellular uptake of the carriers. Antitumor activity was determined using HeLa cells. In vivo therapeutic efficacy was determined in xenograft mouse model. KEY FINDINGS: Uptake studies demonstrated that Tf-DQAsomes result in higher fluorescence intensity to the cancer cells as compared to plain DQAsomes. Tf-DQAsomes exhibited better antitumor activity in vitro as compared to plain DQAsomes and paclitaxel solution. In vivo biodistribution study revealed that paclitaxel concentration in the tumor was much higher in the case of Tf-DQAsomes as compared to plain DQAsomes and paclitaxel solution; however in other organs it was much lower than the latter two formulations. Tf-DQAsomes exhibited significant antitumor activity in the mouse xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: The finding demonstrated that Tf conjugated DQAsomes can effectively be delivered to the tumor in vivo and exhibit significant antitumor activity.",

While brain endothelial cells play an essential role as structural and functional components of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), increased BBB breakdown is thought to be linked to neuroinflammation. Chemopreventive mechanisms targeting both MMPs and COX-2 however remain poorly investigated. In this study, we evaluated the pharmacological targeting of Sirt1 by the diet-derived and antiinflammatory polyphenol resveratrol. Total RNA, cell lysates, and conditioned culture media from human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) were analyzed using qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and zymography respectively. Tissue scan microarray analysis of grade I-IV brain tumours cDNA revealed increased gene expression of Sirt-1 from grade I-III but surprisingly not in grade IV brain tumours. HBMEC were treated with a combination of resveratrol and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a carcinogen known to increase MMP-9 and COX-2 through NF-\u03baB. We found that resveratrol efficiently reversed the PMA-induced MMP-9 secretion and COX-2 expression. Gene silencing of Sirt1, a critical modulator of angiogenesis and putative target of resveratrol, did not lead to significant reversal of MMP-9 and COX-2 inhibition. Decreased resveratrol inhibitory potential of carcinogen-induced I\u03baB phosphorylation in siSirt1-transfected HBMEC was however observed. Our results suggest that resveratrol may prevent BBB disruption during neuroinflammation by inhibiting MMP-9 and COX-2 and act as a pharmacological NF-\u03baB signal transduction inhibitor independent of Sirt1.",

In order to develop an effective vaccine against Cryptococcus neoformans, the cytosolic proteins (Cp) of the pathogen have been used as an antigen in combination with different formulations. In the present study, we have demonstrated that Cp encapsulated poly-lactide co-glycolide (PLGA) microsphere further co-encapsulated into the biocompatible fibrin cross-linked plasma beads (Fib-PLGA-Cp) mediated cytosolic delivery elicited strong immune response in the BALB/c mice. In contrast, other formulations of Cp failed to impart significant level of protection. The immune response, involved with Fib-PLGA-Cp protection, appear to interact with the target cells by both endocytosis as well as membrane fusion mode, thus helping in the activation of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells. Analysis of cytokine profiles in immunized animals revealed that the protective response was associated with the Th1/Th2 polarization in favor of type-1 cytokine [interferons (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-2] cells. Furthermore, vaccination with Fib-PLGA-Cp elicited high immunoglobulin (Ig) G(l) and IgG(2a) isotype response; successfully cleared fungal burden in vital organs and also increased the survival rate of immunized animals. Altogether the present study is a clear indicative of the possible use of fibrin microsphere-based targeted delivery of cytosolic proteins to induce protective immune responses against experimental murine cryptococcosis.",

In order to determine the involvement of phospholipase A2 in the action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the crystal structure of the complex formed between phospholipase A2 and aspirin has been determined at 1.9 angstroms resolution. The structure contains 915 protein atoms, 1 calcium ion, 13 atoms of aspirin and 105 water molecules. The observed electron density of the aspirin molecule in the structure was of very high quality thus allowing the precise determination of its atomic coordinates leading to the clear description of its interactions with the enzyme. The structure of the complex clearly shows that aspirin is literally embedded in the hydrophobic environment of PLA2. It is so placed in the substrate binding channel that it forms several important attractive interactions with calcium ion, His 48 and Asp 49. Thus, the structure of the complex clearly shows that aspirin occupies a favourable place in the specific binding site of PLA2. The binding studies have shown that acetyl salicylate (aspirin) binds to PLA2 enzyme specifically with a dissociation constant of 6.4 x 10(-6) M.

Purpose: This communication resets the extent to which basic criteria influence the brain delivery, through commanding examples. Further, it appraises the intervention of ABC transporters in BBB transportation, with a special emphasis on P-glycoprotein; and also brings forth the successful CNS transportation of therapeutics achieved through chimeric peptide technology. As a right path to travel, it flickers light on the novel CNS molecular drug targets/ biomarkers which are specially expressed by diseased cells. Conclusion: Screening for right molecular target is of great importance for cost and time effective drug discovery process. The principle of chimeric peptide technology should be applied for CNS targeting; and every diseased cell should be screened for its biomarker. Thanks to glycan/lectin arrays technique which scans expression pattern of transporter and their possible ligands, and paves way for a new dimensional research.",

        "abstract": "So far, the computational identification of transcription factor binding sites is hampered by the complexity of vertebrate genomes. Here we present an in silico procedure to predict target sites of a transcription factor in complex genomes using its binding site. In a first step sequence, comparison of closely related genomes identifies the binding sites in conserved cis-regulatory regions (phylogenetic footprinting). Subsequently, more remote genomes are introduced into the comparison to identify highly conserved and therefore putatively functional binding sites (phylogenetic filtering). When applied to the binding site of atonal homolog 5 (Ath5 or ATOH7), this procedure efficiently filters evolutionarily conserved binding sites out of more than 300,000 instances in a vertebrate genome. We validate a selection of the linked target genes by showing coexpression with and transcriptional regulation by Ath5. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates the occupancy of the target gene promoters by Ath5. Thus, our procedure, applied to whole genomes, is a fast and predictive tool to in silico filter the target genes of a given transcription factor with defined binding site.",

The ultimate proof for drug-target validation requires the introduction of mutations that confer resistance in cells, an approach that is not straightforward in mammalian cells.

Selinexor is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of exportin-1 (CRM1/XPO1) with potent anticancer activity and is currently under evaluation in human clinical trials. Mutant cells were resistant to the induction of cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of XPO1 function, including direct binding of the drug to XPO1. These results validate XPO1 as the prime target of selinexor in cells and identify the selectivity of this drug toward the cysteine 528 residue of XPO1.

Using a Method-of-Moments (MoM) code, we earlier simulated such returned echoes from two targets for several moisture contents and burial depths in a soil with known electric properties. We also showed that they could then be all translated to equivalent echoes from the target at some selected standardized depth and soil moisture with adequate accuracy. The signature template of each target is here computed using a time-frequency distribution of the returned echo when the target is buried at a selected depth in the soil with selected moisture content. For any returned echo the relative difference can be computed between the target signature and a selected template signature. Using our target translation method (TTM) that signature difference can then be used as a cost function to be minimized. This is done by adjusting the depth and moisture content. now taken to be unknown parameters, using the differential evolution method (DEM). The template that gives the smallest value of the minimized cost function for a chosen returned echo is here taken to signify the classification. As it turns out, any choice of returned waveform results in correct classification of the two targets used here. Moreover, when the proper template is used, the values of the depth and moisture parameters that give the minimum cost function are good predictions of the actual target depth and soil moisture content.",

In a previous study, we analyzed the SNPs in a group of predicted MIR137 target genes and detected genome-wide significant association of schizophrenia with rs2944829 in the CALN1 gene. However, no experimental evidence for CALN1 and MIR137 interaction has yet been reported. In this study, we first computationally analyzed the putative miR-137 target site on CALN1 and predicted that miR-137 binds CALN1 at nucleotide (nt) position 236-242 in the 3'UTR. Then we assayed gene expression by transfecting miR-137 mimics into HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cell lines. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of CALN1 significantly decreased in cells co-transfected with miR-137 mimics compared to cells transfected with the blank control (P=.0046 in HEK293 cell lines, P=.038 in SH-SY5Y cells lines). Finally, we co-transfected different combinations of miRNA mimics and either wild type CALN1 3'UTR or mutant 3'UTR reporters into HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cell lines and assessed the specificity of miRNA binding using a luciferase reporter assay. The transfection of miR-137 mimics corresponded with a considerable reduction of luciferase activity on vectors carrying the target fragment (P=1.17\u00d710<sup>-5</sup>, 68% reduction in HEK293 cell line, and P=5.09\u00d710<sup>-6</sup>, 32% reduction in SH-SY5Y cell line).

However, a comprehensive and systematic approach to constructing de novo disease-specific gene networks for PPARgamma is lacking, especially one that includes PPARgamma target genes containing either DR1 or DR2 site within their promoter region. Here, we computationally identified 1154 PPARgamma direct target genes and constructed the PPARgamma disease gene network, which revealed 138 PPARgamma target genes that are associated with 65 unique diseases. The network shows that PPARgamma target genes are highly associated with cancer and neurological diseases. Thirty-eight PPARgamma direct target genes were found to be involved in prostate cancer and two key (hub) PPARgamma direct target genes, PRKCZ and PGK1, were experimentally validated to be repressed upon PPARgamma activation by its natural ligand, 15d-PGJ(2) in three prostrate cancer cell lines. We proposed that PRKCZ and PGK1 could be novel therapeutic targets for prostate cancer.

        "abstract": "This study tested the \"Target Method\" for adjusting ventilation systems. The Target Method is based on target hood static pressures (SPh(target)) computed in a manner designed to take into account the estimated effects of dampers on the fan, the order of damper adjustments, and the ratio of the prebalancing branch airflows to their goals. It is aimed at achieving a desired relative distribution of airflows even if the fan output is far from ideal. The method assumes the fan output will be adjusted after the dampers are adjusted. The method is expected to produce lower fan pressure requirements than some commonly used methods. The method was tested on a working seven-branch, full-sized exhaust ventilation system in the West Virginia University Exposure Assessment Laboratory. Two radically different target distributions were tested with two replications apiece. Both target distributions of airflows were substantially different from the initial distribution, providing a high degree of challenge to the methodology. For each distribution, SPh(target) values were computed for the first round of adjustments. Each damper was adjusted until the observed value of the hood static pressure was nearly equal to that damper's computed SPh(target) value for that distribution. Each of the other branch dampers was adjusted similarly in turn. After the first round of adjustments, the median ratio of SPh to SPh(target) provided the targets for the partial second round of adjustments. Twenty-point Pitot traverses were used to determine the airflow in each branch duct both before and after employing the adjustment method, providing the basis to determine the success in reaching each of the two desired distributions. The percentage of excess airflow (assuming ideal adjustment of the fan speed) was below 2.2% for all experimental trials. An unpublished study by Vivek Balasubramanian showed that excess airflow was 4.8% to 8.5% in the same experimental system after two full rounds of adjustment using the customary Target Method. Under poor measurement conditions, the greater uncertainty of pressure measurements would likely produce somewhat higher excess airflows.",

Often image analysis is done via constructing feature vectors from the original two-dimensional image. In this effort, a genetic algorithm is used to evolve a group of linear filters for constructing these feature vectors. Training is performed on collections of target chips and non-target or clutter chips drawn from FLIR image datasets. The evolved filters produce multi-dimensional feature vectors from each sample. First the fitness function for the genetic algorithm rewards maximal separation of target from non-target vectors measured by clustering the two sets and applying a vector space norm. Next, the entire method is adapted to supply feature vectors to a support vector machine classifier (SVM) in order to optimize the SVM's performance, i.e. the genetic algorithm's fitness function rewards effective SVM class distinction. Finally, supplemental features are incorporated into the system, resulting in an improved, hybrid classifier.

Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that the prepared SLNs were of spherical shape. Drug retarding efficiency of the lipid (GPS) was better in pH 7.4 compared with pH 3.5. The release profile showed tendency to follow Higuchi diffusion pattern in both the media.

        "abstract": "Our overall research goal is to advance the safety and effectiveness of acute ischemic stroke therapy by improving the benefit/risk ratio of thrombolysis and hence, the long-term outcome of acute ischemic stroke victims. Our approach is the development of a novel tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) delivery system based on t-PA-loaded magnetic nano- and microcarriers guided directly to the site of vascular occlusion by external magnetic fields. Such a t-PA delivery system would conveniently combine the advantages of both intravenous (systemic) and intraarterial (catheter-facilitated) thrombolysis: non-invasiveness - the magnetic t-PA carriers can be injected intravenously and targeted, as drug delivery is magnetically guided to and t-PA focally released at and within the vascular clot to induce lysis. The focus of our discussion are the two necessary, fundamental and interrelated bioengineering steps: the research and development of well-characterized, biocompatible, functionally active and t-PA-loaded (encapsulated) magnetic nano- and microcarriers able to induce effective thrombolysis, and the design of magnetic guidance systems for targeted tPA-delivery allowing also the triggered release of the thrombolytic agent at the clot site. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrated magnetic trapping of blood borne magnetic nano- and microcarriers from human large vessels, especially arteries. Then, some preliminary experiments using primate models (monkeys) were done to identify successful in vivo sequestration of magnetic carriers in large and smaller arterial branches after arterial upstream and systemic venous injection. Histology (hematoxylin-eosin stain) verified intraarterial carrier concentration (identified as black carrier agglomerates on H and E staining) at the arterial region above the surface magnet. The results revealed the feasibility of magnetic drug-targeting at arteries and solidified the proposed t-PA delivery system.",

        "abstract": "Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is still a major cause of the eventual failure of chemotherapy in cancer treatment. Different approaches have been taken to render these cells drug sensitive. Here, we attempted sensitizing drug-resistant cells from within, using a translocating immune conjugate approach. To that effect, a monoclonal antibody, C219, directed against the intracellular ATP-binding site of the membrane-anchored MDR transporter ABCB1 [P-glycoprotein (P-gp), MDR1], was conjugated to human immunodeficiency virus [HIV(37-72)Tat] translocator peptide through a disulfide bridge. Fluorescence-labelled IgG-Tat conjugates accumulated in drug resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells within less than 20 min. Preincubation with C219-S-S-(37-72)Tat conjugate augmented calcein accumulation in drug-resistant CHO and mouse lymphoma cells, indicating reduction in ABCB1 transporter activity. A thioether conjugate C219-S-(37-72)Tat was ineffective, as were disulfide and thioether conjugates of an irrelevant antibody. Furthermore, in the presence of C219-S-S-(37-72)Tat, drug resistant cells were sensitized to colchicine and doxorubicin. Taken together, these findings demonstrate, as proof of principle, a novel approach for the reversal of MDR from within cells, by delivery of translocating immune conjugates as sensitizing agents towards chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Light is an ideal general triggered signal, which occurs as a result of its non-invasive nature, desirable controllability and high spatial resolution. However, due to its low penetrability and ability to harm tissues, the use of ultraviolet (UV) light for triggered nanocarrier release in in vivo applications has been limited. Compared with UV light, near-infrared (NIR) light deeply penetrates tissues and is less damaging to cells. In this study, we have devised and tested a strategy for site-specific delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cancer cells by using liposomes bearing a photolabile-caged peptide (PCP). The positive charges of the lysine residues on the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) were temporarily caged by the NIR two-photon excitation-responsive protective groups (PG), thereby forming a PCP. Once illuminated by NIR light at tumor tissues, these PGs were cleaved; the positively charged CPP regained its activity and facilitated rapid intracellular delivery of the liposomes into cancer cells. The PCP was connected with 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine via a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer to prepare the modified liposomes (PCP-LP). Subsequent research demonstrated that the application of the PCP modifications may provide an approach for the selectively targeted delivery of siRNA.

Of 139 HIV/AIDS patients submitted to the highly active antiretroviral therapy, 12.2% failed virologically. The significant associated factors related to unresponsiveness to the lentiviral treatment were: patients' place of origin (OR = 3.28; IC95% = 1.0-9.73; P = 0.032) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (RR = 2.90; IC95% = 1.19-7.02; P = 0.019). In the logistic regression analysis, the remaining variables in the model were: patients' birthplace (OR = 3.28; IC95% = 1.10-9.73; P = 0.032) and tuberculosis comorbidity (OR = 3.82; IC95% = 1.19-12.22; P = 0.024). The patients enrolled in this survey had an 88.0% therapeutic success rate for the maximum period of one year of treatment, predicting that T CD4(+) low values and elevated viral loads at pretreatment should be particularly considered in tuberculosis coinfection, besides the availability of new antiretroviral drugs displaying optimal activity both in viral suppression and immunological reconstitution.",

This encourages for the development of formulation for long term drug retention in the joint through intra-articular (i. a.) administration. In this study, genipin cross-linked gelatin microspheres of flurbiprofen were prepared for i. a. delivery. The microspheres were prepared using emulsification-homogenization-cross-linking method by changing the experimental variables such as concentration of cross-linker, cross-linking time and cross-linking temperature. The microspheres showed drug entrapment up to 76.19% with a mean particle size range of 5.91-8.19 microm. The degree of cross-linking and water-soluble fraction were 8.27-59.33% and 12.29-81.23%, respectively. SEM confirmed smooth surface and spherical shape of the microspheres. FTIR and (13)C-NMR confirmed cross-linking of gelatin by genipin. No chemical change in encapsulated drug was observed by FTIR and TGA. DSC and XRD indicated the molecular dispersion of drug within microspheres. Optimized microspheres could prolong the drug release for more than 108 h with anomalous transport. Histopathology confirmed the biocompatibility of microspheres in the rat (Wistar) knee joint. After 96 h of i. a. injection, significant higher amount (42.56%) of administered drug in cross-linked microspheres was recovered than uncross-linked microspheres (8.27%) confirming better drug retention efficiency (p < 0.01).",

As interactions with ECM elements and cognate receptors at the site of an IM injection define the local biology of VEGF and previous studies have only focused on systemic distribution measurements, we have established a method to monitor the local VEGF distribution and fate. Fluorescent-labeled VEGF was prepared that bound to ECM and activated a cognate receptor similarly to VEGF. Beginning by 2 h and becoming complete by 12 h following injection, fluorescence microscopy demonstrated the transition of labeled VEGF from an initial extensive interaction with ECM components to a focused labeling of vascular endothelial cells. Biochemical characterization verified the association of VEGF with ECM components and modification of endothelial cell function associated with vascular permeability changes known to accompany VEGF actions. Our data provide information concerning temporal and spatial VEGF fate and actions at the site of an IM injection that can help guide decisions regarding the identification of acceptable formulation strategies.",

Cells can be transfected by using surface-bound PEI, as well as by PEI/DNA microparticles. In the present experiments we extended these observations by preparing microspheres with covalently attached PEI. Blends of poly(epsilon-CBZ-L-lysine) mixed with poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) were formed into microspheres using a double-emulsification/solvent evaporation procedure. CBZ (carbobenzoxy) groups on the surface of microspheres were removed by Li(0) /liquid ammonia reduction. Surface amino groups were used for covalent attachment of PEI and other molecules. Silica microspheres with bonded-phase PEI were also used. Microspheres were mixed with plasmid DNA encoding green fluorescent protein and added to cultured cells. PEI-coated microspheres transfected cultured Caco cells and MH-S alveolar macrophages. Expression of the transfected DNA increased over several days. MH-S cells phagocytosed PEI-coated silica microspheres, which were shown to reside in an acidic subcellular compartment. This was demonstrated by conjugating a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye (seminaphthofluorescein, SNAFL) to the microsphere surface. Transfection of MH-S cells was increased when plasmid DNA was complexed with histone on the surface of the microspheres. CONCLUSION: PEI-coated microspheres have potential as a DNA delivery device with advantages of the unique properties of PEI and ease of surface chemical modification.",

Antipsychotic drugs have revolutionised the therapy and management of schizophrenia. However, patient compliance rates are notoriously poor due to the nature of the disease and troublesome side-effects, and are major causes of symptom recurrence. Although some new antipsychotic agents have been marketed to offer broader efficacy with much reduced side-effect profiles, the drug delivery systems for antipsychotics are still in the stage of conventional dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules and solutions, and need to be dosed at the frequency of 2-4 times daily. Doubtless. novel drug delivery systems, such as sustained and controlled release systems, will be useful for antipsychotics. They should reduce the frequency of dosing. enhance drug bioavailability and improve patient compliance. In this article, the specificity and characterisation of schizophrenia and pathophysiology. drug therapy. and the development and future prospects of neuroleptic drug delivery systems are reviewed.",

The liposomised form of DEC, when used at sub-optimal dose of 25 mg/kg body weight, successfully eliminated filarial parasite from systemic circulation in animals inflicted with B. malayi infection. However, the formulation was effective upto 60 days post infection only, followed by recurrence of the infection. In contrast, the co-administration of liposomal formulation of DEC along with an immunomodulator tuftsin was found to be competent enough to suppress microfilarial stage of parasite till 90 days post treatment. Interestingly, tuftsin bearing DEC liposomes were found to be effective against adult parasite as well.",

Although neovascularisation via angiogenesis leads to a subsequent rapid growth of the tumour mass, it provides the most reliable route by which neoplastic cells may be reached by cytotoxics. In addition, for a majority of tumours, the lesion's vasculature is more permeable and tortuous than that of the surrounding healthy host tissue. Such deviation potentiates selective delivery of drugs to be achieved. This review examines, from various viewpoints, the area of tumour angiogenesis and vascularisation, currently one of the most fertile and active fields of cancer research.",

Polymer coating of adenovirus is known to increase its plasma circulation kinetics, affording the possibility of active and passive targeting to tumours. Here we show that polymer-coating adenovirus (pc-virus) abrogates its normal infectivity in vitro and also in liver following intravenous injection. The coated virus accumulates within solid subcutaneous AB22 mesothelioma tumours 40-times more than unmodified virus, and mediates higher levels of transgene expression within tumours. This is the first demonstration of passive tumour targeting of polymer-coated adenoviruses administered by intravenous injection, and also the first time pc-virus has been shown to be infectious following passive targeting to tumours in vivo. This technology provides an interesting option for delivery of therapeutic viruses to disseminated tumour masses by intravenous injection.",

Male Balb-c mice were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with zaprinast (3 and 10 mg/kg), rolipram (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg), or physiological saline. Zaprinast (10 mg/kg) significantly increased cued/non-cued food eaten compared to control group, while rolipram had a partial effect on retention trial of STFP test. Zaprinast (10 mg/kg) and rolipram (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) significantly increased ratio index (RI) compared to control group in retention trial of NOR test. There was no significant effect of zaprinast and rolipram on total distance moved, speed, and center zone duration in open field test. Results of this study revealed that both zaprinast and rolipram enhanced visual memory in NOR test, however zaprinast exerted a significant memory-enhancing effect compared to rolipram in STFP test in mice.",

Despite major advances in understanding mtDNA defects at the genetic and biochemical level, there is no satisfactory treatment for the vast majority of patients available. Objective limitations of conventional biochemical treatment for patients with defects of mtDNA warrant the exploration of gene therapeutic approaches. However, mitochondrial gene therapy has been elusive, due to the lack of any mitochondria-specific transfection vector. We review here the current state of the development of mitochondrial DNA delivery systems.

In contrast, none of the animals survived in the control groups, which were treated with free or liposomised Amp B (without tuftsin). Further, the effect of liposomised tuftsin, on T-cell proliferation as well as antibody production reveals that tuftsin elicits strong immunopotentiating effects as well. The pretreatment with liposomised tuftsin prior to challenging the animals with drug resistant C. albicans infection has also been effective and shows an extra edge in prophylactic perspectives.",

The present studies used the RI7-217 rat monoclonal antibody to the mouse transferrin receptor as a BBB drug targeting vector for the delivery to brain of A beta1-40 radiolabeled with either 125-Iodine or 111-Indium. The A beta peptide radiopharmaceutical is conjugated to the RI7 MAb using avidin biotin technology, wherein the A beta1-40 peptide radiopharmaceutical is monobiotinylated (bio) and bound to a conjugate of the RI7 MAb and streptavidin (SA). The [125 I]-bio-A beta1-40 or the [111 In]-bio-A beta1-40 either free or bound to the RI7/SA conjugate was injected intravenously into anesthetized adult mice and plasma pharmacokinetics and organ uptake were measured over the next 60 minutes. The A beta1-40 peptide radiopharmaceutical radiolabeled with 111-Indium was the preferred formulation, compared to peptide labeled with 125-Iodine, because there was a greater metabolic stability and reduced artifactual organ uptake of metabolites associated with the use of the 111-Indium nuclide. However, biotinylated A beta1-40 peptide radiopharmaceuticals conjugated to the RI7/SA brain drug targeting system were metabolically unstable in mice in vivo owing to active biotinidase activity. Future work involving brain drug targeting in mice that utilizes avidin biotin technology will need to incorporate biotin analogues that are resistant to biotinidase.",

This approach, referred to as the \"fully synthetic pancreas\", envisions closed-loop insulin therapy. The strategies for incorporating glucose sensing into formulations can be broadly categorized into three subsets: enzymatic sensing, natural glucose-binding proteins and synthetic molecular recognition. Here, we highlight some examples of each of these approaches. The challenges remaining en route to the realization of closed-loop insulin therapy are substantial, and include improved response time, more authentic fidelity in glycemic control, improved biocompatibility for delivery materials and assurance of both safety and efficacy. The ubiquitous existence of glucose, combined with the unstable and toxic properties of insulin, further compound efforts towards the generation of a fully synthetic pancreas. However, given the growing incidence of both type-1 and type-2 diabetes, there is significant potential impact from the realization of such an approach on improving therapeutic management of the disease.",

Toxicity remains the major obstacle for the most potent drugs already known in the therapy of leishmaniasis. Thus, new drugs and new delivery systems are sought. By using different vesicular delivery modes e.g. liposomes, niosomes, microspheres and nanoparticles, attempts have been made to deliver an indigenous antileishmanial compound, quercetin, to treat experimental leishmaniasis in the hamster model so as to increase its efficacy as well as to reduce the toxicity. At equivalent quercetin concentration, the nanocapsulated quercetin was found to be the most potent in reducing the parasite burden in the spleen as well as in reducing hepatotoxcity and renaltoxicity compared to free drug or drug in other vesicular forms. An inverse relationship between the efficacy and the size of the vesicles was established. Such a drug vehicle formulation especially in the nanocapsulated form may be considered for clinical trials.",

However, in most patients, the disease ultimately relapses and become resistant to rituximab. To overcome the limitation, there is still a need to find novel strategy for improving therapeutic efficacy.  Objective: To construct genetically engineered antibody anti-CD19(Fab)-LDM, and verify the anticancer activity targeted toward B-lymphoma.  Methods: The anticancer activity of anti-CD19(Fab)-LDM in vitro and in vivo was examined. In vitro, the binding activity and internalization of anti-CD19(Fab)-LDP were measured. Using comet assay and apoptosis, the cytotoxicity of energized fusion proteins was observed. From in vivo experiments, targeting of therapeutic effect and anticancer efficacy bythe fusion protein was verified.  Results: Data showed that anti-CD19(Fab)-LDM does not only binding the cell surface but is also internalized into the cell. The energized fusion proteins anti-CD19(Fab)-LDM can induce DNA damage. Furthermore, significant in vivo therapeutic efficacy was observed.  Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that the genetically engineered antibody anti-CD19(Fab)-LDM exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity compared to LDM alone. One of the most powerful advantages of anti-CD19(Fab)-LDM, however, is that it can be internalized within the cells and carry out cytotoxic effects. Therefore, anti-CD19(Fab)-LDM may be as a useful targeted therapy for B-cell lymphoma.",

        "abstract": "Abstract We report on the synthesis of bifunctional mitoxantrone (MTX)-grafted magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) modified by dopamine-polyethylene glycol-folic acid (DPA-PEG-FA) for targeted imaging and therapy of cancer. MNPs ( approximately 7-10 nm) were synthesized using the thermal decomposition reaction of Fe(acac)(3). Bromoacetyl (BrAc) terminal polyethylene glycol dopamine (DPA-PEG-BrAc) was synthesized and treated with ethylene diamine to form bifunctional PEG moiety containing dopamine at one end and amino group at the other end (i.e. DPA-PEG-NH(2)). It was then reacted with Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles (NPs) to form Fe(3)O(4)-DPA-PEG-NH(2) NPs. The activated folic acid (FA) was chemically coupled to Fe(3)O(4)-DPA-PEG-NH(2), forming Fe(3)O(4)-DPA-PEG-FA. MTX was then conjugated to Fe(3)O(4)-DPA-PEG-FA, forming Fe(3)O(4)-DPA-PEG-FA-MTX. Physicochemical characteristics of the engineered MNPs were determined. The particle size analysis and electron microscopy showed an average size of approximately 35 nm for Fe(3)O(4)-DPA-PEG-FA-MTX NPs with superparamagnetic behavior. FT-IR spectrophotometry analysis confirmed the conjugation of FA and MTX onto the MNPs. Fluorescence microscopy, cytotoxicity assay and flow cytometry analysis revealed that the engineered Fe(3)O(4)-DPA-PEG-FA-MTX NPs were able to specifically bind to and significantly inhibit the folate receptor (FR)-positive MCF-7 cells, but not the FR-negative A549 cells. Based upon these findings, we suggest the Fe(3)O(4)-DPA-PEG-FA-MTX NPs as an effective multifunctional-targeted nanomedicine toward simultaneous imaging and therapy of FR-positive cancers.",

        "abstract": "The possibility of administering insulin orally in replacement of painful subcutaneous route has been investigated over years but with varying degree of success. Nanoparticles, microparticles, hydrogel, capsule, tablet, and film patch are designed to deliver insulin orally. They are largely formulated with polymeric adhesive, protease inhibitor, insulin aggregation inhibitor, and functional excipients to induce transcellular, paracellular, Peyer's patches, or receptor-mediated transport of insulin in gastrointestinal tract. Superporous matrix, intestinal patches, and charged-coupled micromagnet microparticles are recent formulation strategies to promote oral insulin absorption. The formulation emphasizes on assembly of insulin and excipients into a physical structure which provides an element of drug targeting to maintain stability and increase bioavailability of insulin. The overview of various strategies applied in oral insulin delivery system design denotes the significance of mucoadhesiveness whereby a prolonged retention of dosage form in intestinal tract translates to cumulative insulin release and absorption, overcoming the intestinal transport capacity limit. Synthesis and use of mucoadhesive excipients, chemical modification of insulin to promote its physicochemical and biological stability for encapsulation in dosage form with prolonged retention characteristics and identification of potential insulin adjuncts are efforts needed to accelerate the speed of obtaining a functional oral insulin delivery system.",

Efficient fluorescence and activity quenching were achieved by increasing the drug-loading rate of nanoparticles. In vitro assays confirmed the reversibility of hypericin deactivation, as the hypericin fluorescence and photodynamic activity were recovered upon cell internalization.",

The changes in intensity and lambda(max) in fluorescence spectroscopy and the increase in fluorescence anisotropy upon complex formation between the oligonucleotide and the protein (PO-BSA) were used to determine the dissociation constant, Km=6.3 x 10(-8) M. The stoichiometry of the complex is mainly 1:1, although 2 PO per BSA have been detected at high PO/BSA ratios. The complexation did not protect PO against enzymatic degradation by snake venom phosphodiesterase (0.1 mg/mL). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that PO-BSA complexes showed a decreased uptake and modified pattern of intracellular distribution with a rapid nuclear accumulation (rather than vesicular localization in the cytoplasm observed for free oligonucleotide). The effect was only observed over a certain threshold of BSA concentration (higher than found in media supplemented with 10% serum). By this way, the interaction with albumin increased the antiviral activity of the oligonucleotide, tested by a plaque reduction assay in MRC-5 fibroblasts infected with human cytomegalovirus (strain RC 256) at a MOI of 0.0035. At 10 microM PO concentration, free PO decreased virus plaques to 85% of the control, while PO-BSA complexes reduced to 60%, in the same order than ISIS 2922. The phosphorotioate analogue complexed by BSA (ISIS 2922-BSA) showed the highest activity with 45% of the control plaques.",

This carrier system is made up of physiological, biodegradable and biocompatible lipid materials and surfactants and is accepted by regulatory authorities for application in different drug delivery systems. The availability of many products in the market in short span of time reveals the success story of this delivery system. Since the introduction of the first product, around 30 NLC preparations are commercially available. NLC exhibit superior advantages over other colloidal carriers viz., nanoemulsions, polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, SLN etc. and thus, have been explored to more extent in pharmaceutical technology. The whole set of unique advantages such as enhanced drug loading capacity, prevention of drug expulsion, leads to more flexibility for modulation of drug release and makes NLC versatile delivery system for various routes of administration. The present review gives insights on the definitions and characterization of NLC as colloidal carriers including the production techniques and suitable formulations. This review paper also highlights the importance of NLC in pharmaceutical applications for the various routes of drug delivery viz., topical, oral, pulmonary, ocular and parenteral administration and its future perspective as a pharmaceutical carrier.",

        "abstract": "Although the oral route of drug administration is the most acceptable way of self-medication with a high degree of patient compliance, the intestinal absorption of many drugs is severely hampered by different biological barriers. These barriers comprise of biochemical and physical components. The biochemical barrier includes enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal lumen, brush border and in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells as well as efflux transporters that pump drug molecules from inside the epithelial cell back to the gastrointestinal lumen. The physical barrier consists of the epithelial cell membranes, tight junctions and mucus layer. Different strategies have been applied to improve the absorption of drugs after oral administration, which range from chemical modification of drug molecules and formulation technologies to the targeting of receptors, transporters and specialized cells such as the gut-associated lymphoid tissues. This review focuses specifically on the targeting of receptor-mediated endocytosis, transporters and the absorption-site as methods of optimizing intestinal drug absorption. Intestinal epithelial cells express several nutrient transporters that can be targeted by modifying the drug molecule in such a way that it is recognized as a substrate. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a transport mechanism that can be targeted for instance by linking a receptor substrate to the drug molecule of interest. Many formulation strategies exist for enhancing drug absorption of which one is to deliver drugs at a specific site in the gastrointestinal tract where optimum drug absorption takes place.",

Hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma or bronchitis, ischemia, and diabetes mellitus were more prevalent in patients than in controls. The prevalence of gastric ulcer and cancer did not differ between the groups. Besides corticosteroids, many patients were also being treated with proton pump inhibitors, antidepressant drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, statins, thyroid hormones, and beta-blockers.

The combination of PLGA50:50 microspheres containing DNA-hsp65 and trehalose dimycolate (TDM) with PLGA75:25 microspheres containing recombinant hsp65 (prime-boost Me) was able to induce high levels of anti-hsp65 specific antibodies. The serum levels of these specific antibodies remained high during 90 days after vaccination, whereas the DNA Me formulation based only in DNA-hsp65 plus TDM-loaded microspheres was not able to sustain the high antibody levels during the same period. Production of IFN-gamma was significant in animals vaccinated with both formulations, while the prime-boost Me vaccinated mice sustained higher levels of this cytokine during all the evaluation period. Thus, prime-boost strategy by using biodegradable microspheres seems to be a promising strategy to stimulate long-lasting immune response.",

The aim of this study was to develop an improved formulation, to validate the formulation for long-time retention, as well as to assess radiotracer stability by novel quality control methods. Our study reports the labeling and evaluation of alginate blends-INH microspheres. The incorporation efficiency of optimized formulation was 89% w/w.

The stability study was carried out in saline and serum and it was found that the complex was highly stable in vitro and in vivo. The blood clearance in rabbits showed bi-exponential pattern depicting that 50% of activity washed out at 2 h with t(1/2(Fast)) was 2.1 h and t(1/2(Slow)) was 12.5 h. Bio-distribution was normal and the experimental mice showed major accumulation of the radiolabeled formulation in liver, intestine, lungs and kidneys, indicating hepatobiliary and renal route of excretion. The distribution of the drugs to the lung was showing its efficiency in the treatment of tuberculosis.",

The adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte trafficking and/or retention within this unique immunological niche are unknown. In this study, we used immunofluorescence microscopy and a battery of monoclonal antibodies to identify the adhesion molecules expressed by leukocytes situated within the intracellular pockets of mouse Peyer's patch (PP) M cells. M cell associated leukocytes (MAL) consistently stained positive for integrin alpha4beta7, and integrin LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), but were rarely positive for L-selectin (CD62L) or the mucosal integrin alphaEbeta7. However, neither the alpha4beta7 ligands MadCAM-1 or VCAM-1, nor the LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1, were detected on M cell basolateral membranes. To determine whether integrins alpha4beta7 or LFA-1 play a functional role leukocyte homing to M cell pockets, we examined M cells in mice deficient in integrin beta7 or CD11a/CD18. Although PP from CD18 or integrin beta7 mice were reduced in number and size as compared to age-matched controls, we identified M cells in both strains of mice. However, mice lacking CD18 (but not integrin beta7) had significantly fewer leukocytes within M cell pockets as compared to control animals, suggesting LFA-1 (but not alpha4beta7) may contribute, in part, to leukocyte trafficking into and/or retention within this unique immunological niche.",

All-in-one covalent nanodrugs of the third generation have been synthesized based on a poly(beta-L-malic acid) (PMLA) platform, targeting human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). They significantly inhibited tumor growth in nude mice by blocking synthesis of epidermal growth factor receptor, and alpha4 and beta1 chains of laminin-411, the tumor vascular wall protein and angiogenesis marker. PMLA and nanodrug biocompatibility and toxicity at low and high dosages were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The dual-action nanodrug and single-action precursor nanoconjugates were assessed under in vitro conditions and in vivo with multiple treatment regimens (6 and 12 treatments). The monitoring of TNBC treatment in vivo with different drugs included blood hematologic and immunologic analysis after multiple intravenous administrations. The present study demonstrates that the dual-action nanoconjugate is highly effective in preclinical TNBC treatment without side effects, supported by hematologic and immunologic assays data.

However, this kind of therapy has limited efficacy due to the low level of gene transfer reached. A modified TK protein, capable of migrating from the producing cell to neighboring cells, would result in a greater proportion of cells affected by the treatment. As a first step towards transmission, we constructed a secretory form of HSV-TK by including the Igkappa leader peptide in the gene. An endoplasmatic reticulum export signal was added to the construct to further improve its secretion. Secretion and protein production in cancer cells, the enzymatic activity of the modified proteins and the ability of the modified TK to sensitize cancer cells to ganciclovir were tested. Addition of the Igkappa leader resulted in high levels of secretion of HSV-TK, with up to 70% of the total amount of protein secreted. Inclusion of an ER export signal did not further improve secretion. The enzyme activity of the secreted TK however, was decreased when compared to native TK. This study is the first to report on secretion of TK, and provides a first step in a novel strategy to improve the efficiency of cancer gene therapy. The loss of function in secreted TK however, may present a major hurdle in the development of a transmitted form of TK.",

        "abstract": "Gemcitabine hydrochloride is an anticancer nucleoside analogue indicated in clinic for the treatment of various solid tumors. Although this drug has been demonstrated to display anticancer activity against a wide variety of tumors, it is needed to be administered at high doses to elicit the required therapeutic response, simultaneously leading to severe adverse effects. We hypothesized that the efficient delivery of gemcitabine to tumors using a biodegradable carrier system could reduce the dose required to elicit sufficient therapeutic response. Thus, we have developed a nanoparticle formulation of gemcitabine suitable for parenteral administration based on the biodegradable polymer poly(octylcyanoacrylate) (POCA). The nanoparticles were synthesized by anionic polymerization of the corresponding monomer. Two drug loading methods were analyzed: the first one based on gemcitabine surface adsorption onto the preformed nanoparticles, and the second method being gemcitabine addition before the polymerization process leading to drug entrapment in the polymeric network. A detailed investigation of the capabilities of the polymer particles to load this drug is described. Gemcitabine entrapment into the polymer matrix yielded a higher drug loading and a slower drug release profile as compared with drug adsorption procedure. The main factors determining the gemcitabine incorporation to the polymer network were the nanoparticles preparation procedure, the monomer concentration, the surfactant concentration, the pH, and the drug concentration. The release kinetic of gemcitabine was found to be controlled by the pH and the type of drug incorporation. The cytotoxicity studies performed on L1210 tumor cells revealed a similar anticancer activity of the gemcitabine-loaded POCA (GPOCA) nanoparticle as free gemcitabine. Following intravenous administration into the mice bearing L1210 wt subcutaneous tumor, the GPOCA nanoparticles displayed significantly greater anticancer activity compared to free gemcitabine; this has been additionally confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry studies, suggesting the potential of GPOCA for the efficient treatment of cancer.",

However, systemic adverse effects of MP limit its availability for the disease. In present study, sulfate-conjugated methylprednisolone (MPS) was evaluated in vivo as a colon-targeted prodrug of MP and its therapeutic properties against 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced rat colitis were investigated. Upon oral administration, a large fraction of MPS reached the large intestine, where MPS was converted to MP implying that MPS would deliver MP effectively to the large intestine. The fecal recovery of MP (after MPS administration) was much greater than that after MP administration and the urinary recovery of MP (after MPS administration) was much less than that after MP administration, suggesting that MPS should exhibit enhanced therapeutic activity and reduced systemic adverse effects. Consistent with this notion, MPS was more effective than MP in ameliorating rat colitis. Moreover, the adverse effects of MPS on adrenal function and thymus were much lower than those of MP. Taken together, MPS may be therapeutically superior to MP in IBD treatment.",

However, information regarding the experience with this agent among advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is limited. In the current study, we investigated the effects of oral febuxostat in patients with advanced CKD with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. We demonstrated, for the first time, that not only the serum levels of uric acid (UA) but also those of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, an oxidative stress marker, were significantly reduced after six months of febuxostat treatment, with no adverse events. These results encouraged us to pursue further investigations regarding the clinical impact of lowering the serum UA levels with febuxostat in advanced CKD patients in terms of concomitantly reducing oxidative stress via the blockade of XO. More detailed studies with a larger number of subjects and assessments of the effects of multiple factors affecting hyperuricemia, such as age, sex, and dietary habits, would shed light on the therapeutic challenges of treating asymptomatic hyperuricemia in patients with various stages of CKD.",

        "abstract": "The combination of liposomal doxorubicin (DXR) and confocal ultrasound (US) was investigated for the enhancement of drug delivery in a rat tumour model. The liposomes, based on the unsaturated phospholipid dierucoylphosphocholine, were designed to be stable during blood circulation in order to maximize accumulation in tumour tissue and to release drug content upon US stimulation. A confocal US setup was developed for delivering inertial cavitation to tumours in a well-controlled and reproducible manner. In vitro studies confirm drug release from liposomes as a function of inertial cavitation dose, while in vivo pharmacokinetic studies show long blood circulation times and peak tumour accumulation at 24-48 h post intravenous administration. Animals injected 6 mg kg(-1) liposomal DXR exposed to US treatment 48 h after administration show significant tumour growth delay compared to control groups. A liposomal DXR dose of 3 mg kg(-1), however, did not induce any significant therapeutic response. This study demonstrates that inertial cavitation can be generated in such a fashion as to disrupt drug carrying liposomes which have accumulated in the tumour, and thereby increase therapeutic effect with a minimum direct effect on the tissue. Such an approach is an important step towards a therapeutic application of cavitation-induced drug delivery and reduced chemotherapy toxicity.",

In the present work, we show for the first time that As2O3 facilitates the DIDS-sensitive anion transport activity of band 3 protein in red blood cells (RBCs) isolated from normal adults and APL patients. To elucidate the effect of As2O3 on band 3 protein, constructs encoding the full length of the band 3 transmembrane domain (mdb3) and its C-terminal deletion forms were transfected into yeast cells by a yeast display system. The results demonstrate that deletion of the C-terminal 16 residues of mdb3 (mdb3-d16) does not affect anion transport activity of mdb3 or its sensitivity to DIDS, but decreases its sensitivity to As2O3 in the yeast cell. More intriguingly, the forced expression of intact mdb3 by transfection significantly induces cell apoptosis in HeLa cells, to a higher degree than in cells transfected with mdb3-d16 or empty vector. Expression of activated caspase 3 in HeLa cells also indicates that the C-terminal 16 residues are important for mdb3-mediated apoptosis in cells treated with As2O3. Our results provide the first evidence that As2O3 enhances the anion transport activity of band 3 and the action is related with the C-terminal 16 residues of the protein.",

These NPs are modified using varied concentration of anionic or cationic lipid. Upon dilution, these lipid mixtures self-assemble to form a series of cubic NPs with various surface charges, but with similar particle size. Positively charged NPs exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicities against L929 cells proportional to the concentration of cationic lipid; whereas negatively charged NPs did not show obvious cytotoxic properties as compared to unmodified NPs. Meanwhile, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry results suggested that NPs with high positive surface charge were taken up more efficiently by L929 cells. The permeability of round window membrane (RWM) was high for highly positively charged NPs, which is likely due to their highly cellular uptake efficiency and consequently high concentration gradient between RWM and cochlear fluid. More importantly, 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) modified NPs greatly facilitated broadly distribution in cochlea, favoring the treatment of hearing loss of low frequencies. Taken together, these findings about charge-dependent of NPs on RWM permeability and cochlear distribution could serve as guideline in the rational design of NP for drug and gene delivery to inner ear.",

Increased oxidative stress, decrease in acetylcholine concentration, and appearance of amyloidal proteins are reported in pathology of Alzheimer. Chemical drugs are effective but on the cost of detrimental side effects. Purpose: Present research is based on Preparation, characterization, behavioral and biochemical evaluation of brain targeted Piperine solid lipid nanoparticles in an experimentally induced Alzheimer's model at a low dose of 2 mg/kg. Methods: Piperine solid lipid nanoparticles were prepared by Emulsification-Solvent Diffusion technique with polysorbate-80 coating to impart Brain specific targeting. Experimental Ibotenic acid induced Alzheimer's, Force swimming test, superoxide dismutase, acetylcholenesterase enzymatic assays and also Histopathology of brain cortex was conducted to evaluate the Piperine therapeutic effects in Alzheimer's Disease. Results: Piperine in solid lipid nanoformulation (2 mg/kg equivalent) reduced the SOD values by 504 +/- 44.24 m units, p < 0.05, increased the acetylcholenesterase values by 29.24 +/- 4.29 microg/mg, p < 0.01 and reduced immobility to 41.36 +/- 3.53 s, p < 0.001 and has shown superior results than Donepezil (5 mg/kg).

        "abstract": "Liposomes have proven their use as a tool in various immunological studies. In our own studies, both their application as antigen carriers and as drug carriers appeared to be useful. Immune responses were elicited against free soluble protein antigens and against the same antigens in a liposome-associated (particulate) form, in order to compare both types of response. Since we were especially interested in the role of splenic macrophages in both types of response, we developed a liposome-mediated macrophage suicide approach, based on the liposome-mediated internalization of the small hydrophilic molecule clodronate in macrophages. This molecule has a very short half life when released in the circulation, but does not easily cross phospholipid bilayers of liposomes or cell membranes. As a consequence, once ingested by a macrophage in a liposome-encapsulated form, it will be accumulated within the cell as soon as the liposomes are digested with the help of its lysosomal phospholipases. At a certain intracellular clodronate concentration, the macrophage is eliminated by apoptosis. Given the fact that neither the liposomal phospholipids chosen nor clodronate are toxic to other (non-phagocytic) cells, this method has proven its efficacy for depletion of macrophage subsets in various organs. In several cases, organ-specific depletion can be obtained by choosing the right administration route for the clodronate liposomes.",

Significantly higher serum G-CSF concentration and increased total leukocyte count in the peripheral blood were observed after coadministration of rhG-CSF (100 microg/kg) with SNAP at various doses (0.3-3.3 mg/kg). The serum G-CSF concentration and the increased total leukocyte count were markedly decreased by the presence of the NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazole-1-oxyl 3-oxide sodium salt (carboxy-PTIO), in combination with rhG-CSF and SNAP. However, no significant inhibitory effect of glutathione (peroxynitrite scavenger) on the absorption-enhancing effect of SNAP was observed. These results suggest that carboxy-PTIO inhibits the absorption-enhancing effect of NO released from SNAP. We found that SNAP has a very low potential for cytotoxicity, as evaluated by the cell detachment assay, release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from cultured cells and morphological observations of nasal tissue of rabbits.

Te aim of this study was to search for the expression of serum antibodies against GnRH1 with an improved enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA), and antibodies against progonadoliberin-2, GnRH2, GnRH receptor, LH, and LH receptor with newly developed ELISAs, in patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction or diabetes mellitus. Healthy blood donors served as controls. Medical records were scrutinized. Our conclusion was that IgM antibodies against GnRH1, progonadoliberin-2, and/or GnRH receptors were more prevalent in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and/or diabetes mellitus, whereas IgG antibodies against these peptides, and LH- and LH receptor antibodies, were expressed in the same magnitude as in controls.",

The blank cationic (cetyltrimethyammoniumbromide) microspheres were prepared by the double emulsion (w/o/w) solvent evaporation technique. The HBsAg was adsorbed onto the surface of blank cationic microspheres. These microspheres were characterized in vitro for their size, shape, adsorption-efficiency, in-process stability, and HBsAg release studies. Specific humoral immune responses (IgM and IgG) and cell-mediated immune responses (cellular-proliferation) assay including release of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and nitric oxide (NO) from host's cells stimulated with HBsAg or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/ concanavalin A (con A) in-vitro were determined. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the single injection (using subcutaneous-route) of the polymeric microspheres produced better immune response (both humoral and cell-mediated) than two injections of a conventional alum-HBsAg vaccine. These data demonstrate high potential of polymeric microspheres for their use as a carrier adjuvant for hepatitis B vaccine.",

The SLNs were prepared by o/w microemulsion technique and characterized by time-resolved particle size analysis, polydispersity index, zeta(zeta)-potential, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), IR-spectroscopy, and wide-angle X-ray diffractometry (WAXD). The results obtained in these studies were compared with SLN prepared with stearic acid alone. IR, WAXD, and DSC studies revealed low-crystalline SLN and were having positive zeta-potentials after three-months of storage. Results indicated mixed lipid-matrix produced SLN with low-crystallinity and smaller particle sizes and higher drug entrapment compared with SLN prepared with stearic acid alone, therefore SLN-B would be suitable for the preparation of nanosuspension. Nanosuspensions were subjected to rheological and physicochemical evaluation, in vitro drug release and ex vivo corneal permeation studies and their effect were evaluated on corneal hydration-level. SLN composed of stearic acid and compritol would prove to be a good ocular drug delivery system considering the smaller particle size, particle size stability, and physiologically tolerable components.",

The particle size and zeta potential of DNA/Man-PLL (prepared at 1:0.7 on a weight basis) were determined to be 220 nm and +12 mV, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of the DNA/Man-PLL complex was assessed in mice using 32P-labeled DNA ([32P]DNA). After intravenous injection of [32P]DNA/Man-PLL, the radioactivity in plasma fell rapidly and was recovered mainly in the liver nonparenchymal cells. The amount in the liver reached more than 80% of the dose. Radioactivity observed in kidney, lung, and spleen was very low compared to that in the liver. Then, the in vivo gene expression after intravenous injection of DNA/Man-PLL was examined by a CAT assay. Highest CAT activity was detected in the liver, but no activity was detected in the lung, kidney, and spleen. These results clearly indicate that a cell-specific gene delivery system can be developed by regulating the biodistribution of DNA/carrier complex through the control of its physicochemical properties.",

It was found that a trauma-induced neurological deficit could be partially improved with daily intraperitoneal injections of SkQT1 (250 nmol/kg) for 5 days after the trauma. Neither an analog of SkQT1 without thymoquinone (C12TPP) nor original thymoquinone without a cation residue was effective to improve such conditions. In the SkQ molecule, the phosphonium cation can be replaced by the rhodamine 19 cation, with the SkQTR1 being still active in the treatment of the neurological deficit. Application of 200 nM Abeta to rat hippocampal slices impaired the induction of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer. A single intraperitoneal injection of SkQT1 (250 nmol/kg body weight) made 24 h before the slice preparation prevented the harmful effect of Abeta on the LTP. Thus mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, containing thymoquinone, have neuroprotective properties.",

Human operators can only observe a limited field of regard. Sensors can enhance the field of regard up to 360, but then the amount of data cannot be fully exploited by a human operator any more. For this reason an intelligent assistance system is required that monitors the circumference of a moving platform and warns the driver of a threatening situation. One first processing step of such a system is the recognition of humans. There are numerous approaches to the detection of humans, mainly from stationary cameras. Moving cameras play a role in the field of pedestrian protection from a moving road vehicle. There are two principal differences to this latter application domain. Firstly, the threat in a MOUT scenario potentially arises from humans in the scene. Secondly, not only the trajectories of individual humans are relevant, but also the motion and the behavior of groups of humans. As a first step towards an assistance system that automatically warns drivers in a MOUT scenario, we implemented an approach to the detection of humans in video images and applied them to a relevant set of image sequences taken in a MOUT scenario. In the paper we assess the obtained results and outline further research activities.",

In this study, the extent of induction of the cytokine IL-6 by OM was examined as evidence for local pharmacological activity in response to OM in lung tissue. OM stimulated dose-dependent release of IL-6 in both BEAS-2B cells and IPRL after exposure of either the apical (AP) or basolateral (BL) side of the epithelium. The increase in IL-6 was rapid, beginning 2 h after dosing, and sustained over 48 h. Similar amounts of IL-6 were released to both AP and BL sides of BEAS-2B cells, regardless of the side of OM dosing. However, in IPRL the extent of response of IL-6 induction to OM was always higher at the dosing side. In addition, airway dosing of OM resulted in an overall lower IL-6 response than perfusate dosing, which may result from the low rate of OM transport (<1%/h) across pulmonary epithelium. We conclude that the route of delivery significantly affects the overall extent of the pharmacological response to OM, with a lesser and more localized response after airway delivery to the lung.",

In vitro reversion of KET-GLY to ketoprofen was carried out in different pHs and in pH 6.8 containing optimized rat fecal material. In vivo healing potential of KET-GLY was evaluated in acetic acid-induced experimental colitis model. In vitro reversion studies suggested that KET-GLY remained intact in stomach but released the free drug at pH 6.8 containing fresh rat fecal material, where the colonic microfloral enzymes (amidase) hydrolyzed the KET-GLY amide linkage, releasing the free drug. In vivo evaluation indicated KET-GLY to be less toxic in stomach, with enhanced anti-inflammatory potential in the colonic region.

The loading efficiency was determined to be 92.0 +/- 0.92 (DOX/FA-PEG-MWCNTs) in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) ascribed to pi-pi stacking interaction. The developed nanoconjugates were evaluated for in vitro DOX release, erythrocytes toxicity, ex vivo cytotoxicity and cell uptake studies on MCF-7 (breast cancer cell line). The DOX/FA-PEG-MWCNTs nanoconjugate affords higher efficacy in tumor growth suppression due to its stealth nature and most preferentially taken up by the cultured MCF-7 through caveolae-mediated endocytosis as compared to free DOX. The in vivo studies were performed to determine the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and antitumor efficacy on tumor bearing female Sprague Dawley rats and improved pharmacokinetics confirm the function of FA-PEG conjugated CNTs. The median survival time for tumor bearing rats treated with DOX/FA-PEG-MWCNTs (30 d) was extended very significantly as compared to free DOX (p < 0.001).

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study a recombined chimeric peptide consisting of lysozyme N-terminal sequence and exendin-4 (shortly LYZ(N)-EX4) as a dual-action peptide for diabetes. METHODS: LYZ(N)-EX4 was recombined into plasmid pET-32a(+) and expressed in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was separated by affinity chromatography and hydrolyzed by enterokinase to prepare LYZ(N)-EX4. The chimeric peptide was digested by thrombin and the digests were analyzed by HPLC. The secondary peptides were identified by mass spectrometry. Biological activities of the thrombin digests were determined in vitro, using NIT-1 cells for insulin promoting action and using human white blood cells (WBC) for anti-AGEs action. RESULTS: The fusion protein was highly expressed in E. coli and LYZ(N)-EX4 was obtained via hydrolysis of the fusion protein. The thrombin digests of LYZ(N)-EX4 were separated by HPLC into two peaks, which were identified as LYZ(N) and EX4 by mass spectrametry. Functional studies found that the digests were able to antagonize the effects of AGEs on expression of RAGE mRNA in WBC, promote cell activity, stimulate PDX-1 mRNA expression and increase insulin secretion by NIT-1 cells, suggesting the actions of LYZ(N) and EX4 on the cells. CONCLUSIONS: LYZ(N)-EX4 was sensitive to thrombin digestion, and the secondary peptides LYZ(N) and EX4 could function as anti-AGEs and insulin-promoting peptides, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The adsorption behaviour of a tetrafunctional copolymer of poly (ethylene oxide)-poly (propylene oxide) ethylene diamine (commercially available as Poloxamine 908) and a diblock copolymer of poly (lactic acid)-poly (ethylene oxide) (PLA/PEG 2:5) onto a model colloidal drug carrier (156 nm sized polystyrene latex) is described. The adsorption isotherm, hydrodynamic thickness of the adsorbed layers and enthalpy of the adsorption were assessed. The close similarity in the conformation of the poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) chains (molecular weight 5,000 Da) in the adsorbed layers of these two copolymers was demonstrated by combining the adsorption data with the adsorbed layer thickness data. In contrast, the results from isothermal titration microcalorimetry indicated a distinct difference in the interaction of the copolymers with the polystyrene colloid surface. Poloxamine 908 adsorption to polystyrene nanoparticles is dominated by an endothermic heat effect, whereas, PLA/PEG 2:5 adsorption is entirely an exothermic process. This difference in adsorption behaviour could provide an explanation for differences in the biodistribution of Poloxamine 908 and PLA/PEG 2:5 coated polystyrene nanoparticles observed in previous studies. A comparison with the interaction enthalpy for several other PEO-containing copolymers onto the same polystyrene colloid was made. The results demonstrate the importance of the nature of the anchoring moiety on the interaction of the adsorbing copolymer with the colloid surface. An endothermic contribution is found when an adsorbing molecule contains a poly (propylene oxide) (PPO) moiety (e.g. Poloxamine 908), whilst the adsorption is exothermic (i.e. enthalpy driven) for PEO copolymers with polylactide (PLA/PEG 2:5) or alkyl moieties.",

        "abstract": "Target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) describes the phenomenon where high affinity binding of a drug to its pharmacological target (enzymes or receptors) significantly alters the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug. A rapid binding model replaces the often inestimable binding micro-constants (k (on) and k (off)) of TMDD models with the equilibrium dissociation constant (K (D)) by assuming rapid binding of the drug to its target. The purpose of this study is to examine the validity of the rapid binding assumption and the pharmacokinetic properties of this model. Temporal profiles of free drug in plasma and a non-specific distribution site, free receptor, and the pharmacodynamically relevant, drug-receptor complex obtained from the rapid binding model compared favorably with the full TMDD model for small values of the parameter epsilon, which represents the ratio of the time required for drug-receptor binding relative to the time required for drug to be cleared from the system. The effect of escalating drug doses on the temporal characteristics and the comparison between the two models has been numerically investigated. A closer match between the full and rapid binding models is observed for high doses. Analysis for very large doses (Dose/V (c)) relative to endogenous steady-state receptor concentration (R (ss)), reveals that the rapid binding model reduces to a standard two compartmental model with a plasma compartment with linear drug elimination and a peripheral compartment. Decreasing clearance with increasing dose and decreasing R (ss) indicates that for drugs exhibiting TMDD, the relative ratio of R (ss) and dose is an important determinant of the pharmacokinetic properties rather than the individual parameters alone. An analytical solution derived for clearance shows that the primary elements of the apparent clearance of the drug are the linear clearance given by k (el) V (c), the non-linear clearance due to drug-receptor complex internalization (k (int)), and the ratio of AUC values of the receptor complex to that of free drug. Overall, simulations and analytical techniques applied here provide a better understanding of the validity of the rapid binding model and provide guidelines for its application.",

        "abstract": "The capability of a commercial respiratory gating system based on video tracking of reflective markers to reduce motion-induced CT planning and treatment errors was evaluated. Spherical plastic shells (2.8-82 cm3), simulating the gross target volume (GTV), were placed in a water-filled body phantom that was moved sinusoidally along the longitudinal axis of the CT scanner and the accelerator for +/- 1 cm at 15-30 cycle/min. During gated CT imaging, the x-ray exposure was initiated by the gating system shortly before the end of expiration (so that the imaging time would be centered at the end of expiration); it was terminated by the scanner after completion of each slice. In nongated CT images, the target appeared distorted and often broken up. GTVs volume errors ranged 16%-110% in axial scans, and 7%-36% in spiral scans. In gated CT images, the spheres appeared 3 and 5 mm longer than their actual diameters (volume errors 2%-16%), at the respective respiration rates of 15 and 20 cycles/min. At 30 cycles/min the target appeared 1 cm longer, and volume error ranged 25%-53%. During treatment, gating kept the beam on for a duration equal to the CT acquisition time of 1 s/slice. The difference in positional errors between gated CT and portal films was 1 mm, regardless the size of residual motion errors. Because of the potential of suboptimal placement of the gating window between CT imaging and treatment, an extra 1.5-2.5 mm safety margin can be added regardless of the size of residual motion error. For respiratory rates > or = 30 cycles/min, the effectiveness of gating is limited by large residual motion in the 1 s CT acquisition time.",

        "abstract": "Syphilis, a slow progressive and the third most common sexually transmitted disease found worldwide, is caused by a spirochete gram negative bacteria Treponema pallidum. Emergence of antibiotic resistant T. pallidum has led to a search for novel drugs and their targets. Subtractive genomics analyses of pathogen T. pallidum and host Homo sapiens resulted in identification of 126 proteins essential for survival and viability of the pathogen. Metabolic pathway analyses of these essential proteins led to discovery of nineteen proteins distributed among six metabolic pathways unique to T. pallidum. One hundred plant-derived terpenoids, as potential therapeutic molecules against T. pallidum, were screened for their drug likeness and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and toxicity) properties. Subsequently the resulting nine terpenoids were docked with five unique T. pallidum targets through molecular modeling approaches. Out of five targets analyzed, D-alanine:D-alanine ligase was found to be the most promising target, while terpenoid salvicine was the most potent inhibitor. A comparison of the inhibitory potential of the best docked readily available natural compound, namely pomiferin (flavonoid) with that of the best docked terpenoid salvicine, revealed that salvicine was a more potent inhibitor than that of pomiferin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a terpenoid as a potential therapeutic molecule against T. pallidum with D-alanine:D-alanine ligase as a novel target. Further studies are warranted to evaluate and explore the potential clinical ramifications of these findings in relation to syphilis that has public health importance worldwide.",

For selecting a suitable imaging probe, the current Molecular Imaging and Contrast Agent Database (MICAD) provides descriptive and qualitative information on imaging probe characteristics and properties. However, MICAD does not support linkage with the expression profiles of target genes. The proposed Disease-specific Imaging Probe Profiling (DIPP) database quantitatively archives and presents the gene expression profiles of targets across different diseases, anatomic regions, and subcellular locations, providing an objective reference for selecting imaging probes. The DIPP database was validated with a clinical positron emission tomography (PET) study on lung cancer and an in vitro study on neuroendocrine cancer. The retrieved records show that choline kinase beta and glucose transporters were positively and significantly associated with lung cancer among the targets of 11C-choline and [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-2-d-glucose (FDG), respectively. Their significant overexpressions corresponded to the findings that the uptake rate of FDG increased with tumor size but that of 11C-choline remained constant. Validated with the in vitro study, the expression profiles of disease-associated targets can indicate the eligibility of patients for clinical trials of the treatment probe.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The targeting protein for Xklp2 (TPX2) has recently gained attention as a putative oncogene possibly amplified in several human malignancies, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In this work, we sought to evaluate the copy number and expression of TPX2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumor tissues and to further explore the potential of TPX2 as a therapeutic target. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The DNA copy number and expression of the TPX2 gene were surveyed in pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumor tissues and compared with those of immortalized normal pancreatic ductal cells and normal pancreatic tissues. The cellular effects of TPX2 knockdown using small interfering RNA oligonucleotides in pancreatic cancer cells, such as growth in tissue culture, in soft agar, and in nude mice; apoptosis; and sensitivity to paclitaxel, were also investigated using various assays. RESULTS: Low-copy-number TPX2 amplification was found in pancreatic cancer cell lines and low-passage pancreatic cancer tumor xenografts. TPX2 expression was upregulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines at both the mRNA and protein levels relative to the immortalized pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line HPDE6. Immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray showed that TPX2 expression was higher in pancreatic tumors compared with their normal counterparts. Treatment with TPX2 targeting small interfering RNAs effectively reduced pancreatic cancer cell growth in tissue culture, induced apoptosis, and inhibited growth in soft agar and in nude mice. Knockdown of TPX2 also sensitized pancreatic cancer cells to paclitaxel treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TPX2 might be an attractive target for pancreatic cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) automatic target recognition (ATR) systems depend upon the capacity of the atmosphere to propagate thermal radiation over long distances. To date, not much research has been conducted on analyzing and mitigating the effects of the atmosphere on FLIR ATR performance, even though the atmosphere is often the limiting factor in long-range target detection and recognition. The atmosphere can also cause frame-to-frame inconsistencies in the scene, affecting the ability to detect and track moving targets. When image quality is limited by turbulence, increasing the aperture size or improving the focal plane array cannot improve ATR performance. Traditional single frame image enhancement does not solve the problem. A new approach is described for reducing the effects of turbulence. It is implemented under a lucky-region-imaging framework using short integration time and spatial domain processing. It is designed to preserve important target and scene structure. Unlike previous Fourier-based approaches originating from the astronomical community, this new approach is intended for real-time processing from a moving platform, with ground as the background. The system produces a video stream with minimal delay. A new video quality measure (VQM(turb)) is presented for quantifying the success of turbulence mitigation on real data where no reference imagery is available. The VQM(turb) is the core of the innovation because it allows a wide range of algorithms to be quantitatively compared. An algorithm can be chosen, and then tuned, to best-fit available processing power, latency requirements, scenarios and sensor characteristics.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\\nAspergillus fumigatus presents a spectrum of clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic challenges. A new pipeline of novel validated antifungal targets is needed to address limitations in existing agents. The fungal cell wall is essential for survival, with chitin (\u03b2(1-4) linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine [GlcNAc]) forming an integral layer. Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of its sugar nucleotide precursor, UDP-GlcNAc, are potential antifungal targets. One such enzyme is glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA1) that N-acetylates glucosamine-6-phosphate to N-acetyl-glucosamine-6-phosphate as an intermediary step. Here we genetically validate A fumigatus GNA1 as an antifungal target and assess whether small-molecule ligands bind to the protein. \\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe constructed a gene deletion mutant, based on homologous recombination, by replacing the afugna1 coding sequence with the pyrG selectable marker. Purified GNA1 from A fumigatus (AfGNA1) was chemically biotinylated, and a fragment screen using bio-layer interferometry (Octet Red, Pall Forte Bio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) done to assess the binding of fragments to the target protein. X-ray crystallography was used to verify preliminary hits and determine the binding mode. \\n\\nFINDINGS\\nThe mutant strain of A fumigatus was unable to grow in vitro without the addition of exogenous GlcNAc. Screening the Dundee Drug Discovery Unit (DDU) fragment library gave a preliminary hit rate of 5\u00b77 % (37/652 with a response rate >0\u00b702 nm). A subset of seven fragments showed stoichiometric binding with equilibrium dissociation constants in the micromolar range. Structural analysis of AfGNA1 in complex with fragment (A) showed that the fragment binds in a groove behind the sugar substrate. \\n\\nINTERPRETATION\\nFragment-based drug discovery provides a complementary and contrasting approach to traditional high-throughput methods by elaborating weakly binding small molecules. Iterative cycles of medicinal chemistry and structural biology are required to optimise this chemical anchor by extending into the active site to generate highly potent drug-like lead molecules. This work suggests that GNA1 is essential for cell viability in A fumigatus and could be a potential novel antifungal target. \\n\\nFUNDING\\nUK Medical Research Council.",

In this report we validate the use of 4D-PET-MIP for the delineation of target volumes in both a phantom and in patients. Methods and Materials: A phantom with 3 hollow spheres was prepared surrounded by air then water. The spheres and water background were filled with a mixture of 18F and radiographic contrast medium. A 4D-PET/CT scan was performed of the phantom while moving in 4 different breathing patterns using a programmable motion device. Nine patients with an FDG-avid lung tumor who underwent FB and 4D-PET/CT and >5 mm of tumor motion were included for analysis. The 3 spheres and patient lesions were contoured by 2 contouring methods (40% of maximum and PET edge) on the FB-PET, FB-CT, 4D-PET, 4D-PET-MIP, and 4D-CT-MIP. The concordance between the different contoured volumes was calculated using a Dice coefficient (DC). The difference in lung tumor volumes between FB-PET and 4D-PET volumes was also measured. Results: The average DC in the phantom using 40% and PET edge, respectively, was lowest for FB-PET/CT (DCAir = 0.72/0.67, DCBackground 0.63/0.62) and highest for 4D-PET/CT-MIP (DCAir = 0.84/0.83, DCBackground = 0.78/0.73). The average DC in the 9 patients using 40% and PET edge, respectively, was also lowest for FB-PET/CT (DC = 0.45/0.44) and highest for 4D-PET/CT-MIP (DC = 0.72/0.73). In the 9 lesions, the target volumes of the FB-PET using 40% and PET edge, respectively, were on average 40% and 45% smaller than the 4D-PET-MIP. Conclusion: A 4D-PET-MIP produces volumes with the highest concordance with 4D-CT-MIP across multiple breathing patterns and lesion sizes in both a phantom and among patients. Freebreathing PET/CT consistently underestimates ITV when compared with 4D PET/CT for a lesion affected by respiration. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

Using examples from recent studies in obesity and diabetes research, the role of endophenotypes, functional challenges and developmental compensation is discussed. Although unexpected results are sometimes perceived as limitations or technical problems of the mouse as a model organism, this review argues that these findings provide key information about medically relevant aspects of biology and are essential to improve oversimplistic models of pathophysiology.",

We recently showed that IGF1R expression is inhibited by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, and the IGF1R is up-regulated in CC-RCC, in which VHL is frequently inactivated. We tested the hypothesis that IGF1R up-regulation mediates resistance to cancer therapeutics, evaluating the effects of IGF1R depletion on sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, which are ineffective in RCC, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin, analogues of which have clinical activity in this tumor. Experimental Design: This study used CC-RCC cells harboring mutant VHL, and isogenic cells expressing functional VHL. Cells were transfected with nonsilencing control small interfering RNA (siRNA), or with one of two different IGF1R siRNAs. The more potent siRNA was modified by 2'-O-methyl derivatization for in vivo administration. Results: CC-RCC cells expressing mutant VHL and higher IGF1R were more chemoresistant than cells expressing functional VHL. IGF1R depletion induced apoptosis, blocked cell survival, and sensitized to 5-fluorouracil and etoposide. These effects were significantly greater in CC-RCC cells expressing mutant VHL, supporting the hypothesis that IGF1R up-regulation makes a major contribution to the chemoresistance associated with VHL loss. IGF1R depletion also enhanced sensitivity to mTOR inhibition, at least in part due to suppression of rapamycin-induced Akt activation.

        "abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a highly malignant soft-tissue tumor of childhood deriving from skeletal muscle cells. RMS can be classified in two major histologic subtypes: embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS), the latter being characterized by the PAX3/7-FKHR translocation. Here we first investigated whether the Met receptor, a transcriptional target of PAX3 and PAX7, has a role in PAX3-FKHR-mediated transformation. Following PAX3-FKHR transduction, Met was up-regulated in mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEF), NIH 3T3 and C2C12 cells, and they all acquired anchorage independence. This property was lost in low serum but addition of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) rescued soft-agar growth. Genetic proof that Met is necessary for this PAX3-FKHR-mediated effect was obtained by transducing with PAX3-FKHR MEFs derived from Met mutant (Met(D/D)) and wild-type (Met(+/+)) embryos. Only Met(+/+) MEFs acquired anchorage-independent growth whereas PAX3-FKHR-transduced Met(D/D) cells were unable to form colonies in soft agar. To verify if Met had a role in RMS maintenance, we silenced the receptor by transducing ERMS and ARMS cell lines with an inducible lentivirus expressing an anti-Met short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Met down-regulation significantly affected RMS cells proliferation, survival, invasiveness, and anchorage-independent growth. Finally, induction of the Met-directed shRNA promoted a dramatic reduction of tumor mass in a xenograft model of RMS. Our data show that both ARMS- and ERMS-derived cell lines, in spite of the genetic drift which may have occurred in years of culture, seem to have retained an \"addiction\" to the Met oncogene and suggest that Met may represent a target of choice to develop novel therapeutic strategies for ARMS.",

However, using a virtual isocenter in ExacTrac has not been thoroughly validated. This study evaluates its target localization accuracy and investigates the impact of two different couch correction sequences.Methods: A CT scan was acquired on an anthropomorphic thoracic phantom with a 2mm-diameter ball bearing (BB) marker implanted in thelung region. A treatment plan was created with isocenter placed at the BB center, and exported to ExacTrac. In ExacTrac, a virtual isocenter wasplaced on a spine vertebral body where three translational shifts (8.8cm laterally, 1.5cm longitudinally and 6cm vertically) were present. A series ofcouch rotations (+/-3 degrees, 1 degree increment) was intentionally applied to simulate angular setup variations. For each rotation, two stereoscopic x-rayimages were acquired and fused using the ExacTrac 6D registrationalgorithm. Calculated shifts were applied using two sequences: (1)automatic 5D corrections (three translations/two robotic couch rotations) followed by manual couch rotation; (2) manual couch rotation then automatic 5D corrections. After each ExacTrac localization, orthogonal (anterior-posterior and right-lateral) portal images were acquired to quantify BB center deviations from the radiation isocenter as an indicator of residual error. Results: Minimal difference between investigated table correction sequences was observed. Average translational deviations between the BB and radiation isocenter (mean+/-1SD) were 0.3+/-0.3mm and 1.0+/-0.2mm for lateral and vertical axis respectively. Longitudinally, the deviations were 0.8+/-0.4mm from the anterior-posterior image and 0.1+/-0.3mm from the right-lateral image. The systematic difference (0.7+/-0.1 mm) between thetwo may have been attributed to gantry sagging during rotation. Conclusions: ExacTrac system successfully corrected angular shifts using the virtual isocenter method in a rigid phantom setup. The sequence ofcouch correction did not influence the localization accuracy. Further patient study is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Of the non-viral vectors, cationic lipid (CL) formulations are the most widely studied for the delivery of genes, antisense oligonucleotides and gene silencing nucleic acids such as small interfering RNAs. However, little is known about the impact of these delivery systems on global gene expression in target cells. In an attempt to study the geno-compatibility of CL formulations in target cells, we have used microarrays to examine the effect of Lipofectin and Oligofectamine on the gene expression profiles of human A431 epithelial cells. Using the manufacturer's recommended CL concentrations routinely used for gene delivery, cDNA microarray expression profiling revealed marked changes in the expression of several genes for both Lipofectin- and Oligofectamine-treated cells. Data from the 200 spot arrays housing 160 different genes indicated that Lipofectin or Oligofectamine treatment of A431 cells resulted in more than 2-fold altered expression of 10 and 27 genes, respectively. The downstream functional consequences of CL-induced gene expression alterations led to an increased tendency of cells to enter early apoptosis as assessed by annexin V-FITC flow cytometry analyses. This effect was greater for Oligofectamine than Lipofectin. Observed gene expression changes were not sufficient to induce any significant DNA damage as assessed by single cell gel electrophoresis (COMET) assay. These data highlight the fact that inadvertent gene expression changes can be induced by the delivery formulation alone and that these may, ultimately, have important safety implications for the use of these non-viral vectors in gene-based therapies. Also, the induced non-target gene changes should be taken into consideration in gene therapy or gene silencing experiments using CL formulations where they may potentially mask or interfere with the desired genotype and/or phenotype end-points.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancers are classified as squamous cell carcinoma (SQ), adenocarcinoma (AC) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). SQ is the major subtype of lung cancer. Currently, there are no targeted therapies for SQ due to lack of understanding its driving oncogenes. In this study, we validated an SQ specific biomarker hsa-miR-205 in Chinese patients with lung cancer and screened its candidate target genes for further functional studies to enrich knowledge in SQ target therapies. METHODS: Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (quantitative RT-PCR) was performed on 197 macro-dissected (cancerous cells >75%) surgical lung tissues (45 SQ, 44 AC, 54 SCLC and 54 adjacent normal tissues) to validate the expression profiles of miR-205. Furthermore, the targets of this microRNA were predicted through the gateway miRecords and mapped to lung cancer-associated pathways using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database. Then quantitative RT-PCR was performed on an independent cohort of 44 snap-frozen surgical lung tissues to concurrently assess the expression profiles of miR-205 and its 52 putative targeted genes. RESULTS: MicroRNA-205 yielded high diagnostic accuracy in discriminating SQ from AC with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.985, and discriminating SQ from SCLC with an AUC of 0.978 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) surgical lung tissues. Predicted targets of miR-205 were associated with 52 key members of lung cancer signaling pathways. Ten target genes (ACSL1, AXIN2, CACNA2D2, FOXO3, PPP1R3A, PRKAG3, RUNX1, SMAD4, STK3 and TBL1XR1) were significantly down-regulated in SQ and had a strong negative correlation with miR-205, while one target gene (CDH3) was up-regulated in SQ and exhibited a strong positive correlation with miR-205. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the high diagnostic accuracy of miR-205 in discriminating SQ from AC and SCLC in Chinese patients. Moreover, we identified 11 significant target genes of miR-205 which could be used for further functional studies as the basis for the development of SQ targeted therapies.",

A comparison of the effect of endothall and cantharidin on plants revealed a similarity in their level of phytotoxicity on both Arabidopsis thaliana and Lemna paucicostata. Cantharidin is a potent inhibitor of animal serine/threonine protein phosphatases. Protein phosphatases and kinases maintain a sensitive balance between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of proteins playing important roles in signal transduction pathways. In this study, we found endothall and cantharidin to both completely inhibit plant serine/threonine protein phosphatases, and their relative inhibitory activities were similar to their relative phytotoxicities. Both compounds acted as slow, irreversible inactivators of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase activities. Transcription of several genes determined to be affected by the inhibition of these protein phosphatases by cantharidin in A. thaliana by transcriptome analyses were affected similarly by endothall, but in a more pronounced way. Therefore, the molecular target site of endothall in plants is similar to that of cantharidin in animals, namely, serine/threonine protein phosphatases responsible for regulating an array of biochemical processes. This mode of action is unlike any other commercial herbicide. \u00a9 2011.",

        "abstract": "Effective targeted cancer therapeutic development depends upon distinguishing disease-associated 'driver' mutations, which have causative roles in malignancy pathogenesis, from 'passenger' mutations, which are dispensable for cancer initiation and maintenance. Translational studies of clinically active targeted therapeutics can definitively discriminate driver from passenger lesions and provide valuable insights into human cancer biology. Activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) are detected in approximately 20% of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and are associated with a poor prognosis. Abundant scientific and clinical evidence, including the lack of convincing clinical activity of early FLT3 inhibitors, suggests that FLT3-ITD probably represents a passenger lesion. Here we report point mutations at three residues within the kinase domain of FLT3-ITD that confer substantial in vitro resistance to AC220 (quizartinib), an active investigational inhibitor of FLT3, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB and RET; evolution of AC220-resistant substitutions at two of these amino acid positions was observed in eight of eight FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients with acquired resistance to AC220. Our findings demonstrate that FLT3-ITD can represent a driver lesion and valid therapeutic target in human AML. AC220-resistant FLT3 kinase domain mutants represent high-value targets for future FLT3 inhibitor development efforts.",

Growth of SKO in vitro is identical to wild-type (WT) cells, whereas DKO has an absolute requirement for thymidine. Removal of thymidine from the medium triggers growth arrest in S phase, associated with gross morphological changes, followed by cell death after 60 h. DKO is unable to infect mice, whereas the virulence of SKO is similar to WT. Normal growth and virulence could be restored by transfection of DKO with T. brucei DHFR-TS, but not with Escherichia coli TS. As pteridine reductase (PTR1) levels are unchanged in SKO and DKO cells, PTR1 is not able to compensate for loss of DHFR activity. Drugs such as raltitrexed or methotrexate with structural similarity to folic acid are up to 300-fold more potent inhibitors of WT cultured in a novel low-folate medium, unlike hydrophobic antifols such as trimetrexate or pyrimethamine. DKO trypanosomes show reduced sensitivity to these inhibitors ranging from twofold for trimetrexate to >10 000-fold for raltitrexed. These data demonstrate that DHFR-TS is essential for parasite survival and represents a promising target for drug discovery.",

We previously demonstrated that the constitutive phosphorylation of ALK chimeric proteins is sufficient to induce cellular transformation in vitro and in vivo and that ALK activity is strictly required for the survival of ALK-positive ALCL cells. To elucidate the signaling pathways required for ALK-mediated transformation and tumor maintenance, we analyzed the transcriptomes of multiple ALK-positive ALCL cell lines, abrogating their ALK-mediated signaling by inducible ALK RNA interference (RNAi) or with potent and cell-permeable ALK inhibitors. Transcripts derived from the gene expression profiling (GEP) analysis uncovered a reproducible signature, which included a novel group of ALK-regulated genes. Functional RNAi screening on a set of these ALK transcriptional targets revealed that the transcription factor C/EBPbeta and the antiapoptotic protein BCL2A1 are absolutely necessary to induce cell transformation and/or to sustain the growth and survival of ALK-positive ALCL cells. Thus, we proved that an experimentally controlled and functionally validated GEP analysis represents a powerful tool to identify novel pathogenetic networks and validate biologically suitable target genes for therapeutic interventions.",

Here we show that oxythiamine, a thiamine analog, inhibits proliferation of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in vitro via a thiamine-related pathway and significantly reduces parasite growth in a mouse malaria model. Overexpression of thiamine pyrophosphokinase (the enzyme that converts thiamine into its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate) hypersensitizes parasites to oxythiamine by up to 1,700-fold, consistent with oxythiamine being a substrate for thiamine pyrophosphokinase and its conversion into an antimetabolite. We show that parasites overexpressing the thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase are up to 15-fold more resistant to oxythiamine, consistent with the antimetabolite inactivating thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes. Our studies therefore validate thiamine utilization as an antimalarial drug target and demonstrate that a single antimalarial can simultaneously target several enzymes located within distinct organelles.",

PqsD is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of these signal molecules. Using a ligand-based approach, we have identified the first class of PqsD inhibitors. Simplification and rigidization led to fragments with high ligand efficiencies. These small molecules repress HHQ and PQS production and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. This validates PqsD as a target for the development of anti-infectives.",

However, this same process is useful in providing a direct and systemic route for the delivery of cytotoxics to the actively growing parts of the tumour. In fact, there is even some merit to stabilising (normalising) the tumour vasculature to aid drug delivery to the deeper recesses of a growing tumour. Additionally, natural biological inhibitors of angiogenesis such as pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) are being developed to test whether they have better activity than older ones such as endostatin. The field of cancer angiogenesis, more than 35 years old now, has seen a few drugs reaching the market, such as Avastin. However, there have been a multitude of failed ones, due to lack of activity, especially when tested in vivo and some failing at clinical trials. This review looks at the current state of play in the area of cancer angiogenesis, and development of therapies to target it.",

Even if target-recognizable ligand is incorporated into the system, the overall physicochemical properties, notably size and charge, are predominant factors influencing in vivo disposition characteristics of the vector. Based on this consideration, liver cell-specific carrier systems via receptor-mediated endocytosis were successfully developed by optimizing physicochemical characteristics.

They have expanded our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in prostate carcinogenesis as well as allowing us to explore both novel and traditional treatment regimes based on the molecular profile of these lesions. Continuing refinement of the transgenic prostate models has proven challenging since no one model seems to represent the entire continuum of the disease, thus currently limiting its applicability to the human condition. This platform may potentially have major impact in validation of drug targeting specific biological process of prostate carcinogenesis, supplementing (or even replacing) many of the current in vitro and in vivo assays with the in vivo environment that transgenic prostate models provide.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE/METHOD: This review focuses primarily on the current state of murine model systems as a preclinical therapeutic platform for the treatment of prostate cancer, as well as hope for the future of the field.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Much of the work in the drug discovery field has been done with the PTEN(-/-) and TRAMP models of prostate cancer. Despite their limitations they have contributed much to our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. There is, however, a need for transgenic models that better reflect the stepwise progression found in the human condition. We feel that they will prove to be invaluable as a preclinical platform regarding efficacy and tolerability of various anticancer agents, which ultimately allows us to translate these findings to the clinical setting to prognosticate and ultimately render cancer patients disease-free.",

        "abstract": "The narcosis target lipid model (NTLM) was used to predict the toxicity of water-accommodated fractions (WAFs) of six gasoline blending streams to algae (Pseudokirchnereilla subcapitata, formerly Selenastrum capricornutum), juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and water flea (Daphnia magna). Gasolines are comprised of hydrocarbons that on dissolution into the aqueous phase are expected to act via narcosis. Aquatic toxicity data were obtained using a lethal-loading test in which WAFs were prepared using different gasoline loadings. The compositions of the gasolines were determined by analysis of C3 to C13 hydrocarbons grouped in classes of n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, aromatics, cyclic alkanes, and olefins. A model was developed to compute the concentrations of hydrocarbon blocks in WAFs based on gasoline composition and loading. The model accounts for the volume change of the gasoline, which varies depending on loading and volatilization loss. The predicted aqueous composition of WAFs compared favorably to measurements, and the predicted aqueous concentrations of WAFs were used in the NTLM to predict the aquatic toxicity of the gasolines. For each gasoline loading and species, total toxic units (TUs) were computed with an assumption of additivity. The acute toxicity of gasolines was predicted to within a factor of two for algae and daphnids. Predicted TUs overestimated toxicity to trout because of experimental factors that were not considered in the model. This analysis demonstrates the importance of aliphatic hydrocarbon loss to headspace during WAF preparation and the contribution of both aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons test to the toxicity of gasolines in closed systems and loss of aliphatics to headspace during WAF preparation. Model calculations indicate that satisfactory toxicity predictions can be achieved by describing gasoline composition using a limited number of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon blocks with different octanol-water partition coefficients.",

The FMM has produced remarkably accurate results, in addition to its efficiency. The efficiency of the FMM is due to its reduced computational complexity and memory requirement, which are both O(N-1.5). Comparison of the measured and computed BRCS values has resulted in a striking agreement, which serves to validate both of the prediction techniques.",

The potential for using lectins as a means of locating and \"anchoring\" a drug delivery system to a target site on a mucosal surface in order to promote controlled drug delivery and enhanced absorption has been described in previous work. Toxicity is evident for many lectins, and this study has investigated the cytotoxicity of lectins to cells derived from the cornea and conjunctiva. Cultures of transformed cell lines from the conjunctiva and cornea were exposed to solution of lectins, and the viability of these cells assessed by their ability to take up an MTT stain relative to the control. Clear evidence of lectin cytotoxicity was apparent for all of the lectins tested in this study, particularly at higher concentrations and over the longer (48 h) time period. This would raise issues with their potential use in targeted drug delivery systems. The lectins from Lycopersicon esculentum and Helix pomatia appeared to show the least cytotoxic activity and so could be considered the most promising. The lectins from Solanum tuberosum and Triticum vulgaris showed significant cytotoxicity, which contrasts with previous in-vivo studies. However, they might be considered for investigation as targeted therapeutic agents in the treatment of malignant diseases.",

The CHE-PAHy-Lac liposomes produced a significant improvement in the encapsulation efficiency of ODNs (28.73-51.37%) compared with conventional liposomes (9.88%). The in vivo results showed that the liposomes incorporating CHE-PAHy-Lac, which contained about 30% (w/w) galactosyl residues, exhibited marked accumulation in the liver and hepatic PC.

Phagocytic and NK activity were tested 72 and 96 h, respectively after the last four intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of the tested compounds have been administered to the mice. Phagocytic activity was evaluated in vitro by phagocytic index and ingestion capacity using a phagocytic assay. NK activity was evaluated in a direct cytotoxic test, in which PECs were used as effector cells while human erythroleukemic K-562 cells were used as target cells. The phagocytic activity of PECs, harvested from tumor-bearing mice, was stimulated after treatment with FR free, FR associated with polymer nanoparticles and with unloaded PBCN. The NK activity of PECs was strongly stimulated by unloaded PBCN. FR both free and encapsulated into the polymer matrix during the polymerization of n-butylcyanoacrylate (n-BCA) stimulated the NK activity of PECs, while FR adsorbed onto nanoparticles restrained it. These results suggest that the association of FR with nanoparticles modifies selectively its immunomodulating ability without producing any significant immunological disturbances. The toxicity of some of FR polymer forms towards PECs, displaying NK activity, probably comes from the enhanced local drug concentration on the membrane surface of the immune cells. However, it is insufficient to preclude the use of nanoparticles as drug delivery system.",

In this work, we sought to evaluate the copy number and expression of TPX2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumor tissues and to further explore the potential of TPX2 as a therapeutic target. Experimental Design: The DNA copy number and expression of the TPX2 gene were surveyed in pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumor tissues and compared with those of immortalized normal pancreatic ductal cells and normal pancreatic tissues. The cellular effects of TPX2 knockdown using small interfering RNA oligonuclecitides in pancreatic cancer cells, such as growth in tissue culture, in soft agar, and in nude mice; apoptosis; and sensitivity to paclitaxel, were also investigated using various assays. Results: Low-copy-number TPX2 amplification was found in pancreatic cancer cell lines and low-passage pancreatic cancer tumor xenografts. TPX2 expression was upregulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines at both the mRNA and protein levels relative to the immortalized pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line HPDE6. Immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray showed that TPX2 expression was higher in pancreatic tumors compared with their normal counterparts. Treatment with TPX2 targeting small interfering RNAs effectively reduced pancreatic cancer cell growth in tissue culture, induced apoptosis, and inhibited growth in soft agar and in nude mice. Knockdown of TPX2 also sensitized pancreatic cancer cells to paclitaxel treatment. Conclusions: Our results suggest that TPX2 might be an attractive target for pancreatic cancer therapy.

Recent advances in systems biology and pathway analysis can help make true rational design a reality through the integration of experimental observations with underlying cellular regulation and metabolic networks. It should enable the formulation of better and more informed testable hypotheses with regard to the most efficient target candidates.

        "abstract": "Aspartic acid semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH) lies at the first branch point in the essential aspartic acid biosynthetic pathway that is found in bacteria and plants but is absent from animals. Mutations in the asadh gene encoding ASADH produce an inactive enzyme, which is lethal. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the hypothesis that ASADH represents a new anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) target. An asadh promoter-replacement mutant MTB, designated MTB::asadh, in which asadh gene expression is regulated by pristinamycin, was constructed to investigate the physiological functions of ASADH in the host bacteria. Bacterial growth was evaluated by monitoring OD600 and ASADH expression was analyzed by Western blotting. The results showed that the growth and survival of MTB::asadh was completely inhibited in the absence of the inducer pristinamycin. Furthermore, the growth of the mutant was rigorously dependent on the presence of the inducer in the medium. The starved mutant exhibited a marked reduction (approximately 80%) in the cell wall materials compared to the wild-type, in addition to obvious morphological differences that were apparent in scanning electron microscopy studies; however, with the addition of pristinamycin, the cell wall contents and morphology similar to those of the wild-type strain were recovered. The starved mutant also exhibited almost no pathogenicity in an in vitro model of infection using mouse macrophage J774A.1 cells. The mutant showed a concentration-dependent recovery of pathogenicity with the addition of the inducer. These findings implicate ASADH as a promising target for the development of novel anti-MTB drugs.",

To investigate whether SAG serves as an anticancer target, we determined the effect of SAG silencing on cell proliferation, survival and radiosensitivity. Experimental Design\u2014SAG protein expression in human tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining using tumor tissue arrays.

        "abstract": "The mevalonate pathway is essential in eukaryotes and responsible for a diversity of fundamental synthetic activities. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway and is targeted by the ubiquitous statin drugs to treat hypercholesterolemia. Independent reports have indicated the cidal effects of statins against the flatworm parasite, S. mansoni, and the possibility that SmHMGR is a useful drug target to develop new statin-based anti-schistosome therapies. For six commercially available statins, we demonstrate concentration- and time-dependent killing of immature (somule) and adult S. mansoni in vitro at sub-micromolar and micromolar concentrations, respectively. Cidal activity trends with statin lipophilicity whereby simvastatin and pravastatin are the most and least active, respectively. Worm death is preventable by excess mevalonate, the product of HMGR. Statin activity against somules was quantified both manually and automatically using a new, machine learning-based automated algorithm with congruent results. In addition, to chemical targeting, RNA interference (RNAi) of HMGR also kills somules in vitro and, again, lethality is blocked by excess mevalonate. Further, RNAi of HMGR of somules in vitro subsequently limits parasite survival in a mouse model of infection by up to 80%. Parasite death, either via statins or specific RNAi of HMGR, is associated with activation of apoptotic caspase activity. Together, our genetic and chemical data confirm that S. mansoni HMGR is an essential gene and the relevant target of statin drugs. We discuss our findings in context of a potential drug development program and the desired product profile for a new schistosomiasis drug.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive histologic subtype of brain cancer with poor outcomes and limited treatment options. Here, we report the selective overexpression of the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 as a novel candidate theranostic target in this disease. PRMT5 silences the transcription of regulatory genes by catalyzing symmetric dimethylation of arginine residues on histone tails. PRMT5 overexpression in patient-derived primary tumors and cell lines correlated with cell line growth rate and inversely with overall patient survival. Genetic attenuation of PRMT5 led to cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and loss of cell migratory activity. Cell death was p53-independent but caspase-dependent and enhanced with temozolomide, a chemotherapeutic agent used as a present standard of care. Global gene profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation identified the tumor suppressor ST7 as a key gene silenced by PRMT5. Diminished ST7 expression was associated with reduced patient survival. PRMT5 attenuation limited PRMT5 recruitment to the ST7 promoter, led to restored expression of ST7 and cell growth inhibition. Finally, PRMT5 attenuation enhanced glioblastoma cell survival in a mouse xenograft model of aggressive glioblastoma. Together, our findings defined PRMT5 as a candidate prognostic factor and therapeutic target in glioblastoma, offering a preclinical justification for targeting PRMT5-driven oncogenic pathways in this deadly disease.",

PLK1 has also been regarded as a valuable target for cancer treatment, and several PLK1 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical investigations. In this study, our data show that the expression level of PLK1 is upregulated in human pancreatic cancer cells. Molecular modeling studies indicate that DMTC inhibits PLK1 activity through competitive displacement of ATP from its binding pocket. Our data further show that DMTC suppresses the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells and induces the formation of multinucleated cells, ultimately resulting in apoptosis. In addition, combination index analysis demonstrates that DMTC acts synergistically with the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine in inhibiting the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. These results thus suggest a potential of using PLK1 inhibitors for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

Three are a newly described deletion of I836 and the others are D835 mutations. The recently described FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 proved cytotoxic to Ba/F3 cells dependent upon activated FLT3 containing either mutation. PKC412 is also differentially cytotoxic to leukemia cells with MLL translocations and FLT3 that is activated by either overexpression of the wild-type receptor or mutation.

RNA interference (RNAi), with its ability to induce specific gene silencing in mammalian cells, represents a powerful technology to investigate and validate the function of pharmaceutical target genes in vitro and in vivo. The aim of the present study was to systematically explore RNAi-mediated gene-silencing of known T cell-specific model signaling molecules in primary murine T cells in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We demonstrate that siRNA delivery and subsequent silencing of T cell specific genes is substantially increased, if murine T cells were activated prior siRNA transfection. Silencing of ZAP70, p56Lck as well as PLC-gamma1 protein expression resulted in impaired function of T cells in vitro. Furthermore, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) was ameliorated in vivo after adoptive transfer of ZAP70-silenced T cells. COCLUSION: The combination of RNAi-mediated gene silencing and adoptive transfer of gene-silenced T cells, thus, may allow the identification and analysis of T cell-specific targets for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, this model system may represent an alternative to conventional time consuming and cost intensive gene targeting approaches.",

        "abstract": "With the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, many new projects to sequence bacterial genomes were started and soon many complete bacterial genome sequences were available. The sequenced genomes of pathogenic bacteria provide useful information for understanding host-pathogen interactions. These data prove to be a new weapon in fighting against pathogenic bacteria by providing information about potential drug targets. But the limitation of computational tools for finding potential drug targets has hindered the process and further experimental analysis. There are many in silico approaches proposed for finding drug targets but only few have been automated. One such approach finds essential genes in bacterial genomes with no human homologue and predicts these as potential drug targets. The same approach is used in our tool. T-iDT, a tool for the identification of drug targets, finds essential genes by comparing a bacterial gene set against DEG (Database of Essential Genes) and excludes homologue genes by comparing against a human protein database. The tool predicts both the set of essential genes as well as potential target genes for the given genome. The tool was tested with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and results were validated. With default parameters, the tool predicted 236 essential genes and 52 genes to encode potential drug targets. A pathway-based approach was used to validate these potential drug target genes. The pathway in which the products of these genes are involved was determined. Our analysis shows that almost all these pathways are very essential for the bacterial survival and hence these genes encode possible drug targets. Our tool provides a fast method for finding possible drug targets in bacterial genomes with varying stringency level. The tool will be helpful in finding possible drug targets in various pathogenic organisms and can be used for further analysis in novel therapeutic drug development.

We investigated whether inhibition of AXL activity by specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is efficient in limiting proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. Expression of AXL was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 42 PDAC. The AXL role in oncogenesis was studied using the short hairpin RNA approach in a pancreatic carcinoma cell line. We further generated antihuman AXL mAbs and evaluated their inhibitory effects and the AXL downstream signaling pathways first in vitro, in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines and then in vivo, using subcutaneous or orthotopic pancreatic tumor xenografts. AXL receptor was found expressed in 76% (32/42) of PDAC and was predominantly present in invasive cells. The AXL-knockdown Panc-1 cells decreased in vitro cell migration, survival and proliferation, and reduced in vivo tumor growth. Two selected anti-AXL mAbs (D9 and E8), which inhibited phosphorylation of AXL and of its downstream target AKT without affecting growth arrest-specific factor 6 (GAS6) binding, induced downexpression of AXL by internalization, leading to an inhibition of proliferation and migration in the four pancreatic cancer cell lines studied. In vivo, treatment by anti-AXL mAbs significantly reduced growth of both subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic tumor xenografts independently of their KRAS mutation status. Our in vitro and preclinical in vivo data demonstrate that anti-human AXL mAbs could represent a new approach to the pancreatic cancer immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "PAX genes are frequently overexpressed in human cancer tissue and appear to contribute to the tumor phenotype, suggesting that they may be potential targets for cancer therapy. In particular, aberrant PAX2 expression has been reported in a high proportion of primary tumors, including the majority of renal cell carcinomas (RCC). We recently demonstrated that PAX2 suppresses cisplatin-induced apoptosis in cultured RCC cells. We hypothesized that silencing of PAX2 expression might partially overcome the notorious resistance of renal cell carcinomas to chemotherapy in vivo. In this report, we show that a PAX2 shRNA successfully knocks down PAX2 mRNA and protein levels in an RCC cell line (ACHN). ACHN cells stably transfected with shRNAs targeted against the PAX2 homeodomain are 3-6-fold more susceptible to cisplatin-induced caspase-3 activation than control ACHN cells line. Furthermore, growth of subcutaneous ACHN/shPAX2 xenografts in nude mice is significantly more responsive to cisplatin therapy than control ACHN cell tumors. Our observations validate PAX2 as a potential therapeutic gene target in renal cancer and suggest that adjunctive PAX2 knockdown may enhance the efficacy of other chemotherapeutic agents. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "Chemotherapy of malaria parasites is limited by established drug resistance and lack of novel targets. Intraerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum are wholly dependent on host glucose for energy. Glucose uptake is mediated by a parasite-encoded facilitative hexose transporter (PfHT). We report that O-3 hexose derivatives inhibit uptake of glucose and fructose by PfHT when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Selectivity of these derivatives for PfHT is confirmed by lack of inhibition of hexose transport by the major mammalian glucose and fructose transporters (Gluts) 1 and 5. A long chain O-3 hexose derivative is the most effective inhibitor of PfHT and also kills P. falciparum when it is cultured in medium containing either glucose or fructose as a carbon source. To extend our observations to the second most important human malarial pathogen, we have cloned and expressed the Plasmodium vivax orthologue of PfHT, and demonstrate inhibition of glucose uptake by the long chain O-3 hexose derivative. Furthermore, multiplication of Plasmodium berghei in a mouse model is significantly reduced by the O-3 derivative. Our robust expression system conclusively validates PfHT as a novel drug target and is an important step in the development of novel antimalarials directed against membrane transport proteins.",

A biochemical screen of AstraZeneca's compound library using GlmU of Escherichia coli identified novel sulfonamide inhibitors of the acetyl transferase reaction. Steady state kinetics, ligand-observe NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry and X-ray crystallography showed that the inhibitors were competitive with acetyl-CoA substrate. Iterative chemistry efforts improved biochemical potency against Gram-negative isozymes 300-fold and afforded antimicrobial activity against a strain of Haemophilus influenzae lacking its major efflux pump. Inhibition of precursor incorporation into bacterial macromolecules was consistent with the antimicrobial activity being caused by disruption of peptidoglycan and fatty acid biosyntheses. Isolation and characterization of two different resistant mutant strains identified the GlmU acetyl transferase domain as the molecular target. These data, along with X-ray co-crystal structures, confirmed the binding mode of the inhibitors and explained their relative lack of potency against Gram-positive GlmU isozymes.

We also determined the inhibitory effect of mycophenolic acid (MPA) on recombinant BgIMPDH (rBgIMPDH) activity and the Babesia-growths in vitro. The translated BgIMPDH peptide contained thirteen amino acid residues responsible for substrate and cofactor binding in its catalytic domain with Gly374 in BgIMPDH being replaced by Ser388 in mammalian IMPDH. The native BgIMPDH enzyme in the parasite was approximately 54-kDa a mass similar to His-tag rBgIMPDH protein. The Km values of the rBgIMPDH were 8.18\u00b10.878 (mean\u00b1standard error of the mean) \u03bcM and 360.80\u00b143.41\u03bcM for IMP and NAD+, respectively. MPA inhibited the rBgIMPDH activity yielding a Ki value of 20.93\u00b11.83\u03bcM with respect to NAD+. For Babesia growths, the IC50s were 0.95\u00b10.21 and 2.88\u00b10.49\u03bcM for B. gibsoni and B. bovis, respectively.

We present two flexible methods, the variable component mixture model and the semiparametric mixture model, that remove the restrictive parametric assumptions in the mixture modeling approach of PeptideProphet. Using a control protein mixture data set generated on an linear ion trap Fourier transform (LTQ-FT) mass spectrometer, we demonstrate that both methods improve parametric models in terms of the accuracy of probability estimates and the power to detect correct identifications controlling the false discovery rate to the same degree.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While the majority of studies have focused on the association between sex hormones and dementia, emerging evidence supports the role of other hormone signals in increasing dementia risk. However, due to the lack of an integrated view on mechanistic interactions of hormone signaling pathways associated with dementia, molecular mechanisms through which hormones contribute to the increased risk of dementia has remained unclear and capacity of translating hormone signals to potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications in relation to dementia has been undervalued.\\n\\nMETHODS: Using an integrative knowledge- and data-driven approach, a global hormone interaction network in the context of dementia was constructed, which was further filtered down to a model of convergent hormone signaling pathways. This model was evaluated for its biological and clinical relevance through pathway recovery test, evidence-based analysis, and biomarker-guided analysis. Translational validation of the model was performed using the proposed novel mechanism discovery approach based on 'serendipitous off-target effects'.\\n\\nRESULTS: Our results reveal the existence of a well-connected hormone interaction network underlying dementia. Seven hormone signaling pathways converge at the core of the hormone interaction network, which are shown to be mechanistically linked to the risk of dementia. Amongst these pathways, estrogen signaling pathway takes the major part in the model and insulin signaling pathway is analyzed for its association to learning and memory functions. Validation of the model through serendipitous off-target effects suggests that hormone signaling pathways substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The integrated network model of hormone interactions underlying dementia may serve as an initial translational platform for identifying potential therapeutic targets and candidate biomarkers for dementia-spectrum disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.",

A previous study (H. R. Onishi, B. A. Pelak, L. S. Gerckens, L. L. Silver, F. M. Kahan, M. H. Chen, A. A. Patchett, S. M. Galloway, S. A. Hyland, M. S. Anderson, and C. R. H. Raetz, Science 274:980-982, 1996) identified a series of synthetic LpxC-inhibitory molecules that were bactericidal for Escherichia coli. These molecules did not inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and were therefore not developed further as antibacterial drugs. The inactivity of the LpxC inhibitors for P. aeruginosa raised the possibility that LpxC activity might not be essential for all gram-negative bacteria. By placing the lpxC gene of P. aeruginosa under tight control of an arabinose-inducible promoter, we demonstrated the essentiality of LpxC activity for P. aeruginosa. It was found that compound L-161,240, the most potent inhibitor from the previous study, was active against a P. aeruginosa construct in which the endogenous lpxC gene was inactivated and in which LpxC activity was supplied by the lpxC gene from E. coli. Conversely, an E. coli construct in which growth was dependent on the P. aeruginosa lpxC gene was resistant to the compound. The differential activities of L-161,240 against the two bacterial species are thus the result primarily of greater potency toward the E. coli enzyme rather than of differences in the intrinsic resistance of the bacteria toward antibacterial compounds due to permeability or efflux. These data validate P. aeruginosa LpxC as a target for novel antibiotic drugs and should help direct the design of inhibitors against clinically important gram-negative bacteria.",

The chosen conformance indexes compare the delineations in two different forms: as a voxel grid and as a surface mesh. In this paper each of the conformance indexes is calculated in three different modes: the standard mode where all differences between datasets are taken into account and two more measuring how much one dataset exceeds the other. The last two modes are not symmetrical. The proposed conformance indexes allowed us to compare efficiently two delineations. The presented results also allow to state that the use of mesh reconstruction algorithms can improve delineations prepared within a limited time frame.",

The most fundamental challenge in miRNA biology is to define the rules of miRNA target recognition. This is critical since the biological role of individual miRNAs will be dictated by the mRNAs that they regulate. Therefore, only as target mRNAs are validated will it be possible to establish commonalities that will enable more precise predictions of miRNA/mRNA interactions. Currently there is no clear agreement as to what experimental procedures should be followed to demonstrate that a given mRNA is a target of a specific miRNA.

The germination of A. thaliana seeds was also completely inhibited with 62.5 ??M TPTA, but it was rescued to 85-92% with the supplement of biotin biosynthesis intermediates such as 0.5 mM of biotin, dethiobiotin, and 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid, but not by 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA). However, additional supplement of 0.5 mM S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) with 0.5 mM KAPA rescued up to 91% of the germination previously inhibited by the 50 ??M TPTA. Also, biotin supplements alleviated the growth inhibition of 40-day-old A. thaliana plant. Foliar application of TPTA induced 8-fold higher substrate (l-alanine) accumulation in the treated A. thaliana plants. RNA expression for KAPAS transcripts were much fainter in the lane representing leaf tissue treated with TPTA. With these results, we report that SAM is an essential donor of amino groups for synthesis of the biotin precursor KAPA to 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA) synthesis in plants, that KAPAS is a potential herbicidal target site in the biotin biosynthesis pathway, and that TPTA might be one of the potential KAPAS inhibitors. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The magnetic responsivity and in vitro release behavior of these MS were studied in detail. The in vivo distribution and targeting delivery of 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) magnetic MS after artery administration were studied in rat.

In this study, the optimized nanoparticles were characterized for morphology, mean particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, drug-loading content, X-ray diffractometer measurement, and in vitro release. The obtained nanoparticles were spherical and intact. The mean particle size was 192.5 nm with polydispersity index being 0.029 and zeta potential - 26.27 mV. The mean entrapment efficiency and loading of tanshinone IIA (TSIIA) in TS-PLA-NPs were 86.35 and 1.61%, respectively. The in vitro release study was performed at pH 7.4 using a dialysis membrane. Without initial burst effect, the TSIIA sustained release from TS-PLA-NPs for more than 7 days. The mean in vitro cumulative release percentage of TSIIA from TS-PLA-NPs vs. time curve fitted well with the Higuchi Equation (Q = 2.0365 + 13.564 x t(1/2), r = 0.9950). In pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution studies, the concentrations of TSIIA are higher in hepatoma and lower in blood, heart, kidney, spleen, and lung at 2 h after TS-PLA-NPs was administered via caudal vein. TS-PLA-NPs were effective in destroying the human liver cancer cells by the Mono-nuclear cell direct cytotoxicity assay (MTT) assay, and the growth-inhibitory effect of TS-PLA-NPs on human liver cancer cells was concentration and time dependent. The effect of TS-PLA-NPs on hepatoma in mice was also performed. The results of TS-PLA-NPs were markedly more effective than both of TSIIA and blank PLA nanoparticles in preventing tumor growth and increasing survival time of mice with hepatoma. This study provided support for the new paradigm, the application of TSIIA for the treatment of hepatoma.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of mesoporous silica for cancer targeting is increasing rapidly. The association between rigid model of nanoparticles such as mesoporous silica and biological compounds with affinity for oncological diseases is a very promising drug targeting system nowadays. METHODS: In this study, we used the mesoporous silica (SBA-15) associated with aptamer (functionalized for the tumor marker MUC-1). RESULTS: The results obtained in the characterization were quite interesting and demonstrated that the silica produced were very uniform and with a size range of 50-100 nm. Thus, the results of cytotoxicity demonstrated that there is no cytotoxicity related to the nanoparticle. CONCLUSION: We conclude that although further studies are required, the nanoparticle mesoporous silica model loaded with aptamer is very functional and its use can be widespread for other application especially in nuclear medicine.",

        "abstract": "1,5-diazaanthraquinones (DAQs) are promising anticancer drugs, however, their clinical potential is limited due to poor solubility. Conjugation of anticancer agents to hydrophilic water-soluble polymers can overcome this problem and has already been used to generate conjugates with demonstrated clinical benefit. Here a library of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer conjugates containing a novel amino-functionalised 1,5-diazaanthraquinone derivative (amino-DAQ) have been synthesised. The conjugates were fully characterised by UV, HPLC, SEC, FT-Raman and NMR spectroscopy. Conjugation to HPMA copolymers improved amino-DAQ aqueous solubility (>7-fold). The HPMA copolymer-amino-DAQ conjugates were slightly less haemolytic than the parent compound (2% Hb released in 1 h for conjugate HPMA copolymer-GFLG (5 mol%)-amino-DAQ conjugate compared to 13% obtained with amino-DAQ). When conjugates were incubated with isolated rat liver lysosomal enzymes (Tritosomes) the rate of amino-DAQ release was influenced by both drug loading and the composition of the peptidyl side chain used to link the drug to the carrier. The higher the drug loading the lower the rate of drug release. Whereas the GG linker did not release amino-DAQ, up to 26% of the amino-DAQ was released from a GFLG linker over 24 h. The in vitro cytotoxicity of these conjugates was evaluated against two different cell lines, B16F10 murine melanoma and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. HPMA copolymer-amino-DAQ conjugates, which are internalised by cells by the endocytic pathway, showed much lower in vitro cytotoxicity (IC50 for HPMA copolymer-GFLG (5 mol%)-amino-DAQ conjugate>397 microM drug-equiv.) than the free drug (the IC50 for amino-DAQ was 12.6 and 2.8 microM against the B16F10 murine melanoma and the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, respectively). Nonetheless, the observed lysosomal activation of the HPMA copolymer-GFLG-amino-DAQ conjugates, suggests that evaluation of the antitumour potential in vivo is warranted.",

In this study, a modified AS1411 was labeled with (99m)Tc and evaluated as a potential tumor-targeting agent for imaging. The AS1411 aptamer was conjugated with HYNIC and labeled with (99m)Tc in the presence a co-ligand. Radiochemical purity and stability testing of the (99m)Tc-HYNIC-AS1411 aptamer were carried out with thin layer chromatography and a size-exclusion column in normal saline and human serum. Cellular nucleolin-specific binding, cellular internalization in DU-145 cells, as high levels of nucleolin expression, were performed. Additionally, biodistribution in normal mice and DU-145 tumour-bearing mice was assessed. Radiolabeling of the aptamer resulted in a reasonable yield and radiochemical purity after purification. The aptamer was stable in normal saline and human serum, and cellular experiments demonstrated specific binding of the AS1411 aptamer to the nucleolin protein. Based on biodistribution assessment of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-AS1411, rapid blood clearance was seen after injection and it appears that the excretion route was via the urinary system at 1 h post-injection. Tumours also showed a higher accumulation of radioactivity with this labeled aptamer. (99m)Tc-AS1411 can be a potential tool for the molecular imaging of nucleolin-overexpressing cancers.",

Male Balb-c mice were treated via intraperitoneal injections with 7-NI (15 mg/kg), ODQ (3, 10 mg/kg), L-arginine (100 mg/kg) + 7-NI (15 mg/kg), or physiological saline. ODQ (3 mg/kg) and 7-NI (15 mg/kg) significantly increased the second-day latency in the mEPM test. 7-NI (15 mg/kg) and ODQ (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the escape latency in second, third, and fourth sessions, decreased the time spent in the escape platform's quadrant, and increased the mean distance to the platform in the probe trial of the MWM test. ODQ (3, 10 mg/kg) and 7-NI (15 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of errors, whereas only 7-NI increased the latency in the RAM test. The administration of L-arginine (100 mg/kg) prior to 7-NI inverted the effects of 7-NI, which supports the role of NO on cognition. Our study shows that the NO/cGMP/GS pathway can regulate spatial memory in mice.",

Particle size, polydispersity, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, drug release profile, and micelles morphology were evaluated and characterized by various methods including high-performance liquid chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Cellular uptake of micelles was evaluated with fluorescence imaging coupled with HPLC method. Cytotoxicity of FN micelles and free FN was compared using MTT method. In vivo imaging was employed to assess the accumulation of DiR micelles and free DiR at tumor site. The antitumor effect of FN micelles was examined in tumor-bearing mice. The results showed that prepared FN micelles had an average particle diameter of 111.91\u2009\u00b1\u20095.82\u2009nm with good stability. FN micelles enhanced the cellular uptake and improved cell cytotoxicity than free FN. Furthermore, DiR micelles quickly accumulated at the tumor site than free DiR. FN micelles significantly improved tumor inhibition rate compared to that observed with free FN in tumor-bearing mice with great biosafety. Thus, FN micelles demonstrated a clear treatment advantage and provided an ideal drug administration system to improve the antitumor effect of FN.",

In this study, we used the UTMD technique to investigate the inhibitory effect of our developed novel reagent on MM cancer stem cells (CD138(-)CD34(-)MM CSCs) that are MM cells with CD138(-)CD34(-) phenotypes, responsible for MM-initiating potential, drug resistance and eventual relapse. The preparatory steps of novel reagent was first epirubicin (EPI)-loaded in the lipid MBs that was consisted of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-biotin, dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylglycerol and 25-NBD-cholesterol, then anti-ABCG2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was conjugated onto the MB surface to form EPI-MBs+mAb. CD138(-)CD34(-)MM CSCs were isolated from human MM RPMI 8226 cell line by the magnetic associated cell sorting method. The results showed that the attenuated proliferation, migration and invasion ability, and increased apoptosis were observed when MM CSCs were incubated with a various agents. EPI-MBs+mAb combined with therapeutic ultrasound significantly promoted the MM CSC apoptosis compared with EPI, EPI-MBs alone or EPI-MBs+mAb without ultrasound exposure. These results suggest that the developed EPI-MBs+mAb combined with therapeutic ultrasound remarkably induced MM CSC apoptosis in vitro.",

MRP2 expression demonstrates plasticity. Caco-2 cells, a routine in vitro model for predicting oral bioavailability, are often cultured in media containing antibiotics. We have investigated whether exposure of Caco-2 cells to two common antibiotic regimes alters MRP2 functional expression. Caco-2 cells were grown in the presence or absence of either gentamicin or penicillin-streptomycin for up to 9 weeks. MRP2 functional activity was assessed by calcein efflux across the apical membrane. MRP2 protein expression was determined by immunoblots. Neither antibiotic regime resulted in consistent changes in calcein efflux across the apical membrane (reflecting MRP2 activity) or basolateral membrane (reflecting MRP3 and possibly MRP6 activity) of Caco-2 cells. MRP2 protein expression also showed no change in response to antibiotic exposure. Routine exposure of Caco-2 cells to penicillin-streptomycin or gentamicin does not affect apical MRP2 functional activity in intestinal enterocytic Caco-2 cells. Extrapolating these results to the situation in vivo suggests that the oral bioavailability of MRP substrates is not predicted to be influenced by recent courses of antibiotics.",

The microbubbles were characterised via optical microscopy to determine the relationship between the size-distribution obtained and the process variables, specifically the flow rates of the phospholipid suspension and air (Q(l) and Q(g)), and the applied voltage (V). The formation of microbubbles in the device was also studied using high-speed photography. For the range of parameters investigated, the bubble diameter was found to scale with the product of the flow rate ratio (Q(l)/Q(g)) and the applied voltage, with a consistent bubble diameter of 5.1 +/- 2 microm being obtained at Q(l)/Q(g) = 1.7 and V = 18 kV.

        "abstract": "The plasma proteins adsorbing onto intravenously injected carriers are considered to be crucial factors determining the organ distribution. Plasma protein adsorption patterns were analyzed on solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) stabilized with Tween 80 or stabilized with poloxamer 188. The binding patterns were determined by applying two different sample preparation methods, i.e. removal of the SLN from the plasma by (a) centrifugation and (b) gel filtration to assess, if the separation method has an effect on the patterns obtained. The Tween 80-modified SLN adsorbed the major plasma proteins known from particles with blood-brain barrier specificity. Poloxamer 188-surface modified SLN adsorbed the proteins known from model particles that exhibit prolonged circulation time in the blood. It is concluded that the biodegradable SLN stabilized with Tween 80 can potentially be used as drug carriers to the blood-brain barrier having a relatively long residence time in the blood stream. For the poloxamer 188-stabilized SLN a relatively long resistance time in the blood is predicted leading to potential accumulation in the bone marrow when looking at the distinct CII/CIII adsorption.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Magnetic drug targeting (MDT) is a new treatment principle for tumors. Passive MDT (pMDT) uses cytostatics coupled to ferromagnetic nanoparticles, whereas in active MDT (aMDT), extracorporeal magnets are additionally placed over the tumor area. PURPOSE: Mitoxantrone-magnetite-dextran composite particles were used to assess the distribution and effect of MDT. METHODS: We conducted two trials with n = 60 rats transfected with R(1)H rhabdomyosarcoma cells. In the biodistribution trial (n = 36) mitoxantrone concentrations in tumor tissue versus plasma were measured after one or two dose administration for aMDT, pMDT, and uncoupled mitoxantrone. The dose/effect trial (n = 24) assessed change in tumor volume at day 1 and 7 days after administration of 4, 6, or 8 doses of mitoxantrone using aMDT. RESULTS: Mitoxantrone-magnetite-dextran concentration in blood was significantly (p < 0.05) lower when using aMDT and as low as uncoupled mitoxantrone. Concentrations in tumor tissue were always significantly higher using MDT when compared to uncoupled mitoxantrone. Two doses resulted in drug accumulation inside the tumor. Tumor growth was significantly decreased with four doses using aMDT versus no treatment. Tumor size on day 8 versus day 1 was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced after administration of six doses of mitoxantrone-magnetite-dextran. No allergies/toxic reactions were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The MDT achieves higher levels of cytostatics in tumor tissue without increased systemic concentrations and succeeds in reducing tumor volume.",

The localized delivery of this drug in this regard would be highly beneficial with respect to safety as well as efficacy.\\n\\nMETHODS: In the current studies, an endeavor has been made to investigate the efficacy of topically applied liposome-encapsulated TAM on skin cancer model. The drug was encapsulated in phospholipid-based vesicular systems viz. conventional liposomes and elastic liposomes. Incidence of papillomas and histopathological examination were employed to determine the efficacy of the tested formulations.\\n\\nRESULTS: The results demonstrated carrier-dependent strong inhibition of skin carcinogenesis with encapsulated drug vis-\u00e0-vis drug in the solution form. The encouraging findings from the current work construe immense potential of the TAM-loaded liposomal systems in the management of skin cancer.",

The bidirectional transport of Nos was studied in Caco-2 and MDCK cell monolayers at pH 5.0-7.8. The effect of 0.5% w/v chitosan (CH) or Captisol (CP) on Nos permeability was investigated at pH 5.0 and 5.8. The effect of 1-5% w/v of CP on oral bioavailability of Nos (150 mg/kg) was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats. The effective permeability coefficients (Peff) of Nos across Caco-2 and MDCK cell monolayers was found to be in the order of pH 5.0 > 5.8 > 6.8 > 7.8. The efflux ratios of Peff < 2 demonstrated that active efflux does not limit the absorption of Nos. The use of CH or CP have shown significant (***, p < 0.001) enhancement in Peff of Nos across cell monolayer compared with the control group. The CP (1-5% w/v) based Nos formulations resulted in significant (***, p < 0.001) increase in the bioavailability of Nos compared with Nos solution. The use of CP represents viable approach for enhancing the oral bioavailability of Nos and reducing the required dose.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in skin carcinogenesis is well documented. Natural molecules, like sesamol, with marked antioxidant potential can be useful in combating skin cancers. In vitro antiproliferative (using MTT assay) and DNA fragmentation studies in HL 60 cell lines, confirmed the apoptotic nature of sesamol. However, it showed a significant flux across the mice skin upon topical application, such that its local availability in skin is limited. Former is attributed mainly to its properties like small size, low molecular weight (138.28), and a sufficient lipid and water solubility (log P 1.29; solubility 38.8 mg/ml). To achieve its maximum epicutaneous delivery, packaging it into a suitable carrier system is thus indicated. Sesamol-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (S-SLN) were thus prepared with particle size of 127.9 nm (PI: 0.256) and entrapment efficiency of 88.21%. Topical application of S-SLN in a cream base indicated significant retention in the skin with minimal flux across skin as confirmed by the in-vivo skin retention and ex-vivo skin permeation studies. In vivo anticancer studies performed on TPA-induced and benzo(a)pyrene initiated tumour production (ROS mediated) in mouse epidermis showed the normalization (in histology studies) of skin cancers post their induction, upon treatment with S-SLN.",

We hypothesized that the efficient delivery of 5-fluorouracil to tumors using a magnetic colloid could reduce the dose required to bring out sufficient therapeutic response. Thus, we have formulated a 5-fluorouracil-loaded magnetic nanomedicine consisting of a magnetic core (iron) and a biocompatible polymeric shell (ethylcellulose), suitable for parenteral administration. These core/shell nanoparticles were synthesized by an emulsion solvent evaporation process. Two drug loading methods were analyzed: the first one based on 5-fluorouracil surface adsorption onto the preformed nanoparticles, and the second method being drug addition prior to the emulsion solvent evaporation process leading to drug entrapment into the polymeric network. 5-Fluorouracil entrapment into the polymeric matrix yielded a higher drug loading and a slower drug release profile as compared with drug adsorption. Finally, as a proof of concept, Prussian blue staining has demonstrated the considerable accumulation of these magnetically guided composite nanoparticles in the tumors, suggesting the potential of this stimuli-sensitive drug carrier for the efficient treatment of cancer by active targeting.",

In this paper, we are going to report the results from our observations on the way folic acid targeted and non-targeted PEGyl-DSPC liposomal doxorubicin particles penetrate into solid tumor tissue.\\n\\nMETHODS: Subcutaneous transplanted murine L1210JF solid tumors in mice were used as a model. PEGyl liposomal doxorubicins were injected through tail venue, and tumor tissue samples were collected at special time points. Cryosections were cut and dried by a flowing of air after mounted on the slides right away. Then the dried cryosections were stained in water systems; the blood vessel cells were stained with green fluorescent FITC labeled antibody against CD31 antigen; the nuclei of the living cells were stained with a blue fluorescent dye DAPI. Since the whole procedure was carried out in aquatic system, the red color fluorescent liposomal doxorubicin particles remain visible under fluorescence microscope.\\n\\nRESULTS: Both folate conjugated and non-conjugated PEGyl-DSPC liposomal doxorubicin particles were only leaking out from the broken holes of blood vessels with a special direction and spread out for a limited distance, which was similar to the results showed before, in that observation a latex microsphere sample was used as a model.",

Methods: H22 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) xenograft transplantation model was generated in UTMD study. BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups: doxorubicin HCl liposomal injection (DOX), DOX + US, UTMD, DOX + UTMD, H22 liver tumor control (CH control) and blank control group. The therapeutic schedule started on day 4 after tumor inoculation. Results: Average survival time of the animal model was approximately 18 d. The UTMD therapy parameters were optimized in the H22 mouse model to be: microbubble (MB) diameter, 2.30 +/- 0.25 mum; MB density, 4.0 x 109 bubbles/ml; treatment dose, 0.2 ml per 20 g mouse body weight; sonication frequency, 1.3 MHz; and sonication power, 2.06 W/cm2. Mice treated with DOX + UTMD had the smallest tumor volume and weight (p < 0.001), and the highest tumor inhibition rate (p < 0.01), intratumoral DOX concentration (p < 0.001) and survival rate among all tumor-burden groups (p < 0.001). Cell viability in different treatment groups was also assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Conclusion: An improved antitumor effect was observed with the combination therapy of DOX and UTMD, as compared with treatment with DOX, DOX + US or UTMD, which implicates a novel approach for HCC treatment.",

VP lowered the phase transition pH of the copolymers but did not affect the onset of micellization. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the copolymers was evaluated on EMT-6 mouse mammary tumor cells in comparison to Cremophor EL (CRM). The anticancer photosensitizer aluminum chloride phthalocyanine (AlClPc) was loaded into the PM with a standard dialysis procedure. Biodistribution and in vivo photodynamic activity were then evaluated in Balb/c mice bearing intradermal EMT-6 tumors. All NIPAM copolymers demonstrated substantially lower cell cytotoxicity than the control surfactant CRM. In vivo, similar AlClPc tumor uptake was observed for the PM and CRM formulations. However, the PM appeared to exhibit greater activity in vivo than CRM formulation at an AlClPc subtherapeutic dose. Therefore, NIPAM-based copolymers containing VP units represent promising alternatives for the formulation of poorly water-soluble phthalocyanines.",

Here we describe the design and synthesis of novel polypeptide-based nanogels with hydrophobic moieties in the cross-linked ionic cores. Diblock copolymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(L-glutamic acid), hydrophobically modified with L-phenylalanine methyl ester moieties was used for controlled template synthesis of nanogels with small size (ca. 70 nm in diameter) and narrow particle size distribution. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence studies using coumarin C153 indicated the existence of hydrophobic domains in the ionic cores of the nanogels. Stable doxorubicin-loaded nanogels were prepared at high drug capacity (30 w/w%). We show that nanogels are enzymatically-degradable leading to accelerated drug release under simulated lysosomal acidic pH. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nanogel-based formulation of doxorubicin is well tolerated and exhibit an improved antitumor activity compared to a free doxorubicin in an ovarian tumor xenograft mouse model. Our results signify the point to a potential of these biodegradable nanogels as attractive carriers for delivery of chemotherapeutics.",

The used polymers were dextrin, chondroitin sulfate and albumin. Under room temperature, EPO solution was added to high concentration of polymer solution and microneedles were prepared by forming thread with polypropylene tips. The mean weight of microneedle was 0.59 +/- 0.01 mg and length and basal diameter were 3.24 +/- 0.16 and 0.55 +/- 0.03 mm, respectively. Four microneedles were percutaneously (pc) administered to mice at the EPO dose levels of 100 IU/kg. After administration, blood samples were collected for 24 h and serum EPO levels were measured. Dextrin EPO microneedles were administered both pc and subcutaneously (sc) to mice. Serum EPO levels vs. time profiles showed Cmax of 138.6 +/- 16.1 and 146.5 +/- 8.0 mIU/ml, respectively. Tmax were 7.5 h. The values of bioavailability (BA) of EPO were 82.1 and 99.4%, respectively. By decreasing the dose from 100 to 50 and 25 IU/kg, dose-dependent serum EPO levels vs. time profiles were not clearly obtained.

The development of new practical treatment modalities for the treatment of AD is currently a highly active area of research. Our lack of success in the development of effective therapies for AD is attributed to, but not limited to a number of factors including the complexity of the brain. Besides this, it is recognized that AD is multisystemic in nature and this presents numerous difficulties for the potential treatment of these disorders. Another important reason for the lack of development of effective drugs and drug delivery system for AD is inability to deliver drugs effectively to the brain due to the numerous protective barriers surrounding the CNS i.e. blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) and circumventricular organs (CVOs). Solutions to these problems require enhanced novel research activities that can address each of these problems. This review article provides a concise movement into the current and future applications of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems for the treatment of AD and explores the application of nanotechnology in clinical neuroscience to develop innovative therapeutic modalities for the AD.",

        "abstract": "The efflux transport of pentazocine (PTZ) from the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was investigated using the Brain Efflux Index method. PTZ was eliminated with the apparent elimination half-life of 13.0 min after microinjection into the parietal cortex area 2 region of the rat brain. The apparent efflux clearance of PTZ across the BBB was 137 microl/min/g brain, which was calculated from the elimination rate constant (5.35 x 10(-2) min(-1) and the distribution volume in the brain (2.56 ml/g brain). The efflux transport of PTZ was decreased in the presence of unlabeled PTZ, suggesting that PTZ is eliminated by a carrier-mediated transport system across the BBB. To characterize the efflux transport of PTZ from the brain in vivo, the effects of several compounds on the efflux transport of PTZ were investigated. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors (verapamil and quinidine) reduced the PTZ efflux transport. In addition, the efflux transport of PTZ was inhibited by organic cations such as l-carnitine and tetraethylammonium (TEA), whereas organic anions such as p-aminohippuric acid, probenecid and taurocholate did not affect the PTZ efflux transport. The present results suggest that PTZ is transported from the brain across the BBB via l-carnitine/TEA-sensitive carrier-mediated efflux transport system(s) in addition to P-gp.",

Oridonin-loaded PCL-PEO-PCL copolymer nanoparticles (ORI-PCL-PEO-PCL-NPs) were prepared by the interfacial deposition method.

The entrapment efficiency and actual drug loading of the nanoparticles were 87.52% +/- 1.86% and 8.63% +/- 0.49%, respectively. The antitumor activity of ORI-PCL-PEO-PCL-NPs was evaluated by measuring changes in tumor volumes, tumor weights, and survival rates of mice with grafted hepatoma (H22). The results indicated that ORI-PCL-PEO-PCL-NPs prolonged the survival time of mice and exhibited higher therapeutic efficacy compared with free oridonin.

Poor prognosis and a median survival of less than 1 year, using conventional treatment, calls for development of new treatment strategies. Overexpression and/or amplification of platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptors (PDGF alpha Rs) in GBM might act as potential targets for a novel therapeutic approach. In this study, conjugates based on PDGFAA-ligand and dextran, of different sizes (10 and 40 kDa dextran), were prepared and investigated regarding targeting properties in vitro. Three human malignant glioma cell lines, U343MGa31L, U343MGaCl2:6, and U563MG, were used because of their previously reported differences in receptor expression and behavior. PDGFAA-based 10 kDa dextran iodine-125 radiolabeled conjugates showed the most favorable properties according to results achieved in accumulation, retention, and localization of cell-associated radioactivity. In comparison with dextran-(125)I-tyrosine delivered radioactivity, the PDGFAA-based dextran conjugates confirm the potential of receptor targeting.",

Although mitochondria are central in deciding the fate of cells, 17AAG induced effects on tumor cell mitochondria were largely unknown. Here, we show that Hsp90 inhibition with 17AAG first affects mitochondrial integrity in different human tumor cells, neuroblastoma, cervical cancer and glial cells. Using human neuroblastoma tumor cells, we found the early effects associated with a change in mitochondrial membrane potential, elongation and engorgement of mitochondria because of an increased matrix vacuolization. These effects are specific to Hsp90 inhibition as other chemotherapeutic drugs did not induce similar mitochondrial deformity. Further, the effects are independent of oxidative damage and cytoarchitecture destabilization since cytoskeletal disruptors and mitochondrial metabolic inhibitors also do not induce similar deformity induced by 17AAG. The 1D PAGE LC MS/MS mitochondrial proteome analysis of 17AAG treated human neuroblastoma cells showed a loss of 61% proteins from membrane, metabolic, chaperone and ribonucleoprotein families. About 31 unmapped protein IDs were identified from proteolytic processing map using Swiss-Prot accession number, and converted to the matching gene name searching the ExPASy proteomics server. Our studies display that Hsp90 inhibition effects at first embark on mitochondria of tumor cells and compromise mitochondrial integrity.",

The present study was undertaken to investigate whether chronic treatment with agomelatine would block unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)-induced cognitive deterioration in mice in passive avoidance (PA), modified elevated plus maze (mEPM), novel object recognition (NOR), and Morris water maze (MWM) tests. Moreover, the effects of stress and agomelatine on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels in the hippocampus was also determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Male inbred BALB/c mice were treated with agomelatine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), melatonin (10 mg/kg), or vehicle daily for five weeks. The results of this study revealed that UCMS-exposed animals exhibited memory deterioration in the PA, mEPM, NOR, and MWM tests. The chronic administration of melatonin had a positive effect in the PA and +mEPM tests, whereas agomelatine had a partial effect. Both agomelatine and melatonin blocked stress-induced impairment in visual memory in the NOR test and reversed spatial learning and memory impairment in the stressed group in the MWM test. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that CREB and BDNF gene expression levels were downregulated in UCMS-exposed mice, and these alterations were reversed by chronic agomelatine or melatonin treatment. Thus, agomelatine plays an important role in blocking stress-induced hippocampal memory deterioration and activates molecular mechanisms of memory storage in response to a learning experience.",

Primary cell cultures of brain capillary endothelial cells represent the closest possible phenotype to the in vivo BBB cell providing a convenient model for the study of transport systems and events that mediate solute delivery to the CNS. In this investigation we have characterized an in vitro primary BBB model from porcine brain microvascular endothelial capillary (PBMVEC) cells after recovery from cryopreservation of upto 12 months and studied their modulation by astrocytes. Co-cultures of PBMVECs with astrocytes (C6 astroglioma) resulted in trans-endothelial electrical resistance of up to approximately 900Omega cm2 and marked discrimination between the para- and trans- cellular markers sucrose and propranolol. Micrographs of confluent monolayers of PBMVECs showed the presence of tight junction complexes and vesicles with the morphological characteristics of either caveolae or clathrin coated pits. Extensive RT-PCR evaluation highlighted the expression of tight junction transcripts, ABC transporters, leptin receptor and select nutrient transporters. Functional studies examined the kinetics of transport of glucose, large neutral amino acids and p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Our findings indicate primary PBMVECs retain many barrier characteristics and transport pathways of the in vivo BBB. Further, primary cells can be stored as frozen stocks which can be thawed and cultured without phenotypic drift many months after isolation. Frozen PBMVECs therefore serve as a robust and convenient in vitro cell culture tool for research programs involving CNS drug delivery and targeting and in studies addressing blood-brain barrier transport mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Clinical use of genistein against cancer is limited by its extremely low aqueous solubility, poor bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. Based on structural analogy with steroidal compounds, liposomal vehicle compositions were designed and optimized for maximum incorporation of genistein's flavonoid structure. Model conventional and stealth liposomes of genistein (GenLip) - incorporating unsaturated phospholipids and cholesterol - have demonstrated enhanced drug solubilization (over 350-folds > aqueous drug solution), shelf-life stability, and extended release profile. Owing to effective cellular delivery, preservation of genistein's antioxidant activity was confirmed through marked neutralization of peroxides via GenLip, in both quantitative and microscopic fluorescent-probe oxidation assays. Furthermore, significant broad-spectrum anticancer efficacy of GenLip, in murine and human cancer cell lines (p < 0.05-0.001), was achieved in a concentration and time-dependent manner - approx. 5-7 lower IC50 values versus all non-incorporated drug controls. Indicative of key pro-apoptotic activity, GenLip produced DNA laddering, with 1/3 of free drug solution content, and resulted in the highest induction level of P53-independent apoptotic pathway markers, compared to all treatments, in our assays (namely, mitochondrial polarization, and caspase-3/7 enzymes). Our proof-of-principle pharmaceutical design of genistein-loaded liposomes shows optimal loading capacity and physico-chemical properties, which improved cellular delivery and specific pro-apototic effectiveness of incorporated drug, against various cancers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, specific transportation mechanisms on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are extensively employed for brain-targeted drug delivery via colloidal nanocarriers. However, in this study, we purposed to exploit the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2)-mediated transportation on the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier to enhance central nervous system penetration of the highly hydrophilic ibuprofen (IBU) by synthesizing a SVCT2-targeted chemical delivery system (CDS), ibuprofen-C6-O-ascorbic acid (IAA). The physicochemical parameters of IAA were determined, and the transporter-mediated transportation mechanism of IAA was explored on a BBB monolayer mode. The overall brain targeting effect of IAA was assayed on mice by measuring the biodistribution of IBU after i.v. administration and calculating the pharmacokinetic parameters and targeting indexes. Results showed that lipophilicity and solubility of IAA was conspicuously improved compared with IBU. At the physiological pH, IAA was stable while in brain homogenates it was easily degraded. Transport studies on the BBB monolayer mode revealed that IAA displayed higher transepithelial permeability than IBU via SVCT2. The biodistribution study in vivo demonstrated that the overall targeting efficiency of IAA was 1.77-fold greater than that of the IBU. In conclusion, the synthetic IAA might be a promising brain-targeted CDS for smuggling small-molecule hydrophilic pharmaceuticals into the brain.",

A modified two-stage emulsification method has been used to prepare multiple emulsions. After improving multiple (w/o/w) emulsion formulations; F1: purified antigen solution (PAS)/soybean oil, HCO-40 and span 80/pluronic F-68, F2: PAS and HPbetaCD/soybean oil, HCO-40 and span 80/pluronic F-68, F3: PAS/squalane, HCO-40 and span 80/pluronic F-68, formulations were selected for the stability study that continued for a 3 month duration. To evaluate the stability of these formulations, microscopic observation, osmolarities of the internal and external aqueous phases, pH, globule size and viscosity were determined. SDS-PAGE (silver staining) was used to evaluate HA and the micro-bicinchoninic acid (mBCA) assay was used to determine the in vitro release of antigen from formulations. Immune responses of formulations were investigated in Wistar Albino rats and compared with the immune response raised against the conventional vaccine. These responses were detected with Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) assay. The results of this study demonstrated that HA was well entrapped in the multiple (w/o/w) emulsion formulations. Molecular weight and antigenicity of the entrapped HA were not affected by the emulsification procedure. These results suggest that multiple emulsion formulations entrapping influenza antigen may have potential for immunization studies as one of the vaccine delivery system with adjuvant properties.",

Flow cytometric experiments showed that aptamer-daunorubicin complex was internalized effectively to Molt-4 cells (PTK7(+)), but not to U266 cells (PTK7(-)). This fact was confirmed by less cytotoxicity of aptamer-drug complex in U266 cells in compare to daunorubicin alone. No significant change in viability between daunorubicin and aptamer-daunorubicin complex treated Molt4 cells was observed.

Recently, Indonesia was listed as a country with the highest cases of dengue by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The current treatment for dengue disease is supportive therapy; there is no antiviral drug available in the market against dengue. Therefore, a research on antiviral drug against dengue is very important, especially to prevent outbreak explosion. In this research, the development of dengue antiviral is performed through the inhibition of n-octyl-\u03b2-D-glucoside (\u03b2-OG) binding pocket on envelope protein of DENV by using analogs of \u03b2-OG pocket binder. There are 828 compounds used in this study, and all of them were screened based on the analysis of molecular docking, pharmacological character prediction of the compounds, and molecular dynamics simulation. The result of these analyses revealed that the compound that can be used as an antiviral candidate against DENV is 5-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-[2-(p-tolyl)benzotriazol-5-yl]furan-2-carboxamide.",

Patients with lymphocytic colitis had children less often compared to those with collagenous colitis (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.05-0.86), however no differences were observed between patients with persistent or transient disease. Patients were less often older than 15 years of age at menarche (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.26-0.91) and were younger at menopause (OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.16-0.56) compared with controls.

Two 7-carboxymethoxy coumarin molecules were immobilized on the terminal group of a methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) chain via l-lysine as linker. The amphiphilic 7-carboxymethoxy coumarin monoend-functionalized methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG-Lys-DCOU) chains were self-assembled micelles. Anti-tumor drug doxorubicin was loaded in the mPEG-Lys-DCOU micelles and the release profile was studied. The cytotoxicity of mPEG-Lys-DCOU was evaluated by NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The drug-loaded micelles were incubated with HepG2 tumor cells to investigate the in vitro anti-tumor effect. The in vivo inhibition efficacy of drug-loaded micelles was carried out on 4T1 breast cancer animal model. The results showed that both hydrophobic and pi-pi stacking interactions within mPEG-Lys-DCOU amphiphiles were contributed to the self-assembly. Both blank and drug loaded micelles were monodisperse nanoparticles with the average diameters around 300 nm. The release profile exhibited certain pH dependence. The drug release rate at pH = 5.5 was much faster than that at pH = 7.4. mPEG-Lys-DCOU amphiphiles were non-toxic to NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.

Designed ISCOMs possessed negative zeta potential (-21.7 mV) and an average size of 44.1 nm with antigen incorporation efficiency approximately 39 %. Serum anti-HBsAg IgG titer after three high nasal doses of ISCOMs was comparable with titer recorded after alum-HBsAg administered subcutaneously. Similarly, modest but higher cellular response (cytokines level in spleen homogenates) and significantly higher secretory sIgA response in mucosal secretions was observed (P < 0.001) in case of HBsAg ISCOM vaccines. Whereas, alum-HBsAg vaccine did not elicit considerable cellular or mucosal response. Thus, ISCOMs produced humoral, mucosal, and cellular immune responses upon nasal administration although high and multidose administrations were required to elicit potent immune responses.

The composite coating was prepared by combining different ratios of PLGA and BCP (1:2, 1:1, 2:1). After completion of the coating process, the compressive strength of the scaffolds was shown to increase with an increase in PLGA concentration from 8.5 AE 0.52 MPa for the SPB1-BCP/ZrO 2 (1:2) to 11 AE 0.65 MPa for SPB3-BCP/ZrO 2 (2:1) scaffolds when PLGA concentration was increased. Furthermore, the increase of PLGA in the coating composition corresponds to a decrease in porosity, degradation rate and weight loss of the scaffolds after 4 weeks. SIM release study demonstrated sustained release of the drug for the three kinds of scaffolds with improved biocompatibility. The increase of PLGA concentration also resulted in a lower release rate of SIM. Thus, the lower release rate of SIM brought upon by the increase of PLGA concentration further enhanced the performance of the scaffold in vitro making it a promising approach in the field of bone tissue regeneration.",

Liposomes were prepared from this lipid and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) in equimolar proportion. Its transfecting capacity was evaluated using ELISA, cell cytometry, and RT-PCR in estimating the silencing effect of VEGF siRNA. This liposome efficiently delivered VEGF siRNA in two human cancer cell lines abundantly secreting VEGF, A431 and MDA-MB-231. Results showed that 50 nM of VEGF siRNA carried by DMHAPC-Chol/DOPE liposomes already silenced more than 90% of VEGF in these cells. A comparative study with two commercial carriers indicated that the inhibition induced by VEGF siRNA transported by cationic DMHAPC-Chol/DOPE liposomes was comparable to that induced by INTERFERin and better than lipofectamine 2000. Moreover, a transfection by a GFP plasmid followed by a GFP siRNA showed that DMHAPC-Chol/DOPE liposomes compared to lipofectamine were less efficient for plasmid but better for siRNA transport. Following one of our previous works concerning cell delivery of plasmid ( Percot et al., 2004 ), the main interest of results presented here resides in the double potential of DMHAPC-Chol/DOPE liposomes to deliver little-sized siRNA as well as large nucleic acids in cells",

Each amino acid in TMD3 was individually mutated to a cysteine and Gly-Sar uptake by each mutated and modified transporter was determined relative to wild-type hPepT1. Uptake data for mutated transporters modified with the lipid-insoluble cysteine-modifying reagent MTSET suggested tilting of TMD3 relative to the substrate translocation pathway; the extracellular region of TMD3 showed little MTSET reactivity, indicative of solvent inaccessibility, whereas the intracellular part of TMD3 was relatively solvent accessible. Modification at 10 positions of TMD3 with MTSEA, a lipid-soluble cysteine-modifying reagent, gave unusual and statistically significant increases in Gly-Sar uptake relative to untreated mutants. We interpret these data in terms of the spatial properties of the hPepT1 substrate translocation channel and possible interactions of TMD3 with other transmembrane domains.",

        "abstract": "DNA-based immunization has shown to be a viable alternative approach to induce protective immunity against Brucella abortus infection. However, the use of a unique gene may not be sufficient to induce full protection. Therefore, a new strategy based on library immunization has been described to improve the level of protection against different pathogens and to identify new protective genes. In the present study, a B. abortus library was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV-Ubi. This plasmid was designed to create a fusion between the gene of interest with ubiquitin. The analysis of this Brucella-library showed approximately 72% of clones containing inserts with an average size of 500-2000 bp. Further, homology searches were performed using the BLASTn program, and all sequenced clones showed homology with Brucella genes, as expected. BALB/c mice immunised intramuscularly with the Brucella genomic expression library showed a strong specific total IgG antibody response to a Brucella protein extract, with production of IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes. Regarding cellular immunity, high levels of IFN-gamma and no IL-4 were detected in primed mouse splenocytes and partial protection against infection was reached in animals vaccinated with the Brucella library compared to the control group.",

        "abstract": "Cannabinoids present an interesting therapeutic potential as antiemetics, appetite stimulants in debilitating diseases (cancer, AIDS and multiple sclerosis), analgesics, and in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and cancer, among other conditions. However, despite their high clinical potential, only few dosage forms are available to date. In this paper, the development of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) biodegradable microspheres as an alternative delivery system for cannabinoid parenteral administration is proposed. Tetrahydrocannabinol was encapsulated into biodegradable microspheres by the oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion solvent evaporation method. Several formulations were prepared using different drug:polymer ratios. The influence of antioxidant (alpha-tocopherol acetate) concentration on the release of THC from the microparticles was studied. Elevated process yield and entrapment efficiencies were achieved. The in vitro drug release studies showed that the encapsulated drug was released over a two week period. As THC has shown therapeutic potential as anticancer drug, the efficacy of the microspheres was tested on different cancer cell lines. Interestingly, the microspheres were able to inhibit cancer cell proliferation during the nine-day study period. All the above results suggest that the use of biodegradable microspheres would be a suitable alternative delivery system for THC administration.",

        "abstract": "Many aspects of detonation phenomena have been well studied over the last century. However, the transient infrared and visible emissions from detonation fireballs have been poorly understood, and this has hampered attempts to remotely identify explosives via combustion signatures. Recently, time-resolved infrared spectra (1800-7000cm(-1), 4cm(-1) resolution, 8 Hz) were collected from the detonation of uncased charges of TNT and several kinds of improvised explosive devices in four weight classes (10, 50, 100, and 1000 kg). A simple model for fireball emissions has been developed which accurately describes the observed spectra in terms of the fireball size, temperature, gaseous byproduct concentrations, and grey particulate absorption coefficient. The model affords high-fidelity dimensionality reduction and provides physical features which can be used to distinguish the uncased explosives.",

        "abstract": "Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is responsible for causing chickenpox and shingles infections, the latter of which can lead to long-term post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), the most common complication of VZV infections. A class of anti-VZV nucleoside analogues has been synthesised that shows up to 30,000 times the potency of aciclovir in vitro. The relatively high lipophilicities exhibited by the compounds led them to be selected for dermal delivery. The aim was to assess the relative penetration and permeation of the compounds into and through the skin, ideally targeting the region of skin in which the reactivated virus replicates. By targeting the skin it should be possible to reduce the viral load that causes damage to the nerves, thereby limiting zoster-associated pain, in particular PHN. Three compounds, as saturated solutions or as ethanol-based creams, were applied to full-thickness pig ear skin in Franz-type diffusion cells. An ethanolic and water receptor phases were compared. Samples of the receptor phase were taken at specific intervals, followed by tape stripping and separation of the remaining membrane at the end of the experiment. Analysis of the samples showed that all three compounds penetrated into the ethanolic receptor phase to a considerable degree, while only the least lipophilic compound entered the water receptor phase. The effects of the organic solvent in the receptor phase were visible in both the penetration and permeation of the compounds. All three compounds were distributed throughout the membrane in a manner that indicates that the site of viral replication in the skin is reached.",

Our approach exploits usage of particulate delivery to generate immune response against prostate cancer antigens. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of prostate cancer vaccine derived from a murine prostate cancer cell line, TRAMP C2 in murine model via oral route using aleuria aurantia lectin as a targeting ligand for M-cells in the intestinal Peyer's patches. METHODS: The whole cell lysate (WCL) was obtained from TRAMP C2 murine prostate cancer cell line and was formulated into particles using one step spray drying process. For in vivo studies, 4-6 week old C57BL/6 male mice were vaccinated orally biweekly for 10 weeks. Serum samples were analyzed at regular intervals to determine serum IgG levels. The mice were then challenged with live TRAMP C2 cells to determine efficacy of the vaccine. RESULTS: The serum IgG levels of vaccinated animals were higher compared to that of the controls. Moreover, the tumor growth was retarded significantly in the vaccinated mice compared to that of controls (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The above findings suggest that oral particulate WCL vaccine can trigger an immune response against prostate cancer antigens.",

        "abstract": "Tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) exhibit an M2 phenotype that promotes tumour progression, and conversion of M2 TAM toward a tumouricidal M1 phenotype is a promising anti-cancer therapy. As NF-kB is a key regulator of macrophage polarization, we developed an in vivo TAM-targeting delivery system that combines mannose-modified bubble liposomes/ NF-kB decoy complexes (Man-PEG bubble lipoplexes) and ultrasound (US) exposure. We investigated the effects of NF-kB decoy transfection on TAM phenotype in solid tumour-bearing mice. Post-transfection tumour growth and survival rates were also recorded. Th2 cytokine (IL-10) level in TAM was significantly lower by NF-kB decoy transfection using Man-PEG bubble lipoplexes and US exposure, while Th1 cytokine levels (IL-1b, TNF-a and IL-6) were significantly higher when compared with controls. In addition, mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and arginase were significantly lower in TAM post-NF-kB decoy transfection. Importantly, TAM-targeted NF-kB decoy transfection inhibited tumour growth and prolonged survival rates in mice. Therefore, TAM-targeted NF-kB decoy transfection using Man-PEG bubble lipoplexes and US exposure may be an effective approach for anti-cancer therapy based on TAM phenotypic conversion from M2 toward M1.",

All methods were assessed alone and with the use of chloroquine, a lysosomal enzyme inhibitor. Transfection efficiencies were determined and compared at various times post-incubation using a fluorescence standard curve. Neither naked DNA alone nor naked DNA and chloroquine were capable of transfecting cells. No differences were evident between lipofectamine with chloroquine and lipofectamine alone which transfected cells with a constant increase in efficiency up to 2 weeks. While transfection was not feasible with polymeric nanospheres alone, the addition of chloroquine allowed DNA released from nanospheres within cells to escape endosomal degradation and transfect the cells. The increase in transfection efficiency via nanospheres over time was exponential up to 1 week, as compared to the constant rate seen for the bolus-type administration of lipofectamine, indicating that nanospheres delivered DNA to the cells by a controlled release mechanism. Additionally, the effective dose delivered to cells via nanospheres was approximately 25% that of lipofectamine, indicating that transfection via PLGA and P(FASA) nanospheres might actually be more efficient.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive age-related irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that represents 70% of all dementia with 35 million cases worldwide. Successful treatment strategies for AD have so far been limited, and present therapy is based on cholinergic replacement therapy and inhibiting glutamate excitotoxicity. In this context, role of neuroprotective drugs has generated considerable interest in management of AD. Recently, direct intranasal (IN) delivery of drug moieties to the central nervous system (CNS) has emerged as a therapeutically viable alternative to oral and parenteral routes. IN delivery bypasses the blood-brain barrier by delivering and targeting drugs to the CNS along the olfactory and trigeminal neural pathways which are in direct contact with both the environment and the CNS. In an attempt to understand how neurotherapeutics/nanoparticulate delivery systems can be transported from the nose to the CNS, the present review sets out to discuss the mechanism of transport from nose to brain. The aim of this review is to discuss and summarize the latest findings of some of the major studies on IN drug delivery in AD models, with a focus on the potential efficacy of neuroprotective treatments.",

        "abstract": "Recently hydrophilic poly[N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide] (PHPMA) was used for BS-RNase modification to prevent its degradation in bloodstream or fast elimination. Polymer-conjugated BS-RNase preparations proved to be cytotoxic after intravenous or intraperitoneal application, whereas native BS-RNase was ineffective. Here RNase A unimer was conjugated with two HPMA polymers (classic and star) and their antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo were compared with those of BS-RNase polymers. Surprisingly, the antitumor effect of RNase A conjugates was also pronounced. The RNase A conjugates (classic and star) injected intravenously to mice bearing melanoma tumor caused a significant reduction in tumor volume following ten doses of 5 and 1 mg/kg, respectively. Despite the antitumor activity observed in vivo, the in vitro tested cytotoxic activity of RNase A did not differ from that caused by native RNase A while native BS-RNase (50 microg/ml) totally inhibited DNA synthesis in treated cells. The experiments with 125I-labeled preparations demonstrated concentration-dependent internalization of native BS-RNase by tumor cells within an hour, whereas the polymer conjugate (S-BS) was not internalized. On the contrary, the in vivo experiments showed that whereas 40% of S-BS conjugate persisted in bloodstream for 24h after administration, 98% of the native BS-RNase was already eliminated. Improved antitumor activities of PHPMA-modified RNases in vivo might be ascribed to their prolonged retention in bloodstream, better proteolytic stability and resistance to the action of the ribonuclease inhibitor.",

We confirmed significant quantities of mRNAs specific for certain somatostatin (SST), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and bombesin (BN) receptors in various commercially available tumor cell lines. Very few of the tumor cell lines examined displayed the high receptor-binding affinity despite exhibiting the expression of appropriate mRNAs and proteins of the cognate receptors. However, binding assays establish that some tumor cell lines, such as pancreatic cancer CFPAC-1, prostate cancer DU-145, and pancreatic carcinoid BON, demonstrate high BN receptor binding. BON cells also demonstrate high somatostatin receptor (SSTR) affinity binding. We also found that tumor cell lines, such as BON and host cells expressing SST receptor subtypes 1 or 2 (CHO-R1 or CHO-R2), underwent a decrease in cell surface receptor density in multiple passages. BON and CHO-R2 cells also rapidly internalize a significant proportion of cell surface ligand-receptor complexes. The tumor cells CFPAC-1, DU-145, and BON with high receptor binding could be useful for peptide drug studies. BON cells were further applied to test SST/BN analogs and cytotoxic conjugates. Furthermore, the in vivo antitumor assay showed that the cytotoxic conjugate CPT-SST targeting all SSTR subtypes displayed a potent tumor-suppressive ability to BON tumors expressing multiple SSTR subtypes.",

In this study, by using rotenone, an irreversible inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation against IMR-32 and BC-8 tumor cells containing differential heat shock transcriptional machinery, we studied whether the oxidative stress response is related to Hsp60. The accelerated cytotoxicity in response to rotenone has been correlated with enhanced production of O 2 \u25cf-, H 2 O 2 , reactive oxygen species, and Hsp60 translocation from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. The inability of cells to resist oxida-tive stress mediated Hsp60 translocation appeared to depend on mitochondrial oxyradical scavenging system and Bax translocation. A delayed oxidative stress response in hsp60 shRNA-treated cells was found to be due to increased mitochondrial translocation of Hsp60 on shRNA pre-sensitization. Overexpression of Hsp60 failed to protect cells from oxidative stress due to a lack of its mitochondrial retention upon post-rotenone treatment. These results also revealed that Hsp60 mitochondrial localization is indispensable for decreas-ing O 2 \u25cf-levels, but not H 2 O 2 and ROS levels. However, cycloheximide treatment alone induced Hsp60 translocation, while rotenone combination delayed this translocation. In contrast to oxidative stress, MG132 and 17AAG treatments showed mitochondrial retention of Hsp60; however, MG132 combination either with hsp60 shRNA or 17AAG induced its translocation. Additionally, overexpression of Huntingtin gene also resulted in Hsp60 mitochondrial accumulation. We suggest that Hsp60 may act as a barrier to pharmacological targeting of mitochondria.",

PURPOSE: This research work reports the development and characterization of aceclofenac-loaded chondroitin sulfate (CS) conjugated (CS-SLN) and unconjugated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) for the effective management of OA. METHODS: The SLNs were prepared using modified solvent injection method and coupled with CS. They were further characterized for size and size distribution, zeta potential, surface morphology, % entrapment efficiency and in vitro drug release profile. Anti-inflammatory activity and in vivo performance was also predicted. RESULTS: The particle size of the SLN and CS-SLN was found to be 143.4 +/- 0.9 nm and 154.2 +/- 1.1 nm, respectively. SLNs exhibited sustained drug release (SLN, 64.25 +/- 0.75%; CS-SLN, 57.82 +/- 0.62%) in vitro for more than 24 h. In vivo performance studies revealed the highest uptake of SLNs by the knee joint. DISCUSSION: SLNs enhanced accumulation at the knee joint due to specific interactions with CD44, annexin and leptin receptors attributed to CS coupling. CONCLUSION: CS-SLN could be potentially effective vector for the treatment or management of OA.",

Previous studies have reported that VPA effects osteogenesis in vivo and in vitro, yet it remains unclear whether VPA promotes cell differentiation of osteoblasts derived from mesenchymal cells. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of VPA on undifferentiated pluripotent mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation into osteoblasts while analyzing the impact of the absence or presence of extracellular matrices (ECMs). Mouse mesenchymal cells were cultured on non-coated plastic, type I collagen-coated, and fibronectin-coated plates in the absence or presence of VPA. A cell proliferation assay was performed in which modified formazan dye content was analyzed and proliferation nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were counted at various concentrations of VPA. A high concentration of VPA did not clearly alter cell morphology, but large numbers of stress fibers were observed in these cells and the cell proliferation ratio was decreased with positive PCNA counts. In the presence of matrices, the cell proliferation ratio decreased at low VPA concentrations compared with the ratio obtained in the absence of these ECMs. On the other hand, VPA promoted osteoblastic differentiation in the presence of type I collagen. These findings indicate that for undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, VPA promotes a decrease in the cell proliferation rate in the presence of ECMs and promotes osteoblastic differentiation, both of which could provide insight into additional mechanisms of osteoblastic cell differentiation caused by VPA.",

We report that Tat-ELP1 was not cytotoxic at 37 degrees C in SK-MEL-2, SKOV-3 and WI-38 cells, and only mildly toxic in the MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line. Application of hyperthermia (42 degrees C) in combination with Tat-ELP1 resulted in cytotoxicity in all cell lines tested, and this toxicity was most prominent in the MCF-7 cell line, which was chosen to study the mechanism behind this increased toxicity.

In this study, the inhibitory effect of TMC-SOD and heparin-SOD on superoxide anion release from macrophages was studied in vitro. Both TMC-SOD and heparin-SOD exhibited excellent inhibitory effects on superoxide anion release from macrophages, and the effects of TMC-SOD surpassed those of native SOD and heparin-SOD. The effects of TMC-SOD and heparin-SOD on inflammatory cytokine expression in vitro were also evaluated. The results showed that both TMC-SOD and heparin-SOD could significantly lower the levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and interleukine-1beta (IL-1beta) expressed by irradiated 3T3 fibroblasts. These results demonstrated that cationic polysaccharide or anionic polysaccharide SOD derivatives might be useful in the prevention and treatment of ROS-mediated inflammatory diseases. This study also demonstrated that chemical modification of SOD, especially cationization, greatly enhanced SOD's intracellular delivery and, consequently, produced a significant protective effect against ROS-mediated injury.",

        "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) in the peripheral tissues act as sentinels of the immune system. They detect and capture pathogens entering the body and present their antigens to T cells to trigger responses directed towards elimination of the pathogen. The induction of peripheral tolerance against self and certain foreign antigens is also believed to be mediated through DCs. The outcome of any immune response is largely controlled by the microenvironment of antigen capture, processing and presentation by DCs. The \"context\" of antigen delivery to DCs will directly influence the microenvironment of antigen presentation and hence the regulation of immune responses. We report here preliminary investigations describing the formulation of a pharmaceutically acceptable, biodegradable, and strategic nanoparticulate delivery system, and its application for efficient antigen loading of DCs to achieve antigen specific T cell activation. \"Pathogen-mimicking\" nanoparticles capable of interacting with DCs were fabricated by incorporating monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA; toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 ligand) or CpG ODN (seq #2006; TLR9 ligand) in biodegradable copolymer, poly(D,L,-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). The uptake of PLGA nanoparticles by human umbilical cord blood derived DCs (DCs propagated from CD34 progenitors) was conclusively demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Cell phenotype at day 12 of cultures was determined as immature DC using specific cell surface markers, i.e. CD11c (approximately 90%), MHC-II (approximately 70%), CD86 (approximately 20%), CD83 (approximately 5%), CD80 (approximately 40%), CD40 (approximately 40%), and CCR7 (approximately 5%). Tetanus toxoid (TT), a model antigen, was encapsulated in nanoparticles along with an immunomodulator, i.e. either MPLA or CpG ODN. DCs pulsed with various antigen formulations were co-cultured with autologous naive T cells at various cell ratios (DC: T cells were 1:5-20). The DCs pulsed with TT and MPLA together in nanoparticles induced significantly higher T cell proliferation (P<0.05) as compared to when DCs pulsed with TT and MPLA in solution were employed. A similar trend was observed when CpG ODN was used instead of MPLA in the TT nanoparticles. This strategy of antigen delivery to DCs was then tested with a cancer vaccine candidate, a MUC1 lipopeptide. The T cell proliferation observed in the presence of nanoparticulate MUC1 and MPLA pulsed-DCs was much higher than DCs pulsed with soluble antigen (P<0.0005). These results indicate that PLGA nanoparticles mimicking certain features of pathogens are efficient delivery systems for targeting vaccine antigens to DCs and activation of potent T cell responses.",

To identify the beta-cell protection effect of pbeta-SP-Ex-4 delivery, the Ins-1 beta cells were transfected with pbeta-SP-Ex-4 or pbeta-Ex-4 and incubated under normoxia or hypoxia. An MTT assay showed that the pbeta-SP-Ex-4 transfected cells had higher beta-cell viability than the pbeta-Ex-4 transfected cells under hypoxia. In addition, the pbeta-SP-Ex-4 transfected cells exhibited lower caspase-3 activity than the pbeta-Ex-4 transfected cells.

Results: The results obtained in the characterization were quite interesting and demonstrated that the silica produced were very uniform and with a size range of 50-100 nm. Thus, the results of cytotoxicity demonstrated that there is no cytotoxicity related to the nanoparticle.

Clinicians need guidance about appropriate initial dosing to achieve the higher target.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a high-target vancomycin dosing nomogram to achieve trough levels of 15-20 mg/L.\\n\\nMETHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at 2 teaching hospitals, St Paul's Hospital and Vancouver General Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia. Patients who were treated with vancomycin between January 2008 and June 2010 and who had achieved a trough level of 14.5-20.5 mg/L were identified. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Multiple linear regression was used to develop a vancomycin dosing nomogram for each hospital site. An integrated nomogram was constructed by merging the data from the 2 hospitals. A unique set of patients at each institution was used for validating their respective nomograms and a pooled group of patients for validating the integrated nomogram. Predictive success was evaluated, and a nomogram was deemed significantly different from another nomogram if p < 0.05 via \"\u03c7(2) testing.\\n\\nRESULTS: Data from 78 patients at one hospital and 91 patients at the other were used in developing the respective institutional nomograms. For each hospital's data set, both age and initial serum creatinine were significantly associated with the predicted dosing interval (p < 0.001). Validation in a total of 105 test patients showed that the integrated nomogram had a predictive success rate of 56%.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: A novel vancomycin dosing nomogram was developed and validated at 2 Canadian teaching hospitals. This integrated nomogram is a tool that clinicians can use in selecting appropriate initial vancomycin regimens on the basis of age and serum creatinine, to achieve high-target levels of 15-20 mg/L. The nomogram should not replace clinical judgment for patients with unstable and/or reduced renal function.",

Together with thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), SHMT participates to the thymidylate (dTMP) biosynthetic process. Elevated SHMT activity has been coupled to the increased demand for DNA synthesis in tumour cells. However, SHMT is the only enzyme of the thymidylate cycle yet to be targeted by chemotherapeutics. In this study, the interaction mode of SHMT with pemetrexed, an antifolate drug inhibiting several enzymes involved in folate-dependent biosynthetic pathways, was assessed. The mechanism of SHMT inhibition by pemetrexed was investigated in vitro using the human recombinant protein. The results of this study showed that pemetrexed competitively inhibits SHMT with respect to H4PteGlu with a measured Ki of 19.1 ?? 3.1 ??M; this value was consistent with a Kd of 16.9 ?? 5.0 ??M, measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. The binding mode of pemetrexed to SHMT was further investigated by molecular docking. The calculated interaction energy of pemetrexed in the active site of SHMT was -7.48 kcal/mol, and the corresponding predicted binding affinity was 36.3 ??M, in good agreement with Kd and Ki values determined experimentally. The results thus provide insights into the mechanism of action of this antifolate drug and constitute the basis for the rational design of more selective inhibitors of SHMT. ?? 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Consequently, inhibiting MdmX has emerged as an attractive approach to restoring p53 function in those cancers that retain functional p53. However, the consequences of acute systemic MdmX inhibition in normal adult tissues remain unknown. To determine directly the effects of systemic MdmX inhibition in normal tissues and in tumors, we crossed mdmX(-/-) mice into the p53ER(TAM) knockin background. In place of wild-type p53, p53ER(TAM) knockin mice express a variant of p53, p53ER(TAM), that is completely dependent on 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen for its activity. MdmX inhibition was then modeled by restoring p53 function in these MdmX-deficient mice. We show that MdmX is continuously required to buffer p53 activity in adult normal tissues and their stem cells. Importantly, the effects of transient p53 restoration in the absence of MdmX are nonlethal and reversible, unlike transient p53 restoration in the absence of Mdm2, which is ineluctably lethal. We also show that the therapeutic impact of restoring p53 in a tumor model is enhanced in the absence of MdmX, affording a significant extension of life span over p53 restoration in the presence of MdmX. Hence, systemic inhibition of MdmX is both a feasible therapeutic strategy for restoring p53 function in tumors that retain wild-type p53 and likely to be significantly safer than inhibition of Mdm2.",

        "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi phosphodiesterase (PDE) C (TcrPDEC), a novel and rather unusual PDE in which, unlike all other class I PDEs, the catalytic domain is localized in the middle of the polypeptide chain, is able to hydrolyze cyclic GMP (cGMP), although it prefers cyclic AMP (cAMP), and has a FYVE-type domain in its N-terminal region (S. Kunz et al., FEBS J. 272:6412-6422, 2005). TcrPDEC shows homology to the mammalian PDE4 family members. PDE4 inhibitors are currently under development for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, chronic pulmonary diseases, and psoriasis, and for treating depression and serving as cognitive enhancers. We therefore tested a number of compounds originally synthesized as potential PDE4 inhibitors on T. cruzi amastigote growth, and we obtained several useful hits. We then conducted homology modeling of T. cruzi PDEC and identified other compounds as potential inhibitors through virtual screening. Testing of these compounds against amastigote growth and recombinant TcrPDEC activity resulted in several potent inhibitors. The most-potent inhibitors were found to increase the cellular concentration of cAMP. Preincubation of cells in the presence of one of these compounds stimulated volume recovery after hyposmotic stress, in agreement with their TcrPDEC inhibitory activity in vitro, providing chemical validation of this target. The compounds found could be useful tools in the study of osmoregulation in T. cruzi. In addition, their further optimization could result in the development of new drugs against Chagas' disease and other trypanosomiases.",

Most high school students conduct various simple experiments exploring the laws of physics that Sr. Isaac Newton discovered. Physical properties of materials can also lead to very deterministic calculations. The deflection on a simple beam can be found using equations derived from material properties and integration along the beam. A larger assembly can easily exceed hundreds of thousands of elements and equations. The accompanying CD-ROM contains the decoder output from the model below. The CD-ROM also has more examples of models and some animations of models responding to stress. Computer modeling can be used to determine stress, strain, deflection, mass, moment of inertia, vibration mode shapes, fluid flow, temperature distributions, electrical and magnetic characteristics, and more. Boundary conditions are the mathematical definitions used to define the constraints on a model. Material properties are the physical characteristics of the material the model is simulating. This is a source for many mistakes. Most published material data is insufficient for a complete model of a material's behavior.",

Paradoxically, some cancer cell lines also display addiction to glutamine despite the fact that glutamine is a nonessential amino acid that can be synthesized from glucose. The high rate of glutamine uptake exhibited by glutamine-dependent cells does not appear to result solely from its role as a nitrogen donor in nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis. Instead, glutamine plays a required role in the uptake of essential amino acids and in maintaining activation of TOR (target of rapamycin) kinase. Moreover, in many cancer cells, glutamine is the primary mitochondrial substrate and is required for maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential and integrity and for support of the NADPH production needed for redox control and macromolecular synthesis.",

        "abstract": "For many years, there have been heated debates about the best way to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of psychological therapies. On the one hand, there are those who argue that the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the only reliable and scientifically credible way to assess psychological interventions. On the other hand, there are those who have argued that psychological therapies cannot be meaningfully assessed using a methodology developed to evaluate the impact of drug treatments, and that the findings of RCTs lack \" external validity \" and are difficult to translate into routine clinical practice. In this article, we advocate the use of mixed-method research designs for RCTs, combining the rigor of quantitative data about patterns of change with the phenomenological contextualized insights that can be derived from qualitative data. We argue that such an approach is especially important if we wish to understand more fully the impact of therapeutic interventions within complex clinical settings. To illustrate the value of a mixed-method approach, we describe a study currently underway in the United Kingdom, in which a qualitative study (IMPACT-My Experience [IMPACT-ME]) has been \" nested \" within an RCT (the Improving Mood With Psychoanalytic and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [IMPACT] study) designed to evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies in the treatment of adolescent depression. We argue that such a mixed-methods approach can help us to evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies and support the real-world implementation of our findings within increasingly complex and multidisciplinary clinical contexts.",

The algorithm proposes a modified top-hat transformation by importing the property of the small target region firstly, which largely enhances the dim target and apparently suppresses the heavy clutter. Consequently, the potential targets are easy to be segmented by the iterative thresholding method. After decreasing the false alarms through the dilation cumulation, the real target and the trajectory are correctly given by using the data association formed by the motion property of the real target. Various experiments verified that the proposed algorithm was efficient and robust for dim target detection and tracking under the condition of heavy clutter.",

Patient outcomes were collected pre-post, and on a session-by-session basis, using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Therapist and supervision feedback indicates that this structured psychodynamic treatment could be effectively taught, and that the key competences involved were acquired and demonstrated in the clinical work supervised. Patients found the treatment acceptable and relevant to their problems. The treatment appeared compatible with session-by-session monitoring of symptoms of anxiety and depression. DIT was associated with a significant reduction in reported symptoms in all but one case, to below clinical levels in 70% of the patients. Random regression models revealed highly significant linear and quadratic components, confirming the decrease in reported symptom severity but cautioning about slight increase in symptoms around the ending phase of the treatment. The results suggest that DIT is promising in its acceptability and effectiveness with an unselected group of primary care patients, and is easily acquired by psychodynamically trained clinicians.",

Participants' AAIs were less coherent and lower in reflective function than those of controls, who were matched for attachment status and mood disorder.

Fortunately, a new approach, called the Moving Target Defense (MTD) has emerged as a potential solution to this problem. While promising, there is cur- rently little research to show that MTD systems can work effectively in real systems. In fact, there is no standard defi- nition of what an MTD is, what is meant by attack surface, or metrics to define the effectiveness of such systems. In this paper, we propose an initial theory that will begin to answer some of those questions. The paper defines the key concepts required to formally talk about MTD systems and their ba- sic properties. It also discusses three essential problems of MTD systems, which include the MTD Problem (or how to select the next system configuration), the Adaptation Selec- tion Problem, and the Timing Problem.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Clinical governance requires measurement of the outcomes of health care. The Measure of Processes of Care (MPOC; King, Rosenbaum & King 1995) is a postal questionnaire developed in Canada to reflect parents' perceptions of the quality of services received. AIM: To examine the usefulness of the MPOC for the evaluation of services for children with disabilities and their families. METHODS: The MPOC was revised minimally for British idiom, taking out explicit references to a 'Centre'. Surveys of parents using child disability services were carried out in three rural and two urban communities, where there are no Child Development Centres, with a total of 495 analysable questionnaires returned. In addition, 32 parents using a home nursing service for children with multiple disabilities completed questionnaires. RESULTS: The rate of return ranged from 49% to 67%. Factor analysis confirmed a five-factor solution but only one factor mapped clearly onto the Canadian structure. Using the revised structure, the surveys provide evidence of the discriminating potential of the MPOC, comparing the perceptions of parents who do or do not have a care coordinator, and comparing recipients of a home nursing service with matched users of general services. CONCLUSIONS: The MPOC can be used as a measure of outcome for child disability services of differing organizational structures.",

This study observed the morphology of swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages (including 1-day old, 1-7 month old) by Hematoxylin-eosin staining. We also examined the expression of miR-499 and its target genes (CYLC1, DMRT1, QKI, XRN2, ZNF313) in samples of tissue slices using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, which showed that miR-499 had a significant negative correlation with QKI gene. Then, the proteins of QKI gene expression were determined by western blot, which were consistent with results of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection. Therefore, the luciferase reporter gene system was used to verify correlation between miR-499 and QKI gene. Activity of luciferase was significantly lower in miR-499 co-transfected with pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-WT group than the miR-499 co-transfected with pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-mut/si groups, indicating that target sequence of miR-499 existed in 3'UTR of QKI gene. Furthermore, the expressions of miR-499 and QKI were detected in testicular cells that were transfected with miR-499, miR-499 negative control and untreated. The results showed that the diameter of convoluted seminiferous tubule growth increased with age. Significantly different expressions of miR-499 and its target genes were found in swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages (p<0.05), overexpressing miR-499 analysis, suggesting that miR-499 was negatively correlated to the expression of QKI (p<0.05). In conclusion, QKI is a target gene of miR-499.",

        "abstract": "The ESS and SINQ Heat Emitting Temperature Sensing Surface (HETSS) mercury experiments have been used to validate the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code CFX-4 employed in designing the lower region of the international liquid-metal cooled Megapie target, to be installed at SINQ, PSI, in 2006. Conclusions were drawn on the best turbulence models and degrees of mesh refinement to apply, and a new CFD model of the Megapie geometry was made, based on the CATIA CAD design of the exact geometry constructed. This model contained the fill and drain tubes as well as the bypass feed duct, with the differences in relative vertical length due to thermal expansion being considered between these tubes and the window. Results of the mercury experiments showed that CFD calculations can be trusted to give peak target window temperature under normal operational conditions to within about ??10%. The target nozzle actually constructed varied from the theoretical design model used for CFD due to the need to apply more generous separation distances between the nozzle and the window. In addition, the bypass duct contraction approaching the nozzle exit was less sharp compared with earlier designs. Both of these changes modified the bypass jet penetration and coverage of the heated window zone. Peak external window temperature with a 1.4 mA proton beam and steady-state operation is now predicted to be 375 ??C, with internal temperature 354.0 ??C (about 32 ??C above earlier predictions). Increasing bypass flow from 2.5 to 3.0 kg/s lowers these peak temperatures by about 12 ??C. Stress analysis still needs to be made, based on these thermal data. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Despite several analyses have focused on elucidating the FurA-regulatory network, the number of target genes described for this essential transcription factor is limited to a handful of examples. In this article, we combine an in silico genome-wide predictive approach with experimental determinations to better define the FurA regulon. Predicted FurA-binding sites were identified upstream of 215 genes belonging to diverse functional categories including iron homeostasis, photosynthesis and respiration, heterocyst differentiation, oxidative stress defence and light-dependent signal transduction mechanisms, among others. The probabilistic model proved to be effective at discerning FurA boxes from non-cognate sequences, while subsequent electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments confirmed the in vitro specific binding of FurA to at least 20 selected predicted targets. Gene-expression analyses further supported the dual role of FurA as transcriptional modulator that can act both as repressor and as activator. In either role, the in vitro affinity of the protein to its target sequences is strongly dependent on metal co-regulator and reducing conditions, suggesting that FurA couples in vivo iron homeostasis and the response to oxidative stress to major physiological processes in cyanobacteria.",

In one scenario, a considerable numbers of chronic HBV carrier would eventually develop serious complications like liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In another, chronic HBV carriers would be permanent sources of HBV infection and transmit HBV to uninfected healthy individuals. Taken together, chronic HBV infection represents a major global public health problem, especially in the developing nations of the Asia and Africa, where most of the chronic HBV-carriers reside. Unfortunately, there is no good curative therapy approach for these patients. The prospect of treatment of chronic HBV infection by antiviral agents like type-I interferons and lamivudine is not satisfactory due to their low efficacy, considerable side effects and high costs. Vaccine therapy, an immune therapy, has recently shown considerable optimism for treating patients with chronic HBV infection. In this review, we will first describe the pathogenesis of chronic HBV carrier state to provide scientific and ethical rationales of vaccine therapy in chronic HBV carriers. Next, we will summarize the information that has been compiled from ongoing clinical trials of vaccine therapy in chronic HBV carrier. Finally, we will discuss the mechanism of action of vaccine therapy in patients with chronic HBV infection and HBV transgenic mice, a murine model of chronic HBV carrier state. This information will be valuable for developing next generation therapeutic vaccines for the management of chronic HBV infection. \u00a9 2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

        "abstract": "One of the most serious side effects associated with the therapy of HIV-1 infection is the appearance of viral strains that exhibit resistance to protease inhibitors. At the molecular level, resistance to protease inhibition predominantly takes the form of mutations within the protease molecule that preferentially lower the affinity of protease inhibitors with respect to protease substrates, while still maintaining a viable catalytic activity. Mutations associated with drug resistance occur within the active site cavity as well as distal sites. Active site mutations affect directly inhibitor/protease interactions while non-active site mutations affect inhibitor binding through long range cooperative perturbations. The effects of mutations associated with drug resistance are compounded by the presence of naturally occurring polymorphisms, especially those observed in non-B subtypes of HIV-1. The binding thermodynamics of all clinical inhibitors against the wild type protease, drug resistant mutations and non-B subtype HIV-1 proteases has been determined by high sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry. In conjunction with structural information, these data have provided a precise characterization of the binding mechanism of different inhibitors and their response to mutations. Inhibitors that exhibit extremely high affinity and low susceptibility to the effects of mutations share common features and binding determinants even if they belong to different chemical scaffolds. These binding determinants define a set of rules and constraints for the design of better HIV-1 protease inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Therapy with recombinant human interferon alpha remains pivotal to the treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus liver disease. Semi-synthetic protein-polymer conjugates of interferon with polyethylene glycol have also been recently developed. These conjugates protect the protein from degradation; reduce the immunogenicity; and prolong exposure to drug by a sustained absorption, restricted volume of distribution and sustained high serum concentration. Therapy with pegylated interferons is associated with significantly greater sustained virological response rates (SVR) compared to the non-pegylated formulation. Ribavirin is a guanosine analog with minimal antiviral activity against HCV. It demonstrates significant clinical synergism when administered in combination with interferon. Amantadine blocks entry of influenza A virus into cells. Used in combination with ribavirin and interferon as triple therapy, it may have some benefit compared to dual or monotherapy. Current treatment with pegylated interferons combined with weight-based ribavirin, provides the highest sustained virological response rates. In the absence of suitable animal models, HCV dynamic studies in man have been helpful in defining the mechanisms of action of interferon in chronic HCV liver disease. Novel therapeutic agents are being developed as the replication cycle of HCV is being understood. However, their safety and efficacy remain to be established and availability for clinical use is unlikely within the next 3 to 5 years. This review describes current antiviral therapy in chronic HCV liver disease, addresses the potential role of viral dynamics in elucidating the mechanisms of action of the drugs and discusses future potential therapeutics agents.",

A reference PTV was defined by using 47 normal lymphangiograms and CT-data of the pelvis from 15 patients who underwent surgery for cervical carcinoma. The simulation films were digitized and evaluated for adequacy in covering the PTV, previously individually determined by the radiation oncologists. Subsequently, the simulation films were also evaluated for adequacy in covering the reference PTV. Results: Large variations were observed in the portals used and in treatment techniques. From the digitized films, it appeared that in 50% of the cases the defined PTV was not covered adequately. Furthermore, 71% of the treatment plans would not cover the lateral borders of the reference PTV sufficiently. Conclusions: There appears to be no consensus on the target volumes to be irradiated in postoperative radiotherapy of early stage cervical carcinoma. When a PTV defined on the basis of lymphangiograms and CT-data is taken as a reference, 71% of the treatment plans would not cover this PTV adequately. These findings indicate the need for a consensus in the design of standardized treatment volumes. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",

However, the discovery of anti-H. pylori agents is a difficult task due to lack of mature protein targets. Therefore, identifying new molecular targets for developing new drugs against H. pylori is obviously necessary. In this study, the in-house potential drug target database (PDTD, http://www.dddc.ac.cn/tarfisdock/) was searched by the reverse docking approach using an active natural product (compound 1) discovered by anti-H. pylori screening as a probe. Homology search revealed that, among the 15 candidates discovered by reverse docking, only diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DC) and peptide deformylase (PDF) have homologous proteins in the genome of H. pylori. Enzymatic assay demonstrated compound 1 and its derivative compound 2 are the potent inhibitors against H. pylori PDF (HpPDF) with IC50 values of 10.8 and 1.25 microM, respectively. X-ray crystal structures of HpPDF and the complexes of HpPDF with 1 and 2 were determined for the first time, indicating that these two inhibitors bind well with HpPDF binding pocket. All these results indicate that HpPDF is a potential target for screening new anti-H. pylori agents. In addition, compounds 1 and 2 were predicted to bind to HpPDF with relatively high selectivity, suggesting they can be used as leads for developing new anti-H. pylori agents. The results demonstrated that our strategy, reverse docking in conjunction with bioassay and structural biology, is effective and can be used as a complementary approach of functional genomics and chemical biology in target identification.",

MLL forms a ternary complex with the lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) and MENIN. LEDGF/p75, a chromatin reader recognising H3K36me3 marks, contributes to the association of the MLL multiprotein complex to chromatin. Formation of this complex is critical for the development of MLL leukaemia. Available X-ray data represent only a partial structure of the LEDGF/p75-MLL-MENIN complex. Using NMR spectroscopy, we identified an additional LEDGF/p75-MLL interface, which overlaps with the binding site of known LEDGF/p75 interactors - HIV-1 integrase, PogZ and JPO2. Binding of these proteins or MLL to LEDGF/p75 is mutually exclusive. The resolved structure as well as mutational analysis show that the interaction is primarily sustained via two aromatic residues of MLL (F148 and F151). Colony forming assays in MLL-AF9+ leukaemic cells expressing MLL interaction defective LEDGF/p75 mutants revealed that this interaction is essential for transformation. Finally, we show that the clonogenic growth of primary murine MLL-AF9 expressing leukaemic blasts is selectively impaired upon overexpression of a LEDGF/p75 binding cyclic peptide CP65, originally developed to inhibit the LEDGF/p75-HIV-1 integrase interaction. The newly defined protein-protein interface therefore represents a new target for the development of therapeutics against LEDGF/p75-dependent MLL-fusion driven leukaemic disorders.",

The guidelines are equivalent to a HC5 (i.e., hazard concentration to 5% of the tested species, or the concentration that protects 95% of the tested species). The model of toxicity used in this evaluation is the target lipid model (TLM) that was developed for assessing the toxicity of type I narcotic chemicals. An acute to chronic ratio is used for chronic expression and sublethal effects. The TLM is evaluated by comparing predicted and observed toxicity of these petroleum components. The methodology is capable of predicting both the acute and chronic toxicity of MAHs and PAHs in single exposures and in mixtures. For acute exposures, the TLM was able to predict the toxicity to within a factor of three to five. The use of toxic units was an effective metric for expressing the toxicity of mixtures. Within the uncertainty bounds, the TLM correctly predicted where sublethal effects of edemas, hemorrhaging, and other abnormalities were observed to occur in early life-stage exposure to PAHs. The computed HC5s were lower than no-observed-effect concentrations based on growth, reproduction, and mortality endpoints and sublethal effects. The methodology presented can be used by the oil spill community to compare residual concentrations of PAHs against defensible, numeric guidelines to assess potential ecological impacts.",

We tested the Siemens syngo(\u00ae) TPS plan optimisation module for water cubes fixing the configurable parameters at clinical standards, with homogeneous target coverage to a 2 Gy (RBE) dose prescription as unique goal. Plans were delivered and the dose at each volume centre was measured in water with a calibrated PTW Advanced Markus(\u00ae) chamber. An EBT3(\u00ae) film was also positioned at the phantom entrance window for the acquisition of 2D dose maps. Discrepancies between TPS calculated and MC simulated values were mainly due to the different lateral spread modeling and resulted in being related to the field-to-spot size ratio. The accuracy of the TPS was proved to be clinically acceptable in all cases but very small and shallow volumes. In this contest, the use of MC to validate TPS results proved to be a reliable procedure for pre-treatment plan verification.",

        "abstract": "Mosquitoes are important disease vectors that transmit a wide variety of pathogens to humans, including those that cause malaria and dengue fever. Insecticides have traditionally been deployed to control populations of disease-causing mosquitoes, but the emergence of insecticide resistance has severely limited the number of active compounds that are used against mosquitoes. Thus, to improve the control of resistant mosquitoes there is a need to identify new insecticide targets and active compounds for insecticide development. Recently we demonstrated that inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels and small molecule inhibitors of Kir channels offer promising new molecular targets and active compounds, respectively, for insecticide development. Here we provide pharmacological validation of a specific mosquito Kir channel (AeKir1) in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. We show that VU590, a small-molecule inhibitor of mammalian Kir1.1 and Kir7.1 channels, potently inhibits AeKir1 but not another mosquito Kir channel (AeKir2B) in vitro. Moreover, we show that a previously identified inhibitor of AeKir1 (VU573) elicits an unexpected agonistic effect on AeKir2B in vitro. Injection of VU590 into the hemolymph of adult female mosquitoes significantly inhibits their capacity to excrete urine and kills them within 24 h, suggesting a mechanism of action on the excretory system. Importantly, a structurally-related VU590 analog (VU608), which weakly blocks AeKir1 in vitro, has no significant effects on their excretory capacity and does not kill mosquitoes. These observations suggest that the toxic effects of VU590 are associated with its inhibition of AeKir1.",

A criticism is that pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates and variability in healthy volunteers are smaller than those in patients. In this study, the initial estimates of exposure from MCS were compared with actual exposure data in patients treated with ceftobiprole in a phase 3 nosocomial-pneumonia (NP) study (NTC00210964). Results of MCS using population PK data from ceftobiprole derived from 12 healthy volunteers were used (J. W. Mouton, A. Schmitt-Hoffmann, S. Shapiro, N. Nashed, N. C. Punt, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 48:1713-1718, 2004). Actual individual exposures in patients were derived after building a population pharmacokinetic model and were used to calculate the individual exposure to ceftobiprole (the percentage of time the unbound concentration exceeds the MIC [percent fT > MIC]) for a range of MIC values. For the ranges of percent fT > MIC used to determine the dosage schedule in the phase 3 NP study, the MCS using data from a single phase 1 study in healthy volunteers accurately predicted the actual clinical exposure to ceftobiprole. The difference at 50% fT > MIC at an MIC of 4 mg/liter was 3.5% for PK-sampled patients. For higher values of percent fT > MIC and MICs, the MCS slightly underestimated the target attainment, probably due to extreme values in the PK profile distribution used in the simulations. The probability of target attainment based on MCS in healthy volunteers adequately predicted the actual exposures in a patient population, including severely ill patients.",

        "abstract": "Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among gynecologic malignancies. The monoclonal antibody 12G4 specifically recognizes the human M\u00fcllerian inhibiting substance type II receptor (MISRII) that is strongly expressed in human granulosa cell tumors (GCT) and in the majority of human epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC). To determine whether MISRII represents an attractive target for antibody-based tumor therapy, we first confirmed by immunohistochemistry with 12G4 its expression in all tested GCT samples (4/4) and all, but one, EOC human tissue specimens (13/14). We then demonstrated in vitro the internalization of 12G4 in MISRII(high)COV434 cells after binding to MISRII and its ability to increase the apoptosis rate (FACS, DNA fragmentation) in MISRII(high)COV434 (GCT) and MISRII(medium)NIH-OVCAR-3 (EOC) cells that express different levels of MISRII. A standard (51)Cr release assay showed that 12G4 mediates antibody-dependent cell-meditated cytotoxicity. Finally, in vivo assessment of 12G4 anti-tumor effects showed a significant reduction of tumor growth and an increase of the median survival time in mice xenografted with MISRII(high)COV434 or MISRII(medium)NIH-OVCAR-3 cells and treated with 12G4 in comparison to controls treated with an irrelevant antibody. Altogether, our data indicate that MISRII is a new promising target for the control of ovarian GCTs and EOCs. A humanized version of the 12G4 antibody, named 3C23K, is in development for the targeted therapy of MISRII-positive gynecologic cancers.",

        "abstract": "Alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and other melanocortin peptides are potent anti-inflammatory agents exhibiting efficacy in many animal models of acute and chronic inflammation. They are derived from a larger precursor molecule known as the POMC prohormone and are produced both centrally and peripherally. They exert their effect by binding to melanocortin receptors, of which five have been cloned and partially characterised. Agonism at these receptors leads to adenylate cyclase activation and subsequent increases in cAMP formation. Two receptors to date have been proposed to mediate the actions of the melanocortin peptides in an inflammatory scenario, the MC1 and 3-R, and here we discuss our findings proposing the MC3-R as a novel therapeutic target. The potential anti-inflammatory role for MC3-R is in its infancy, however, recent studies have shown that melanocortin peptides are effective in mice bearing a non-functional MC1-R (recessive yellow e/e mice). This ability to inhibit cell migration appears to be via inhibition in cytokine and adhesion molecule expression and is due to their abilities to interfere with cell signalling pathways. Identification of endogenous mediators of anti-inflammation, their receptors and the pathologies they are effective in, is of benefit to the medical community, and will hopefully have reduced side effects. We believe that specific small molecule agonists directed at MC3-R could be potential novel therapeutics for inflammatory conditions.",

In view of the multitude of methods employed for this purpose so far, this paper suggests to further make use of the methodological advantages of semantic priming. In order to enable the use of such a paradigm in a German speaking context, a set of German words belonging to the semantic categories 'interpersonal closeness', 'interpersonal distance' and 'neutral' were identified and their semantics were validated combining production- and rating method. 164 university students answered corresponding online-questionnaires. Ratings were analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and cluster analysis from which three clearly distinct groups emerged. Beyond providing validated stimulus- and target words which can be used to activate the adult attachment system in a semantic priming paradigm, the results of this study point at important links between attachment and stress which call for further investigation in the future.",

Novel primers targeting a conserved segment of the apicoplast (PFC10_AP|0010:rRNA) were designed and used in a number of different high throughput platforms such as single-step PCR (ssPCR), nested PCR (nPCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for parasite detection. Replicates of ten-fold serial dilutions of Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 DNA, with equivalent parasite density ranges of 200 000 to 0.2 parasites/\u03bcL, were used to determine the limit of detection and repeatability of each assay. A panel of 184 archived DNA samples extracted from either EDTA whole blood or dried blood spots, from across West Africa and South East Asia was used to determine the diagnostic performance of the assays. All assays amplified the 2 parasites/\u03bcL dilution except the ssPCR, which amplified two of the three replicates. Using an 18S rRNA PCR as reference, the sensitivity was 98% (95% CI 93-100%) for the LAMP assay, 87% (95% CI 79-93%) for ssPCR and 100% (95% CI 97-100%) for nPCR. Specificity was 91% (95% CI 83-96%) for LAMP, 82% (95% CI 72-90%) for ssPCR and 66% (95% CI 54-76%) for nPCR. The apicoplast genome-based nPCR detected more positive samples overall than the reference method. Discrepant samples were confirmed as true positives using a probe-based real-time quantitative PCR assay. The results show that the apicoplast genome is a suitable target for molecular diagnosis of malaria.",

        "abstract": "The advent of high-throughput screening (HTS) in the 1990s revolutionized the search for lead molecules. It enabled screening of large, diverse compound libraries against drug targets to identify chemical probes for target validation and drug candidates for clinical development on a scale not previously envisaged. However, the suc-cess of HTS was limited by the quality and diversity of the screening libraries and by the nature of many of the assay technologies, which required compound testing in artificial biological systems 1 . Twenty-five years on, we believe we are on the cusp of a new era in HTS, in which its transformation from a 'numbers game' to a smart selection tool will be com-pleted. This transformation is being driven by recent advances in computational and medicinal chemistry, cell biology, biophysics and instrumentation, which together could enable the design of bespoke screening libraries for each drug target that can be tested in information-rich biophysical assays and advanced cellular models. The innovations now being implemented could deliver on the long-sought promise of a hit for every target, meeting the strategic need to look beyond traditional drug target families for the next generation of medicines. Furthermore, a range of innovative partnerships mean that in this new era, lead discovery based on HTS will no longer be the preserve of pharmaceutical companies, but will become commonplace in the academic research community. Enhanced screening technology For much of the past 20 years, pharmaceutical compa-nies have used a target-class approach to drug discovery, focused on screening members of tractable protein superfamilies such as G protein-coupled receptors and kinases. A major strategy was to identify chemical probes to be used for associating the targets with dis-ease.There is now a drive towards the selection of drug targets with increased levels of target validation before a screening programme is started",

This crucial step is time consuming and prone to inter- and intra-observer variations. Automatic segmentation by atlas deformable registration may help to reduce time and variations. We aim to test a new commercial atlas algorithm for automatic segmentation of OAR and CTV in both ideal and clinical conditions.\\n\\nMETHODS: The updated Brainlab automatic head and neck atlas segmentation was tested on 20 patients: 10 cN0-stages (ideal population) and 10 unselected N-stages (clinical population). Following manual delineation of OAR and CTV, automatic segmentation of the same set of structures was performed and afterwards manually corrected. Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Average Surface Distance (ASD) and Maximal Surface Distance (MSD) were calculated for \"manual to automatic\" and \"manual to corrected\" volumes comparisons.\\n\\nRESULTS: In both groups, automatic segmentation saved about 40% of the corresponding manual segmentation time. This effect was more pronounced for OAR than for CTV. The edition of the automatically obtained contours significantly improved DSC, ASD and MSD. Large distortions of normal anatomy or lack of iodine contrast were the limiting factors.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The updated Brainlab atlas-based automatic segmentation tool for head and neck Cancer patients is timesaving but still necessitates review and corrections by an expert.",

        "abstract": "The emphasis in anticancer drug discovery has always been on finding a drug with great antitumor potential but few side-effects. This can be achieved if the drug is specific for a molecular site found only in tumor cells. Here, we find the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) to be highly overexpressed in lung and other cancers, and show that EZH2 is integral to proliferation in cancer cells. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed higher expression of EZH2 in clinical bladder cancer tissues than in corresponding non-neoplastic tissues (P < 0.0001), and we confirmed that a wide range of cancers also overexpress EZH2, using cDNA microarray analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining for EZH2 in 14 of 29 cases of bladder cancer, 135 of 292 cases of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 214 of 245 cases of colorectal cancer, whereas no significant staining was observed in various normal tissues. We found elevated expression of EZH2 to be associated with poor prognosis for patients with NSCLC (P = 0.0239). In lung and bladder cancer cells overexpressing EZH2, suppression of EZH2 using specific siRNAs inhibited incorporation of BrdU and resulted in significant suppression of cell growth, even though no significant effect was observed in the normal cell strain CCD-18Co, which has undetectable EZH2. Because EZH2 expression was scarcely detectable in all normal tissues we examined, EZH2 shows promise as a tumor-specific therapeutic target. Furthermore, as elevated levels of EZH2 are associated with poor prognosis of patients with NSCLC, its overexpression in resected specimens could prove a useful molecular marker, indicating the necessity for a more extensive follow-up in some lung cancer patients after surgical treatment.",

        "abstract": "Recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer is an area of high, unmet treatment need. There is a strong rationale for targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in head and neck cancer as most of these tumors express high levels of EGFR relative to normal tissue, with high expression correlating with poor patient outcome. This rationale has been validated in extensive preclinical studies. Two small molecules with EGFR inhibitory activity, gefitinib ('Iressa', ZD1839) and erlotinib ('Tarceva', OSI-774), and a humanized monoclonal antibody against the EGFR extracellular domain, cetuximab ('Erbitux', C225), are in clinical trials for advanced head and neck cancer. The initial results of these trials are promising. Gefitinib and erlotinib show activity as monotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, and have an acceptable safety profile compared with conventional chemotherapy. Gefitinib, which can be given at doses below the maximum tolerated dose, is associated with slightly lower rates of adverse events than erlotinib, which is dosed at the maximum tolerated dose. Combinations of cetuximab with radiotherapy or platinum-based chemotherapy have also shown activity in phase I/II studies. Both gefitinib and cetuximab have entered phase III studies. The results of these trials, which will mature over the next few years, will help determine the optimal use of EGFR agents in head and neck cancers.",

X-ray fluoroscopy provides high-resolution, 2-dimensional (2D) projection imaging. We have developed real-time x-ray fused with MRI (XFM) to guide invasive procedures that combines the best features of both imaging modalities. We tested the accuracy of XFM using external fiducial markers to guide endomyocardial cell injections in infarcted swine hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endomyocardial injections of iron-labeled mesenchymal stromal cells admixed with tissue dye were performed in previously infarcted hearts of 12 Yucatan miniswine (weight, 33 to 67 kg). Features from cardiac MRI were displayed combined with x-ray in real time to guide injections. During 130 injections, operators were provided with 3D surfaces of endocardium, epicardium, myocardial wall thickness (range, 2.6 to 17.7 mm), and infarct registered with live x-ray images to facilitate device navigation and choice of injection location. XFM-guided injections were compared with postinjection MRI and with necropsy specimens obtained 24 hours later. Visual inspection of the pattern of dye staining on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride-stained heart slices agreed (kappa=0.69) with XFM-derived injection locations mapped onto delayed hyperenhancement MRI and the susceptibility artifacts seen on the postinjection T2*-weighted gradient echo MRI. The distance between the predicted and actual injection locations in vivo was 3.2+/-2.6 mm (n=64), and 75% of injections were within 4.1 mm of the predicted location. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional to two-dimensional registration of x-ray and MR images with the use of external fiducial markers accurately targets endomyocardial injection in a swine model of myocardial infarction.",

After standard dosing, several factors affect exposure of voriconazole, resulting in large variability and demanding further elucidation of drug distribution. For measurements at the site of action, microdialysis is considered to be an outstanding minimally invasive method. For determination of voriconazole in microdialysate and human plasma a new, efficient, reliable, and robust HPLC assay using UV detection at 254 nm has been developed and validated. After simple sample preparation using acetonitrile for plasma and for microdialysate, 20 microL were injected and separated on an RP-18 column. The chromatographic run time was less than 4 min. Overall, the assay showed high precision (CV 93.9 to 99.5%) and accuracy (RE -96.7 to +107%) for both matrices. Of the 36 drug products typically co-administered with voriconazole, none except ambroxol interfered with its peak signal, and this interference was successfully managed. In summary, the method is highly suitable for application in (pre)clinical microdialysis studies, e.g., of critically ill patients with invasive mycoses.",

Patients who respond to IFN monotherapy but relapse during the follow-up should be re-treated with combination therapy given for at least 6 months at the minimum dose of 3 MU thrice weekly plus ribavirin 1000 mg/daily. Recent data suggest that prolonging the time of treatment (12 months) may induce a significantly higher rate of sustained response among patients with genotype 1. The efficacy of the combination of IFN and ribavirin in retreating patients with chronic hepatitis C not responding to IFN monotherapy is controversial as it ranges between 0% and 40%. Recent data show an overall rate of sustained response of 23% when an aggressive approach is adopted but increasing the dosage and the time of treatment induces a significant therapeutic benefit only in patients with genotype 1.

        "abstract": "Drug resistance is one of the major factors contributing to the resurgence of malaria, especially resistance to the most affordable drugs such as chloroquine and Fansidar, a combination drug of pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine. Understanding the mechanisms of such resistance and developing new treatments, including new drugs, are urgently needed. Great progress has been made recently in studying the mechanisms of drug action and drug resistance in malaria parasites, particularly in Plasmodium falciparum. These efforts are highlighted by the demonstration of mutations in the parasite dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase genes conferring resistance to pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine, respectively, and by the recent discovery of mutations in the gene coding for a putative transporter, PfCRT, conferring resistance to chloroquine. Mutations in a homologue of a human multiple-drug-resistant gene, pfmdr1, have also been shown to be associated with responses to multiple drugs. However, except in the case of resistance to antifolate drugs, the mechanisms of action and resistance to most drugs currently in use are essentially unknown or are being debated. Additionally, novel mechanisms of resistance exist in different malaria parasites, complicating the process of developing new drugs and treatment strategies. Here we summarise the progress made in drug resistance research in malaria parasites over the past 20 years, emphasising the most recent developments in the genetics of drug resistance.",

        "abstract": "At sites of inflammation, multiple inflammatory cells including eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages are capable of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can contribute to development of various diseases. In case of allergic inflammation, for example, the lung cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) following antigen challenge generates superoxide anion at nanomolar concentrations. Eosinophils obtained from BAL following a segmental allergen challenge generate more superoxide anion than eosinophils obtained from the peripheral circulation. Such ROS may contribute not only to tissue injury but also to inflammatory reactions. For example, hydrogen peroxide can stimulate both neutrophil and eosinophil adhesion as an autocrine or paracrine mediator via the upregulation of \u03b22 integrin. Furthermore, ROS may alter morphological or functional properties of endothelial cells, including permeability and adhesion molecule expression. Thus, ROS can promote adhesive interaction between inflammatory and endothelial cells, which could culminate in manifestations of inflammatory diseases such as bronchial asthma. \u00a9 2005 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Retinoid-related orphan receptors ROR alpha, -beta, and -gamma are evolutionarily related transcription factors belonging to the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. Studies of ROR mutant mice revealed that these receptors are critical in the regulation of a number of physiological processes. ROR alpha plays a key role in the development of the cerebellum particularly in the regulation of Purkinje cell differentiation and proliferation of granule cell progenitors. ROR alpha has also been implicated in the maintenance of bone tissue and mice deficient in ROR alpha exhibit a greater susceptibility to atherosclerosis. ROR gamma is essential for lymph node organogenesis and plays a key role in the generation or survival of lymphoid tissue inducer (Lti) cells. ROR gamma is also critical in thymopoiesis where it controls differentiation and promotes the survival of thymocytes by positively regulating Bcl-X(L) expression. Several studies have indicated a regulatory role for RORs in circadian behavior. In several tissues, the expression of RORs oscillates during circadian rhythm while mice deficient in ROR beta exhibit an altered circadian rhythm. ROR alpha and ROR gamma have been implicated in the control of various immune responses. Mice deficient in ROR gamma exhibit a reduced susceptibility to allergen-induced airway inflammation while ROR alpha null mice show a prolonged inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide. Recent analyses of the crystal structure and transcriptional activity of RORs revealed that cholesterol and specific cholesterol derivatives behave as agonists of ROR alpha while certain retinoids function as partial antagonists of ROR beta and ROR gamma. These studies indicate that ROR activity and, as a consequence physiological processes regulated by RORs, can be modulated by exogenous (ant)agonists. Therefore, the discovery of new (ant)agonists may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for human disease in which RORs have been implicated.",

        "abstract": "Tumorigenesis is a multi-step process involving several consecutive genetic alterations resulting in loss of genomic stability and deregulated signal transduction pathways. To study these deregulated processes in vitro, typically established cancer cell lines derived from primary tumors, ascites, or from metastases are used. However, these cancer cell lines reflect only late stages of the tumorigenic process. To better understand the consequences of the sequential genetic alterations in an in vitro model system, we applied consecutive immortalization and transformation of primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) combining shRNA-mediated knockdown of tumor suppressor genes and overexpression of oncogenes. Thereby, we developed a panel of isogenic HMEC-derived cell lines reflecting the multi-step process of tumorigenesis. The immortalized cell lines have a normal epithelial morphology and proliferate indefinitely and anchorage-dependently. In contrast, the transformed cells exhibit mesenchymal-like morphological changes and strong colony-forming activity in soft agar. SNP array analysis showed that none of the cell lines displayed gross chromosomal aberrations in 80 % of the chromosomes. However, massive changes were observed in some chromosomes of the transformed cells indicating that the transformed phenotype is characterized by chromosomal alterations. The isogenic immortalized and transformed cells described here provide a powerful tool for the in vitro validation of target genes for cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer is an area of high, unmet treatment need. There is a strong rationale for targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in head and neck cancer as most of these tumors express high levels of EGFR relative to normal tissue, with high expression correlating with poor patient outcome. This rationale has been validated in extensive preclinical studies. Two small molecules with EGFR inhibitory activity, gefitinib ('Iressa', ZD1839) and erlotinib ('Tarceva', OSI-774), and a humanized monoclonal antibody against the EGFR extracellular domain, cetuximab ('Erbitux', C225), are in clinical trials for advanced head and neck cancer. The initial results of these trials are promising. Gefitinib and erlotinib show activity as monotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, and have an acceptable safety profile compared with conventional chemotherapy. Gefitinib, which can be given at doses below the maximum tolerated dose, is associated with slightly lower rates of adverse events than erlotinib, which is dosed at the maximum tolerated dose. Combinations of cetuximab with radiotherapy or platinum-based chemotherapy have also shown activity in phase I/II studies. Both gefitinib and cetuximab have entered phase III studies. The results of these trials, which will mature over the next few years, will help determine the optimal use of EGFR agents in head and neck cancers.",

There is no standard adjuvant treatment to prevent metastasis and no effective therapy in the metastatic setting. We have established a unique panel of 7 UM cell lines from either patient's tumors or patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs). This panel recapitulates the molecular landscape of the disease in terms of genetic alterations and mutations. All the cell lines display GNAQ or GNA11 activating mutations, and importantly four of them display BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein-1) deficiency, a hallmark of aggressive disease. The mTOR pathway was shown to be activated in most of the cell lines independent of AKT signaling. mTOR inhibitor Everolimus reduced the viability of UM cell lines and significantly delayed tumor growth in 4 PDXs. Our data suggest that mTOR inhibition with Everolimus, possibly in combination with other agents, may be considered as a therapeutic option for the management of uveal melanoma.",

Despite being the least well studied of the MAPK-modules, evidence supports a role for MAPK7-signaling in the pathology of several cancer types.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis identified MAPK7 gene amplification in 4% (3/74) of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) (enriched to 6% (3/49) in squamous cell carcinoma) and 2% (2/95) of squamous esophageal cancers (sqEC). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis revealed a good correlation between MAPK7 gene amplification and protein expression. MAPK7 was validated as a proliferative oncogenic driver by performing in vitro siRNA knockdown of MAPK7 in tumor cell lines. Finally, a novel MEK5/MAPK7 co-transfected HEK293 cell line was developed and used for routine cell-based pharmacodynamic screening. Phosphorylation antibody microarray analysis also identified novel downstream pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers of MAPK7 kinase inhibition in tumor cells (pMEF2A and pMEF2D).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Together, these data highlight a broader role for dysregulated MAPK7 in driving tumorigenesis within niche populations of highly prevalent tumor types, and describe current efforts in establishing a robust drug discovery screening cascade.",

The study also examines the effects of using various coverage criteria on the effectiveness of the studied approaches. The results show that prioritization techniques that are based on additional coverage with finer grained coverage criteria perform significantly better in fault detection rates. The study also reveals that using modification information in prioritization techniques does not significantly enhance fault detec- tion rates. The results show that test selection does not provide significant savings in execution cost (<2%), which might be attributed to the nature of the changes made to the system. Test suite minimization using finer grained coverage criteria could provide significant savings in execution cost (79.5%) while maintaining a fault detection capability level above 70%, thus representing a possible trade-off. The hybrid technique did not provide a significant improvement over traditional minimization techniques",

This article has two main objectives. First, the regional variance is derived for a multi-object representation commonly used in the tracking literature, known as the multi-Bernoulli point process, in which the multi-target state is described with a set of hypothesised tracks with associated existence probabilities. This model is exploited in multi-target applications where it can be assumed that targets evolve independently of each other and generate sensor observations that are uncorrelated with other targets. An illustration of the concept of regional statistics (mean and variance) in target number, and how to interpret them in the broader context of multi-object filtering, it then provided. Possible applications include performance assessment and sensor control for multi-target tracking.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in genomics and proteomics have generated a change in emphasis from hypothesis-based to discovery-based investigations. Genomic and proteomic studies based on differential expression microarrays or comparative proteomics often provide many potential candidates for functionally important roles in normal and diseased cells. High throughput technologies to address protein and gene function in situ are still necessary to exploit these emerging advances in gene and protein discovery in order to validate these identified targets. The pharmaceutical industry is particularly interested in target validation, and has identified it as the critical early step in drug discovery. An especially powerful approach to target validation is a direct protein knockdown strategy called chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI) which is a means of testing the role of specific proteins in particular cellular processes. Recent developments in CALI allow for its high throughput application to address many proteins in tandem. Thus, CALI may have applications for high throughput hypothesis testing, target validation or proteome-wide screening.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although routine viral load (VL) monitoring currently is too costly for poor countries, clinical failure criteria perform poorly. We previously developed an algorithm combining a clinical predictor score (CPS) with targeted VL testing in a Cambodian patient population (derivation population). We now prospectively validate the algorithm in the same clinical setting (validation population), assess its operational performance, and explore its cost-saving potential.\\n\\nMETHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, applying the CPS in adults on first-line antiretroviral treatment for at least 1 year. Treatment failure was defined as a VL >1000 copies per milliliter. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the CPS to detect treatment failure in the current study population (validation population) was compared with the AUROC of the CPS obtained in the patient population where the CPS was derived from in 2008 in the same study setting (derivation population). Costs related to VL testing and second-line regimens with the different testing strategies were compared.\\n\\nRESULTS: One thousand four hundred ninety individuals {56.6% female, median age 38 years [interquartile range (IQR): 33-44]} were included, with a median baseline CD4 cell count of 94 cells per microliter (IQR: 28-205). Median time on antiretroviral treatment was 3.6 years (IQR: 2.1-5.1), 45 (3.0%) individuals had treatment failure. The AUROC of the CPS in validation was 0.75 (95% confidence interval: 0.67 to 0.83), relative to an AUROC of 0.70 in the derivation population. At the CPS cutoff \u2265 2, VL was indicated for 164 (11%) individuals, preventing inappropriate switching to second line in 143 cases. Twenty-four cases of treatment failure would be missed. When applied in routine care, the AUROC was 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 0.60 to 0.77). Overall 1-year program costs with targeted VL testing were 4-fold reduced.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The algorithm performed well in validation and has cost-saving potential. Further studies to assess its performance, feasibility, and impact in different settings are warranted.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the notion of the death of the Translator, inspired by Barthes\u2019 formulation of the death of the Author. It argues that the death of the Translator is caused by a loss of human agency in translation and is therefore most clearly exemplified in machine translation. Based on an avant-garde bilingual poetry project by a Taiwanese poet, the paper demonstrates that machine translation can produce unexpected new meanings through unpredictable routes of semantic and syntactic divergences from the source text. The poet\u2019s use of transparency as physical medium and of machine translation as mediator raises the following questions: does translation actually allow us to \u2018read through\u2019 a source text? If so, to what extent is such translation \u2018transparent\u2019? How should we even come to terms with the concept of \u2018transparency\u2019 with respect to the meaning of a literary text in translation? The paper argues that in the bilingual project in question, machine translation plays the crucial function of bringing the reader\u2019s attention back to the target language by way of delaying/blocking comprehension, hence rendering the corporeality of the target language \u2018transparent\u2019.",

The lazy was to moderate point cursor and the bubble cursor by bubble cursor expanded to envelop the closest target when the ratio of the distances to the closest and the second closest target was less than 1:2. In addition to this lazy behavior the cone cursor had a tail that stayed on the last enveloped target until the next target was enveloped. In an experiment with 18 participants we found that the bubble cursor was faster than our cursors that had smaller target activation areas but the difference remained very small. Of the bubble cursor variants the lazy bubble exhibited higher error rate than the other two. Thus, the winners on the objective metrics were the bubble cursor and the cone cursor.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Our purpose was to study whether the time to target temperature correlates with neurologic outcome in patients after cardiac arrest with restoration of spontaneous circulation treated with therapeutic mild hypothermia in an academic emergency department. METHODS: Temperature data between April 1995 and June 2008 were collected from 588 patients and analyzed in a retrospective cohort study by observers blinded to outcome. The time needed to achieve an esophageal temperature of less than 34 degrees C was recorded. Survival and neurological outcomes were determined within six months after cardiac arrest. RESULTS: The median time from restoration of spontaneous circulation to reaching a temperature of less than 34 degrees C was 209 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 130-302) in patients with favorable neurological outcomes compared to 158 min (IQR: 101-230) (P < 0.01) in patients with unfavorable neurological outcomes. The adjusted odds ratio for a favorable neurological outcome with a longer time to target temperature was 1.86 (95% CI 1.03 to 3.38, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In comatose cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after return of spontaneous circulation, a faster decline in body temperature to the 34 degrees C target appears to predict an unfavorable neurologic outcome.",

        "abstract": "The authors address the issue of inferring unconscious internal working models of interaction through language. After reviewing Main's seminal work of linguistic assessment through the 'adult attachment interview', they stress the idea of adults' internal working models (IWMs) as information-processing devices, which give moment-to-moment sensory orientation in the face of any past or present, animate or inanimate object. They propose that a selective perception of the objects could match expected with actual influence of objects on the subject's self, through very simple 'parallel-processed' categories of internal objects. They further hypothesise that the isomorphism between internal working models of interaction and grammatical connections between subjects and objects within a clause could be a key to tracking positive and negative images of self and other during discourse. An experiment is reported applying the authors' 'scale of subject/object affective connection' to the narratives of sixty-two subjects asked to write about the 'worst' and 'best' episodes of their lives. Participants had previously been classified using Hazan & Shaver's self-reported 'attachment types' (avoidant, anxious and secure) categorising individuals' general expectations in relation to others. The findings were that the subject/object distribution of positive and negative experience, through verbs defined for this purpose as either performative or state verbs, did significantly differ between groups. In addition, different groups tended, during the best episodes, significantly to invert the trend of positive/negative subject/object distribution shown during the worst episode. Results are discussed in terms of a psychoanalytic theory of improvement through co-operative elaboration of negative relational issues.",

        "abstract": "A clutter-adaptive target-detection method is proposed to detect small moving targets in midwave infrared maritime scenarios. In particular, we focus our attention on the sea-sky background and targets of interest are ships along the horizontal sea-sky line. In the distant sea-sky background infrared imagery, small targets frequently appear as weak intensity and do not have enough structure information in the vicinity of horizontal sea-sky-line, that is sea-sky region, and the complexity of background clutters has direct impact on the target detection performance. Thus, a fuzzy system constructed by the extracted image-based features is designed for the clutter classification. And then, based on the determined clutter type, low clutter or high clutter, the horizontal sea-sky line can be detected successfully. In the target detection stage, under the guidance of the sea-sky line, a modified multilevel filter method is applied to enhance the target in the sea-sky region. Finally, the recursive segmentation method and the target validation technique are adopted for the target extraction and validation. In the experiments, the target detection performance of proposed method is validated by extensive experiments on infrared images taken in different imaging conditions. It achieves high accuracy with a low false alarm rate.",

The key issue is spatial scale; conventional measurements of soil moisture are made at a point whereas satellite sensors provide an integrated area/volume value for a much larger spatial extent. For microwave remote sensing from space it is necessary to consider the kilometer to 40 kin scale, which presents new challenges. This issue of spatial scale is common to both current and future satellite missions. Regardless of the degree of difficulty, ground based sampling must remain a core component of validation. An integrated approach using in situ networks, field campaigns and comparison to other satellite products is described.",

        "abstract": "Despite an extraordinary investment in R&D the yield of successful new drugs has been disproportionately low in recent years, suggesting that the whole process of drug development requires rethinking and reform. Most analyses on this issue focus on molecular target discovery considerations. Target identification is characterized by a surplus of potential targets, but there is a translational bottleneck primarily due to limitations of currently employed target validation platforms. Meanwhile, the clinical entities, to which treatments are directed, are also highly complex in terms of pathophysiologic mechanisms and manifestations. In the present study we discuss the limitations of current molecular target discovery approaches mainly in regard to selectivity and efficacy. We also describe the constraints imposed on drug development by the current diagnostic constructs and the tendency towards dissecting the complex clinical phenotypes to component intermediate phenotypes. Finally, we describe how the reconsideration of molecular and clinical targets in polygenic diseases may lead to new strategies of pharmacological intervention directed against component dysfunctions, rather than the whole complex phenotype. Such strategies involve the combination of single ligands that act selectively on multiple molecules involved in a particular disease, or the employment of \"multi-targeted\" drugs, i.e. single drug molecules that hit selectively multiple receptors sharing common binding sites.",

The Bmi-1 protein is elevated in many types of cancers, and experimental reduction of Bmi-1 protein levels by small interfering RNA (siRNA) causes apoptosis and/or senescence in tumor cells in vitro and increases susceptibility to cytotoxic agents. The Bmi-1 protein has no known enzymatic activity, but serves as the key regulatory component of the PRC1 complex (polycomb repressive complex-1). This complex influences chromatin structure and regulates transcriptional activity of a number of important loci including the Ink4a locus which encodes the tumor suppressor proteins p16(Ink4a) and p14(Arf) .

In 2009, cellular prion protein (PrPC) was identified in a genome-wide screen as a high-affinity receptor for Abeta oligomers, and since then, many studies have explored the role of PrPC in Alzheimer's disease. Herein, I systematically assess the current level of target validation for PrPC in Alzheimer's disease and the merits of the identified approaches to therapeutically affect the PrPC:Abeta oligomer-interaction. The interaction of Abeta oligomers with PrPC in mice impairs hippocampal long-term potentiation, memory, and learning in a manner that involves Fyn, tau, and glutamate receptors. Furthermore, PrPC acts to catalyze the formation of certain Abeta oligomeric species in the synapse and may mediate the toxic effects of other beta-sheet rich oligomers as well. Therapeutic approaches utilizing soluble PrPC ectodomain or monoclonal antibodies targeting PrPC can at least partially prevent the neurotoxic effects of Abeta oligomers in mice.",

The accuracy of qRT-PCR results is largely dependent on the selection of stable reference genes. The stability of reference gene expression may vary with plant species and environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to select stable reference genes for qRT-PCR analysis of target genes in different organs under different abiotic stresses for a perennial grass species, bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon). The stability of eight potential reference genes (TUB, ACT, GAPDH, EF1\u03b1, TIP41, PP2A, CACS, UPL7) was evaluated under four different abiotic stresses (salt, drought, cold, and heat) and in leaves and roots of bermudagrass. Four programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) were employed to evaluate the stability of reference gene expression and to identify the most stable reference genes for bermudagrass. Eight potential reference genes exhibited differential expression stability in leaves and roots under salt, drought, cold, and heat stress. The expression levels of PP2A and CACS were stable in roots and leaves under salt stress, in leaves under drought stress, and in roots exposed to cold and heat stress. EF1\u03b1 and TIP41 expression were stable in roots of drought-stressed plants. UPL7, TUB and GAPDH were stably expressed in leaves under cold stress. Expression levels of PP2A and TIP41 were stable in leaves under heat stress. The use of the reference genes identified as internal controls for examination of gene expression patterns and quantification of expression levels of target genes will enable accurate qRT-PCR analysis in bermudagrass.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a library of hairpin ribozyme genes that can be delivered and expressed in mammalian cells with the purpose of identifying genes involved in a specific phenotype. By applying the appropriate phenotypic selection criteria in tissue culture, we can enrich for ribozymes that knock down expression of an unknown gene or genes in a particular pathway. Once specific ribozymes are selected, their target binding sequence is used to identify and clone the target gene. We have applied this technology to identify a putative tumor suppressor gene that has been activated in HF cells, a nontransformed revertant of HeLa cells. Using soft agar growth as the selection criteria for gain of transformation, we have isolated ribozymes capable of triggering anchorage-independent growth. Isolation of one of these ribozymes, Rz 568, led to the identification and cloning of the human homologue of the Drosophila gene ppan, a gene involved in DNA replication, cell proliferation, and larval development. This novel human gene, PPAN, was verified as the biologically relevant target of Rz 568 by creating five additional \"target validation\" ribozymes directed against additional sites in the PPAN mRNA. Rz 568 and all of the target validation ribozymes reduced the level of PPAN mRNA in cells and promoted anchorage-independent growth. Exogenous expression of PPAN in HeLa and A549 tumor cells reduced their ability to grow in soft agar, underscoring its role in regulating anchorage-dependent growth. This study describes a novel method for gene discovery where the intracellular application of hairpin ribozyme libraries was used to identify a novel gene based solely on a phenotype.",

Selection of suitable reference genes for quantification of target gene expression is important for the discovery of molecular mechanisms underlying improved growth traits and stress tolerance. The stability of nine potential reference genes (ACT, TUB, EF1a, GAPDH, SAND, CACS, F-box, PEPKR1 and TIP41) was evaluated using four programs, GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. The combinations of SAND and TUB or TIP41 and TUB were most stably expressed in salt-treated roots or leaves. The combinations of GAPDH with TIP41 or TUB were stable in roots and leaves under drought stress. TIP41 and PEPKR1 exhibited stable expression in cold-treated roots, and the combination of F-box, TIP41 and TUB was also stable in cold-treated leaves. CACS and TUB were the two most stable reference genes in heat-stressed roots. TIP41 combined with TUB and ACT was stably expressed in heat-stressed leaves. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays of the target gene FaWRKY1 using the identified most stable reference genes confirmed the reliability of selected reference genes. The selection of suitable reference genes in tall fescue will allow for more accurate identification of stress-tolerance genes and molecular mechanisms conferring stress tolerance in this stress-tolerant species.",

The objectives of this study were to apply an automatic computer algorithm to compute target volumes and to validate the algorithm using histologic data from real human prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: Various modalities for prostate imaging were performed. In vivo imaging included T2 3-T magnetic resonance imaging and 11C-choline PET. Ex vivo imaging included 3-T magnetic resonance imaging, histology, and block face photos of the prostate specimen. A novel registration method based on mutual information and thin-plate splines was applied to all modalities. Once PET is registered with histology, a voxel-by-voxel comparison between PET and histology is possible. A thresholding technique based on various fractions of the maximum standardized uptake value in the tumor was applied, and the respective computed threshold volume on PET was compared with histologic truth. Results: Sixteen patients whose primary tumor volumes ranged from 1.2 to 12.6 cm3 were tested. PET has low spatial resolution, so only tumors > 4 cm3 were considered. Four cases met this criterion. A threshold value of 60% of the 11C-choline maximum standardized uptake value resulted in the highest volume overlap between threshold volume on PET and histology. Medial axis distances between threshold volume on PET and histology showed a mean error of 7.7 ?? 5.2 mm. Conclusions: This is a proof-of-concept study demonstrating for the first time that histology-guided thresholding on PET can delineate tumor volumes in real human prostate cancer. ?? 2010 AUR.",

        "abstract": "We assess the performance of our previously reported structure-based support vector machine target-specific scoring function across 41 targets, 40 among them from the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD). The area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic plots (ROC-AUC) revealed that scoring with SVM-SP resulted in consistently better enrichment over all target families, outperforming Glide and other scoring functions, most notably among kinases. In addition, SVM-SP performance showed little variation among protein classes, exhibited excellent performance in a test case using a homology model, and in some cases showed high enrichment even with few structures used to train a model. We put SVM-SP to the test by virtual screening 1125 compounds against two kinases, EGFR and CaMKII. Among the top 25 EGFR compounds, three compounds (1-3) inhibited kinase activity in vitro with IC\u2085\u2080 of 58, 2, and 10 \u03bcM. In cell cultures, compounds 1-3 inhibited nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (H1299) cancer cell proliferation with similar IC\u2085\u2080 values for compound 3. For CaMKII, one compound inhibited kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner among 20 tested with an IC\u2085\u2080 of 48 \u03bcM. These results are encouraging given that our in-house library consists of compounds that emerged from virtual screening of other targets with pockets that are different from typical ATP binding sites found in kinases. In light of the importance of kinases in chemical biology, these findings could have implications in future efforts to identify chemical probes of kinases within the human kinome.",

This paper attempts to explore the application of the last of these processes, testing, to the most novel part of the MDA, that of model transformation. We present a general view of the roles of testing in the different stages of model-driven development, and a more detailed exploration of approaches to testing model transformations.

        "abstract": "MicroRNA deregulation is a critical event in tumor initiation and progression. The down-regulation of microRNA-138 has been frequently observed in various cancers, including tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). Our previous studies suggest that deregulation of miR-138 is associated with the enhanced proliferation and invasion in TSCC cells. Here, we seek to identify the targets of miR-138 in TSCC, and explore their functional relevance in tumorigenesis. Our genome-wide expression profiling experiments identified a panel of 194 unique transcripts that were significantly down-regulated in TSCC cells transfected with miR-138. A comprehensive screening using six different sequence-based microRNA target prediction algorithms revealed that 51 out of these 194 down-regulated transcripts are potential direct targets for miR-138. These targets include: chloride channel, nucleotide-sensitive, 1A (CLNS1A), G protein alpha inhibiting activity polypeptide 2 (GNAI2), solute carrier family 20, member 1 (SLC20A1), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (EIF4EBP1), and Rho-related GTP-binding protein C (RhoC). GNAI2 is a known proto-oncogene that is involved in the initiation and progression of several different types of tumors. Direct targeting of miR-138 to two candidate binding sequences located in the 3'-untranslated region of GNAI2 mRNA was confirmed using luciferase reporter gene assays. Knockdown of miR-138 in TSCC cells enhanced the expression of GNAI2 at both mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, ectopic transfection of miR-138 reduced the expression of GNAI2, which, in consequence, led to reduced proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In summary, we identified a number of high-confident miR-138 target genes, including proto-oncogene GNAI2, which may play an important role in TSCC initiation and progression.",

Protein kinase C beta (PKCbeta) is an essential signaling element of the BCR and was recently shown to be overexpressed in human CLL. We used the TCL1 transgenic mouse model to directly target PKCbeta in the development of murine CLL. TCL1 overexpression did restore the CD5(+) B-cell population that is absent in PKCbeta-deficient mice. However, PKCbeta-deleted TCL1 transgenic mice did not develop a CLL disease, suggesting a role of PKCbeta in the establishment of the malignant clone. Moreover, targeting of PKCbeta with the specific inhibitor enzastaurin led to killing of human CLL samples in vitro. We thus propose that PKCbeta may be a relevant target for the treatment of CLL.",

        "abstract": "Since the discovery of an endogenous cannabinoid system, research into the pharmacology and therapeutic potential of cannabinoids has steadily increased. Two subtypes of G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, have been cloned and several putative endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) have been detected during the past 15 years. The main endocannabinoids are arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), derivatives of arachidonic acid, that are produced \"on demand\" by cleavage of membrane lipid precursors. Besides phytocannabinoids of the cannabis plant, modulators of the cannabinoid system comprise synthetic agonists and antagonists at the CB receptors and inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation. Cannabinoid receptors are distributed in the central nervous system and many peripheral tissues, including immune system, reproductive and gastrointestinal tracts, sympathetic ganglia, endocrine glands, arteries, lung and heart. There is evidence for some non-receptor dependent mechanisms of cannabinoids and for endocannabinoid effects mediated by vanilloid receptors. Properties of CB receptor agonists that are of therapeutic interest include analgesia, muscle relaxation, immunosuppression, anti-inflammation, antiallergic effects, improvement of mood, stimulation of appetite, antiemesis, lowering of intraocular pressure, bronchodilation, neuroprotection and antineoplastic effects. The current main focus of clinical research is their efficacy in chronic pain and neurological disorders. CB receptor antagonists are under investigation for medical use in obesity and nicotine addiction. Additional potential was proposed for the treatment of alcohol and heroine dependency, schizophrenia, conditions with lowered blood pressure, Parkinson's disease and memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease. \u00a9 2005 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

        "abstract": "This review will focus primarily on the role of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP-1) in neuronal synapse formation and function in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We review the role that its ligands may have in cognition or AD: apolipoprotein E (ApoE), alpha2-macroglobulin, Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGFbeta, Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA), insulin growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), which all bind LRP-1 and apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), which is a ligand for LRP-2. After reviewing its role as a signaling receptor, we discuss the connection between LRP and the NMDA glutamate receptor via the post synaptic density 95 (PSD-95) neuronal scaffold protein and the implications it may have for memory and cognition. Finally, we discuss the evidence supporting a role for LRP in AD. Although the evidence for LRP as a genetic risk factor is weak, many of its ligands impose genetic risk, and have been implicated in AD pathogenic cascades. We discuss the role of LRP in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and production of beta-amyloid (Abeta. We identify LRP ligands that accelerate aggregation of toxic Abeta species. LRP mediates crucial pathways in AD pathogenesis such as Abeta clearance, Abeta uptake, intraneuronal Abeta accumulation and Abeta-associated neuron death. Interestingly, the TGFbeta -V receptor is LRP-1. Data show that one critical ligand TGFbeta2, associated with neurodegeneration in amyloid diseases, induces LRP expression in PC12 cells. Data from rodent infusion models demonstrate the impact of TGFbeta2 in modifying Abeta- induced Long Term Potentiation (LTP) responses, presynaptic proteins, lipid peroxidation, gliosis and staining for neuronal nuclei. The evidence supports a complex and significant role of LRP in cognition and AD.",

'Ambiguity', here understood as something that allows for more than one interpretation, is supposed to be critical in translation for children as it clashes with some mediators' ideas of what children's literature is or ought to be. Hans Christian Andersen's tale of 'Den standhaftige Tinsoldat' ['The steadfast tin soldier'] and a sample of twenty-four translations thereof (twelve into Swedish and twelve into Spanish) are used to explore different ways that ambiguity is translated for children. The objective is to determine if and how the tale's ambiguities are manipulated in the various translations, and thus to initiate a theoretical discussion of ambiguity in translation for children. A difference is established between 'textually resolvable' and 'textually irresolvable' ambiguities and these two kinds of ambiguity are found to be treated differently in the analyzed sample of translations.",

When faced with a difficult text, the behaviour in both groups was clearly affected, but some of the differences observed between novice and professional translators in the translation of the easy text were neutralized in that the professionals took over many of the features characteristic of the novices.",

The paper will explore the ways in which Dona Marina has been presented by translation scholars. The next section will provide the perspective of historians, focusing on three aspects relevant for Translation Studies: (1) the facts known about her origin, which explain her ability to communicate in two local languages, (2) her role as interpreter during the conquest of Mexico, (3) her alleged participation in the Cholulan massacre as an informant of Cortes. It will conclude with a discussion that aims to highlight the contrast between the use of impressionistic views of historic figures and the more balanced narratives based on factual rather than mythical elements.",

The application of such methodologies to interpreted texts has been much slower in developing than in the case of translated ones, but significant progress has been made in recent years. After presenting the fundamental methodological hurdles - and advantages - of working on machine-readable (transcribed) oral corpora, we present and discuss several recent studies using cross-modal comparisons, and examine the viability of using interpreted outputs to explore the features that set simultaneous interpreting apart from other forms of translation. We then set out to test the hypothesis that modality may exert a stronger effect than ontology - i.e. that being oral (vs. written) is a more powerful influence than being translated (vs. original).",

Te frequency and distribution of linguistic features associated with three of the universals of translated language (explicitation, normalisation/conserva- tism, and simplification) across the three subcorpora were analysed. Te study was guided by the hypothesis that the frequency and distribution of linguistic features associated with the universals of translated language would demonstrate similarities in the two subcorpora of mediated text (i.e., the translated and edited subcorpus), as compared to the subcorpus of unmediated text (i.e., the unedited subcorpus). However, the study yields almost no evidence for a mediation effect that is shared by translated and edited language, at least not along the linguis- tic features investigated. Tere is, however, evidence for what appears to be a separate translation-specific effect, which seems likely to be more unconscious, more proceduralised and more related to the linguistic level alone. Tis offers some support for the hypothesis of universals of translated language that are unique to this kind of text mediation specifically. Furthermore, the findings of the study suggest that editing may involve a different kind of mediation effect altogether, which frequently remains invisible in conventional corpus-based studies comparing translated and non-translated language, and which requires further investigation.",

To date, however, there is little agreement on the most suitable method to measure this phenomenon. In this contribution, I set out to discuss four of the most common methods of measuring cognitive load and the way in which they have been applied in interpreting research, providing examples for each and highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages. The main focus of the contribution will be on pupillometry, a psycho-physiological method I deem to be among the most promising approaches to objectively measure cognitive load during simultaneous interpreting in real time.",

        "abstract": "Canada's two official languages are involved in a power struggle characterized by inequality. Affected by this inequality, theatre texts resort to verbal resources whose functions vary according to the language in which they are written and the community to which they are addressed. Thus, French-Canadian plays exhibit a code-switching practice that reflects the reality of North America's French minority's exposure to the dominant influence of English and is, therefore, difficult to translate into English. The accent displayed on stage by the characters is also a manifestation of a heterolingualism that contributes to an extremely complex identity-dynamic particular to the spoken word. This study focuses upon the accents and the code-switching found in plays by Michel Tremblay, Jean Marc Dalp\u00e9 and Robert Lepage in order to identify the functions they perform and their representation in the translated English versions.<Source>ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR</Source> [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Due to lack of appropriate methods, pharmacological mechanisms of WTD acting on RA have not been fully elucidated. In this study, a list of putative targets for compositive compounds containing in WTD were predicted by drugCIPHER-CS. Then, the interaction network of the putative targets of WTD and known RA-related targets was constructed and hub nodes were identified. After constructing the interaction network of hubs, four topological features of each hub, including degree, node betweenness, closeness and k-coreness, were calculated and 79 major hubs were identified as candidate targets of WTD, which were implicated into the imbalance of the nervous, endocrine and immune (NEI) systems, leading to the main pathological changes during the RA progression. Further experimental validation also demonstrated the preventive effects of WTD on inflammation and joint destruction in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats and its regulatory effects on candidate targets both in vitro and in vivo systems. In conclusion, we performed an integrative analysis to offer the convincing evidence that WTD may attenuate RA partially by restoring the balance of NEI system and subsequently reversing the pathological events during RA progression.",

        "abstract": "The alpha-7 neuronal nicotinic receptor is a novel pharmacological target for psychiatric and cognitive disorders. Selective radiotracer tools for pre-clinical receptor occupancy can facilitate the interpretation of the biological actions of small molecules at a target receptor. We discovered a high affinity nicotinic alpha-7 subtype-selective ligand, AZ11637326, with physical-chemical and pharmacokinetic properties suitable for an in vivo radioligand tool. [ 3H]AZ11637326 synthesis by tritiodehalogenation of the corresponding tribromide precursor yielded a high specific activity radiotracer with high affinity alpha-7 receptor binding in the rat hippocampus determined by autoradiography (Kd = 0.2 nM). When [ 3H]AZ11637326 was administered to rats by intravenous bolus, rapid uptake was measured in the brain followed by a 3-4 fold greater specific binding in regions containing the alpha-7 receptor (frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and midbrain) when compared to non-target regions (striatum and cerebellum). Systemic administration of the high affinity alpha-7 receptor antagonist, methyllycaconitine (MLA), or pretreatment with alpha-7 selective agonists (AR-R17779, PyrQTC, DBCO-4-POM, and DBCO-3-POM) significantly blocked the alpha-7 specific binding of [ 3H]AZ11637326 in the rat brain. The rank order of ligand ED 50 values for in vivo alpha-7 receptor occupancy in rat hippocampus was: DBCO-4-POM > DBCO-3-POM ??? MLA > PyrQTC > AR-R17779. The occupancy affinity shift was consistent with in vitro binding affinity in autoradiography. Our studies established the optimal conditions for [ 3H]AZ11637326 in vivo specific binding in the rat brain and support the use of [ 3H]AZ11637326 as a pre-clinical tool for assessment of novel alpha-7 compounds in drug discovery. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Serum trough concentrations were measured before the fourth or fifth dose, and dosages were adjusted as needed.\\n\\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Median patient age was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR] 49-65 yrs), median weight was 71.2 kg (IQR 63-85 kg), and median creatinine clearance was 66.5 ml/minute (IQR 52-82 ml/min). The median initial vancomycin trough concentration achieved was 17.5 mg/L (IQR 15.0-20.0 mg/L), with 116 patients (58%) achieving the initial target trough of 15-20 mg/L. The median percent error was 13.6%, and the mean \u00b1 SD error for predicted versus actual serum trough concentrations was -0.50 \u00b1 0.021 mg/L. One hundred fifty-four patients (77%) eventually achieved the trough target concentration within a median of 2 days. One hundred forty patients (70%) achieved initial troughs of 14-21 mg/L and 160 (80%) achieved troughs of 13-22 mg/L. Nine patients (4.5%) experienced nephrotoxicity while receiving vancomycin, which occurred after a median of 8 days of therapy. The median initial vancomycin trough concentration for these patients was 18.5 mg/L (IQR 15.3-19.3 mg/L), with eight of the nine patients having trough concentrations of 15 mg/L or greater.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Fifty-eight percent of patients achieved the target trough of 15-20 mg/L (median 17.5 mg/L). The performance of the nomogram improved to 80% when the trough range was adjusted to 13-22 mg/L. Caution should be applied when using this nomogram. The nomogram should not replace clinical judgment, and dosage adjustments should be based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic targets and clinical response.",

        "abstract": "Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the lungs and the transcription factor NF-kappa B regulates the production of numerous inflammatory mediators that may have a role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Hence, the signalling pathways leading to NF-kappa B activation are considered prime targets for novel anti-inflammatory therapies. The prevention of NF-kappa B activity in mice, through the knockout of IKK beta or p65, causes fatal liver degeneration in utero making it difficult to determine the full implications of inhibiting NF-kappaB activity in tissues physiologically relevant to human diseases. This study used adenovirus delivery of a dominant inhibitor of NF-kappaB (I kappa B alpha delta N) and dominant-negative IKK alpha (IKK alpha(KM)) and IKK beta (IKK beta(KA)) to investigate the role of the individual IKKs in NF-kappa B activation and inflammatory gene transcription by human pulmonary A549 cells. Overexpression of IKK beta(KA) or I kappa B alpha delta N prevented NF-kappa B-dependent transcription and DNA binding. IKK beta(KA) also prevented I kappa B alpha kinase activity. Similarly, IKK beta(KA) and I kappa B alpha delta N overexpression also inhibited IL-1beta- and TNF alpha-dependent increases in ICAM-1, IL-8 and GM-CSF in addition to IL-1beta-mediated increases in cyclooxygenase-2 expression, whereas IKK alpha(KM) overexpression had little effect on these outputs. IKK beta(KA) also reduced cell viability and induced caspase-3 and PARP cleavage regardless of the stimuli, indicating the induction of apoptosis. This effect seemed to be directly related to IKK beta kinase activity since I kappa B alpha delta N only induced PARP cleavage in TNF alpha-treated cells. These results demonstrate that inhibition of IKK beta and NF-kappa B suppresses inflammatory mediator production and reduces A549 cell viability. Thus, novel therapies that target IKK beta could have potent anti-inflammatory effects and may be beneficial in the treatment of certain cancers.",

        "abstract": "Many multiple-model (MM) algorithms for tracking maneuvering targets are available, but there are few comparative studies of their performance. This work compares seven MM algorithms for maneuvering target tracking in terms of tracking performance and computational complexity. Six of them are well known and widely used. They are the autonomous multiple-model algorithm, generalized pseudo-Bayesian algorithm of first order (GPB1), and of second order (GPB2), interacting multiple-model (IMM) algorithm, B-best based MM algorithm, and Viterbi-based MM algorithm. Also considered is the reweighted interacting multiple-model algorithm, which was developed recently. The algorithms were compared using three scenarios. The first scenario consists of two segments of tangential acceleration while the second scenario consists of two segments of normal acceleration. Both of these scenarios have maneuvers that are represented by one of the models in the model set. The third scenario, however, has a single maneuver that consists of a tangential and a normal acceleration. This type of maneuver is not overed by the model set and is used to see how the algorithms react to a maneuver outside of the model set. Based on the study, there is no clear-cut best algorithm but the IMM algorithm has the best computational complexity among the algorithms that have acceptable tracking errors. It also showed a remarkable robustness to model mismatching, and appears to be the top choice if the computational cost is of concern.",

        "abstract": "While asyndeton between finite clauses within the sentence may be considered a marginal construction, compared for example to coordination or subordination, it is more frequent in French than in English, in which it is limited with respect to genre. Particularly interesting examples, both quantitively and qualitively, can be found in French literature, notably in the fiction of Marguerite Duras, who made asyndeton her hallmark. This study documents the choices made by English translators of Duras, and of three other French writers who exploit asyndeton. Literature aside, asyndeton in French texts is not carried over into English, in what can be qualified as norm-governed translation. However, asyndeton in literary texts is carried over into English in up to fifty percent of cases, reflecting a certain compromise between norms in the source language and those in the target language. Apart from describing Duras' specific use of asyndeton, and illustrating the difficulty of translating any element that is an essential ingredient of a writer's style, which, by definition, represents a departure from an accepted norm, this study brings to light certain aspects governing clause combining in English. Certain linguistic parameters that favour the exploitation of asyndeton in English are systematised, specifically concision, rhythm and isotopy. Semantic, temporal and/or aspectual constraints are also highlighted",

        "abstract": "There is a significant unmet need for therapeutic agents in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Given their clinical importance, prototypical molecules that clearly exhibit both neuroprotective and neuroregenerative activities have been highly sought after. The journey led to the exploitation of neurotrophins, a family of proteins that had extraordinary therapeutic properties in pre-clinical models of neurodegeneration. Although experimentally promising, clinical development of neurotrophins for various neurological indications, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Parkinson's Disease was met with severe obstacles and setbacks, such as the inability to deliver these large proteins to target population of neurons, instability of the proteins, and non-specific activity. Immunophilins are proteins that act as receptors for immunosuppresant drugs, i.e. FK506 (tacrolimus), cyclosporin A, and rapamycin (sirolimus, Rapamune). Studies indicate immunophilins are expressed 10-100 fold higher in CNS and PNS tissue than in immune tissue. Subsequent studies revealed potent neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties of immunophilin ligands in both culture and animal models. In contrast to neurotrophins, most immunophilin ligands are highly stable, small molecules that can readily cross the blood-brain barrier and are orally bioavailable. Taken together, these data prompted the development of nonimmunosuppressive immunophilin ligands with potent therapeutic activities, although the potency of select compounds has come into question in more recent studies. This review will examine the experimental evidence supporting the use of immunophilin ligands for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and the current progression of these molecules in clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "This article examines problems arising from biliterate performances in English and Chinese in the context of the sociolinguistics of Singapore. The questions asked include: What are the ramifications of translating Chinese literature carrying anglophobic themes into English? How might translation displace anglophobic readings from Chinese literary works? What kind of identity discourse do self-translation practices engender? The article examines three cases of cross-linguistic practice as biliterate modalities in Singapore, with an eye on the identity discourse emanating from the translational space between English and Chinese in each case. In the first case, it is argued that the English translation of a Chinese poem with an anglophobic stance triggers an ironic self-reflexivity on the part of the target text reader and has the potential to exacerbate the cultural anxiety faced by the Chinese-speaking Self in the source text. The second case presents an example where the anglophobic interpretation of a Chinese play can potentially be \u2018unread\u2019 through the homogenization of code-switching through translation. In the final case of a self-translating playwright, it is found that English-Chinese and Chinese-English translations establish an asymmetric symbiosis whereby translation creates an interliminal space in which a hybrid identity discourse is negotiated. The three cases illustrate the tensions and paradoxes residing in the translational space between English and Chinese in Singapore, pointing to the problematic of inter- and cross-cultural communication in the multilingual state.",

        "abstract": "Evidence is emerging that micro RNA (miRNA) is an important and potentially polymorphic regulatory layer for silencing gene expression in vivo. Knowledge of miRNA targeting may help to elucidate the function of many human genes in common diseases, providing a powerful target validation technology. Accurate in silico prediction of miRNA targets in mRNA is a critical capability, allowing effective evaluation of the impact of variation on the creation, strengthening, weakening and destruction of miRNA binding sites. Application of such analyses identifies thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which may potentially impact miRNA regulation of mRNA. The authors believe this information may offer a real opportunity to study miRNA function at a number of levels. First, sequence-focused analysis will help to define the functional boundaries of miRNA target binding. Second, one may be able to identify miRNA target variants in mRNA with a direct role in human disease, which may be valuable therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To support drug development of a PEGylated anti-CD28 domain antibody, a sensitive and robust LC\u2013MS/MS assay was developed for the first in-human multiple ascending dose study. Materials & methods: The procedure consists of a protein precipitation with acidified acetonitrile, followed by trypsin digestion of the supernatant. A surrogate peptide from the complementarity determining region was quantified with an LC\u2013MS/MS assay using a stable isotope-labeled internal standard with flanking amino acids. An acid dissociation step was found to be essential to achieve full analyte recovery in the presence of antidrug antibodies and soluble target CD28. Results & conclusion: The fully validated LC\u2013MS/MS assay demonstrates good accuracy (% deviation \u22646.3) and precision (%CV \u22645.2) with an lower limit of quantitation of 10 ng/ml.",

        "abstract": "Docking scoring functions are notoriously weak predictors of binding affinity. They typically assign a common set of weights to the individual energy terms that contribute to the overall energy score; however, these weights should be gene family dependent. In addition, they incorrectly assume that individual interactions contribute toward the total binding affinity in an additive manner. In reality, noncovalent interactions often depend on one another in a nonlinear manner. In this paper, we show how the use of support vector machines (SVMs), trained by associating sets of individual energy terms retrieved from molecular docking with the known binding affinity of each compound from high-throughput screening experiments, can be used to improve the correlation between known binding affinities and those predicted by the docking program eHiTS. We construct two prediction models: a regression model trained using IC(50) values from BindingDB, and a classification model trained using active and decoy compounds from the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD). Moreover, to address the issue of overrepresentation of negative data in high-throughput screening data sets, we have designed a multiple-planar SVM training procedure for the classification model. The increased performance that both SVMs give when compared with the original eHiTS scoring function highlights the potential for using nonlinear methods when deriving overall energy scores from their individual components. We apply the above methodology to train a new scoring function for direct inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) InhA. By combining ligand binding site comparison with the new scoring function, we propose that phosphodiesterase inhibitors can potentially be repurposed to target M.tb InhA. Our methodology may be applied to other gene families for which target structures and activity data are available, as demonstrated in the work presented here.",

        "abstract": "This Article aims to introduce the translation and the validation of a multidimensional measure of coping strategies: the Brief COPE, in a French population. The coping concept comes from psychological studies that were conducted on stress. In the conceptual analysis of stress by Lazarus and Folkman, coping works with two cognitive appraisals performed by the person concerning the perception of a threatening situation and his or her available resources to deal with it. Coping is defined as \"cognitive and behavioural efforts to master, reduce, or tolerate the internal and/or external demands that are created by the stressful transaction\". The Brief COPE is the abridged version of the COPE inventory and presents fourteen scales all assessing different coping dimensions: 1) active coping, 2) planning, 3) using instrumental support, 4) using emotional support, 5) venting, 6) behavioural disengagement, 7) self-distraction, 8) self-blame, 9) positive reframing, 10) humor, 11) denial, 12) acceptance, 13) religion, and 14) substance use. Each scale contains two items (28 altogether). This inventory has the advantage of being built from acknowledged theoretical models (Lazarus' transactional model of stress, 1984; behavioral self-regulation model, Carver and Scheier, 1981, 1998). It can be used to assess trait coping (the usual way people cope with stress in everyday life) and state coping (the particular way people cope with a specific stressful situation). As is the COPE inventory, the Brief COPE is a measure used for many health-relevant studies: drugs addiction, ageing, breast cancer, depression, AIDS. Both measures are widely used in Anglophone countries and translated in many Languages. Today, the COPE inventory has been validated among Estonian, Croatian, Chinese, and Italian populations and the Brief COPE is also validated among Spanish people. Thus, the worldwide use of this coping inventory should allow a broad comparison of medical and psychological research for coping strategies regarding every kind of pathologies. Thus, we were led to present the translation and the validation of this measure in a French population. Two studies are presented in this Article: the first one describes the validation of the inventory in a dispositional format (trait coping) and the second one the validation of the inventory in a situational format (state coping). The French version of Brief COPE, which was used for both studies, was back-translated and analysed by the Brief COPE Author: Charles S. Carver. For study 1, 834 first Year university students answered the Brief COPE in its dispositional format. To study the factor structure of the Brief COPE, we used structural equation modeling and the LISREL software. Results show that the expected theoretical structure and the observed one fit adequately (c2=606, p<0,05, RMSEA=0,04, GFI>0,95, AGFI>0,92, RMR<0,03). In order to study convergent and discriminant validity of Brief COPE, self-esteem (SEI, Rosenberg, 1979), perceived stress (PSS, Cohen et al., 1983), and psychological distress (GHQ-12, Goldberg, 1972) measures were used. Results show that functional coping strategies (eg, active coping) are linked to good self-esteem, to lower perceived stress, and to lower psychological distress, whereas less functional strategies (eg, denial or self-blame) are widely linked to poor self-esteem, to a high perceived stress, and to psychological distress. Study 1 shows also several significant gender differences. Study 2 describes the Brief COPE validation in its situational format. 178 additional students answered this version. The method that was used is the same the one developed by Lazarus and his colleagues for the WCC validation. Participants were asked to recall and think about the most stressful event they had experienced during the past two Months. They were also to give an account of how much that situation mattered to them. They had to evaluate their capacity to control the situation and indicated whether they felt the situation was amenable to change. The study includes only peopl s only people who labeled an event as \"important\" or \"very important\". Here again LISREL was used to study the factor structure of the Brief COPE. The results emphasise - as in study 1 - that the expected theoretical structure and the observed one fit adequately (c2=391, p<0,05, RMSEA<0,05, GFI=0,87, AGFI=0,80, RMR<0,06). Differences among means showed how the perceived control of the situation and how the perception of its favourable evolution influenced the coping strategies used (eg, humour or denial). Results in both studies indicate good psychometric properties for the Brief COPE in its French version, whatever the format (ie, dispositional or situational). Thus French searchers have a relevant tool on hand to measure as accurately as possible the coping strategies someone used in everyday life (strategies interfering on health, on a long scale), or in distressful situations (eg, serious illness, traumas). The fact that this easy-to-use coping measure is worldwide spread among medical and psychological studies allows a better broadcast and comparison of results whatever the pathology.",

The best scoring sites were positionally conserved between mouse and human orthologs, suggesting that this parameter can be used to enrich for true CREB targets. Target validation experiments revealed a core promoter requirement for transcriptional induction via CREB; TATA-less promoters were unresponsive to cAMP compared to TATA-containing genes, despite comparable binding of CREB to both sets of genes in vivo. Indeed, insertion of a TATA box motif rescued cAMP responsiveness on a TATA-less promoter. These results illustrate a mechanism by which subsets of target genes for a transcription factor are differentially regulated depending on core promoter configuration.",

        "abstract": "High-grade astrocytomas are invariably deadly and minimally responsive to therapy. Pten is frequently mutated in aggressive astrocytoma but not in low-grade astrocytoma. However, the Pten astrocytoma suppression mechanisms are unknown. Here we introduced conditional null alleles of Pten (Pten(loxp/loxp)) into a genetically engineered mouse astrocytoma model [TgG(deltaZ)T121] in which the pRb family proteins are inactivated specifically in astrocytes. Pten inactivation was induced by localized somatic retroviral (MSCV)-Cre delivery. Depletion of Pten function in adult astrocytoma cells alleviated the apoptosis evoked by pRb family protein inactivation and also induced tumor cell invasion. In primary astrocytes derived from TgG(deltaZ)T121; Pten(loxp/loxp) mice, Pten deficiency resulted in a marked increase in cell invasiveness that was suppressed by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) or of PKC-zeta, specifically. Finally, focal induction of Pten deficiency in vivo promoted angiogenesis in affected brains. Thus, we show that Pten deficiency in pRb-deficient astrocytoma cells contributes to tumor progression via multiple mechanisms, including suppression of apoptosis, increased cell invasion, and angiogenesis, all of which are hallmarks of high-grade astrocytoma. These studies not only provide mechanistic insight into the role of Pten in astrocytoma suppression but also describe a valuable animal model for preclinical testing that is coupled with a primary cell-based system for target discovery and drug screening.",

        "abstract": "The neuroinflammation cycle has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target in the development of new approaches to altering Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. However, the efficacy and toxicological profile of compounds that focus only on classical NSAID targets have been disappointing to date. Therefore, we recently initiated an unbiased, integrative chemical biology approach that used a hierarchal set of cell-based screens, followed by efficacy analysis in a new AD-relevant animal model that more closely resembles human pathology endpoints in terms of neuroinflammation and neuronal loss. The prior investigations provided a proof of concept that targeting the neuroinflammation cycle may be a viable drug discovery approach for AD. However, recent informatics analyses of the high attrition rate in drug development have identified the need for starting drug development with lead compounds that are well below cut off values in computed molecular properties in order to facilitate late stage medicinal chemistry refinement to improve in vivo functions. We describe here how we are leveraging our novel, unbiased, integrative chemical biology approach for the rapid discovery of potential lead compounds for AD drug discovery. Specifically, we show that orally bioavailable compounds with the desired physical properties and in vivo functions can be identified in focused synthetic libraries composed of chemical diversifications of the inactive but privileged pyridazine molecular fragment.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To validate and clinically evaluate autocontouring using atlas-based autosegmentation (ABAS) of computed tomography images. Methods and Materials: The data from 10 head-and-neck patients were selected as input for ABAS, and neck levels I-V and 20 organs at risk were manually contoured according to published guidelines. The total contouring times were recorded. Two different ABAS strategies, multiple and single subject, were evaluated, and the similarity of the autocontours with the atlas contours was assessed using Dice coefficients and the mean distances, using the leave-one-out method. For 12 clinically treated patients, 5 experienced observers edited the autosegmented contours. The editing times were recorded. The Dice coefficients and mean distances were calculated among the clinically used contours, autocontours, and edited autocontours. Finally, an expert panel scored all autocontours and the edited autocontours regarding their adequacy relative to the published atlas. Results: The time to autosegment all the structures using ABAS was 7 min/patient. No significant differences were observed in the autosegmentation accuracy for stage N0 and N+ patients. The multisubject atlas performed best, with a Dice coefficient and mean distance of 0.74 and 2 mm, 0.67 and 3 mm, 0.71 and 2 mm, 0.50 and 2 mm, and 0.78 and 2 mm for the salivary glands, neck levels, chewing muscles, swallowing muscles, and spinal cord-brainstem, respectively. The mean Dice coefficient and mean distance of the autocontours vs. The clinical contours was 0.8 and 2.4 mm for the neck levels and salivary glands, respectively. For the autocontours vs. The edited autocontours, the mean Dice coefficient and mean distance was 0.9 and 1.6 mm, respectively. The expert panel scored 100% of the autocontours as a \"minor deviation, editable\" or better. The expert panel scored 88% of the edited contours as good compared with 83% of the clinical contours. The total editing time was 66 min. Conclusion: Multiple-subject ABAS of computed tomography images proved to be a useful novel tool in the rapid delineation of target and normal tissues. Although editing of the autocontours is inevitable, a substantial time reduction was achieved using editing, instead of manual contouring (180 vs. 66 min). ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

Failures of molecules in Phase III for poor efficacy raise questions about target identification and validation.

The current lack of multi-dimensional measurement tools impede an in-depth understanding of the dynamic of disclosure. Objective: To develop and validate complex measures of serostatus disclosure. Methods: This international community based research study was performed by joint research teams (researchers/community based organizations (CBO)) in five countries (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Mali, Morocco and Romania). A convenience sample of 1500 people living with HIV (PLHIV) in contact with local CBO were recruited in 2011 (300 in each country). Face-to-face interviews were performed using a 125-item questionnaire covering HIV status disclosure to 23 potential disclosure targets and related issues (including personal history with HIV, people's reaction to disclosure, sexuality). A principal component analysis and a hierarchical cluster analysis were performed, in order to identify the main components of HIV disclosure, create measures and classify participants into profiles. Results: Patterns of disclosure were summarized using two main measures: direct and indirect disclosure. Disclosure to sexual partners, whether steady or not, was different from patterns of disclosure to other targets. Among the participants, three profiles emerged - labelled Restricted disclosure, Mainly indirect disclosure and Mainly direct disclosure, respectively representing 61%, 13% and 26% of the total sample. The profiles were associated with different aspects of PLHIV's lives, including self-efficacy, functional limitations and social exclusion. Patterns varied across the five studied countries. Conclusion: Results suggest that multi-dimensional constructs should be used to measure disclosure in order to improve understanding of the disclosure process.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) still remains a deadly neurodegenerative disease, mainly characterized by the combined degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons (MNs). The pathology perspective is changed after 2006 due to the demonstration of common inclusions in ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia (non-tauFTD). Genetics largely contributed to further define the common mechanisms of both diseases but the large numbers of sporadic cases still remain unsolved. Transgenic mice models demonstrated the non-cell autonomous nature of ALS, being surrounding cells as astrocytes, microglial cells, and olygodendrocytes crucial in determining MN degeneration. More recently, the use of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and/or IPSCs contributed to provide in vitro models for the ALS pathology and biological assay of clinical relevance. The combined use of ESC and SOD1 transgenic model of ALS has been pioneering used. The prostanoid receptor DP1 has been elegantly demonstrated to mediate the glial toxicity to stem-cell derived MNs in vitro. This evidence has been translated in vivo: the genetic ablation of DP1 in the SOD1G93A mice extended life span, decreasing microglial activation and MN loss. This paper is quite compelling, at the cutting edge of the stem cell-transgenic translation, demonstrating that discoveries derived from stem cells can be corroborated in vivo and possibly translated to humans.",

        "abstract": "During the past five years, RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as arguably the best functional genomics tool available to date, providing direct, causal links between individual genes and loss-of-function phenotypes through robust, broadly applicable, and readily upscalable methodologies. Originally applied experimentally in C. elegans and Drosophila, RNAi is now widely used in mammalian cell systems also. The development of commercially available libraries of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and other RNAi silencing reagents targeting entire classes of human genes provide the opportunity to carry out genome-scale screens to discover and characterize gene functions directly in human cells. A key challenge of these studies, also faced by earlier genomics or proteomics approaches, resides in reaching an optimal balance between the necessarily high throughput and the desire to achieve the same level of detailed analysis that is routine in conventional small-scale studies. This chapter discusses technical aspects of how to perform such screens, what parameters to monitor, and which readouts to apply. Examples of homogenous assays and multiplexed high-content microscopy-based screens are demonstrated.",

High throughput target validation and expression studies are expected to yield a powerful arsenal of new cancer treatments, but untangling the complex pathways underlying the major cancer phenotypes remains a significant challenge. A considerable body of evidence in recent years implicates deregulated expression of a single multi-component enzyme, telomerase, as a causative factor at the heart of immortalization in the vast majority of human tumors. This review highlights the potential of telomerase as a target for novel cancer therapies. The potential of exploiting the selectivity of the telomerase family of genes within cancer cells to develop gene therapy strategies is discussed, and the progress towards translating these novel therapeutics from the laboratory to the clinic is reviewed.",

        "abstract": "Background: Physical activity in early childhood may be important for the prevention of childhood obesity. It is unknown if parent-reported physical and sedentary activity correlate with direct measures in preschoolers. Objective: To compare parent-reported physical and sedentary activity and directly measured physical activity and sedentary activity using accelerometers in young children. Methods: From 2013 to 2014,117 healthy children aged 5 years and under were recruited from the TARGet Kids! primary care research network. Eighty-seven wore Actical accelerometers for at least 4 days. Average daily physical activity was defined as the sum of activity >100 counts per minute, and sedentary activity as the sum of activity <100 counts/min, during waking hours. Parents reported daily physical activity (including unstructured free play in and out of school, and structured activities) and sedentary behaviours (including screen time, stroller time, time in motor vehicle). Spearman correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots were used to compare parent-reported measures to accelerometer data. Results: The correlation between parent-reported and directly measured total physical activity was rho=0.39 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.56). The correlations between types of physical activity (unstructured activity in and out of school/daycare, and structured activity) and accelerometer were rho=0.30 (0.09, 0.49); rho=0.42 (0.23, 0.58); rho=0.26 (0.05, 0.46), respectively. Parent-reported and objectively measured total sedentary behaviour were not correlated, rho=0.10 (-0.12, 0.33) Conclusions: Parent-reported measures of unstructured free play and structured activity may be valid for the relative measurement of physical activity among young children. Further research is needed to adequately capture sedentary activity in young children.",

        "abstract": "This paper concentrates on instrumental thinking to analyse the conceptualization of translation in praxis and theory. First, instrumental thinking is introduced as a general mode of thinking which can be traced across different academic disciplines. A critical position is adopted with reference to Horkheimer/Adorno and Bourdieu. Based on Bourdieu's work on 'the state of the unthought' and the 'pre-constructed,' some examples from academic discourse are discussed to foreground how a certain type of instrumental thinking is linked to market-oriented politics and how this shapes concepts in academic discourse as well. It is argued that the effects of the instrumental can be found on several levels in Translation Studies and that these levels are interrelated. These include the ways translation is understood and approached in practice by interaction partners involved in translation and interpreting processes, in the discourses on translation and interpretation in fields outside academia, and in scholarly work on translation.

Devised by the present author, who is also responsible for the translations analyzed, the CIS is a translational scheme whereby meaning is understood as an inexhaustible textual effect, and which, in its theoretical elucidation, seeks to raise the practicing translator's awareness of the control he or she might have over the degree of infinite exegetic circumscription \u00f9 and subsequent infinite exegetic recreation \u00f9 during the translation process.",

        "abstract": "There is no doubt that self-reflection and meta-reflection are characteristic of every dynamic and developing scholarly discipline. Nevertheless, it is arguable that meta-reflection is exceptionally clearly present in Translation Studies (see Gambier: this issue). Some scholars may get the impression that the discipline, despite its perceived successful development over recent decades, is caught in a more or less permanent state of doubt and uncertainty. Or is this just a more negative perception of the very features that others consider signs of the dynamics of the discipline? After several paradigm changes and even more turns, after fights about scholarly territories and methodological renewal, after intra- and interdisciplinary discussions, after the question whether localizing knowledge embarrasses or rather complements globalizing research etc., Translation Studies continues to produce a large number of publications dealing with the struggle of defining itself and its object, with the borderlines of both the discipline and the object, with ways of interacting with related (sub)disciplines",

        "abstract": "Equivalence was a key word in the linguistics-based translation theories of the 1960s and 1970s, although its basic mode of thought may be traced back to Cicero and later to the Renaissance theories that began to presuppose languages of equal status. Close inspection reveals that some theories assume pre-existing equivalents and are thus concerned with a search for 'natural' equivalence. Other theories allow that translators actively create equivalents, and are thus concerned with 'directional' equivalence. The first kind of equivalence is concerned with what languages ideally do prior to translation; the other deals with what they can do. These two approaches are often intertwined, giving rise to many misunderstandings and unfair criticisms of the underlying concept. The historical undoing of the equivalence paradigm came when the directional use of the term allowed that equivalence need be no more a belief or expectation at the moment of reception, which need not be substantiated on the level of linguistic forms. At the same time, source texts became less stable and languages have been returning to more visibly hierarchical relations, further undermining the concept. Contemporary localization projects may nevertheless fruitfully be interrogated from the perspective of natural and directional equivalence, since the presumptions are being used by contemporary technology precisely at the moment when the terms themselves have been dropped from critical and exploratory metalanguage.",

By comparing pauses recorded from both processes, two temporal features were discovered: Firstly, the mean length of pause at textual category boundaries grew the higher the category was in the linguistic hierarchy. Secondly, the length of pause at clause level and lower was on average longer in translation than in monolingual text production, where- as pauses above clause level tended to be shorter in translation. Besides the differences in pause duration, translation also affected the use of total production time. Translation requires on average a longer revision and monitoring phase while the drafting phase is completed more quickly. Both writing tasks used approximately the same proportion of time for the orientation phase.",

The advertisements, newspaper pre-reviews and reviews named Reita Lounatvuori, a well-known Finnish theatre translator, as the author of the translation. However, several other people were also involved in the translation process before Mouawad\u2019s text reached the stage. In my article, I offer an empirical study of the process of translation of Incendies into Finnish to argue that translations in the theatre are not objects of art but products of art worlds, bearing the fingerprints of many subjectivities. To support my argument, I draw on Actor-Network Theory, as recently developed in the context of translation sociology (Buzelin 2007, 2005; Bogic 2010), and on Performance Studies, following Richard Schechner\u2019s articulation of the concept of performance (Schechner 2013). I apply these models to the specific context of the theatre, the specific genre of drama, and the process of translating one play. This interdisciplinary exploratory study argues for the relevance of Schechner\u2019s analytical model, and more broadly of Performance Studies, to the analysis of interlingual translation processes.",

        "abstract": "In recent years localization has become a popular concept in both translation practice and theory. It has developed a language of its own, which, however, still seems to be little known among translation scholars. What is more, being primarily an industry-based discourse, the terms related to localization are very fluid, which makes theorizing about it difficult. Therefore, the aim of this article is, first of all, to explain the basic terms of the metalanguage of localization, as they are used by both localization practitioners and scholars, and, secondly, to make this metalanguage more consistent by proposing some general definitions that cover the basic concepts in localization. This, in turn, should, on the one hand, facilitate scholar-to-practitioner communication and vice versa and, on the other, should result in concept standardization for training purposes. In the conclusions I link the present discussion of the metalanguage of localization to a more general debate on metalanguage(s) in Translation Studies and propose that in the future we might witness the emergence of a new discipline called Localization Studies.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis evolves from the vascular wall. The initial build-up starts at the inner layers of the intima media complex of the artery. To track these phases of the beginning of disease requires a technique that can reliably detect and follow the extent and severity non-invasively over time. The artery that is accessible and indicative for the process of atherosclerosis is the carotid artery. The Quantitative assessment of the Intima Media Thickness (IMT) using ultrasound is safe, validated and portable, is inexpensive, and can be used in multicenter studies. IMT coupled with an interactive large multi-ethnic may provide a reliable tool to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular complications like myocardial infarction or stroke. QIMT combines the quantitative analyses and assessment of the far wall of the common carotid artery in a specific area, proximal to the bulb, that includes a fully automatic algorithm interacting with an ethnically diverse database. Many new and exciting applications where the underlying disease has an impact on cardiovascular disease have been added to its cardiovascular current use. The standardization of the whole procedure front image acquisition, transport of images, computerized assessment of images and interactive assessment for a specific individual is critical in its new and expanded role. Unfortunately the vast majority of the current systems do not adhere to these requirements, leading to a false sense of security when a value is provided. Given the lack of standardization in most IMT programs, a new valid standard is urgently needed, with the dissemination of these new concepts of application happens. The QIMT method of assessment of the far wall of the common carotid artery is validated, reproducible and the preferred method proposed for standardization. Different specialties should be approached and contribute in the expansion of its use, as opposed to the current trend to limit QIMT to specific healthcare areas. \u00a9 2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence in obesity has increased dramatically over the past 30 years, more than double in the United States alone. Obesity is associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, biliary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and certain types of cancer. The pathophysiology of obesity is complex, involving behavioral, environmental, and genetic factors. Current treatment options include behavior modification and lifestyle changes which incorporate weight-reducing diets and physical activity, FDA approved long-term anti-obesity pharmacological agents sibutramine and orlistat, non-FDA approved over-the-counter (OTC) supplements and nutriceuticals, and, when appropriate, bariatric surgery. Without adequate prevention and treatment of obesity, government agencies have suggested that the direct and indirect costs associated with obesity may overwhelm the healthcare system. This brief review explores the current data available on treatments for the obese patient including the relative merits of different types of macronutrient composition (e.g., low carbohydrate vs. high carbohydrate diets) of weight-reducing diets, the value of resistance/ strength training in physical activity programs designed for the obese patient, the safety and efficacy associated with OTC supplements and nutriceuticals for weight reduction (e.g., Ephedra, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), Garcinia cambogial hydroxycitric acid (HCA), chromium, pyruvate), the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved long-term obesity treatments sibutramine and orlistat, and bariatric surgery. \u00a9 2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

They differ not only in how they address their subject matter but also in that they occupy different \u201cniches\u201d in the culture. In the terminology of Bourdieu, they partake in different, though possibly partly overlapping cultural fields. This article attempts to create a meeting place for two representatives of these disciplines: Paul Ric\u0153ur, a leading figure in French hermeneutics of the 20th century, and Gideon Toury, a prominent researcher in the field of translation studies. Ric\u0153ur's concept of the (non-existing) \u201cthird text\u201d is compared with Toury's concept of \u201cthe adequate translation as a hypothetical construct\u201d, which was proposed in the 1980s and negated in the 1990s; and Ric\u0153ur's view of translation as \u201cequivalence without adequacy\u201d is compared with Toury's stand on this issue. The possibility of working with both and reading each of them in light of the other is examined by applying their ideas to a test case \u2014 three Hebrew translations of Kipling's \u201cIf\u201d.

However, the role of its paralogue, BACE2, proved elusive until a 2011 publication implicated it as a Collectrin (TMEM27) secretase controlling pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and a new therapeutic intervention for diabetes.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review, using SureChemOpen, encompasses early validation compounds and small-molecule BACE2 inhibitors for diabetes. Since 2010, one assay patent and several chemical series have been published by Roche but these were followed by filings from Novartis and Schering in 2012. The patents from these three companies include BACE2-only filings but also some specifying both BACE1 and BACE2 inhibitors.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Roche's early collaborative target validation has given them a lead in BACE2 medicinal chemistry. However, the extensive data output for BACE1 in patents and papers over the last decade, plus liganded crystal structures for both proteases, should expedite the design of BACE2 inhibitors by other organisations. This may also shorten the development time for clinical candidates that, unlike those now entering Phase I trials for BACE1, would not need to be brain-penetrant.",

Recent developments in RNA interference (RNAi) technology in in vivo models promise to further improve upon the static and irreversible features of gene knockouts. Chemical genetic approaches create novel functional alleles of targets and allow fine modulation of protein function in vivo by small molecules, providing the most pharmacologically relevant target validation. Using these advanced models, one can not only ask whether the function of the target is critical for the initiation and maintenance of the disease, but also whether therapies designed to alter the function of the target would be safe and efficacious.

This potential arises from the numerous advantages that 3D imagery has to offer over traditional 2D imagery, thereby increasing the accuracy of automatic target detection (ATD) and recognition (ATR). Despite advancements in both 3D sensing and 3D data exploitation, 3D imagery has yet to demonstrate a true operational gain, partly due to the processing burden of the massive dataloads generated by modern sensors. In this context, this paper describes the current status of a workbench designed for the study of 3D ATD/ATR. Among the project goals is the comparative assessment of algorithms and 3D sensing technologies given various scenarios. The workbench is comprised of three components: a database, a toolbox, and a simulation environment. The database stores, manages, and edits input data of various types such as point clouds, video, still imagery frames, CAD models and metadata. The toolbox features data processing modules, including range data manipulation, surface mesh generation, texture mapping, and a shape-from-motion module to extract a 3D target representation from video frames or from a sequence of still imagery. The simulation environment includes synthetic point cloud generation, 3D ATD/ATR algorithm prototyping environment and performance metrics for comparative assessment. In this paper, the workbench components are described and preliminary results are presented. Ladar, video and still imagery datasets collected during airborne trials are also detailed.",

The protozoal diversity of rumen contents from moose in Alaska was assessed. In the present study, primer set 1, P-SSU-316F and GIC758R (amplicon of 482 bases), gave the best representation of diversity using BLAST classification, and the set amplified Entodinium simplex and Ostracodinium spp., which were not amplified by the other two primer sets.

Primer sets 1 and 2 are recommended for use in ruminants. However, primer set 1 may be inadequate to determine protozoal diversity in nonruminants.

The human genome codes for hundreds of different miRNAs and it is predicted that they target thousands of mRNAs involved in a wide variety of physiological processes such as development and cell identity. In animals, the identification of mRNA targets is complex because most miRNAs and their target mRNAs do not have exact or nearly exact complementarity. This tendency of animal miRNAs to bind their mRNA targets with imperfect sequence homology represents a considerable challenge to identifying miRNA targets. Computational algorithms based on conservation and experimental approaches based on expression profiles are flooding the literature with lists of candidate genes containing a large number of false-positive and false-negative predictions and indirect targets that cover the real list of direct targets for each miRNA. Currently, the only available tools to validate a sequence as a direct target of an miRNA are the systems based on a reporter gene carrying the candidate sequence. Here, an miRNA target validation reporter gene system based on the luminescence generated by the luciferase protein is described in detail, including the design of the reporter constructs, its expression in a model cell line and its measurement using a luciferase assay.",

The conservation of genome structure and physiology among organisms poses unexpected peculiarities, and the redundancy in certain gene families or the presence of polymorphisms that can slightly alter gene expression can, in certain instances, bring invertebrate systems, such as Drosophila, closer to humans than mice and vice versa. This necessitates the analysis of disease pathways in multiple model organisms. Areas covered: The author highlights findings from Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases that have occurred in the past few years. She also highlights and discusses various molecular, genetic and genomic tools used in flies, as well as methods for generating disease models. Finally, the author describes Drosophila models of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's tri-nucleotide repeat diseases, and Fragile X syndrome and summarizes insights in disease mechanisms that have been discovered directly in fly models. Expert opinion: Full genome genetic screens in Drosophila can lead to the rapid identification of drug target candidates that can be subsequently validated in a vertebrate system. In addition, the Drosophila models of neurodegeneration may often show disease phenotypes that are absent in equivalent mouse models. The author believes that the extensive contribution of Drosophila to both new disease drug target discovery, in addition to target validation, makes them indispensible to drug discovery and development.",

        "abstract": "The term epigenetic landscape was coined by CH Waddington to describe how cell fates were established in development, visualized as valleys and ridges directing the irreversibility of cell type differentiation. It is now clear that normal differentiation control breaks down during tumor development and that all tumor types show aberrant regulation of the epigenetic code, including changes in DNA methylation, histone modification and microRNAs. This has led to much interest in the development of epigenetic cancer therapies to target this aberrant epigenetic regulation. Histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are now used in the treatment of certain hematological malignancies. However, their more general applicability to solid tumors may be limited by lack of specificity and delivery challenges. Approaches to overcome these limitations and how to develop more specific drugs are discussed. The use of RNAi in the context of genome regulation as well as the possibility to use polyamides and engineered zinc fingers to target master regulators in the future is examined. Ultimately, improved specificity of epigenetic therapies will require increased mapping of the aberrant epigenetic landscape in cancer and cancer-specific target validation using chemical epigenetic approaches.",

        "abstract": "<p>Background: Quality of life (QOL) is an important outcome measure in the treatment of heroin addiction. The Taiwan version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment (WHOQOL-BREF [TW]) has been developed and studied in various groups, but not specifically in a population of injection drug users. The aim of this study was to analyze the psychometric properties of the WHOQOL-BREF (TW) in a sample of injection drug users undergoing methadone maintenance treatment.Methods: A total of 553 participants were interviewed and completed the instrument. Item-response distributions, internal consistency, corrected item-domain correlation, criterion-related validity, and construct validity through confirmatory factor analysis were evaluated.Results: The frequency distribution of the 4 domains of the WHOQOL-BREF (TW) showed no floor or ceiling effects. The instrument demonstrated adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficients were higher than 0.7 across the 4 domains) and all items had acceptable correlation with the corresponding domain scores (r = 0.32-0.73). Correlations (p &lt; 0.01) of the 4 domains with the 2 benchmark items assessing overall QOL and general health were supportive of criterion-related validity. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded marginal goodness-of-fit between the 4-domain model and the sample data.Conclusions: The hypothesized WHOQOL-BREF measurement model was appropriate for the injection drug users after some adjustments. Despite different patterns found in the confirmatory factor analysis, the findings overall suggest that the WHOQOL-BREF (TW) is a reliable and valid measure of QOL among injection drug users and can be utilized in future treatment outcome studies. The factor structure provided by the study also helps to understand the QOL characteristics of the injection drug users in Taiwan. However, more research is needed to examine its test-retest reliability and sensitivity to changes due to treatment. \ufffd 2013 Fu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</p>",

Liquid and vapor penetration as well as multidimensional liquid and vapor data were used as response variables. The Morris one-at-a-time (MOAT) screening method was used to identify the most important boundary conditions. The LHS and PCE methods both predict the same level of variability in the response variables, which was much larger than the corresponding experimental uncertainty. Nested grids were used in conjunction with the PCE method to examine the effects of subsets of boundary condition variables. Numerical modeling parameters had a much larger effect on the resulting spray predictions; the uncertainty in spray penetration or multidimensional spray contours from physically derived boundary conditions was close to the uncertainty of the measurements.",

        "abstract": "Target identification is one of the most critical steps following cell-based phenotypic chemical screens aimed at identifying compounds with potential uses in cell biology and for developing novel disease therapies. Current in silico target identification methods, including chemical similarity database searches, are limited to single or sequential ligand analysis that have limited capabilities for accurate deconvolution of a large number of compounds with diverse chemical structures. Here, we present CSNAP (Chemical Similarity Network Analysis Pulldown), a new computational target identification method that utilizes chemical similarity networks for large-scale chemotype (consensus chemical pattern) recognition and drug target profiling. Our benchmark study showed that CSNAP can achieve an overall higher accuracy (>80%) of target prediction with respect to representative chemotypes in large (>200) compound sets, in comparison to the SEA approach (60-70%). Additionally, CSNAP is capable of integrating with biological knowledge-based databases (Uniprot, GO) and high-throughput biology platforms (proteomic, genetic, etc) for system-wise drug target validation. To demonstrate the utility of the CSNAP approach, we combined CSNAP's target prediction with experimental ligand evaluation to identify the major mitotic targets of hit compounds from a cell-based chemical screen and we highlight novel compounds targeting microtubules, an important cancer therapeutic target. The CSNAP method is freely available and can be accessed from the CSNAP web server (http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/CSNAP/).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:In an epidemiological study, it is essential to test the validity of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for its ability to estimate dietary intake. The objectives of our study were to 1) validate a FFQ for estimating folate intake, and to identify the foods that contribute to inter-individual variation of folate intake in the Japanese population.METHODS:Validity of the FFQ was evaluated using 28-day weighed dietary records (DRs) as gold standard in the two groups independently. In the group for which the FFQ was developed, validity was evaluated by Spearman's correlation coefficients (CCs), and linear regression analysis was used to identify foods with large inter-individual variation. The cumulative mean intake of these foods was compared with total intake estimated by the DR. The external validity of the FFQ and intake from foods on the same list were evaluated in the other group to verify generalizability. Subjects were a subsample from the Japan Public Health Center-based prospective Study who volunteered to participate in the FFQ validation study.RESULTS:CCs for the internal validity of the FFQ were 0.49 for men and 0.29 and women, while CCs for external validity were 0.33 for men and 0.42 for women. CCs for cumulative folate intake from 33 foods selected by regression analysis were also applicable to an external population.CONCLUSION:Our FFQ was valid for and generalizable to the estimation of folate intake. Foods identified as predictors of inter-individual variation in folate intake were also generalizable in Japanese populations. The FFQ with 138 foods was valid for the estimation of folate intake, while that with 33 foods might be useful for estimating inter-individual variation and ranking of individual folate intake.",

        "abstract": "Considerable interest has arisen in the recent years utilizing inexpensive acoustic sensors in the battlefield to perform targets of interest identification and classification. There are many advantages of using acoustic sensor arrays. They are low cost, and relatively have low power consumption. They require no line of sight and provide many capabilities for target detection, bearing estimation, target tracking, classification and identification. Furthermore, they can provide cueing for other sensors and multiple acoustic sensor responses can be combined and triangulated to localize an energy source target in the field. In practice, however, many environment noise factors affect their performance in detecting targets of interest reliably and accurate. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach for detection, classification, and identification of moving target vehicles. The approach is based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) coupled with Particle Filtering (PF) technique. Using SVD dominant features of vehicle acoustic signatures are extracted efficiently. Then, these feature vectors are employed for robust identification and classification of target vehicles based on a particle filtering scheme. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated based on a set of experimental acoustic data from multiple vehicle test-runs. It is demonstrated that the approach yields very promising results where an array of acoustic sensors are used to detect, identify and classify target vehicles in the field.",

Different combinations of microRNAs are expressed in different cell types and may coordinately regulate cell-specific target genes. Here, we present PicTar, a computational method for identifying common targets of microRNAs. Statistical tests using genome-wide alignments of eight vertebrate genomes, PicTar's ability to specifically recover published microRNA targets, and experimental validation of seven predicted targets suggest that PicTar has an excellent success rate in predicting targets for single microRNAs and for combinations of microRNAs. We find that vertebrate microRNAs target, on average, roughly 200 transcripts each. Furthermore, our results suggest widespread coordinate control executed by microRNAs. In particular, we experimentally validate common regulation of Mtpn by miR-375, miR-124 and let-7b and thus provide evidence for coordinate microRNA control in mammals.",

This approach to experimental controller validation avoids the conservatism inherent in indirect two-step validation approaches that require one to first identify a plant model and uncertainty-bounds from experimental data before analysing control system robustness.

        "abstract": "Understanding the functional response of bacteria to their natural environment is one of the challenges in current microbiology. Over the past decades several techniques have been developed to study gene expression in complex natural habitats. Most of these methods however are laborious and validation of results under in situ conditions is cumbersome. Here we report the improvement of the Recombinase-based In Vivo Expression Technology (R-IVET) by the implementation of two additional reporter genes. The first one is an alpha-galactosidase (melA) which facilitates the rapid identification of in vivo induced genes. Secondly, the bacterial luciferase genes (luxAB) are transcriptionally coupled to the resolvase gene which allows rapid validation and characterization of in vivo induced genes. The system is implemented and validated in the industrially important lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis. We demonstrate the applicability of the advanced R-IVET system by the identification and validation of lactococcal promoter elements that are induced in minimal medium as compared to the commonly used rich laboratory medium M17. R-IVET screening led to the identification of 19 promoters that predominantly control expression of genes involved in amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, and transport functions. Furthermore the luciferase allows high resolution transcription analysis and enabled the identification of complex medium constituents and specific molecules involved in promoter control. Rapid target validation exemplifies the high throughput potential of the extended R-IVET system. The system can be applied to other bacterial species, provided the used reporter genes are functional in the organism of interest.",

        "abstract": "In bacteria, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) DNA-targeting complex Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense) uses CRISPR RNA (crRNA) guides to bind complementary DNA targets at sites adjacent to a trinucleotide signature sequence called the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). The Cascade complex then recruits Cas3, a nuclease-helicase that catalyzes unwinding and cleavage of foreign double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bearing a sequence matching that of the crRNA. Cascade comprises the CasA-E proteins and one crRNA, forming a structure that binds and unwinds dsDNA to form an R loop in which the target strand of the DNA base pairs with the 32-nt RNA guide sequence. Single-particle electron microscopy reconstructions of dsDNA-bound Cascade with and without Cas3 reveal that Cascade positions the PAM-proximal end of the DNA duplex at the CasA subunit and near the site of Cas3 association. The finding that the DNA target and Cas3 colocalize with CasA implicates this subunit in a key target-validation step during DNA interference. We show biochemically that base pairing of the PAM region is unnecessary for target binding but critical for Cas3-mediated degradation. In addition, the L1 loop of CasA, previously implicated in PAM recognition, is essential for Cas3 activation following target binding by Cascade. Together, these data show that the CasA subunit of Cascade functions as an essential partner of Cas3 by recognizing DNA target sites and positioning Cas3 adjacent to the PAM to ensure cleavage.",

In 2009, cellular prion protein (PrPC) was identified in a genome-wide screen as a high-affinity receptor for A beta oligomers, and since then, many studies have explored the role of PrPC in Alzheimer's disease. Herein, I systematically assess the current level of target validation for PrPC in Alzheimer's disease and the merits of the identified approaches to therapeutically affect the PrPC: A beta oligomer-interaction. The interaction of A beta oligomers with PrPC in mice impairs hippocampal long-term potentiation, memory, and learning in a manner that involves Fyn, tau, and glutamate receptors. Furthermore, PrPC acts to catalyze the formation of certain A beta oligomeric species in the synapse and may mediate the toxic effects of other beta-sheet rich oligomers as well. Therapeutic approaches utilizing soluble PrPC ectodomain or monoclonal antibodies targeting PrPC can at least partially prevent the neurotoxic effects of A beta oligomers in mice.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms are detrimental to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of Parkinson's disease patients. In this study, the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) was used to assess the impact of the non-motor symptoms on HRQoL of Parkinson's disease patients. METHODS: In a multicenter, international, cross sectional study on 411 Parkinson's disease patients, the NMSS was applied along with clinical (Hoehn and Yahr staging and SCOPA-Motor) and HRQoL measures (PDQ-39, and EQ-5D). Prevalence of non-motor symptoms was determined also through the NMSS. The association of NMSS and SCOPA-Motor with HRQoL measures and the differences in HRQoL scores between patients with and without non-motor symptoms in each NMSS domain were estimated by non-parametric statistics. Predictors of HRQoL were sought through multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Nocturia (68.4% of the sample), fatigue (65.9%), and dribbling saliva (56.7%), were the most frequent complaints. Total NMSS score: (1) showed a higher correlation coefficient (r(S) = 0.70) with the PDQ-39 Summary Index (SI) than SCOPA-Motor (r(S) = 0.58); (2) showed high-moderate correlation (r(S) = 0.60 - 0.38) with all PDQ-39 domains; and (3) was the best predictor of HRQoL as measured by the PDQ-39 SI. For each NMSS domain, patients with symptoms had significantly worse HRQoL scores than patients without symptoms. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine in a holistic manner the impact of the non-motor symptoms on HRQoL of Parkinson's disease patients. The results show that non-motor symptoms have, as a whole, a greater impact on HRQoL than motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms progression contributes importantly to HRQoL decline in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

This is related to, but in contrast with, translation validation, which aims to establish that a particular instance of a transformation undertaken by an optimising compiler is semantics preserving. Our main setting is a program logic for a subset of Java bytecode, which is sound and complete for a resource-annotated operational semantics. The latter employs resource algebras for measuring dynamic costs such as time, space and more elaborate examples. We describe examples of optimisation validation that we have formally verified in Isabelle/HOL using the logic. We also introduce a type and effect system for measuring static costs such as code size, which is proved consistent with the operational semantics. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Our novel riboswitch-ligand pairings are shown to regulate physiologically important genes required for bacterial motility in Escherichia coli and cell morphology in Bacillus subtilis.

Of these predicted targets, 446 and 1,049 proteins with the highest rank and total scores, respectively, included homologs of targets for cancer chemotherapy, depression, age-related decline and cardiovascular disease. Based on comparative analyses, more than half of drug target proteins identified from the tree shrew genome were shown to be higher similarity to human targets than in the mouse. Target validation also demonstrated that the constitutive expression of the proteinase-activated receptors of tree shrew platelets is similar to that of human platelets but differs from that of mouse platelets. We developed an effective pipeline and search strategy for drug target prediction and the evaluation of model-based target identification for drug testing.

        "abstract": "High-throughput molecular technologies have provided a wealth of putative biomarkers representing potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets. Target validation commonly requires abundant and well-characterized tissue resources, as well as linked clinicopathologic data-sets. The tissue micro-array (TMA) is a validation and discovery platform of increasing popularity and necessity. TMAs provide a rapid means of examining in situ gene expression in a wide spectrum and large number of tissue samples. This paper describes the uses of TMAs as a translational research tool in biomarker profiling. The laboratory has performed numerous biomarker studies on several types of epithelial cancers. As an example, Epithelial Protein Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM), a panepithelial antigen used to target tumours with immunotherapy, was examined in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). EpCAM was an independent prognosticator for improved disease-specific survival in 318 clear cell RCCs examined, with a Cox proportional hazards multivariate hazard ratio of 0.63 (p=0.017; 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.92). Interestingly, despite a typically widespread epithelial expression, EpCAM is instead infrequently expressed in clear cell RCC, the most common type of renal cancer, making it a poor target for immunotherapy. In this capacity the TMA provided strong support for halting lengthy and costly clinical trials for this application.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are the endogenous small non-coding RNA molecules capable of silencing protein coding genes at the posttranscriptional level. Based on computer-aided predictions, a single microRNA could have over a hundred of targets. On the other hand, a single protein-coding gene could be targeted by many potential microRNAs. However, only a relatively small number of these predicted microRNA/mRNA interactions are experimentally validated, and no systematic validation has been carried out using a reporter system.\\n\\nMETHODS: In this study, we used luciferease reporter assays to validate microRNAs that can silence cyclin D1 (CCND1) because CCND1 is a well known proto-oncogene implicated in a variety of types of cancers. We chose miRanda http://www.microRNA.org as a primary prediction method. We then cloned 51 of 58 predicted microRNA precursors into pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP and tested for their effect on the luciferase reporter carrying the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of CCND1 gene.\\n\\nRESULTS: Real-time PCR revealed the 45 of 51 cloned microRNA precursors expressed a relatively high level of the exogenous microRNAs which were used in our validation experiments. By an arbitrary cutoff of 35% reduction, we identified 7 microRNAs that were able to suppress Luc-CCND1-UTR activity. Among them, 4 of them were previously validated targets and the rest 3 microRNAs were validated to be positive in this study. Of interest, we found that miR-503 not only suppressed the luciferase activity, but also suppressed the endogenous CCND1 both at protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, we showed that miR-503 was able to reduce S phase cell populations and caused cell growth inhibition, suggesting that miR-503 may be a putative tumor suppressor.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This study provides a more comprehensive picture of microRNA/CCND1 interactions and it further demonstrates the importance of experimental target validation.",

In this report, genes were selected by using DNA microarrays on a panel of colorectal cancer (CRC) paired samples. A large number of up-regulated genes in colorectal cancer patients were investigated for cellular location, and those corresponding to membrane or extracellular proteins were used for a non-biased expression in Escherichia coli. We investigated different sources of cDNA clones for protein expression as well as the influence of the protein size and the different tags with respect to protein expression levels and solubility in E. coli. From 29 selected genes, 21 distinct proteins were finally expressed as soluble proteins with, at least, one different fusion protein. In addition, seven of these potential markers (ANXA3, BMP4, LCN2, SPARC, SPP1, MMP7, and MMP11) were tested for antibody production and/or validation. Six of the seven proteins (all except SPP1) were confirmed to be overexpressed in colorectal tumoral tissues by using immunoblotting and tissue microarray analysis. Although none of them could be associated to early stages of the tumor, two of them (LCN2 and MMP11) were clearly overexpressed in late Dukes' stages (B and C). This proteomic study reveals novel clues for the assembly of a robust and highly efficient high throughput system for the validation of genomic data. Moreover it illustrates the different difficulties and bottlenecks encountered for performing a quick conversion of genomic results into clinically useful proteins.",

In particular we address the problem of data association after coalescence - this happens when two objects become sufficiently close (in angular terms) that they can no longer be resolved by the EO sensor. Some moments later they de-coalesce and the resulting detections must be associated with the existing tracks in the EO sensor. Traditionally this would be solved by making use of the velocity vectors of the objects prior to coalescence. This approach can work well for crossing objects, but when the objects are largely moving in a direction radial to the sensor it becomes problematic. Here we investigate the use of data fusion to combine Radar range with a brightness measure derived from an EO sensor to enhance the accuracy of data association.

There is an increasing need for better target validation for new drug development and proteomic technologies are contributing to it. Identifying a potential protein drug target within a cell is a major challenge in modern drug discovery; techniques for screening the proteome are, therefore, an important tool. Major difficulties for target identification include the separation of proteins and their detection. These technologies are compared to enable the selection of the one by matching the needs of a particular project. There are prospects for further improvement, and proteomics technologies will form an important addition to the existing genomic and chemical technologies for new target validation. Proteomics is applicable for protein analysis and bioinformatics based analysis gives the comprehensive molecular description of the actual protein component. Bioinformatics is being increasingly used to support target validation by providing functionally predictive information mined from databases and experimental datasets using a variety of computational tools.

To better understand the mechanism in OA pathogenesis and investigate its effective target, we analyzed miRNA profiles during OA pathogenesis and verify the role and its functional targets of miR-488.\\n\\nRESULTS: Human articular chondrocytes were obtained from cartilage of OA patients undergoing knee replacement surgery and biopsy samples of normal cartilage and the expression profile of miRNA was analyzed. From expression profile, most potent miR was selected and its target and functional role in OA pathogenesis were investigated using target validation system and OA animal model system. Among miRNAs tested, miR-488 was significantly decreased in OA chondrocytes Furthermore, we found that exposure of IL-1\u03b2 was also suppressed whereas exposure of TGF-\u03b23 induced the induction of miR-488 in human articular chondrocytes isolated from biopsy samples of normal cartilages. Target validation study showed that miR-488 targets ZIP8 and suppression of ZIP8 in OA animal model showed the reduced cartilage degradation. Target validation study showed that miR-488 targets ZIP8 and suppression of ZIP8 in OA animal model showed the reduced cartilage degradation.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: miR-488 acts as a positive role for chondrocyte differentiation/cartilage development by inhibiting MMP-13 activity through targeting ZIP-8.",

        "abstract": "Validation of analytical procedures is a vital aspect not just for regulatory purposes, but also for their efficient and reliable long-term application. In order to address the performance of the analytical procedure adequately, the analyst is responsible to identify the relevant parameters, to design the experimental validation studies accordingly and to define appropriate acceptance criteria. Establishing an acceptable analytical variability for the given application is of central importance as many other acceptance criteria can be derived from such a precision. Acceptable precision ranges for types of control tests and/or analytes can be obtained from validation, but also related activities such as transfer, control charts, or extracted from routine applications such as batch release or stability studies (data mining). Apart from compiling a database for general benchmarking, during such an information-building process, the reliability of the analytical variability of the specific procedure is more and more increased. This is important as a reliable target variability facilitates to detect or investigate atypical or out-of specification behaviour of analytical data in a routine application, thus improving the data quality and reliability. According to the life-cycle concept of validation, measures should be taken to maintain and control the validated status of analytical procedures during long-term routine application, such as monitoring relevant performance parameters (system suitability tests), control charts, etc. If the analytical system is demonstrated to be stable, i.e. under statistical control, a major variability contribution in LC originating from the standard preparation and analysis can be reduced. A concept of quantification by pre-determined calibration parameters instead of the classical approach of simultaneous calibration is described.",

        "abstract": "Multiple factors are involved in the translation of functional genomic results into proteins for proteome research and target validation on tumoral tissues. In this report, genes were selected by using DNA microarrays on a panel of colorectal cancer (CRC) paired samples. A large number of up-regulated genes in colorectal cancer patients were investigated for cellular location, and those corresponding to membrane or extracellular proteins were used for a non-biased expression in Escherichia coli. We investigated different sources of cDNA clones for protein expression as well as the influence of the protein size and the different tags with respect to protein expression levels and solubility in E. coli. From 29 selected genes, 21 distinct proteins were finally expressed as soluble proteins with, at least, one different fusion protein. In addition, seven of these potential markers (ANXA3, BMP4, LCN2, SPARC, SPP1, MMP7, and MMP11) were tested for antibody production and/or validation. Six of the seven proteins (all except SPP1) were confirmed to be overexpressed in colorectal tumoral tissues by using immunoblotting and tissue microarray analysis. Although none of them could be associated to early stages of the tumor, two of them (LCN2 and MMP11) were clearly overexpressed in late Dukes' stages (B and C). This proteomic study reveals novel clues for the assembly of a robust and highly efficient high throughput system for the validation of genomic data. Moreover it illustrates the different difficulties and bottlenecks encountered for performing a quick conversion of genomic results into clinically useful proteins.",

Joint data management (JDM) includes the hardware (e. g. sensors/targets), software (e. g. processing/algorithms), entities (e. g. service-based collections), and operations (scenario-based environments) of data exchange that enable persistent surveillance in the context of a layered sensing or data-to-decision (D2D) information fusion enterprise. Key attributes of an information fusion enterprise system require pragmatic assessment of data and information management, distributed communications, knowledge representation as well as a sensor mix, algorithm choice, life-cycle data management, and human-systems interaction. In this paper, we explore the various issues surrounding Wide-Area Video Exploitation (WAVE) in a layered-sensing environment to include improvements in Joint Data Management such as (1) data collection, construction, and transformation, (2) feature generation, extraction and selection, and (3) information evaluation, presentation, and dissemination. Throughout the paper, we seek to describe the current technology, research directions, and metrics that instantiate a realizable JDM product. We develop the methods for joint data management for structured and unstructured WAVE data in the context of decision making.

We examine this issue from the perspective of a tester who must accept or reject the forecasts of a potential expert. If experts can be skeptical about the validity of claims then they can strategically evade rejection. In contrast, if experts are required to conclude that claims backed by sufficient evidence are likely to be true, then they can be tested and rejected.

        "abstract": "AIM: To assess the feasibility and to demonstrate the potential clinical application of intravascular doppler in the evaluation of renal blood flow in patients with hypertension and normal renal arteries., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intravascular doppler was used to measure renal blood flow in 19 patients (34 kidneys) during arteriography to rule out renovascular hypertension. Arteriography showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis in any patient. Hemodynamic parameters, renal artery diameter, and doppler measurements were undertaken at baseline, after injection of a bolus (10 ml) of normal (0.9%) saline, and after injection of isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg diluted in 10 ml normal saline)., RESULTS: Repeated measurements of renal blood flow confirmed the reproducibility of the technique. Basal blood flow was similar in both right and left kidneys; injection of vehicle solution (10 ml normal saline) had no effect on doppler parameters. Injection of isosorbide dinitrate resulted in a significant increase in renal blood flow velocity reflecting an increase in renal blood flow; this demonstrates the existence of a renal flow reserve. The degree of increase in renal blood flow varied significantly between kidneys., CONCLUSIONS: Intravascular doppler is a safe, effective, and reproducible technique for measurement of renal blood flow. It allows evaluation of variations in renal blood flow in response to diverse vasoactive drugs or other vasomotor stimuli. The present study demonstrated the heterogenous response of renal blood flow in response to vasodilator stimuli.",

Several decades ago its clinical application in cancer treatment was explored but failed due to unacceptable toxicity. The causes behind the desired and undesired biological effects have never been elucidated and only limited information about acivicin-specific targets is available. In order to elucidate the target spectrum of acivicin in more detail we prepared functionalized derivatives and applied them for activity based proteomic profiling (ABPP) in intact cancer cells. Target deconvolution by quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) revealed a preference for specific aldehyde dehydrogenases. Further in depth target validation confirmed that acivicin inhibits ALDH4A1 activity by binding to the catalytic site. In accordance with this, downregulation of ALDH4A1 by siRNA resulted in a severe inhibition of cell growth and might thus provide an explanation for the cytotoxic effects of acivicin.",

Target identification commonly involves the search for differences between tumor and non-tumor cell lines and/or tissue at the DNA, mRNA, protein or antibody reactivity levels. The next stage, target validation, utilizes antibodies to profile the expression of antigen in normal and tumor tissue and to verify that the antigen is selectively expressed on the surface of tumor cells. Supportive evidence for protein expression is often sought by mRNA profiling and, sometimes, analysis for genomic defects. Unfortunately, concordance between mRNA and protein levels has been found in only about approximately 20% of cases and therefore must be evaluated for individual targets of interest. Antigens judged suitable for antibody targeting are then advanced to the next stage, namely, in vitro and then in vivo screening of antibodies for anti-tumor activities. Subsequent optimization of an antibody clinical lead for therapy is a desirable, if not obligatory, step to developing an antibody as an anti-cancer therapeutic. No single approach or even combination of methods has emerged as the preferred way to identify surface antigens suitable for targeting in oncology. Major options at each step in the process are reviewed here, including their strengths and limitations.",

        "abstract": "The PDE3 enzymes or \"low Km cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterases\" have long been established as important mediators of cellular physiology, and synthetic PDE3 inhibitors have been critical to the delineation of the enzymes' roles. Yet despite decades of progress on the biology of these enzymes, the medicinal chemistry landscape relating to PDE3 inhibitors has remained essentially unchanged since the mid 1990's. Up until then the field was at the cutting edge of drug design; without the tools of molecular and structural biology, molecules of high potency were being achieved using logical pharmacophore models and lead modification. Yet virtually all the impetus went out of this area on the back of failures at the clinic and PDE3 as a therapeutic target largely fell out of favour. A decade later and with the \"new\" technologies of structural and molecular biology breathing new life into PDE3 research in general, PDE3 inhibitors are sought for target validation in an array of therapeutic applications. In this review, we examine the current state of PDE3 research; firstly we summarize the structural and functional properties of PDE3 enzymes with particular attention to the heterogeneity within this class of enzymes which differ markedly in expression, localisation and means of regulation across various tissue types. It is the structural and functional complexity of the PDE3 enzymes that underpins the re-emergence of PDE3s roles as targets for drug design. We then look at past clinical evaluation of PDE3 inhibitors that occurred without that information and which may have had a significant bearing on the outcome of those drug discovery efforts. Finally we look at current approaches to the design of PDE3 inhibitors which utilize that historic data but also incorporate new inputs from structural biology and combinatorial chemistry.",

The success of intracellular binding reagents depends on their affinity and specificity for target molecules, although their stability and functionality in the intracellular environment actually determine their usefulness for such application. Alternative binding proteins derived from scaffolds devoid of disulfide bonds are well suited for intracellular use, as their folding and stability are usually not impaired under reducing conditions. Here, we describe the generation of intracellular binding reagents called Affilin, based on the human \u03b3B-crystallin scaffold. The target was human papillomavirus E7 protein implicated in the development of cervical cancer. E7 binders were selected from the combinatorial \u03b3B-crystallin library by conventional phage display technique. Affilin variants specifically bound the E7 protein with affinities in the nanomolar range. Intracellular expression of Affilin molecules in E7-positive cells led to inhibition of cellular proliferation. The effect was specific, as the growth of E7-negative cells or cells expressing the wild-type \u03b3B-crystallin scaffold remained unaffected. These results demonstrate that the \u03b3B-crystallin scaffold allows the de novo generation of alternative binding proteins, which are suitable for intracellular applications as they retain their functionality in the reducing environment of mammalian cells. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we suggest the usage of tests of equivalence, which use the hypothesis of dissimilarity as the null hypothesis, that is, the null hypothesis is that the model is unacceptable. Thus, they flip the burden of proof back onto the model. We demonstrate the application of equivalence testing to model validation using an empirical forest growth model and an extensive database of field measurements.

        "abstract": "New compounds are needed to treat parasitic nematode infections in humans, livestock and plants. Small molecule anthelmintics are the primary means of nematode parasite control in animals; however, widespread resistance to the currently available drug classes means control will be impossible without the introduction of new compounds. Adverse environmental effects associated with nematocides used to control plant parasitic species are also motivating the search for safer, more effective compounds. Discovery of new anthelmintic drugs in particular has been a serious challenge due to the difficulty of obtaining and culturing target parasites for high-throughput screens and the lack of functional genomic techniques to validate potential drug targets in these pathogens. We present here a novel strategy for target validation that employs the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to demonstrate the value of new ligand-gated ion channels as targets for anthelmintic discovery. Many successful anthelmintics, including ivermectin, levamisole and monepantel, are agonists of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, suggesting that the unexploited pentameric ion channels encoded in parasite genomes may be suitable drug targets. We validated five members of the nematode-specific family of acetylcholine-gated chloride channels as targets of agonists with anthelmintic properties by ectopically expressing an ivermectin-gated chloride channel, AVR-15, in tissues that endogenously express the acetylcholine-gated chloride channels and using the effects of ivermectin to predict the effects of an acetylcholine-gated chloride channel agonist. In principle, our strategy can be applied to validate any ion channel as a putative anti-parasitic drug target.",

The mechanism of action is thought to involve the inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II. However, NK109 also exhibits potent anti-tumor activities against doxorubicin-, cisplatin- and etoposide-resistant human cell lines. This paper describes target validation of NK109 using biotinylated NK109 and a T7 phage library screening procedure. Phage particles displaying an affinity for NK109 were isolated and the DNA sequence determined. The amino acid sequences of selected peptides, and the results of mutation experiments by alanine scanning, confirmed that the binding target motif of NK109 is PNxxxxP. In silico analysis of the interaction between NK109 and the peptide, by docking simulation and molecular dynamics, supported this conclusion. The PNxxxxP motif exists in the C2 domain of protein kinase C??. NK109 was confirmed to bind the C2 domain from surface plasmon resonance analysis. Furthermore, NK109 moderately inhibited protein kinase C activity in vitro. Our results show that the anti-tumor activity of NK109 stems from interactions with multiple protein targets. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

When this is compounded by large sensor uncertainties, different platform geometries, and poor sensor quality against targets that operate under variable speeds (often below thresholds detectable by GMTI sensors) and under high maneuvers, most tracking approaches fail. Two competing approaches have gained in popularity in recent years, Multiple Hypothesis Tracking and Interacting Multiple Model. Both of these approaches rely on the principles of hybrid state estimation using Gaussian mixtures. Traditionally, the chi-squared approach has been used to assess tracking performance, whether we use a single track model or multiple models within the Gaussian mixture framework. This paper will examine the use of Kullback-Leibler metrics as a viable means of measuring the impact of data selection on model parameter estimation and compare performance with respect to the Mahalanobis distance metric. Specifically, we shall show that the Mahalanobis distance is actually a special case of the Kullback-Leibler metric when evaluating Gaussian mixture model systems.",

In this paper, we develop a joint time-frequency approach for appliance event detection based on the time varying power signals obtained from the measured aggregated current and voltage waveforms. The short-time Fourier transform is performed to obtain the spectral components of the non-stationary aggregated power signals of appliances. The proposed event detector utilizes a goodness-of-fit Chi-squared test for detecting load activities using the calculated av- erage power followed by a change point detector for estimating the change point of the transient signals using the first harmonic component of the power signals. Unlike the conventional detectors such as the generalized likelihood ratio test, the proposed event detector allows a closed form calculation of the decision threshold and provides a guideline for choosing the size of the detection data window, thus eliminating the need for extensive training for determining the detection threshold while providing robust detection performance against dynamic load activities. Using the real-world power data collected in two residential building testbeds, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional generalized likelihood ratio detector.",

        "abstract": "An automated video enhancement technique capable of image fusion from a stream of randomly-distorted images of a still scene is presented in this paper. The technique is based on the \u201clucky-region\u201d fusion (LRF) approach and aims to improve locally the image quality according to the following steps: (1) for each image of the video stream an image quality map (IQM) which characterizes locally the image quality is computed, (2) each IQM is compared to that of the current fused image leading to the selection of best quality regions (the \u201clucky-regions\u201d), and (3) the selected regions are merged into the fused video stream. While the LRF approach succeeds in producing images with significantly improved image quality compared to the source images, its performance depends on the imaging conditions and requires adjustment of its fusion parameter \u2013 the fusion kernel size \u2013 in order to adapt to an evolving environment (e.g. a turbulent atmosphere). Parameter selection was so far performed manually using a trial-and-error approach which causes the technique to be impractical for a real world implementation. The automated LRF technique presented is relaxed from this requirement and selects automatically the fusion parameter based on the analysis of the source images making it more suitable for practical systems. The improved LRF technique is applied to imaging through atmospheric turbulence for various imaging conditions and scenes of interest. In each case automatically-fused video streams demonstrate increases in image quality comparable to that obtained with manual selection of the fusion parameter. Keywords:",

        "abstract": "We applied recently introduced universal image quality index Q that quantifies the distortion of a processed image relative to its original version, to assess the performance of different graylevel image fusion schemes.  The method is as follows. First, we adopt an original test image as the reference image. Second, we produce several distorted versions of this reference image. The distortions in the individual images are complementary, meaning that the same distortion should not occur at the same location in all images (it should be absent in at least one image). Thus, the information content of the overall set of distorted images should equal the information content of the original test image. Third, we apply the image fusion process to the set of distorted images.  Fourth, we quantify the similarity of the fused image to the reference image by computing the universal image quality index Q.  The method can also be used to optimize image fusion schemes for different types of distortions, by maximizing Q through repeated application of steps two and three for different parameter settings of the fusion scheme.",

        "abstract": "A new cascaded fuzzy classifier (CFC) is proposed to implement ground-moving targets classification tasks locally at sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSN). The CFC is composed of three and two binary fuzzy classifiers (BFC) respectively in seismic and acoustic signal channel in order to classify person, Light-wheeled (LW) Vehicle, and Heavywheeled (HW) Vehicle in presence of environmental background noise. Base on the CFC, a new basic belief assigni-nent (bba) function is defined for each component BFC to give out a piece of evidence instead of a hard decision label. An evidence generator is used to synthesize available evidences from BFCs into channel evidences and channel evidences are further temporal-fused. Finally, acoustic-seismic modality fusion using Dempster-Shafer method is performed. Our implementation gives significantly better performance than the implementation with majority-voting fusion method through leave-one-out experiments.",

        "abstract": "A fuzzy logic resource manager that enables a collection of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to automatically cooperate to make meteorological measurements will be discussed. Once in flight no human intervention is required. Planning and real-time control algorithms determine the optimal trajectory and points each UAV will sample, while taking into account the UAVs' risk, risk tolerance, reliability, mission priority, fuel limitations, mission cost, and related uncertainties. The control algorithm permits newly obtained information about weather and other events to be introduced to allow the UAVs to be more effective. The approach is illustrated by a discussion of the fuzzy decision tree for UAV path assignment and related simulation. The different fuzzy membership functions on the tree are described in mathematical detail. The different methods by which this tree is obtained are summarized including a method based on using a genetic program as a data mining function. A second fuzzy decision tree that allows the UAVs to automatically collaborate without human intervention is discussed. This tree permits three different types of collaborative behavior between the UAVs. Simulations illustrating how the tree allows the different types of collaboration to be automated are provided. Simulations also show the ability of the control algorithm to allow UAVs to effectively cooperate to increase the UAV team's likelihood of success.",
