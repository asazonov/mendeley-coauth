        "abstract": "Despite the many decades of use of most of the current trypanocides, we know little of their mode of action. This may in part be because most of these will act on multiple targets once inside the cell, and they derive their selective action on the parasite from selective accumulation by the pathogen. Loss of this capacity for drug uptake by the trypanosome would thus be a major cause for drug resistance. We here discuss the use of current drugs against human and veterinary African trypanosomiasis, the prevalence, causes and mechanisms of drug resistance and new developments in trypanosomiasis therapy such as the introduction of nifurtimox and DB289. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Current genetic and epigenetic theories of cancer-specific drug resistance do not adequately explain: (i) the karyotypic changes that coincide with resistance, (ii) the high rates at which cancer cells acquire and enhance resistance compared to the rates of conventional mutation, (iii) the wide ranges of resistance such as multidrug resistance, (iv) the frequent occurrence of intrinsic drug resistance. We have recently proposed, that specific karyotypic alterations are sufficient for drug resistance via new transcriptomes of cooperative genes, independent of gene mutation. This mechanism generates new phenotypes just like trisomy 21 generates Down syndrome. These karyotypic changes are generated by cancer-specific aneuploidy autocatalytically, because aneuploidy destabilizes the karyotype by misbalancing teams of proteins that synthesize, repair and segregate chromosomes. Evidence for this chromosomal mechanism is as follows: (i) resistance is proportional to the number of clonal chromosomal alterations compared to drug-sensitive precursors. (ii) The high rates at which cancer cells acquire drug resistance are comparable with the rates, as high as 10-2 per cell generation, at which their karyotypes change-dimming hopes for gene-specific therapies. (iii) Multidrug resistance probably reflects un-selected transcriptomes of karyotypes selected for resistance against specific drugs. (iv) Intrinsic drug resistance probably reflects unselected transcriptomes of karyotypes selected for oncogenicity. We also adduce evidence that resistance of chronic myeloid leukemia against the drug imatinib is chromosomal, although it is widely believed to be due to mutation of a kinase. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics and emerging targeted drugs is a devastating problem in the treatment of cancer patients. Multiple mechanisms contribute to drug resistance such as increased drug efflux, altered drug metabolism, secondary mutations in drug targets, and activation of downstream or parallel signal transduction pathways. The rapid kinetics, the reversibility of acquired drug resistance and the absence of genetic mutations suggest an epigenetic basis for drug insensitivity. Similar to the cellular variance seen in the human body, epigenetic mechanisms, through reversible histone modifications and DNA methylation patterns, generate a variety of transcriptional states resulting in a dynamic heterogeneous tumor cell population. Consequently, epigenomes favoring survival in the presence of a drug by aberrant transcription of drug transporters, DNA-repair enzymes and pro-apoptotic factors render cytotoxic and targeted drugs ineffective and allow selection of rare drug-resistant tumor cells. Recent advances in charting cancer genomes indeed strongly indicate a role for epigenetic regulators in driving cancer, which may result in the acquisition of additional (epi)genetic modifications leading to drug resistance. These observations have important clinical consequences as they provide an opportunity for \u201cepigenetic drugs\u201d to change reversible drug-resistance-associated epigenomes to prevent or reverse non-responsiveness to anti-cancer drugs.",

        "abstract": "a b s t r a c t Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly recognized as causative agents of opportunistic infections in humans. For most NTM infections the therapy of choice is drug treatment, but treatment regimens differ by species, in particular between slow (e.g. Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobac-terium kansasii) and rapid growers (e.g. Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium fortuitum). In general, drug treatment is long, costly, and often associated with drug-related toxicities; outcome of drug treat-ment is poor and is likely related to the high levels of natural antibiotic resistance in NTM. The role of drug susceptibility testing (DST) in the choice of agents for antimicrobial treatment of NTM disease, mainly that by slow growers, remains subject of debate. There are important discrepancies between drug sus-ceptibility measured in vitro and the activity of the drug observed in vivo. In part, these discrepancies derive from laboratory technical issues. There is still no consensus on a standardized method. With the increasing clinical importance of NTM disease, DST of NTM is again in the spotlight. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms of drug resistance in NTM, phenotypic methods for testing susceptibility in past and current use for DST of NTM, as well as molecular approaches to assess drug resistance.",

        "abstract": "Antibody-based therapy of various human malignancies has shown efficacy in the past 30 years and is now one of the most successful and leading strategies for targeted treatment of patients harboring hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) aim to take advantage of the affinity and specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to selectively deliver potent cytotoxic drugs to antigen-expressing tumor cells. Key parameters for ADC include choosing the optimal components of the ADC (the antibody, the linker and the cytotoxic drug) and selecting the suitable cell-surface target antigen. Building on the success of recent FDA approval of brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris\u00ae) and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla\u00ae), ADCs are currently a class of drugs with a robust pipeline with clinical applications that are rapidly expanding. The more ADCs are being evaluated in preclinical models and clinical trials, the clearer are becoming the parameters and the challenges required for their therapeutic success. This rapidly growing knowledge and clinical experience are revealing novel modalities and mechanisms of resistance to ADCs, hence offering plausible solutions to such challenges. Here, we review the key parameters for designing a powerful ADC, focusing on how ADCs are addressing the challenge of multiple drug resistance (MDR) and its rational overcoming. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",

Galectin-3, a 31 kDa gene product, is a multifunctional oncogenic protein which regulates cell growth, cell adhesion, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Recent studies have revealed that galectin-3 demonstrates anti-apoptotic effects which contribute to cell survival in several types of cancer cells. Intracellular galectin-3 in particular, which contains the NWGR anti-death motif of the Bcl-2 family, inhibits cell apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agent such as cisplatin and etoposide in some types of cancer cells. We have also reported that nuclear export of phosphorylated galectin-3 regulates its anti-apoptotic activity in response to chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we will describe the role of galectin-3 as an anti-apoptotic factor in response to chemotherapeutic drugs and will discuss recent data on its molecular mechanism that contribute to drug resistance. We suggest that targeting galectin-3 could improve the efficacy of anticancer drug chemotherapy in several types of cancer. ?? 2007.",

Embryonal carcinoma cells, on the contrary, are stem cells derived from teratomas that give rise to teratocarcinomas and differentiated tissues quite similar to ESCs. What is the difference? Compare the proteomes. Out of 1800 proteins identified and quantitated by Chaerkady et al., roughly 200 showed at least a two-fold difference in abundance by iTRAQ. Among the proteins expressed at high levels in ESCs were factors involved in pluripotency and development. A number of the highly expressed proteins in the ESCs have been found in other systems associated with malignancies.pp. 1359-1373 TALKING TO ITSELF: A CELL MANAGES ITS ADHESION OPTIONS: I once slept on a pillow that squeaked and crunched every time I moved my head. The old chicken feathers just did not want to quit. Perhaps they were plotting where to put the next lump. Cells have a complex system for deciding when to stay or go. Adhesive interactions between cells are critical to development, wound healing and inflammation, etc. They are modulated by membrane receptors that interact with intra- and extracellular ligands. Friedrichs et al. have developed quantitative means to look at how different adhesion receptors on the same cell interact. Using an atomic force microscope, the cantilever is coated with the primary adhesive ligand and the slide with a secondary ligand. A cell to be tested is allowed to attach to the cantilever, then put in contact with the test surface. Analysis of the force-distance profile reveals the presence or absence of communication between the two receptors.pp. 1455-1462 RETRO RECORD SPINNER REVEALS RESIDENCE WITH NURD: DJ-1 was one of those drifters, very often drifting onto the wrong side of the cancer line to be invited to reputable recreation more than once in any tissue.

Opsahl et al., using a full set of proteomic tools, found that DJ-1 was a bit of a firefighter (oxidative stress); part-time nurse (staving off death by p53 and daunorubicin); and NuRD master (involved in control of acetylation and deacetylation of proteins by changes in affinity of NuRD complex). The authors characterize DJ-1 as a two-edged sword, able to cut or protect friends and enemies. There are still more lessons to be learned from the number 1 DJ.pp. 1494-1504.",

        "abstract": "Anticancer drug resistance almost invariably emerges and poses major obstacles towards curative therapy of various human malignancies. In the current review we will distinguish between mechanisms of chemoresistance that are predominantly mediated by ATP-driven multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux transporters, typically of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, and those that are independent of such drug efflux pumps. In recent years, multiple nanoparticle (NP)-based therapeutic systems have been developed that were rationally designed to overcome drug resistance by neutralizing, evading or exploiting various drug efflux pumps and other resistance mechanisms. NPs are being exploited for selective drug delivery to tumor cells, to cancer stem/tumor initiating cells and/or to the supportive cancer cell microenvironment, i.e. stroma or tumor vasculature. Some of these NPs are currently undergoing preclinical in vivo studies as well as advanced stages of clinical evaluation with promising results. Nanovehicles harboring a payload of therapeutic drug combinations for the selective targeting and elimination of tumor cells as well as the simultaneous overcoming of mechanisms of drug resistance are a subject of intense research efforts, some of which are expected to enter clinical trials in the near future. In the present review we highlight novel approaches to selectively target cancer cells and overcome drug resistance phenomena, through the use of various nanometric drug delivery systems. In the near future, it is anticipated that innovative theragnostic nanovehicles will be developed which will harbor four major components: (1) a selective targeting moiety, (2) a diagnostic imaging aid for the localization of the malignant tumor and its micro- or macrometastases, (3) a cytotoxic, small molecule drug(s) or novel therapeutic biological(s), and (4) a chemosensitizing agent aimed at neutralizing a resistance mechanism, or exploiting a molecular \"Achilles hill\" of drug resistant cells. We propose to name these envisioned four element-containing nanovehicle platform, \"quadrugnostic\" nanomedicine. This targeted strategy holds promise in paving the way for the introduction of highly effective nanoscopic vehicles for cancer therapeutics while overcoming drug resistance. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Deregulations in mTOR signaling are frequently associated with tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis. This review highlights the role of the mTOR in anticancer drug resistance. We discuss the network of signaling pathways in which the mTOR kinase is involved, including the structure and activation of the mTOR complex and the pathways upstream and downstream of mTOR as well as other molecular interactions of mTOR. Major upstream signaling components in control of mTOR activity are PI3K/PTEN/AKT and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways. We discuss the central role of mTOR in mediating the translation of mRNAs of proteins related to cell cycle progression, those involved in cell survival such as c-myc, hypoxia inducible factor 1??

Design: Retrospective and prospective assessment of viruses obtained from people recently infected with HIV. Setting: Multiple centres (patients enrolled in the UK register of seroconverters) and a single large HIV clinic (active case ascertainment). Participants: 69 patients infected with HIV between June 1994 and August 2000. Main outcome measures: Prevalence of key mutations associated with drug resistance in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes of HIV-1, by year of infection. Results: Between June 1994 and August 2000, 10 (14%) of 69 newly infected patients had one or more key HIV-1 mutations associated with drug resistance. The risk of being infected with drug resistant virus increased over time (adjusted relative risk per year 1.74 (95% confidence interval 0.93 to 3.27), P=0.06). The estimated prevalence of drug resistance in those infected in 2000 was 27% (12% to 48%). Conclusions: Transmission of drug resistant HIV-1 in the United Kingdom seems to be increasing. New approaches to encourage safer sexual behaviour in all sectors of the population are urgently needed.  What is already known on this topic The emergence of HIV drug resistance in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy is common Transmission of virus variants resistant to anti-HIV drugs has been documentedWhat this paper adds The prevalence of transmitted HIV drug resistance in the United Kingdom is increasing, exceeding 20% in 2000 New approaches to encourage safer sexual behaviour are urgently needed",

        "abstract": "An appealing therapeutic target in AML is constitutively activated, mutant FLT3, which is expressed in a subpopulation of AML patients and is generally a poor prognostic indicator in patients under the age of 65. There are currently several FLT3 inhibitors that are undergoing clinical investigation. However, the discovery of drug-resistant leukemic blast cells in FLT3 inhibitor-treated AML patients has prompted the search for novel, structurally diverse FLT3 inhibitors that could be alternatively used to circumvent drug resistance. Here, we provide an overview of FLT3 inhibitors under preclinical and clinical investigation, and we discuss mechanisms whereby AML cells develop resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, and the ways in which combination therapy could potentially be utilized to override drug resistance. We discuss how the cross-talk between major downstream signaling pathways, such as PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR, RAS/Raf/MEK/ERK, and Jak/STAT, can be exploited for therapeutic purposes by targeting key signaling molecules with selective inhibitors, such as mTOR inhibitors, HSP90 inhibitors, or farnesyltransferase inhibitors, and identifying those agents with the ability to positively combine with inhibitors of FLT3, such as PKC412 and sunitinib. With the widespread onset of drug resistance associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, due to mechanisms involving development of point mutations or gene amplification of target proteins, the use of a multi-targeted therapeutic approach is of potential clinical benefit. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Although chemotherapy is an important therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment, it fails to eliminate all tumor cells due to intrinsic or acquired drug resistance, which is the most common cause of tumor recurrence. Emerging evidence suggests an intricate role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-type cells in anticancer drug resistance. Recent studies also demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the regulation of drug resistance. Here we will discuss current knowledge regarding CSCs, EMT and the role of regulation by miRNAs in the context of drug resistance, tumor recurrence and metastasis. A better understanding of the molecular intricacies of drug-resistant cells will help to design novel therapeutic strategies by selective targeting of CSCs and EMT-phenotypic cells through alterations in the expression of specific miRNAs towards eradicating tumor recurrence and metastasis.

        "abstract": "Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have received increasing attention in the field of cancer research. miRNAs play important roles in many normal biological processes; however, the aberrant miRNA expression and its correlation with the development and progression of cancers is an emerging field. Therefore, miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for diagnosis of cancer and prediction of prognosis. Importantly, some miRNAs could regulate the formation of cancer stem cells and the acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which are critically associated with drug resistance. Moreover, some miRNAs could target genes related to drug sensitivity, resulting in the altered sensitivity of cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs. Emerging evidences have also shown that knock-down or re-expression of specific miRNAs by synthetic anti-sense oligonucleotides or pre-miRNAs could induce drug sensitivity, leading to increased inhibition of cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. More importantly, recent studies have shown that natural agents including isoflavone, 3,3???-diindolylmethane, and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate altered miRNA expression profiles, leading to an increased sensitivity of cancer cells to conventional therapeutics. These emerging results suggest that specific targeting of miRNAs by different approaches could open new avenues for cancer treatment through overcoming drug resistance and thereby improve the outcome of cancer therapy. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, the majority of useful herpesvirus antivirals are nucleoside analogues that block herpesvirus DNA replication by targeting the DNA polymerase. The new helicase-primase inhibitors (HPI) target a different enzyme complex that is also essential for herpesvirus DNA replication. This review will place the HPI in the context of previous work on the nucleoside analogues. Several promising highly potent HPI will be described with a particular focus on the identification of drug-resistance mutations. Several HPI have good pharmacological profiles and are now at the outset of phase II clinical trials. Provided there are no safety issues to stop their progress, this new class of compound will be a major advance in the herpesvirus antiviral field. Furthermore, HPI are likely to have a major impact on the therapy and prevention of herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients alone or in combination with current nucleoside analogues. The possibility of acquired drug-resistance to HPI will then become an issue of great practical importance. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Resistance towards chemotherapy, either primary or acquired, represents a major obstacle in clinical oncology. Three basic categories underlie most cases of chemotherapy failure: Inadequate pharmacokinetic properties of the drug, tumor cell intrinsic factors such as the expression of drug efflux pumps and tumor cell extrinsic conditions present in the tumor microenvironment, characterized by such hostile conditions as hypoxia, acidosis, nutrient starvation and increased interstitial pressure. Tumor hypoxia has been known to negatively affect therapy outcome for decades. Hypoxia inhibits tumor cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest, ultimately conferring chemoresistance since anticancer drugs preferentially target rapidly proliferating cells. However, this knowledge has been largely neglected while screening for anti-proliferative substances in vitro, resulting in hypoxia-mediated failure of most newly identified substances in vivo. To achieve a tangible therapeutic benefit from this knowledge, the mechanisms that drive tumoral responses to hypoxia need to be identified and exploited for their validity as innovative therapy targets. The HIF family of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors represents the main mediator of the hypoxic response and is widely upregulated in human cancers. HIF-1\u03b1 and to a lesser extent HIF-2\u03b1, the oxygen-regulated HIF isoforms, have been associated with chemotherapy failure and interference with HIF function holds great promise to improve future anticancer therapy. In this review we summarize recent findings on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the role of the HIFs in drug resistance. Specifically, we will highlight the multifaceted interaction of HIF with apoptosis, senescence, autophagy, p53 and mitochondrial activity and outline how these are at the heart of HIF-mediated therapy failure.",

        "abstract": "An increased tendency of genomic alterations during the life cycle of cells leads to genomic instability, which is a major driving force for tumorigenesis. A considerable fraction of tumor cells are tetraploid or aneuploid, which renders them intrinsically susceptible to mitotic aberrations, and hence, are particularly sensitive to the induction of mitotic catastrophe. Resistance to cell death is also closely linked to genomic instability, as it enables malignant cells to expand even in a stressful environment. Currently it is known that cells can die via multiple mechanisms. Mitotic catastrophe represents a step preceding apoptosis or necrosis, depending on the expression and/or proper function of several proteins. Mitotic catastrophe was proposed to be an onco-suppressive mechanism and the evasion of mitotic catastrophe constitutes one of the gateways to cancer development. Thus, stimulation of mitotic catastrophe appears to be a promising strategy in cancer treatment. Indeed, several chemotherapeutic drugs are currently used at concentrations that induce apoptosis irrespective of the cell cycle phase, yet are very efficient at triggering mitotic catastrophe at lower doses, significantly limiting side effects. In the present review we summarize current data concerning the role of mitotic catastrophe in cancer drug resistance and discuss novel strategies to break this link.",

        "abstract": "In the past 65 years, antifolates targeting folate metabolism played a pivotal role in drug treatment of malignant, microbial, parasitic and chronic inflammatory diseases. Drug discovery of novel antifolates with improved properties and superior activities remains an attractive strategy both in academia and in the pharmaceutical industry. Among novel antifolates are pemetrexed which primarily targets thymidylate synthase as well as pralatrexate which blocks dihydrofolate reductase, and displays enhanced transport and cellular retention properties. The present review describes the evolution and pharmacological activity of antifolates and prospects for the development of the next generation antifolates. Pre-clinical and clinical studies identified a plethora of mechanisms of antifolate resistance that are a primary hindrance to curative cancer chemotherapy; these are frequently associated with qualitative and/or quantitative alterations in influx and/or efflux transporters of antifolates and in folate-dependent enzymes. Current advances including for example the deciphering of the dominant folate transporter proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT/SLC46A1) facilitated the synthesis of experimental antifolates aimed at selectively targeting solid tumor cells, which reside in an acidic microenvironment where PCFT supposedly functions optimally. Moreover, drugs that are structurally and mechanistically distinct from folates were conjugated to folic acid (e.g. Vintafolide/EC145, a folic acid desacetylvinblastine conjugate) to facilitate endocytosis via the folate receptor (FR) which is markedly overexpressed in various solid tumors. In an alternative approach, novel antifolates selectively targeting the FR but not other folate transporters are being developed (e.g. BGC 945). Hence, targeting mechanisms of antifolate-resistance could facilitate the development of rationally-based novel antifolates and strategies that overcome chemoresistance. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Although DNA has been recognized as the primary cellular target for these agents, there are unresolved issues concerning their effects and the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor efficacy. These cytotoxic agents interact with sub-cellular compartments other than the nucleus. Here, we review how such emerging phenomena contribute to the pharmacologic activity as well as to drug resistance phenotypes. DNA-unrelated effects of platinum drugs involve alterations at the plasma membrane and in endo-lysosomal compartments. A direct interaction with the mitochondria also appears to be implicated in drug-induced cell death. Moreover, the pioneering work of a few groups has shown that platinum drugs can act on the tumor microenvironment as well, and potentiate antitumor activity of the immune system. These poorly understood aspects of platinum drug activity sites may be harnessed to enhance their antitumor efficacy.

Thus inhibition of these survival pathways or efflux transporter expression may increase the efficacy of drug treatment. Here we review the role of the oncogenic PIM kinase family in regulating important proliferation and survival pathways in cancer cells and the involvement of PIM kinases in the expression and activity of MDR-1 and BCRP, two of the most important drug efflux transporters. PIM kinases are over expressed in various types of tumors and regulate the activation of signaling pathways that are important for tumor cell proliferation, survival and expression of drug efflux proteins. This makes PIM kinases attractive targets for the development of anti-cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. Focussing mainly on solid tumors, we provide an update on the literature describing the tumorigenic functions of PIM kinases. Also we provide an overview of the development of selective small molecule PIM kinase inhibitors. Because of the intense effort by pharmaceutical companies and academia it is reasonable to expect that PIM kinase inhibitors will enter the clinic in the foreseeable future. We therefore finish this review with a discussion on the most efficient application of these PIM inhibitors. This includes a consideration of which tumor type is the most appropriate target for treatment, how to select the patient population that stands to gain the most from treatment with PIM inhibitors, which molecular markers are suitable to follow the course of treatment and whether PIM kinase inhibitors should be used as monotherapy or in combination with other cytotoxic agents. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, asymptomatic carriage of Plasmodium falciparum sustains a long-lasting reservoir in the transmission-free dry season that seeds cyclical malaria outbreaks. Clinical trials targeting asymptomatic parasitaemia in the dry season failed to interrupt the malaria epidemics that follow annual rains. These asymptomatic infections tend to carry multiple-clones, capable of producing gametocytes and infecting Anopheles mosquitoes. Different clones within an infection fluctuate consistently, indicative of interaction between clones during the long course of asymptomatic carriage. However, the therapy-free environment that prevails in the dry season dis-advantages the drug resistant lineages and favors the wild-type parasites.

        "abstract": "The alarming rise of ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported in several clinical studies. Though the mutation of resistance genes and their role in drug resistance has been researched, the process by which the bacterium acquires high-level resistance is still not well understood. How does the genomic evolution of P. aeruginosa affect resistance development? Could the exposure of antibiotics to the bacteria enrich genomic variants that lead to the development of resistance, and if so, how are these variants distributed through the genome? To answer these questions, we performed 454 pyrosequencing and a whole genome analysis both before and after exposure to ciprofloxacin. The comparative sequence data revealed 93 unique resistance strain variation sites, which included a mutation in the DNA gyrase subunit A gene. We generated variation-distribution maps comparing the wild and resistant types, and isolated 19 candidates from three discrete resistance-associated high variability regions that had available transposon mutants, to perform a ciprofloxacin exposure assay. Of these region candidates with transposon disruptions, 79% (15/19) showed a reduction in the ability to gain high-level resistance, suggesting that genes within these high variability regions might enrich for certain functions associated with resistance development.",

Microarray studies screening for novel targets and chemical library screens for effective therapies have implicated signaling pathways, tumor-stromal interactions, miRNAs and possible even piwi-interacting (piRNAs) in the regulation of tumor initiating cell self-renewal. Potential targeting agents including the ??-catenin inhibitor sulforaphane, AKT inhibitor perfosine, hedgehog inhibitor cyclopamine, stromal interaction inhibitor repertaxin, multidrug resistance pump poison dofequifar fumarate, as well as targeted the dual epidermal growth factor family inhibitor lapatinib and many more have all been found to have toxicity against purportedly chemotherapy resistant subpopulations of cancer cells often referred to as tumor initiating cells (TICs). Work using clinical samples is emerging and supports the hypothesis that neoadjuvant chemotherapy can enrich for TICs in residual disease, but strong correlation with long-term outcome is yet to be established. This paper reviews current attempts to targeting TICs and discusses the competing hypotheses to explain breast cancer recurrence and therapy resistance. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Background Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses serious challenges for tuberculosis control in many settings, but trends of MDR-TB have been difficult to measure.\nMethods We analyzed surveillance and population-representative survey data collected worldwide by the World Health Organization between 1993 and 2012. We examined setting-specific patterns associated with linear trends in the estimated per capita rate of MDR-TB among new notified TB cases to generate hypotheses about factors associated with trends in the transmission of highly drug resistant tuberculosis.\nResults 59 countries and 39 sub-national settings had at least three years of data, but less than 10% of the population in the WHO-designated 27-high MDR-TB burden settings were in areas with sufficient data to track trends. Among settings in which the majority of MDR-TB was autochthonous, we found 10 settings with statistically significant linear trends in per capita rates of MDR-TB among new notified TB cases. Five of these settings had declining trends (Estonia, Latvia, Macao, Hong Kong, and Portugal) ranging from decreases of 3% to 14% annually, while five had increasing trends (four individual oblasts of the Russian Federation and Botswana) ranging from 14% to 20% annually. In unadjusted analysis, better surveillance indicators and higher GDP per capita were associated with declining MDR-TB, while a higher existing absolute burden of MDR-TB was associated with an increasing trend.\nConclusions Only a small fraction of countries in which the burden of MDR-TB is concentrated currently have sufficient surveillance data to estimate trends in drug-resistant TB. Where trend analysis was possible, smaller absolute burdens of MDR-TB and more robust surveillance systems were associated with declining per capita rates of MDR-TB among new notified cases. ?? 2014 The Authors.",

We examined data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sponsored Antiretroviral Drug Resistance Testing project, which performed genotypic testing on leftover HIV diagnostic serum specimens of confidentially and anonymously tested ARV-na\u00efve persons newly diagnosed with HIV in Colorado (n\u2009=\u2009365 at 11 sites) and King County, Washington (n\u2009=\u2009492 at 44 sites). The serologic testing algorithm for recent HIV seroconversion was used to classify people as likely to have been recently infected or not. Type of testing, anonymous or confidential, was not significantly associated with either timing of HIV testing by serologic testing algorithm for recent HIV seroconversion or resistance rates. Mutations conferring any level of ARV resistance were present in 17% of testers, and high-level resistance mutations were present in 10%. Anonymous testers were significantly more likely to have CD4+ counts >500 cells per mm(3) (45% vs. 28%; p\u2009=\u20090.018), indicative of an early infection. This study indicates that anonymous testers have demographic differences relative to confidential HIV testers but were not more likely to exhibit drug resistance. Findings related to when in the course of disease anonymous testers are tested are inconsistent, but anonymous testers had higher CD4 counts, which indicates early testing and is consistent with other studies.",

        "abstract": "The enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) is an important target for sulfa drugs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes. However, the understanding of DHPS function and the action of antifolates in eukaryotes has been limited due to technical difficulties and the complexity of DHPS being a part of a bifunctional or trifunctional protein that comprises the upstream enzymes involved in folic acid synthesis (FAS). Here, yeast strains have been constructed to study the effects of FOL1 expression on growth and sulfa drug resistance. A DHPS knockout yeast strain was complemented by yeast vectors expressing the FOL1 gene under the control of promoters of different strengths. An inverse relationship was observed between the growth rate of the strains and FOL1 expression levels. The use of stronger promoters to drive FOL1 expression led to increased sulfamethoxazole resistance when para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) levels were elevated. However, high FOL1 expression levels resulted in increased susceptibility to sulfamethoxazole in pABA free media. These data suggest that up-regulation of FOL1 expression can lead to sulfa drug resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",

Primary resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and streptomycin were determined by the BACTEC method. IS6110 and pTBN12 were used as molecular markers. The frequency of resistance to at least one drug was 32.95%, whereas 10.23% of the isolates were resistant to more than one drug. Single-drug resistance to isoniazid, streptomycin, ethambutol, and rifampicin was found in 9 (10.22%), 7 (7.95%), 4 (4.54%), and 0 (0.0%) strains, respectively. Two M. tuberculosis strains (2.26%) showed multiple drug resistance. The combination of two fingerprinting procedures on a total of 88 isolates identified 58 (65.9%) strains as unique and clustered 30 strains in 11 clusters (clustering = 34.1%). The clustering rate for resistant and sensitive isolates was 13.8% and 40.1%, respectively. In conclusion; drug susceptibility testing showed that the majority of the drug-resistant infections involved either isoniazid or streptomycin alone. In addition to the high tuberculosis incidence, elevated primary drug resistance and high clustering rate indicate problems in the present control programs. New control strategies supported by molecular typing might be more effective to reduce tuberculosis.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To examine recent trends in transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in the United Kingdom. Methods: Analysis of results of genotypic resistance tests reported to the UK HIV Drug Resistance Database, which includes virtually all tests conducted as part of routine clinical care nationally. Resistance was based on major mutations as defined in the 2005 International AIDS Society-USA guidelines. Analysis was restricted to persons who were antiretroviral treatment-naive at the time of sampling, and a test defined as relating to recent infection if the patient was co-enrolled in the UK Register of HIV Seroconverters and the sample taken within 18 months of a negative HIV antibody test. Results: A total of 4454 samples from treatment-naive patients between 1996 and 2004 were analysed, including 316 from patients recently infected at the time of the resistance test. After an initial rise, TDR declined from a peak of around 14% in 2001\u20132002 to around 8% by the end of 2004 (Ptrend<0.001), largely driven by a decrease in nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutations. Non-NRTI resistance has become increasingly important in relative terms and is now as common as NRTI resistance. Among patients with recent infection, an almost identical pattern was observed but shifted approximately 2 years earlier. A change in the distribution of viral subtypes did not explain these temporal trends. Conclusions: This is the first clear evidence of a decrease in TDR at national level. The wider use of regimens that suppress viral concentration to below infectious levels is one of several plausible explanations for this finding.",

Bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in Bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). The most common species was Escherichia coli (n=98), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (n=54), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), Proteus mirabilis (n=32), Staphylococcus aureus (n=27), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and Enterobacter cloacae (n=21). S. aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for Enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blaCTX-M-1 group beta-lactamases. The CTX-M gene in E. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blaCTX-M-15, and phylogroup B2 isolates with blaCTX-M-15 were classified into ST131 with O25b allele, harboring aac(6')-Ib-cr and various virulence factors. Carbapenemase genes blaNDM-1 and blaNDM-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup A E. coli. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates had type IV or V SCCmec, including isolates of ST361 (CC672), which is related to an emerging ST672 clone in the Indian subcontinent.

The majority of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline (73.8%), mainly conferred by tet(A). Resistances to streptomycin (aadA1-like, aadA2, and strAB), sulfonamides (sul1, sul2, and sul3), trimethoprim (dfrA1-like and dfrA12), ampicillin (blaTEM-1-like), and chloramphenicol (cmlA1-like) were also detected, with frequencies ranging from 12% to 20.2%.

Both Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates (Kpn922 and Kpn9599) were resistant to meropenem and imipenem and were subjected to additional antibiotic susceptibility testing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analyses were used to characterize bacterial carbapenemase resistance genes, extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases, plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes, quinolone resistance, and 16s RNA methylase. Genetic relatedness was determined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Plasmids were analyzed by S1-PFGE and Southern blot. Results: PCR analyses revealed that the Kpn922 isolate carried blaNDM-1, blaIMP-4, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-1 genes, while Kpn9599 carried blaNDM-1, blaIMP-4, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-12 genes. MLST determined that the two isolates were ST1043 and ST571 sequence types. Southern blot analyses revealed that metallo-\u03b2-lactamase genes were plasmid borne in both isolates. Plasmids \u223c300\u2009kb simultaneously carried blaNDM-1 and blaIMP-4. Conclusions: Coexistence of blaNDM-1 and blaIMP-4 in these clinical isolates may herald the emergence of a new pattern of drug resistance.

For many of these drugs, however, resistant lines have been generated in the laboratory and these have proven very useful for elucidating a given drug's target. These targets range from metabolic pathways in the cytosol to organellar functions encoded in the mitochondrion or plastid.

Subtyping results were combined with data from the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort Study and the UK HIV and AIDS Reporting System. Analyses adjusted for the number of national HIV-1 diagnoses made each year within demographic subgroups. Viral subtypes were described overall, over time and by demographic subgroup.\\n\\nRESULTS:: Subtype B diagnoses (39.9%) have remained stable since 2005, whereas subtype C diagnoses (34.3%) were found to decline in prevalence from 2004. Across most demographic subgroups, the prevalence of non-B non-C subtypes has increased over time, in particular novel recombinant forms (9.9%), subtype G (2.7%), and CRF01 AE (2.0%).\\n\\nCONCLUSION:: HIV-1 subtypes are increasingly represented across all demographic subgroups and this could be evidence of sexual mixing. Between 2002 and 2010, the prevalence of novel recombinant forms has increased in all demographic subgroups. This increasing genetic diversity and the effect of subtype on disease progression may impact future HIV-1 treatment and prevention.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivitives 3.0 License, where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

        "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates are increasing worldwide and greatly limit therapeutic options, particularly when considering extensively drug-resistant (XDR) or pandrug-resistant isolates. The resistance profile of P. aeruginosa isolates from a Portuguese central hospital was surveyed during 10 years (n=3,778). About 39.9% were classified as MDR and 2.9% as XDR. Statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney test and regression modeling) revealed a decrease in total MDR rates over time but an increase in XDR rates. This suggests a tendency for higher proportions of XDR isolates in the future, which is of great concern. Isolates of nosocomial origin presented similar results to total population but, when analyzing them according to the different wards of origin, it was still observed a trend of increase in MDR rates in some wards, particularly pneumology, neurology, and neurosurgery. Similar analysis considering the nosocomial specimen source revealed a negative trend of evolution in MDR rates of respiratory origin and a positive trend over time in XDR rates of isolates collected from urine. Regarding the association of antibiotic resistance to MDR and XDR profiles, it was observed a negative relation over time between imipenem resistance and MDR and gentamicin resistance and XDR, suggesting that resistance to these antibiotics may predict the absence of MDR or XDR in P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Similar studies in other European hospitals should be performed to give further information to physicians, important for their empirical antibiotherapy regimens.",

        "abstract": "Revealing functional reorganization or module rewiring between modules at network levels during drug treatment is important to systematically understand therapies and drug responses. The present article proposed a novel model of module network rewiring to characterize functional reorganization of a complex biological system, and described a new framework named as module network rewiring-analysis (MNR) for systematically studying dynamical drug sensitivity and resistance during drug treatment. MNR was used to investigate functional reorganization or rewiring on the module network, rather than molecular network or individual molecules. Our experiments on expression data of patients with Hepatitis C virus infection receiving Interferon therapy demonstrated that consistent module genes derived by MNR could be directly used to reveal new genotypes relevant to drug sensitivity, unlike the other differential analyses of gene expressions. Our results showed that functional connections and reconnections among consistent modules bridged by biological paths were necessary for achieving effective responses of a drug. The hierarchical structures of the temporal module network can be considered as spatio-temporal biomarkers to monitor the efficacy, efficiency, toxicity, and resistance of the therapy. Our study indicates that MNR is a useful tool to identify module biomarkers and further predict dynamical drug sensitivity and resistance, characterize complex dynamic processes for therapy response, and provide biologically systematic clues for pharmacogenomic applications.",

Typhimurium) strains (including the emerging monophasic variant [4,5,12:i:- ]) was investigated. All strains shared class 1 integrons (with seven types of variable regions) and belonged to different lineages (L1-L6) according to their phage types, DNA polymorphisms by XbaI-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), integrons, and/or resistance patterns. The strains were screened for the presence and localization (chromosomal or plasmid) of 32 DNA sequences representing integron-, Tn21-like transposon-, resistance-, and virulence-plasmid genes. Strains belonging to lineage L1 (definitive phage type DT104) carried the 90-kb Salmonella virulence plasmid together with the complete or partial chromosomally located Salmonella Genomic Island 1 (SGI1). All strains belonging to the other five lineages carried their resistance determinants on various resistance plasmids. Two of these strains showed complex plasmid profiles, which included a 95 kb virulence plasmid together with two or four resistance plasmids. Two strains carried a resistance plasmid that lacked the virulence-plasmid-encoding sequences. The remaining two strains carried two different hybrid virulence-resistance plasmids. Twenty-three of the DNA sequences could be assigned to distinct XbaI genomic restriction patterns (PFGE profiles). In this way, the influence of the resistance and virulence plasmids on the PFGE profiles was determined, and several groups of resistance genes could be identified. The data obtained represent a useful epidemiological tool for tracing the emergence and distribution of multiresistant S. Typhimurium worldwide.",

        "abstract": "The increased incidence of drug-resistant fungal infections, a process in which active efflux plays an important role, calls for the development of new treatments. Candida albicans and Candida glabrata are the most frequent human fungal pathogens. The latter, in spite of its increased azole tolerance, is rarely used in medicinal plant screening. Several extracts inhibiting the growth of this pathogenic yeast are identified here. The ethyl acetate extract of the herb Dalea formosa of the American Southwest, not previously known to possess antifungal activity, proved most active against azole-sensitive and azole-resistant isolates. The model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, related to C. glabrata, was used to evaluate the influence of multidrug efflux on the antifungal activity of identified extracts and selected fractions from further purification steps, together with their ability to modulate ketoconazole resistance. The differential involvement of the major pleiotropic drug transporters of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily Pdr5p, Snq2p, and Yor1p as well as their transcriptional activators Pdr1p and Pdr3p in the detoxification of the antifungal constituents of several important medicinal plants is demonstrated. These include Artemisia annua and its widely used antimalarial component artemisinin. This approach revealed the concomitant presence of multidrug efflux pump substrates and modulators in the extract of A. annua and also allowed the identification of an extract not affected by the major pleiotropic drug-resistance genes.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial chromosomal mutations that confer antibiotic resistance often have deleterious effects that impose costs on reproductive fitness. This observation has led to the generalization that in the absence of the selection pressure exerted through treatment, the frequency of resistance will decrease. This model implies that the prudent use of antibiotics will eventually result in a decline in the prevalence of drug resistance. Recent work, however, suggests that some resistance-conferring mutations may not significantly impair fitness and that others may be accompanied by compensatory mutations that restore the organisms' reproductive potential. Thus drug resistance, once introduced, may persist unless specific measures are implemented to target prevalent drug-resistant cases. Here we present ecological evidence to support the hypothesis that mutations at the 315 position of katG confer isoniazid resistance for Mycobacterium tuberculosis without diminishing virulence or transmissibility.",

Microarray analysis for the presence of antimicrobial resistance and plasmid genes identified aminoglycoside [aac(6), aac(3), aadA, aph, strA, and strB], \u03b2-lactam (blaAmpC, blaTEM, blaCMY, and blaPSE-1), chloramphenicol (cat, flo, and cmlA), sulfamethoxazole (sulI and sulII), tetracycline [tet(A), tet(C), tet(D), and tetR], and trimethoprim (dfrA) resistance genes. IncA/C plasmid core genes were detected in 27 isolates, while IncHI1 plasmid genes were detected in one isolate, indicating the likely presence of these plasmids. PCR assays for 18 plasmid replicon types often associated with MDR in Enterobacteriaceae also detected one or more replicon types in all 32 isolates. Class I integrons were investigated by PCR amplification of the integrase I gene, intI1, and the cassette region flanked by conserved sequences. Twenty-five isolates were positive for the intI1 gene, and class I integrons ranging in size from ~1,000 to 3,300 bp were identified in 19 of them. The presence of class I integrons, IncA/C plasmid genes, and MDR-associated plasmid replicons in the isolates indicates the importance of these genetic elements in the accumulation and potential spread of antimicrobial resistance genes in the microbial community associated with poultry.\\n",

In contrast, multiple resistance (to four or more antimicrobial drugs) has declined from 18% to 15%. The most significant increase in resistance has been to nalidixic acid (14% to 20%), particularly in Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (10% to 26%), the most common serovar. For England and Wales this increase has for the most part been attributed to infections linked to contaminated eggs originating outside the United Kingdom. For Salmonella Typhimurium, the second most prevalent serovar, there has been an overall decline in the occurrence of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines, attributed to a decline in the occurrence of multiresistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104. For Salmonella Virchow, a serotype with a predilection for invasive disease, there has been a substantive increase in resistance to most antimicrobials, attributed to the spread of drug-resistant strains associated with poultry. Because of the widespread importation of foods, it is important that controls to reduce the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains of Salmonella are internationally implemented.",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) ranks fourth among cancer related deaths. The disappointing 5-year survival rate of below 5% stems from drug resistance to all known therapies, as well as from disease presentation at a late stage when PDA is already metastatic. Gemcitabine has been the cornerstone of PDA treatment in all stages of the disease for the last two decades, but gemcitabine resistance develops within weeks of chemotherapy initiation. From a mechanistic perspective, gemcitabine resistance may result from alterations in drug metabolism until the point that the cytidine analog is incorporated into the DNA, or from mitigation of gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. Both of these drug resistance modalities can be either intrinsic to the cancer cell, or influenced by the cancer microenvironment. Mechanisms of intrinsic gemcitabine resistance are difficult to tackle, as many of the genes that drive the carcinogenic process itself also interfere with gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. In this regard, recent understanding of the involvement of microRNAs in gemcitabine resistance may offer new opportunities to overcome intrinsic gemcitabine resistance. The characteristically fibrotic and immune infiltrated stroma of PDA that accompanies tumor inception and expansion is a lush ground for treatments aimed at targeting tumor microenvironment-mediated drug resistance. In the last couple of years, drugs interfering with tumor microenvironment have matured to clinical trials. Although drugs inducing 'stromal depletion' have yet failed to improve survival, they have greatly increased our understanding of tumor microenvironment-mediated drug resistance. In this review we summarize the current knowledge on intrinsic and environment-mediated gemcitabine resistance, and discuss the impact of these pathways on patient screening, and on future treatments aimed to potentiate gemcitabine activity.",

Multidrug resistance is not only observed with clinically established chemotherapeutics, but also with novel targeted therapies. Although a range of drug resistance mechanisms have been identified up till now, for most drugs it is still controversial which mechanisms are responsible for resistance and therapy failure in patients. Hence, the development of strategies to circumvent drug resistance is often unfocused. Since several years genetically engineered mouse models have been generated which develop tumors that closely resemble cancer in humans. We argue that such models can be used to investigate relevant in vivo mechanisms of resistance.

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that cancer can be envisioned as a \"signaling disease\", in which alterations in the cellular genome affect the expression and/or function of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. This ultimately disrupts the physiologic transmission of biochemical signals that normally regulate cell growth, differentiation and programmed cell death (apoptosis). From a clinical standpoint, signal transduction inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for human malignancies has recently achieved remarkable success. However, as additional drugs move forward into the clinical arena, intrinsic and acquired resistance to \"targeted\" agents becomes an issue for their clinical utility. One way to overcome resistance to targeted agents is to identify genetic and epigenetic aberrations underlying sensitivity/resistance, thus enabling the selection of patients that will most likely benefit from a specific therapy. Since resistance often ensues as a result of the concomitant activation of multiple, often overlapping, signaling pathways, another possibility is to interfere with multiple, cross-talking pathways involved in growth and survival control in a rational, mechanism-based, fashion. These concepts may be usefully applied, among others, to agents that target two major signal transduction pathways: the one initiated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and the one converging on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to EGFR inhibitors, as well as the rationale for combining them with other targeted agents, in an attempt to overcome resistance. In the second part of the paper, we review MAPK-targeted agents, focusing on their therapeutic potential in haematologic malignancies, and examine the prospects for combinations of MAPK inhibitors with cytotoxic agents or other signal transduction-targeted agents to obtain synergistic anti-tumour effects. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, cisplatin resistance is a major impediment in cancer therapy, and deciphering the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance is crucial for the development of novel therapies with enhanced efficacy. The Rho subfamily of small GTPases plays a significant role in cancer progression, and a growing body of evidence points toward the involvement of these proteins in anticancer drug resistance, including cisplatin resistance. The cycling between active and inactive states, governed by the balance between their GEFs, GAPs and GDIs, RhoGTPases, acts as molecular switches with a pivotal role in actin cytoskeleton organization. The Rho subfamily of proteins is involved in many key cellular processes including adhesion, vesicular trafficking, proliferation, survival, cell morphology and cell-matrix interactions. Although RhoA, RhoB and RhoC are highly homologous and share some upstream regulators and downstream effectors, they each have different roles in cancer progression and chemoresistance.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial drug resistance is a global issue that affects health, economic, and social development. The problem has been attributed to misuse of antimicrobial agents.\\n\\nPURPOSE: To identify the agents of bacterial infection in Ghana, determine their antibiogram, and the possibility of setting up a surveillance program.\\n\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective quantitative study set in various hospitals including two teaching hospitals, seven regional hospitals, and two district hospitals in Ghana. A total of 5099 bacterial isolates from various clinical specimens were collected over a period of 1 year, including data related to the patients. Susceptibility of the isolates was determined by the Kirby-Bauer method. In addition, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of multidrug-resistant isolates of epidemiological significance was also determined using the E-test.\\n\\nRESULTS: A wide range of bacterial isolates were identified in both teaching and regional hospitals. High percentage of resistance was observed for tetracycline (82%), cotrimoxazole (73%), ampicillin (76%), and chloramphenicol (75%). Multidrug resistance was observed to a combination of ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole. On the other hand, a lower percentage of resistance was observed for ceftriaxone (6.3%), ciprofloxacin (11%), and amikacin (9.9%).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Generally, the prevalence of multidrug resistance was widespread among the various isolates. Some multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, and non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) had high MIC to cefuroxime (>256), gentamicin (>256), and ciprofloxacin (>32).",

        "abstract": "Resistance to quinoline antimalarials, especially to chloroquine and mefloquine has had a major impact on the treatment of malaria worldwide. In the period since 2000, significant progress has been made in understanding the origins of chloroquine resistance and to a lesser extent mefloquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. Chloroquine resistance correlates directly with mutations in the pfcrt gene of the parasite, while changes in another gene, pfmdr1, may also be related to chloroquine resistance in some strains. Mutations in pfcrt do not appear to correlate with mefloquine resistance, but some studies have implicated pfmdr1 in mefloquine resistance. Its involvement however, has not been definitively demonstrated. The protein products of these genes, PfCRT and Pgh-1 are both located in the food vacuole membrane of the parasite. Current evidence suggests that PfCRT is probably a transporter protein. Chloroquine appears to exit the food vacuole via this transporter in resistant PfCRT mutants. Pgh-1 on the other hand, resembles mammalian multi-drug resistance proteins and appears to be involved in expelling hydrophobic drugs from the food vacuole. Resistance reversing agents are believed to act by inhibiting these proteins. The currently known chloroquine- and mefloquine-resistance reversing agents are discussed in this review. This includes a discussion of structure-activity relationships in these compounds and hypotheses on their possible mechanisms of action. The status of current clinical applications is also briefly discussed. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

When used as a single agent, resistance to atovaquone arose rapidly in falciparum malaria, requiring the development of a new antimalarial drug combination of atovaquone and proguanil. Recent laboratory investigations have provided insights into the mode of atovaquone action, and identified the molecular basis for the resistance development. Mutations within a catalytic domain of the cytochrome bc(1)complex present within the parasite mitochondrial inner membrane were shown to be responsible for atovaquone resistance.

Although they exert broad effects on cancer cells, their ability to (1) stabilize pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family, (2) inhibit the two major pathways leading to NF??B activation, and (3) cause the build-up of misfolded proteins appear to be particularly important. In addition, PIs may disrupt tumor-stromal interactions that drive NF??B activation and angiogenesis and in such a way sensitize cancer cells to other agents. Still, drug resistance ultimately emerges in all tumors that initially respond to PIs.

        "abstract": "Multiple molecular, cellular, micro-environmental and systemic causes of anticancer drug resistance have been identified during the last 25 years. At the same time, genome-wide analysis of human tumor tissues has made it possible in principle to assess the expression of critical genes or mutations that determine the response of an individual patient's tumor to drug treatment. Why then do we, with a few exceptions, such as mutation analysis of the EGFR to guide the use of EGFR inhibitors, have no predictive tests to assess a patient's drug sensitivity profile. The problem urges the more with the expanding choice of drugs, which may be beneficial for a fraction of patients only. In this review we discuss recent studies and insights on mechanisms of anticancer drug resistance and try to answer the question: do we understand why a patient responds or fails to respond to therapy? We focus on doxorubicin as example of a classical cytotoxic, DNA damaging agent and on sunitinib, as example of the new generation of (receptor) tyrosine kinase-targeted agents. For both drugs, classical tumor cell autonomous resistance mechanisms, such as drug efflux transporters and mutations in the tumor cell's survival signaling pathways, as well as micro-environment-related resistance mechanisms, such as changes in tumor stromal cell composition, matrix proteins, vascularity, oxygenation and energy metabolism may play a role. Novel agents that target specific mutations in the tumor cell's damage repair (e.g. PARP inhibitors) or that target tumor survival pathways, such as Akt inhibitors, glycolysis inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors, are of high interest. In order to increase the therapeutic index of treatments, fine-tuned synergistic combinations of new and/or classical cytotoxic agents will be designed. More quantitative assessment of potential resistance mechanisms in real tumors and in real time, such as by kinase profiling methodology, will be developed to allow more precise prediction of the optimal drug combination to treat each patient.",

        "abstract": "Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine, MIL), registered as Impavido??, has become the first oral drug for the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmanasis. MIL is a simple molecule, very stable, relatively safe and highly efficient in clinical trials. However, MIL requires a long treatment course (28 days) and has a long half-life (around 150 h), which might accelerate the emergence of drug resistance in case of inadequate use. The mechanisms of MIL resistance have been studied in vitro with experimental resistant lines. Resistance was shown to develop quickly in Leishmania promastigotes. Interestingly, a decreased MIL accumulation has always accounted for the resistance phenotype. The lower MIL accumulation can be achieved by two independent mechanisms: (i) an increase in drug efflux, mediated by the overexpression of the ABC transporter P-glycoprotein, and (ii) a decrease in drug uptake, which is easily achieved by the inactivation of any one of the two proteins known to be responsible for the MIL uptake, the MIL transporter LdMT and its beta subunit LdRos3. Policies concerning a proper use of this drug should be followed and supervised by health authorities of endemic areas to minimalize the risk for the appearance of drug failures and to ensure a long life span for this effective oral drug. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Comprehensive analysis of cancer genomes has provided important insights in the critical alterations that confer proliferation and survival advantage to the tumor, so-called driver mutations. Tumors harboring these genetic changes frequently exhibit striking sensitivities to inhibition of these oncogenic driver pathways, a principle referred to as oncogene addiction. Substantial progress has been made in the development of drugs that specifically target components of the pathways that are associated with these driver mutations. This has enabled the first steps in a shift from the use of cytotoxic drugs to highly selective targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. Unfortunately, despite the expanding development of targeted anti-cancer strategies, treatment failure due to primary or acquired resistance is still an almost inevitable outcome in most advanced human cancers. Understanding drug resistance mechanisms will help design more efficient combination treatment strategies that help block resistance mechanisms before they become clinically manifest. In this review, we discuss how RNA interference functional genetic screens can be used to identify clinically relevant mechanisms of drug resistance and how this technology can be used to develop effective combination therapies. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Among them, most of the isolates were multiresistant, and 80% of the strains showed phenotypic resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Using PCR analysis, among the several types of \u03b2-lactamases, TEM was the most prevalent, and OXA was the second most prevalent.

However, key determinants including the development of drug resistance and dose-limiting toxicity call for the identification of alternative components of the UPS for novel drug targeting. Recently the deubiquitinases (DUBs), a diverse family of enzymes that catalyze ubiquitin removal, have attracted significant interest as targets for the development of next generation UPS inhibitors. In particular, pharmacological inhibition of the proteasomal cysteine DUBs (i.e., USP14 and UCHL5) has been shown to be particularly cytotoxic to cancer cells and inhibit tumour growth in several in vivo models.

These diverse functions reflect the ability of SIRTs to target and modify a broad spectrum of protein substrates, including cytoskeletal proteins, signalling components, transcription factors, and histones. SIRTs are also implicated in tumorigenesis as well as in the response of the tumour to chemotherapy. In particular, SIRT1 has been found to be overexpressed in many drug resistant cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that the role of SIRTs in drug resistance may be foremost related to their ability to target and modulate the activity of tumour suppressors, including p53, p73, E2F1, and FOXO3a. In other words, while SIRT-dependent deacetylation of transcription factors is normally used to fine-tune gene expression, this function is hijacked by cancer cells to evade proliferative arrest and cell death in response to chemotherapy. Consequently, interventions predicated on disrupting the interactions between tumour suppressors and SIRTs may be effective in circumventing or reversing drug resistance in cancer. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To that end, good antimalarial chemotherapies have been difficult to find in the global market and those that seem to be most effective are rapidly becoming ineffective due to the emergence and spread of drug resistance. Artemisinin, a very effective yet expensive antimalarial, has quickly become the recommended drug of choice when all other possibilities fail. However, for all its promise as the next great antimalarial, the outlook is bleak. Resistance is developing to artemisinin while another effective antimalarial is not in sight. Malaria endemic areas which are mostly in developing countries must deal with the multifaceted process of changing and implementing new national malaria treatment guidelines. This requires complex interactions between several sectors of the affected society which in some cases take place within the context of political instability. Moreover, the cost associated with preventing and containing the spread of antimalarial resistance is detrimental to economic progress.

Experimental evolution offers a compelling addition to such studies because the combination of replicated experiments under tightly controlled conditions with genomics of intermediate time points allows real-time reconstruction of evolutionary trajectories. Recent studies thus established causal links between antibiotic deployment therapies and the course and timing of mutations, the cost of resistance and the likelihood of compensating mutations. They particularly underscored the importance of long-term effects. Similar investigations incorporating horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are wanting, likely because of difficulties associated with its integration into experiments. In this review, we describe current advances in experimental evolution of antibiotic resistance and reflect on ways to incorporate horizontal gene transfer into the approach. We contend it provides a powerful tool for systematic and highly controlled dissection of evolutionary paths to antibiotic resistance that needs to be taken into account for the development of sustainable anti-bacterial treatment strategies. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Invasive fungal infections cause morbidity and mortality in severely ill patients, and limited drug classes restrict treatment choices. The echinocandin drugs are the first new class of antifungal compounds that target the fungal cell wall by blocking ??-1,3-d-glucan synthase. Elevated MIC values with occasional treatment failure have been reported for strains of Candida. Yet, an uncertain correlation exists between clinical failure and elevated MIC values for the echinocandin drugs. Fungi display several adaptive physiological mechanisms that result in elevated MIC values. However, resistance to echinocandin drugs among clinical isolates is associated with amino acid substitutions in two \"hot-spot\" regions of Fks1, the major subunit of glucan synthase. The mutations, yielding highly elevated MIC values, are genetically dominant and confer cross-resistance to all echinocandin drugs. Prominent Fks1 mutations decrease the sensitivity of glucan synthase for drug by 1000-fold or more, and strains harboring such mutations may require a concomitant increase in drug to reduce fungal organ burdens in animal infection models. The Fks1-mediated resistance mechanism is conserved in a wide variety of Candida spp. and can account for intrinsic reduced susceptibility of certain species. Fks1 mutations confer resistance in both yeasts and moulds suggesting that this mechanism is pervasive in the fungal kingdom. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Our current understanding of the mechanisms of action of antitumor agents and the precise mechanisms underlying drug resistance is that these two processes are directly linked. Moreover, it is often possible to delineate chemoresistance mechanisms based on the specific mechanism of action of a given anticancer drug. A more holistic approach to the chemoresistance problem suggests that entire metabolic pathways, rather than single enzyme targets may better explain and educate us about the complexity of the cellular responses upon cytotoxic drug administration. Drugs, which target thymidylate synthase and folate-dependent enzymes, represent an important therapeutic arm in the treatment of various human malignancies. However, prolonged patient treatment often provokes drug resistance phenomena that render the chemotherapeutic treatment highly ineffective. Hence, strategies to overcome drug resistance are primarily designed to achieve either enhanced intracellular drug accumulation, to avoid the upregulation of folate-dependent enzymes, and to circumvent the impairment of DNA repair enzymes which are also responsible for cross-resistance to various anticancer drugs. The current clinical practice based on drug combination therapeutic regimens represents the most effective approach to counteract drug resistance. In the current paper, we review the molecular aspects of the activity of TS-targeting drugs and describe how such mechanisms are related to the emergence of clinical drug resistance. We also discuss the current possibilities to overcome drug resistance by using a molecular mechanistic approach based on medicinal chemistry methods focusing on rational structural modifications of novel antitumor agents. This paper also focuses on the importance of the modulation of metabolic pathways upon drug administration, their analysis and the assessment of their putative roles in the networks involved using a meta-analysis approach. The present review describes the main pathways that are modulated by TS-targeting anticancer drugs starting from the description of the normal functioning of the folate metabolic pathway, through the protein modulation occurring upon drug delivery to cultured tumor cells as well as cancer patients, finally describing how the pathways are modulated by drug resistance development. The data collected are then analyzed using network/netwire connecting methods in order to provide a wider view of the pathways involved and of the importance of such information in identifying additional proteins that could serve as novel druggable targets for efficacious cancer therapy.",

However, acquired and/or intrinsic resistance still represent a major limitation. Lately, in particular mechanisms leading to impaired uptake and/or decreased cellular accumulation of platinum compounds have attracted attention. In this review, we focus on the role of active platinum uptake and efflux systems as determinants of platinum sensitivity and -resistance and their contribution to platinum pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). First, the three mostly used platinum-based anticancer agents as well as the most promising novel platinum compounds in development are put into clinical perspective. Next, we describe the presently known potential platinum transporters--with special emphasis on organic cation transporters (OCTs)--and discuss their role on clinical outcome (i.e. efficacy and adverse events) of platinum-based chemotherapy. In addition, transporter-mediated tumour resistance, the impact of potential platinum transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions, and the role of drug transporters in the renal elimination of platinum compounds are discussed",

        "abstract": "Innate or acquired resistance to cancer therapeutics remains an important area of biomedical investigation that has clear ramifications for improving cancer specific death rates. Importantly, clues to key resistance mechanisms may lie in the well-orchestrated and highly conserved cellular and systemic responses to injury and stress. Many anti-neoplastic therapies typically rely on DNA damage, which engages potent DNA damage response signaling pathways that culminate in apoptosis or growth arrest at checkpoints to allow for damage repair. However, an alternative cellular response, senescence, can also be initiated when challenged with these internal/external pressures and in ideal situations acts as a self-protecting mechanism. Senescence-induction therapies are an attractive concept in that they represent a normal, highly conserved and commonly invoked tumor-suppressing response to overwhelming genotoxic stress or oncogene activation. Yet, such approaches should ensure that senescence by-pass or senescence re-emergence does not occur, as emergent cells appear to have highly drug resistant phenotypes. Further, cell non-autonomous senescence responses may contribute to therapy-resistance in certain circumstances. Here we provide an overview of mechanisms by which cellular senescence plausibly contributes to therapy resistance and concepts by which senescence responses can be influenced to improve cancer treatment outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic regimens are the most frequently used (neo)adjuvant treatments for the majority of solid tumors. While platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens have proven effective against highly proliferative malignant tumors, significant relapse and progression rates as well as decreased overall survival are still observed. Currently, it is known that sub-populations of chemoresistant cells share biological properties with cancer stem cells (CSC), which are believed to be responsible for tumor relapse, invasion and ultimately disease dissemination through acquisition of mesenchymal cell traits. In spite of concentrated efforts devoted to decipher the mechanisms underlying CSC chemoresistance and to design targeted therapeutics to these cells, proteomics has failed to unveil molecular signatures capable of distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant stem cells. This has hampered substantial developments in this complex field. Envisaging a novel rationale for an effective therapy, the current review summarizes the main cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance and the impact of chemotherapy challenge in CSC selection and clinical outcome. It further emphasizes the growing amount of data supporting a role for protein glycosylation in drug resistance. The dynamic and context-dependent nature of protein glycosylation is also comprehensively discussed, hence highlighting its potentially important role as a biomarker of CSC. As the paradigm of cancer therapeutics shifts towards precision medicine and patient-tailored therapeutics, we bring into focus the need to introduce glycomics and glycoproteomics in holistic pan-omics models, in order to integrate diverse, multimodal and clinically relevant information towards more effective cancer therapeutics.",

In this study, 45 P. aeruginosa clinical strains, with an MDR phenotype, have been isolated in a hospital of Northern Italy and characterized to identify the mechanisms responsible for their fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance. These isolates were analyzed for clonal similarity, mutations in genes encoding the FQ targets, overexpression of specific Resistance Nodulation-cell Division efflux pumps, and search for mutations in their regulatory genes. The achieved results suggested that the mutations in genes encoding ciprofloxacin targets represented the main mechanism of FQ resistance of these strains; 97.8% of these isolates showed mutations in gyrA, 28.9% in gyrB, 88.9% in parC, and 6.7% in parE. Another mechanism of resistance was overexpression of the efflux pumps in some representative strains. In particular, overexpression of MexXY-OprM drug transporter was found in five isolates, whereas overexpression of MexCD-OprJ was detected in two isolates; surprisingly, in one of these last two isolates, also overexpression of MexAB-OprM pump was identified.",

        "abstract": "Members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters including P-glycoprotein (Pgp/ABCB1), multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs/ABCC) as well as breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) function as ATP-dependent drug efflux transporters, which form a unique defense network against multiple chemotherapeutic drugs and cellular toxins. Among antitumor agents is the important group of folic acid antimetabolites known as antifolates. Antifolates such as methotrexate (MTX), pemetrexed and raltitrexed exert their cytotoxic activity via potent inhibition of folate-dependent enzymes essential for purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis and thereby block DNA replication. Overexpression of MRPs and BCRP confers resistance upon malignant cells to various hydrophilic and lipophilic antifolates. Apart from their central role in mediating resistance to antifolates and other anticancer drugs, MRPs and BCRP have been recently shown to transport naturally occurring reduced folates. This was inferred from various complementary systems as follows: (a) Cell-free systems including ATP-dependent uptake of radiolabeled folate/MTX into purified inside-out membrane vesicles from stable transfectants and/or cells overexpressing these transporters, (b) Decreased accumulation of radiolabeled folate/MTX in cultured tumor cells overexpressing these transporters, as well as (c) In vivo rodent models such as Eisi hyperbillirubinemic rats (EHBR) that hereditarily lack MRP2 in their canalicular membrane and thereby display a bile that is highly deficient in various reduced folate cofactors and MTX, when compared with wild type Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. In all cases, these folate/antifolate transporters functioned as high capacity, low affinity ATP-driven exporters. While the mechanism of cellular retention of (anti)folates is mediated via (anti)folylpolyglutamylation, certain efflux transporters including MRP5 (ABCC5) and BCRP were shown to transport both mono-, di- as well as triglutamate derivatives of MTX and folic acid. Furthermore, overexpression of MRPs and BCRP has been shown to result in decreased cellular folate pools, whereas loss of ABC transporter expression brought about a significant expansion in the intracellular reduced folate pool. The latter finding has important implications to antifolate-based chemotherapy as an augmented cellular folate pool results in a significant level of resistance to certain antifolates. Hence, the aims of the present review are: (a) To summarize and discuss the cumulative evidence supporting a functional role for various multidrug resistance efflux transporters of the ABC superfamily which mediate resistance to hydrophilic and lipophilic antifolates, (b) To describe and evaluate the recent data suggesting a role for these efflux transporters in regulation of cellular folate homeostasis under folate replete and deplete conditions. Furthermore, novel developments and future perspectives regarding the identification of novel antifolate target proteins and mechanisms of action, as well as rationally designed emerging drug combinations containing antifolates along with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being discussed. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental evidence demonstrates that dysregulation of specific miRNAs leads to drug resistance in different cancers and correction of these miRNAs using miRNA mimics or antagomiRs can normalize the gene regulatory network and signaling pathways and sensitize cancerous cells to chemotherapy.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occurrence, causative pathogens, and resistance patterns in surgical intensive care units (SICU) are different between Western and developing Asian countries. In Thailand, resistant organisms have progressively increased in the last decade. However, the evidence describing causes of VAP and its outcomes, especially secondary to resistant pathogens, in Asian developing countries' SICUs is very limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the incidence, pathogen characteristics, and risk factors that impact mortality and patient survival following VAP in a tertiary Northern Thai SICU.\\n\\nMETHODS: Between 2008 and 2012, VAP occurred in a total of 150 patients in Chiang Mai University's general SICUs (6.3\u00b12.8 cases per 1,000 mechanical ventilator days). The following clinical data were collected from 46 patients who died and 104 patients who survived: microbiologic results, susceptible patterns, and survival status at hospital discharge. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were classified as susceptible, multidrug resistant (MDR), extensively drug resistant (XDR), and pan-drug resistant (PDR). The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated for risk factor analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS: Regarding the microbiology, gram negative organisms were the major pathogens (n=142, 94.7%). The first three most common organisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (38.7% of all organisms, mortality 41.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%, mortality 30.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.7%, mortality 16%) respectively. The most common gram positive organism was Staphylococcus aureus (4.0%, mortality 50%). The median day of VAP occurrence were significantly different between the three groups (P<0.01): susceptible (day 4), MDR (day 5), and XDR (day 6.5). Only half of all VAP cases were caused by susceptible organisms. Antibiotic resistance was demonstrated by 49.3% of the gram negative organisms and 62.5% of the gram positive organisms. Extensive drug resistance was evident only in Acinetobacter baumannii (30.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.3%). No pan-drug resistance was found during surveillance. The significant HR risk factors were age (P=0.03), resistant organisms (P=0.04), XDR (P=0.02), and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score (<0.01). Acinetobacter baumannii (P=0.06) and intubation due to severe sepsis (P=0.08) demonstrated a trend toward a significant increase in the HR. On the other hand, there were significantly decreased HRs in trauma patients (P=0.01). Initial administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy had a tendency toward a significant decrease in the HR (P=0.08).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Gram negative organisms were the primary cause of bacterial VAP in Chiang Mai University's general SICU. Resistant strains were present in half of all VAP cases and were associated with the day of VAP onset. Regarding risk factors, age, acute physiology, chronic health evaluation II score, resistant organisms (especially XDR), and being a non-trauma patient increased the risk of mortality.",

E. coli isolates were affiliated to the phylogroups/MLST: D/ST405 (CC405), A/ST10 (CC10), A/ST617 (CC10), and B1/ST1431. K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to phylogroup KpI and to sequence types ST15, ST17, ST36, ST48, ST54, and ST147. The study showed a multi-drug resistance at the inflow and outflow of the WWTP, with ESBL production, plasmid-mediated quinolones resistance, and mutations in topoisomerases. The findings highlight the similarity of antibiotic resistance mechanisms in the clinical setting and the environment, and the role of the latter as a source of dissemination of resistance genes.",

        "abstract": "Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterium that causes the disease melioidosis, is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. First-line antibiotic therapy for treating melioidosis is usually the synthetic \u03b2-lactam, ceftazidime (CAZ), as almost all B. pseudomallei strains are susceptible to this drug. However, acquired CAZ resistance can develop in vivo during treatment with CAZ, which can lead to mortality if therapy is not switched to a different drug in a timely manner. Serial B. pseudomallei isolates obtained from an acute Thai melioidosis patient infected by a CAZ susceptible strain, who ultimately succumbed to infection despite being on CAZ therapy for the duration of their infection, were analyzed. Isolates that developed CAZ resistance due to a proline to serine change at position 167 in the \u03b2-lactamase PenA were identified. Importantly, these CAZ resistant isolates remained sensitive to the alternative melioidosis treatments; namely, amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and meropenem. Lastly, real-time polymerase chain reaction-based assays capable of rapidly identifying CAZ resistance in B. pseudomallei isolates at the position 167 mutation site were developed. The ability to rapidly identify the emergence of CAZ resistant B. pseudomallei populations in melioidosis patients will allow timely alterations in treatment strategies, thereby improving patient outcomes for this serious disease.",

In the immunosuppressed host, such as those treated with immunosuppressive drugs or infected with human immunodeficiency virus particularly at advanced stages of the disease, microsporidia can produce a wide range of clinical diseases. The most common manifestation is gastrointestinal tract infection; however, encephalitis, ocular infection, sinusitis, myositis and disseminated infection have also been described. In addition, these organisms have been reported in immune competent individuals. Multiple genes are involved in these infections and different organisms can result in distinct clinical pictures. Differences in clinical and parasitologic response to various therapeutic agents have emerged from clinical, as well as in vitro and in vivo studies. Currently there are no precisely defined guidelines for the optimal treatment of microsporidial infections.

        "abstract": "Drug resistance and metastasis are major impediments for the successful treatment of cancer. A common feature among drug resistant and metastatic tumor cells is that they exhibit profound resistance to apoptosis. This property enables cancer cells not only to grow and survive in stressful environments (metastasis) but also to display resistance against many anticancer agents. Therefore, perturbation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathways of cancer cells will affect their ability to respond to chemotherapy and to metastasize and survive in distant sites. Recent studies have demonstrated that cancer cells and cancer cell lines selected for resistance against chemotherapeutic drugs or isolated from metastatic sites, express elevated levels of the multifunctional protein, tissue transglutaminase (TG2). TG2 is the most diverse and ubiquitous member of the transglutaminase family of proteins that is implicated to play a role in apoptosis, wound healing, cell migration, cell attachment, cell growth, angiogenesis, and matrix assembly. TG2 can associate with certain ?? members of the integrin family of proteins (??1, ??3, ??4, and ??5) and promote stable interaction between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in increased cell survival, cell migration, and invasion. Additionally, TG2 forms a ternary complex with I??B/p65:p50 and results in constitutive activation of the nuclear transcription factor-??B (NF-??B). Moreover, TG2 expression in cancer cells leads to constitutive activation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and its downstream PI3K/Akt survival pathway. Importantly, the inhibition of endogenous TG2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in the reversal of drug resistance and the invasive phenotype. Conversely, ectopic expression of TG2 promoted cell survival, cell motility and invasive functions of cancer cells. This review discusses the current thinking and implications of increased TG2 expression in development of drug resistance and metastasis by cancer cells. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of antimicrobial drugs in medicine gave hope for a future in which all infectious diseases could be controlled. Decades later it appears certain this will not be the case, because antibiotic resistance is growing relentlessly. Bacteria possess an extraordinary ability to adapt to environmental challenges like antimicrobials by both genetic and phenotypic means, which contributes to their evolutionary success. It is becoming increasingly appreciated that adaptation is a major mechanism behind the acquisition and evolution of antibiotic resistance. Adaptive resistance is a specific class of non-mutational resistance that is characterized by its transient nature. It occurs in response to certain environmental conditions or due to epigenetic phenomena like persistence. We propose that this type of resistance could be the key to understanding the failure of some antibiotic therapy programs, although adaptive resistance mechanisms are still somewhat unexplored. Similarly, hard wiring of some of the changes involved in adaptive resistance might explain the phenomenon of \"baseline creep\" whereby the average minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a given medically important bacterial species increases steadily but inexorably over time, making the likelihood of breakthrough resistance greater. This review summarizes the available information on adaptive resistance. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

With the introduction of epidemiological cut-off values for each agent in important fungal pathogens based on the distribution of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), the distinction between wild type and drug-resistant populations has been facilitated. Antifungal resistance has been described for all currently available antifungal agents in several pathogens and most of the associated resistance mechanisms have been deciphered at the molecular level. Clinical breakpoints for some agents have been proposed and can have predictive value for the success or failure of therapy. Tolerance to antifungals has been a much more ignored area. By definition, tolerance operates at antifungal concentrations above individual intrinsic inhibitory values. Important is that tolerance to antifungal agents favours the emergence of persister cells, which are able to survive antifungal therapy and can cause relapses. Here we will review the current knowledge on antifungal tolerance, its potential mechanisms and also evaluate the role of antifungal tolerance in the efficacy of drug treatments.",

Seventy-six A. baumannii strains were collected from inpatients and object surface of devices in intensive care units from May 2008 to February 2011. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of 18 antimicrobial agents was performed. The presence of carbapenemase-encoding resistance genes was investigated by polymerase chain reaction. Genotyping and dendrogram analysis of A. baumannii strains from nosocomial infections were performed using the DiversiLab System. All of the 76 clinical A. baumannii isolates were shown multidrug resistance. The bla(OXA-23) gene was identified in the 76 MRAB strains, while bla(OXA-24), bla(OXA-58), VIM, IMP-1, IMP-4, SIM, and blaNDM-1 were absent in all. Twenty-four A. baumannii strains from the samples with nosocomial infections were classified into four unrelated groups and nine patterns. In conclusion, production of bla(OXA-23) in MRAB is one of the molecular mechanisms responsible for carbapenem resistance. The MRAB strains from unrelated groups show different drug resistance, but the homologous strains also have different drug resistance. Homologous analysis can provide scientific evidence for evaluation of epidemic status of nosocomial infection caused by MRAB.",

Instead of striving for a comprehensive overview, we showcase several trends, concepts and research areas that exemplify the complexity of drug resistance and its reversal as we currently understand it. Many of the studies discussed here deal with the interaction of tumor cells with their stromal microenvironment; structural proteins as well as cellular components, fibroblasts as well as inflammatory cells. Target identification, target validation and dealing with the challenge of resistance are recurring themes. Specific classes of molecules discussed are the taxanes, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic, anti-stromal and anti-metastatic agents. In the latter three categories, targets reviewed are delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4), integrins, nodal, galectins, lysyl oxidases and thrombospondins, several of which belong to the p53-tumor suppressor repertoire of secreted proteins.

Efflux transporters, genetic responses and enzyme activity in tumor cells are examples of the main modalities that account for resistance to therapy. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that the host also plays a significant role in promoting therapy resistance. Recruitment of different host cell types to the treated tumor site occurs in response to a range of therapies, including chemotherapy, radiation and even targeted drugs. This host response may have a protective effect on the tumor cells, not only negating anti-tumor activity, but also promoting a resistant tumor. In this review, we focus on host-tumor interactions leading to therapy resistance with special emphasis on different host cells and secreted factors within the tumor microenvironment. The development of novel inhibitors that block the host response to therapy could be used as a treatment strategy to enhance therapy outcomes and survival.",

These are highly promising agents for specific inhibition of malignant cell growth and metastasis. However, their therapeutic potential also depends on access to their intracellular targets, which may be significantly affected by certain ABC membrane transporters. It has been recently shown that several human multidrug transporter ABC proteins interact with specific TKIs, and the ABCG2 transporter has an especially high affinity for some of these kinase inhibitors. These results indicate that multidrug resistance protein modulation by TKIs may be an important factor in the treatment of cancer patients; moreover, the extrusion of TKIs by multidrug transporters may result in tumor cell TKI resistance.

        "abstract": "Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a major hurdle in the eradication of malignant tumors. Despite the high sensitivity of various cancers to treatment, some residual cancer cells persist and lead to tumor recurrence and treatment failure. Obvious reasons for residual disease include mechanisms of secondary therapy resistance, such as the presence of mutant cells that are insensitive to the drugs, or the presence of cells that become drug resistant due to activation of survival pathways. In addition to such unambiguous resistance modalities, several patients with relapsing tumors do not show refractory disease and respond again when the initial therapy is repeated. These cases cannot be explained by the selection of mutant tumor cells, and the precise mechanisms underlying this clinical drug resistance are ill-defined. In the current review, we put special emphasis on cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms that may explain mechanisms of MRD that are independent of secondary therapy resistance. In particular, we show that studying genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), which highly resemble the disease in humans, provides a complementary approach to understand MRD. In these animal models, specific mechanisms of secondary resistance can be excluded by targeted genetic modifications. This allows a clear distinction between the selection of cells with stable secondary resistance and mechanisms that result in the survival of residual cells but do not provoke secondary drug resistance. Mechanisms that may explain the latter feature include special biochemical defense properties of cancer stem cells, metabolic peculiarities such as the dependence on autophagy, drug-tolerant persisting cells, intratumoral heterogeneity, secreted factors from the microenvironment, tumor vascularization patterns and immunosurveillance-related factors. We propose in the current review that a common feature of these various mechanisms is cancer cell dormancy. Therefore, dormant cancer cells appear to be an important target in the attempt to eradicate residual cancer cells, and eventually cure patients who repeatedly respond to anticancer therapy but lack complete tumor eradication.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Artemisin-based combination therapies became the recommended therapy in C\u00f4te-d'Ivoire in 2005, but both chloroquine (CQ) and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) have been heavily used for many decades. Despite this long history, little is known about the geographical distribution of drug resistance-conferring genotypes outside the capital city of Abidjan. In this work, we compared the prevalence of drug-resistant genotypes in Bonoua, an urban area, and Samo, a rural agricultural area, in southeastern C\u00f4te-d'Ivoire, about 59 km from Abidjan.\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples were collected from symptomatic patients in both sites during the rainy season in 2005. Genomic DNA was isolated and codons associated with resistance to CQ and SP were analyzed: pfcrt codons Cys-72-Ser, Val-73-Val, Met-74-Ile, Arg-75-Glu, Lys-76-Thr; pfdhfr codons Ala-16-Val, Arg-51-Ile, Cys-59-Arg, Ser-108-Arg/Thr, and Ile-164-Leu; pfdhps codons Ser-436-Ala, Ala-437-Gly, Lys-540-Glu, Ala-581-Gly, and Ala-613-Thr/Ser.\\nRESULTS: A limited number of genotypes were found in Bonoua compared with Samo. In both sites, the triple-mutant allele CVIET of pfcrt predominated: 100% in Bonoua and 86.2% in Samo. The wild-type allele, NCSI of pfdhfr, was common - 50% in Bonoua and 38.7% in Samo - but the triple-mutant IRNI and double-mutant NRNI were also frequent (IRNI, 32.6% in Bonoua and 19.4% in Samo; NRNI, 15.2% in Bonoua and 9.7% in Samo). In Samo, a wide range of different genotypes of Pfdhps was observed, with alleles carrying the Gly-437 codon fixed in Bonoua and comprising 73% of the isolates in Samo.\\nCONCLUSION: Although these two sites are only 8 km apart, they belonged to very different ecological environments. The overall prevalence of alleles of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with resistance to CQ and SP in both locations was among the highest of the region by 2005, although the more rural site showed a more diverse set of alleles and mixed infections. Continued surveillance of these markers will be a useful tool for drug policy, as both CQ and SP are still frequently used years after withdrawal, and SP is recommended by the World Health Organization for intermittent preventive therapy for pregnant women and infants. Data analyzed herein are among the first to be generated during the year of artemisin-based combination-therapy introduction in C\u00f4te-d'Ivoire and could be of some interest for malaria policy-makers.",

Thirty-six Campylobacter jejuni and 24 Campylobacter coli isolated from broilers and 68 C. jejuni and 32 C. coli from turkeys were tested by disk diffusion for their susceptibility to apramycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, cefuroxime, ampicillin, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, nalidixic acid, flumequine, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, tilmicosin, tylosin, tiamulin, clindamycin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim, chloramphenicol. Depending on the drug, breakpoints provided by Comit\u00e9 de l'antibiogramme de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Microbiologie, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, and the manufacturer were followed. All broiler strains and 92% turkey strains were multidrug resistant. Very high resistance rates were detected for quinolones, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim, ranging from 65% to 100% in broilers and from 74% to 96% in turkeys. Prevalence of resistance was observed also against ampicillin (97% in broilers, 88% in turkeys) and at least three cephalosporins (93-100% in broilers, 100% in turkeys). Conversely, no isolates showed resistance to chloramphenicol and tiamulin. Susceptibility prevailed for amoxicillin+clavulanic acid and aminoglycosides in both poultry species, and for macrolides and clindamycin among turkey strains and among C. jejuni from broilers, whereas most C. coli strains from broilers (87.5%) were resistant. Other differences between C. jejuni and C. coli were observed markedly in broiler isolates, with the overall predominance of resistance in C. coli compared to C. jejuni. This study provides updates and novel data on the AMR of broiler and turkey campylobacters in Italy, revealing the occurrence of high resistance to several antimicrobials, especially key drugs for the treatment of human campylobacteriosis, representing a potential risk for public health.\\n",

To overcome it, it is essential to understand the mechanisms and identify the molecules involved, so that they can be specifically targeted in combination therapies. The proteasome is such a validated target: it plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation, inhibition of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and drug resistance development. Bortezomib (Velcade??, PS-341) was the first proteasome inhibitor to receive regulatory approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Clinical combination trials have demonstrated a chemo-sensitizing effect of bortezomib on conventional agents in hematological malignancies and some solid tumors such as androgen-independent prostate and ovarian cancer. Although generally well-tolerated, bortezomib still generates toxicity which underscores the need for less toxic proteasome inhibitors. Several naturally occurring products, such as green tea polyphenols and the antibiotic lactacystin, have been shown to be potent proteasome inhibitors. Significantly, green tea polyphenols, as well as several flavonoids such as genistein, curcumin and resveratrol, have also been shown to have chemo-sensitizing properties in prostate, breast, hepatic, and lung tumors. Further studies on natural proteasome inhibitors as chemo-sensitizers could lead to identification of more potent and less toxic compounds that could be used in combination therapies for drug-resistant tumors. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The fundamental barriers to comparison were the lack of shared targets for performance and predictive measures of success. Unique problems and policies within countries resulted in variations in goals, methods, pathogens, drugs, and priorities within and between jurisdictions. Other obstacles included: (1) lack of information on potential biases associated with different microbiological testing and sampling methods; (2) lack of information with which to conclude whether or not different programs examined comparable spectra of patients or outcomes; (3) inadequate description of the epidemiological rationale for sampling strategies; (4) use of aggregated national data that can hide regional or local variations; (5) rarity of studies designed explicitly for multinational comparison; and (6) lack of international agreement on methods, continuing education, and quality control needed to ensure program comparability.

Currently, multiple clinical trials are underway to evaluate the antitumor activity of recombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) and agonistic antibodies that target death receptors (DRs) 4 or 5. It is encouraging that these products have shown a tolerated safety profile in early phase studies. However, their therapeutic potential is likely limited by the emergence of tumor drug resistance phenomena. Increasing evidence indicates that TRAIL DRs are deficient on the plasma membrane of some cancer cells despite their total protein expression. Notably, the lack of surface DR4/DR5 is sufficient to render cancers resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, regardless of the status of other apoptosis signaling components. The current review highlights recent findings on the dynamic expression of TRAIL death receptors, including the regulatory roles of endocytosis, autophagy, and Ras GTPase-mediated signaling events. This information could aid in the identification of novel predictive biomarkers of tumor response as well as the development of combinational drugs to overcome or bypass tumor drug resistance to TRAIL receptor-targeted therapies.",

Results: Re-emergence in the sensitivity to chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole with increase in the resistance to various quinolones has been observed. The efficacy of nalidixic acid resistance to be used as a marker for decrease in sensitivity to ciprofloxacin may vary. Clonal differences on the basis of amplification of repetitive elements (rep-PCR) were found in the two different areas within the same region. Conclusions: The present study creates a paramount baseline for rationalizing the judicious use of quinolones and re-examine the use of chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole. Molecular analysis of clinical Salmonella isolates depicts the clonal expansion of the isolates that may serve as a reference to which newer outbreak strains can be compared. rep-PCR techniques may be useful in molecular discrimination of isolates for better understanding of the Salmonella epidemiology and as a basis for development of rational control strategies.",

Identifying azole resistance is critically method dependent; nevertheless reproducible methods, reflective of in vivo outcome, are now in routine use. Some isolates also have elevated MICs to posaconazole and voriconazole. Multiple mechanisms of resistance are now known to be responsible, with differing degrees of azole cross-resistance, including mutations in the Cyp51A gene at G54, L98 + TR, G138, M220, G448. Establishing breakpoints for Aspergillus is probably impossible with clinical data alone for multiple reasons yet there is an urgent need to do so. We propose the following breakpoints for A. fumigatus complex using the proposed EUCAST susceptibility testing methodology: for itraconazole and voriconazole, <2 mg/L (susceptible), 2 mg/L (intermediate) and >2 mg/L (resistant); for posaconazole, <0.25, 0.5 and >0.5 mg/L respectively. We recognize that additional work will be needed to confirm these proposed breakpoints, including in vivo and clinical correlative responses. We also propose nomenclature for genotypic resistance, in the event an isolate is not cultured, typified by ITZgR, VCZgI, POSgR (G54W) indicating that the isolate has a G54W substitution with a corresponding phenotype of resistance to itraconazole and posaconazole and intermediate susceptibility to voriconazole. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "The BCR-ABL-fusion gene is critical for the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and BCR-ABL positive acute lymphatic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Blocking BCR-ABL by the ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec??) is clinically highly efficient. Treatment response is unfortunately compromised by the emergence of IM resistance, which is regularly seen in accelerated and blastic phase of CML (CML-AP/BP) and in Ph+ ALL. BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations are then considered the causative mechanism of IM resistance, because 50-60% of the IM resistant patients harbour such mutations. In contrast, IM resistance arises very rarely in patients that are treated with IM in early chronic phase of CML. This implies that BCR-ABL independent factors such as the cellular context of BCR-ABL expression and stage of disease decisively control the evolution of IM resistance. In line with this, novel Abl-kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib (DA) or nilotinib (NI) - although capable of inhibiting most of the BCR/-BL kinase mutants - still often fail to overcome resistance and do mostly not induce durable cytogenetic responses in IM resistant CML-AP/BC and Ph+ ALL patients. On the basis of available evidence it is proposed here that alternative genetic aberrations, which synergize with BCR-ABL to enable leukemic self-renewal are of causal importance for the evolution of clinical kinase inhibitor resistance. Kinase mutations may in turn reflect clonal variants of cells that emerge on the basis of an already existing IM resistant and self-renewing leukemic cell population. This model has clinical implications as it implies that even highly potent Abl-kinase inhibition can not target the genetic basis of IM resistance and will also not resolve the problem of Abl-kinase inhibitor resistance. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii represent more than 50% of microbial isolates. Additionally, bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones, macrolides and third-generation cephalosporins is of serious concern.

Microdilution broth assays verified that B. anthracis Sterne is highly resistant to a variety of sulfonamides with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) exceeding 1250 microg/ml. A putative gene encoding DHPS (folP) was amplified from B. anthracis Sterne chromosomal DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned. Sequence comparisons showed 100% identity with DHPSs from published genome sequences for various strains of B. anthracis. Additionally, expression of folP in B. anthracis Sterne was confirmed. Functionality of the B. anthracis DHPS was confirmed by complementation of an Escherichia coli folP deletion mutant as well as a standard enzyme assay. Concomitant transfer of high level sulfonamide resistance to this mutant along with increased sulfonamide IC(50)values for purified B. anthracis DHPS links DHPS to sulfonamide resistance in B. anthracis. These findings lay the groundwork that will aid future development of antimicrobics that target DHPS to treat anthrax infections.",

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) has not only gained a cornerstone position in the treatment of hematological malignancies, particularly multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, but also in experimental therapeutics of acute leukemia. However, the therapeutic efficacy of bortezomib is hampered by the emergence of acquired resistance, for which multifactorial mechanisms have been identified. This review summarizes the current status of the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to proteasome inhibitors that emerged in preclinical therapeutic studies, and discusses these findings in the clinical perspective of novel therapeutic modalities of hematological malignancies. The specific topics that will be addressed in the current review include the recently established mechanisms of resistance to proteasome inhibitors: the role of constitutive and immunoproteasomes, mutations in proteasome subunits, unfolded protein response, XBP1 and MARCKS proteins, multidrug efflux transporters, aggresomes and autophagy, as well as the impact of pro-survival signaling pathways and bone marrow microenvironment. The growing knowledge of the determinants that confer bortezomib resistance and/or toxicity has provided the basis for the rational development of second generation proteasome inhibitors, some of which were recently approved or that are undergoing clinical evaluation as novel strategies to overcome bortezomib resistance as well as to enhance clinical therapeutic efficacy along with minimal side effects. Collectively, these combined approaches should enhance therapeutic efficacy and outcome in patients with hematological malignancies.",

Imipenem-selected mutants were generated from the imipenem-susceptible strain ATCC 17978 by multistep selection resistance. Antibiotic susceptibilities were examined, and the selected mutants originated from the ATCC 17978 strain were confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The genomic sequence of a resistant mutant was analyzed using a next-generation sequencing platform, and genetic recombination was further confirmed by PCR. The result showed that phenotypic resistance was observed with carbapenem upon exposure to various concentrations of imipenem. Genomewide analysis showed that ISAba1 transposition was initiated by imipenem exposure at concentrations up to 0.5 mg/L. Transposition of ISAba1 upstream of blaOXA-95 was detected in all the selected mutants. The expression of blaOXA-95 was further analyzed by quantitative PCR, and the results demonstrated that a 200-fold increase in gene expression was required for resistance to imipenem. This study concluded that imipenem exposure at a concentration of 0.5 mg/L mediated the transposition of ISAba1 upstream of the blaOXA-95 gene and resulted in the overexpression of blaOXA-95 gene, which may play a major role in the resistance to imipenem in A. baumannii.",

The effect of three inoculum sizes on the selection of resistance to vancomycin, daptomycin, and linezolid was investigated in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS: Low (10(4) CFU/ml), medium (10(6) CFU/ml), and high (10(8) CFU/ml) inocula of MRSA were exposed to twofold increasing concentrations of either drug during 15 days of cycling. MICs for low (MICL), medium (MICM), and high (MICH) inocula were determined daily. Conventional MICs were measured at days 1, 5, 10, and 15. Experiments were performed in triplicate. RESULTS: At the beginning of the experiment a small IE was observed for vancomycin (MICL=1 mug/ml, MICM=1-2 mug/ml, and MICH=2 mug/ml) and a significant IE for daptomycin (MICL=0.25 mug/ml, MICM=0.25-0.5 mug/ml, and MICH=2 mug/ml). Linezolid exhibited no IE at low and medium inocula (MICL=1 mug/ml and MICM=1-2 mug/ml), but with the high inoculum, concentrations up to 2,048 mug/ml did not fully inhibit visual growth. During cycling, increase of MIC was observed for all antibiotics. At day 15, MICL, MICM, and MICH of vancomycin were 2-4, 4-8, and 4-16 mug/ml and of daptomycin were 0.5-2, 8-128, and 64-256 mug/ml, respectively. MICL and MICM of linezolid were 1 and 2-4 mug/ml, respectively. Conventional MICs showed vancomycin and daptomycin selection of resistance since day 5 depending on the inocula. No selection of linezolid resistance was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed the importance of the inoculum size in the development of resistance. Measures aimed at lowering the inoculum at the site of infection should be used whenever possible in parallel to antimicrobial therapy.",

In recent years, new tubulin-binding agents have been under preclinical or clinical development. One of these classes of agents, epothilones, has shown great promise in phase III clinical trials. What all these agents share in common, is that they bind to beta-tubulin and disrupt microtubule function during mitosis which in turn leads to mitotic arrest and cell death. In addition, these agents can inhibit angiogenesis. Not withstanding their effectiveness, drug resistance can pose a major clinical problem. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms mediating resistance to tubulin-binding agents related to the cellular target and discusses strategies to overcome this important clinical problem.",

        "abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) has the highest mortality rate among all gynecological cancers. Patients are generally diagnosed in an advanced stage with the majority of cases displaying platinum resistant relapses. Recent genomic interrogation of large numbers of HGSOC patient samples indicated high complexity in terms of genetic aberrations, intra- and intertumor heterogeneity and underscored their lack of targetable oncogenic mutations. Sub-classifications of HGSOC based on expression profiles, termed \u2018differentiated\u2019, \u2018immunoreactive\u2019, \u2018mesenchymal\u2019 and \u2018proliferative\u2019, were shown to have prognostic value. In addition, in almost half of all HGSOC patients, a deficiency in homologous recombination (HR) was found that potentially can be targeted using PARP inhibitors. Developing precision medicine requires advanced experimental models. In the current review, we discuss experimental HGSOC models in which resistance to platinum therapy and the use of novel therapeutics can be carefully studied. Panels of better-defined primary cell lines need to be established to capture the full spectrum of HGSOC subtypes. Further refinement of cell lines is obtained with a 3-dimensional culture model mimicking the tumor microenvironment. Alternatively, ex vivo ovarian tumor tissue slices are used. For in vivo studies, larger panels of ovarian cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are being established, encompassing all expression subtypes. Ovarian cancer PDXs grossly retain tumor heterogeneity and clinical response to platinum therapy is preserved. PDXs are currently used in drug screens and as avatars for patient response. The role of the immune system in tumor responses can be assessed using humanized PDXs and immunocompetent genetically engineered mouse models. Dynamic tracking of genetic alterations in PDXs as well as patients during treatment and after relapse is feasible by sequencing circulating cell-free tumor DNA and analyzing circulating tumor cells. We discuss how various models and methods can be combined to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying platinum resistance and to select HGSOC patients other than BRCA1/2-mutation carriers that could potentially benefit from the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors. This integrated approach is a first step to improve therapy outcomes in specific subgroups of HGSOC patients.",

Kuwait is an important destination for commerce, employment for expatriates, and stationing of multinational troops. Knowledge about antimicrobial susceptibility of C. jejuni will be helpful for empirical treatment of infection. Tetracycline is one of the antibiotics recommended for treatment, but no data exist for tetracycline resistance in C. jejuni for the Arabian Gulf region. We characterized the tetracycline susceptibility of 85 C. jejuni isolates from diarrheal stools of patients seen at a teaching hospital in Kuwait during 2003-2006. Thirty-four (40%) isolates were tetracycline resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration >= 16 mu g/ml), with 30 isolates carrying the tet(O) gene, including 19 isolates that carried the gene on a 35 kb plasmid. Four selected tetracycline-resistant donor strains transferred the plasmids and tetracycline resistances to a tetracycline-susceptible C. jejuni strain on conjugation. Tetracycline-resistant C. jejuni isolates were genetically unrelated to each other by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Thus, tetracycline resistance is common in C. jejuni isolates from Kuwait with the resistance determinant carried on transmissible plasmids. We conclude that tetracycline resistance is a feature of C. jejuni in Kuwait as in other parts of the world and that empirical therapy with tetracycline will yield variable results in Kuwait.",

The fundamental functions of these multiple transporter proteins include: (1) conserved mechanisms related to nutrition and pathogenesis in bacteria, (2) spore formation in fungi, and (3) signal transduction, protein secretion and antigen presentation in eukaryotes. Moreover, one of the major causes of multidrug resistance (MDR) and chemotherapeutic failure in cancer therapy is believed to be the ABC transporter-mediated active efflux of a multitude of structurally and mechanistically distinct cytotoxic compounds across membranes. It has been postulated that ABC transporter inhibitors known as chemosensitizers may be used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. The current paper reviews the advance in the past decade in this important domain of cancer chemoresistance and summarizes the development of new compounds and the re-evaluation of compounds originally designed for other targets as transport inhibitors of ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps.",

Currently, the beta-lactamases receiving the most attention are the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamases and carbapenemases. When found in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., ESBLs confer resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, such as ceftazidime, cefotaxime and cefepime. Hence, ESBLs limit the choice of beta-lactam therapy to carbapenems. A worrisome trend is the increasing number of pathogens found in isolates from patients in the community that possess ESBLs. It is equally distressing that carbapenemases (serine and metallo-beta-lactamases) are being found in many of the same bacteria that harbor ESBLs, for example Klebsiella pneumoniae.

A molecular survey was performed in Plasmodium falciparum isolates originating from persons from gold mining areas to assess the extent and role of mining areas as reservoirs of malaria resistance in Suriname.\\n\\nMETHODS: The status of 14 putative resistance-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in the pfdhfr, pfcrt, pfmdr1, and pfATP6 genes was assessed for 28 samples from gold miners diagnosed with P. falciparum malaria using polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and the results were compared with earlier data from nonmining villagers.\\n\\nRESULTS: Isolates from miners showed a high degree of homogeneity, with a fixed pfdhfr Ile51/Asn108, pfmdr1 Phe184/Asp1042/Tyr1246, and pfcrt Thr76 mutant genotype, while an exclusively wild-type genotype was observed for pfmdr1 Asn86 and pfdhfr Ala16, Cys59, and Ile164, and for the pfATP6 positions Leu263/Ala623/Ser769. Small variations were observed for pfmdr1 S1034C. No statistically significant difference could be detected in allele frequencies between mining and nonmining villagers.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Despite the increased risk of malaria infection in individuals working/living in gold mining areas, we did not detect an increase in mutation frequency at the 14 analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms. Therefore, mining areas in Suriname cannot yet be considered as reservoirs for malaria resistance.",

Urinary pathogens were identified in 719 cases, and Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (661/719, 91.9%). Antibiotic susceptibilities to several E. coli antibiotics were as follows: ciprofloxacin, 84.1%; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazola (TMP-SMX), 67.2%; and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative, 92.4%.

We compared clinical outcomes and hospital days in patients with FQ-resistant (32) and FQ-sensitive E. coli (173) who received FQ as initial empirical therapy. Clinical cure was higher in the FQ-sensitive group (78% vs. 91%, p=0.027), and hospital days were longer in the FQ-resistant group (9.6\u00b15.5 days vs. 7\u00b13.5 days, p=0.001). In conclusion, FQ-sensitivity of E. coli from UAPN was 84.1%. FQ treatment of UAPN caused by FQ-resistant E. coli has a lower cure rate and involves longer hospital stay than FQ treatment of cases caused by FQ-sensitive E. coli. \u00a9 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global emergency and is one of the most common infectious disease causes of death in developing countries. Current treatment regimens for multi-drug resistant TB are associated with low treatment success rates, are toxic, and require long duration of treatment. The need for shorter and more effective treatment regimens is urgent. Delamanid (Deltyba, or formerly known as OPC-67683) is a new dihydro-imidazooxazole anti-TB drug active against resistant forms of pulmonary TB. Delamanid kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acids required for cell wall synthesis. Whilst delamanid has been included in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicine by the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines and in international guidance for the treatment of multi-drug resistant TB since April 2014, its access in countries with the greatest need, has proven challenging. This review provides an update on currently available clinical safety and efficacy data on delamanid and offers a discussion on research priorities and recommendations for expedited, expanded access. \u00a9 2015 Rustomjee and Zumla.",

IMS Health Global Services pro- vided national outpatient antibiotic prescription data for the years 1996\u20132003 from France, Spain, Italy, Ger- many, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Surveillance data consist of S. pneumoniae isolates ob- tained from a surveillance database in the same geographic regions from 1996 to 2003. A linear mixed model for repeated measures was used to analyze the association between resistance and several antibacterial classes through time. Changes in penicillin resistance through time in any country are better explained by the weighted cumulative antibacterial consumption with a 2-year lag. Narrow-spectrum penicillins are associated with lower resistance rates. Large reductions in consumption at the population level are needed to affect resistance. There is a peak level of penicillin resistance associated with cumulative exposure to a combination of antibiotic classes that is unique for every country.",

Portugal also presents high levels of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (1.5%, primary rate and 2.4%, in retreatment cases). In the present study we have characterized 58 MDR-TB clinical isolates by: (i) determining the resistance profile to first- and second-line drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis; (ii) genotyping all isolates by MIRU-VNTR; (iii) analyzing mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and ethambutol, in katG, mabA-inhA, rpoB, rpsL, rrs, and pncA genes. We have therefore established the prevalence of the most common mutations associated with drug resistance in the Lisbon Health Region: C-15T in mabA-inhA for isoniazid; S531L in rpoB for rifampicin; K43R in rpsL for streptomycin; and V125G in pncA for pyrazinamide. By genotyping all isolates and combining with the mutational results, we were able to assess the isolates' genetic relatedness and determine possible transmission events. Strains belonging to family Lisboa, characterized several years ago, are still responsible for the majority of the MDR-TB. Even more alarming is the high prevalence of extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) among the MDR-TB isolates, which was found to be 53%. The TB status in Portugal therefore requires urgent attention to contain the strains continuously responsible for MDR-TB and now, XDR-TB.",

The presence of the aadE gene encoding aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase was also evaluated. To reveal putative connection between ERY and STR resistance mechanisms, 13 C. coli isolates initially susceptible to STR and ERY were exposed to STR, and resistant variants were characterized. We also assessed the development of ERY resistance with a similar method. Finally, the effect of the putative CmeABC efflux pump inhibitor phenyl-arginine-beta-naphthylamine on STR resistance was tested. Our studies showed an association between mutations in the rpsL gene and STR resistance in C. coli. Further, mutations obtained in vitro were more diverse than those occurring in vivo. However, we observed no resistance associated mutations in the other genes studied, and selection with STR did not result in variants resistant to ERY and vice versa. None of the isolates harbored the aadE gene, and no differences in STR minimum inhibitory concentration levels were detected in the presence or absence of phenyl-arginine-beta-naphthylamine. In conclusion, we found that STR resistance was associated with mutations in the rpsL gene, but no obvious association between STR and ERY resistance mechanisms was found in C. coli.",

Susceptibility to 21 antimicrobials was determined and the overall prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was 25.8%. Pair-wise difference in prevalences of resistance to individual antimicrobials was significant between isolates from residents on farms that fed medicated swine rations compared to those that did not (p = 0.013). Cross-resistance among antimicrobials of same class and multidrug-resistance were observed. Logistic regression models revealed the following risk factors positively associated with antimicrobial resistance: use of antimicrobials in pigs on farms; number of hours per week that farmers spent in their pig barns; handling of sick pigs; and intake of antimicrobials by farm residents. This study indicates that occupational exposure of farmers to resistant bacteria and use of antimicrobials in pig farming may constitute a source of resistance in humans, although the human health impacts of such resistance is unknown. The consumption of antimicrobials by farmers appeared to constitute a significant risk for resistance development. Fecal E. coli from farm residents may act as a reservoir of resistance genes for animal and/or human pathogens.",

A total of 500 nonduplicated clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were obtained from fecal specimens at five tertiary-care hospitals between March and May 2008. The PMQR genes (qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qepA) were amplified by PCR and confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR products. A total of 83 (16.6%) qnr-positive isolates were detected. The prevalence rates of qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS were 1.4%, 13.6%, and 1.6%, respectively. The species distributions of qnrB-positive isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae (37/109; 33.9%), Citrobacter freundii (10/34; 29.4%), Citrobacter braakii (8/13; 61.5%), and Escherichia coli (8/275; 2.9%).

A decade ago, several supranational surveillance initiatives were introduced. Few of them are still ongoing, and only one features an interactive database in the public domain. No public surveillance system monitors resistance trends among non-invasive isolates on a supranational level. Although the relevance of measuring antimicrobial resistance in invasive isolates is undisputable and there is a large consensus on sampling techniques for these isolates, surveillance systems monitoring invasive infections will only have low sensitivity for early detection of emerging resistance trends, also missing an important opportunity for intervention. Surveillance of resistance patterns should ideally include characterization of important clones involved in the dissemination of resistance.

If a health care disaster is to be avoided then massive and long term funding is urgently required. Funds need to be applied in a cohesive manner, accountable to funding bodies and tailored to the specifics of each endemic region. The key elements of such an approach should be improving early diagnosis and treatment of infection and the deployment of combination regimens containing an artemisinin derivative.

To monitor the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and resistance genes in Aeromonas, a total of 106 isolates were collected from cultured freshwater animals in China from 1995 to 2012. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined by the disk diffusion method. The highest resistance percentage occurred with ampicillin, rifampin, streptomycin, and nalidixic acid. Most strains were sensitive to fluoroquinolones, doxycycline, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, and amikacin. The isolates from turtle samples had the highest levels of resistance to 11 of the 12 tested antimicrobials when compared with those from fish or shrimp. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequence results showed that all trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant strains contained sul1, and 37.0% were positive for tetA in tetracycline-resistant strains. ant(3\u2033)-Ia was identified in 13 (24.5%) streptomycin-resistant strains. Plasmid-borne quinolone resistance genes were detected in five Aeromonas hydrophila (4.7%), two of which carried qnrS2, while the other three strains harbored aac(6')-Ib-cr. Two cefotaxime-resistant A. hydrophila were positive for bla(TEM-1) and bla(CTX-M-3).

Indeed, anti-angiogenic therapy has become an important option for the management of several human malignancies. However, a significant number of patients either do not respond to anti-angiogenic agents or fairly rapidly develop resistance. In addition, the benefit of anti-angiogenic therapy is relatively short-lived and the majority of patients eventually relapses and progresses. Several mechanisms of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy have been recently proposed.

Biomedical scientists in laboratories across Ghana with capacity to perform bacteriological culture were selected and trained. In-house standard operating protocols were used to perform microbiological investigations on clinical specimens. Additional microbiological tests and data analyses were performed at a centralized laboratory. Surveillance data were stored and analyzed using WHONET program files. A total of 24 laboratories participated in the training, and 1,598 data sets were included in the final analysis. A majority of the bacterial species were isolated from outpatients (963 isolates; 60.3%). Urine (617 isolates; 38.6%) was the most common clinical specimen cultured, compared to blood (100 isolates; 6.3%). Ten of 18 laboratories performed blood culture. Bacteria isolated included Escherichia coli (27.5%), Pseudomonas spp. (14.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.5%), Streptococcus spp. (2.3%), and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (0.6%).

Susceptibility testing for erythromycin, clindamycin, penicillin, cefotaxime, vancomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, choramphenicol, ofloxacin, and meropenen was carried out by disc-diffusion test, and the E-test was also applied for erythromycin and clindamycin. The constitutive MLS(B) resistance (cMLS(B)) and inducible MLS(B) resistance (iMLS(B)) phenotypes, respectively, as well as the M resistance phenotype were determined by the erythromycin-clindamycin double-disc test. The presence of ermA, ermB, ermC, msrA, and mef(A/E) macrolide resistance genes was studied by PCR. Resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was found in 15% and 9.6% of the isolates, respectively. The resistance phenotypes detected among the 14 erythromycin-resistant isolates were as follows (number of isolates): cMLS(B) (9), iMLS(B) (3), and M (2). The MICs for erythromycin and clindamycin were as follows: cMLS(B) isolates (128-256 and >or=32 mg/L, respectively), iMLS(B) isolates (16-256 and 1 mg/L), and M isolates (2-8 and 1 mg/L). The following combination of genes were detected among isolates with cMLS(B) or iMLS(B) phenotypes: erm(B) (6 isolates), ermA + ermTR (3), ermA + ermB + ermTR (1), and none of these genes (2). The two isolates with M phenotype harbored the mef(A/E), and msrA gene was also found in one of them.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Moraxella catarrhalis previously considered as commensal of upper respiratory tract has gained importance as a pathogen responsible for respiratory tract infections. Its beta-lactamase-producing ability draws even more attention toward its varying patterns of resistance. METHODS: This was an observational study conducted to evaluate the prevalence and resistance pattern of M. catarrhalis. Patients aged 20-80 years admitted in the Department of Chest Medicine of Liaquat National Hospital from March 2012 to December 2012 were included in the study. Respiratory samples of sputum, tracheal secretions, and bronchoalveolar lavage were included, and their cultures were followed. RESULTS: Out of 110 respiratory samples, 22 showed positive cultures for M. catarrhalis in which 14 were males and eight were females. Ten samples out of 22 showed resistance to clarithromycin, and 13 samples out of 22 displayed resistance to erythromycin, whereas 13 showed resistance to levofloxacin. Hence, 45% of the cultures showed resistance to macrolides so far and 59% showed resistance to quinolones. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that in our environment, M. catarrhalis may be resistant to macrolides and quinolones; hence, these should not be recommended as an alternative treatment in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections caused by M. catarrhalis. However, a study of larger sample size should be conducted to determine if the recommendations are required to be changed.",

        "abstract": "Selection of bacterial strains for resistance to antimicrobial agents may affect fitness; and fluoroquinolone resistance has been shown to affect fitness of aerobic and facultative bacteria. The impact on bacterial fitness of resistance selection to three fluoroquinolones was examined in three wild-type strains of Clostridium perfringens: ATCC 13124, ATCC 3626, and NCTR. Selection for resistance to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and gatifloxacin affected the fitness of nine mutant strains differently. In a series of pure cultures grown in the absence of drugs, the growth of each of the mutants was comparable to that of the corresponding wild type. In competition experiments between mutants and isogenic wild types, however, some of the mutants were less fit. The fitness of ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants was comparable for all three strains, but two gatifloxacin-resistant mutants and one norfloxacin-resistant mutant were significantly less fit than the corresponding wild types. We conclude that both the genetic background of the strain and the fluoroquinolone which induced resistance affected the fitness of the resistant mutants. This is the first time that the effect on fitness of resistance to antimicrobial agents has been measured for C. perfringens.",

Although antimicrobial resistance in A. pleuropneumoniae has been recently reported in different countries, the current situation in Canada is unknown. The aim of the current study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibilities of 43 strains of A. pleuropneumoniae isolated in Canada. In addition, antimicrobial resistance genes were detected with an oligonucleotide microarray. The impact of biofilm formation on susceptibility to antimicrobials was also evaluated. All isolates were susceptible to ceftiofur, florfenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tilmicosin. A low level of resistance was observed toward tiamulin, penicillin, and ampicillin as well as danofloxacin. We observed a high level of resistance to chlortetracycline (88.4%) and oxytetracycline (90.7%). The strains showing resistance to tetracycline antimicrobials contained at least one of the following tet genes: tetB, tetO, tetH, or tetC. Five isolates showed multiresistance to penicillins (bla(ROB-1)), streptomycin [aph3'' (strA)], sulfonamides (sulII), and tetracyclines (tetO) antimicrobials whereas three others showed multiresistance to streptomycin [aph3'' (strA)], sulfonamides (sulII), and tetracyclines (tetB, tetO, or tetB/tetH) antimicrobials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of tetC gene in Pasteurellaceae. Finally, cells of A. pleuropneumoniae in a biofilm were 100 to 30,000 times more resistant to antimicrobials than their planktonic counterparts.",

This continent includes 12 independent countries with huge socioeconomic differences, where the ample access to antimicrobials, including counterfeit ones, coexists with ineffective health systems and sanitation problems, favoring the emergence and dissemination of resistant strains. This work presents a literature review concerning the evolution and current status of antimicrobial resistance threats found among Enterobacteriaceae in South America. Resistance to ??-lactams, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides was emphasized along with description of key epidemiological studies that highlight the success of specific resistance determinants in different parts of the continent. In addition, a discussion regarding political and socioeconomic factors possibly related to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant strains in clinical settings and at the community is presented. Finally, in order to assess the possible sources of resistant bacteria, we compile the current knowledge about the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in isolates in South American' food, food-producing animals and off-hospitals environments. By addressing that intensive intercontinental commerce and tourism neutralizes the protective effect of geographic barriers, we provide arguments reinforcing that globally integrated efforts are needed to decelerate the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistant strains. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The development of tumor cell resistance to conventional therapeutics is a major clinical problem. There is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics to overcome resistance and save patients from tumor recurrences. Novel therapeutics are currently being developed based on better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern resistance and the identification of targets that control resistance. One of the major factors that controls resistance is the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-??B) that has been shown to be constitutively activated in the majority of cancers and is responsible, in large part, for tumor cell survival, growth and direct activation of anti-apoptotic gene products. The development of non-toxic inhibitors of NF-??B activity may result in diminishing the anti-apoptotic threshold of resistant tumor cells and leading to inhibition of tumor cell growth and cell death or sensitization to the apoptotic effects of cytotoxic therapeutics. The novel NF-??B inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), selectively prevents the translocation of NF-??B into the nucleus and, hence, prevents its various transcriptional functions. Thus, DHMEQ is unlike many other NF-??B inhibitors that target gene products of the NF-??B pathway and it is also unlike proteasome inhibitors that prevent the degradation of pI??B. DHMEQ is a small molecule shown to be non-toxic in mice and rodents and exerts direct anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo as well as significant chemo- and immuno-sensitizing activities in resistant tumor cells. The present review summarizes studies that have used DHMEQ as a novel anti-cancer agent. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Despite the major progresses in biomedical research and the development of novel therapeutics and treatment strategies, cancer is still among the dominant causes of death worldwide. One of the crucial challenges in the clinical management of cancer is primary (intrinsic) and secondary (acquired) resistance to both conventional and targeted chemotherapeutics. Multiple mechanisms have been identifiedthat underlie intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance: these include impaired drug uptake, increased drug efflux, deletion of receptors, altered drug metabolism, quantitative and qualitative alterations in drug targets, increased DNA damage repair and various mechanisms of anti-apoptosis. The fast efflux of anticancer drugs mediated by multidrug efflux pumps and the partial or complete reversibility of chemoresistance combined with the absence of genetic mutations suggests a multifactorial process. However, a growing body of recent evidence suggests that chemoresistance is often triggered by the highly acidic microenvironment of tumors. The vast majority of drugs, including conventional chemotherapeutics and more recent biological agents, are weak bases that are quickly protonated and neutralized in acidic environments, such as the extracellular microenvironment and the acidic organelles of tumor cells. It is therefore essential to develop new strategies to overcome the entrapment and neutralization of weak base drugs. One such strategy is the use of proton pump inhibitors which can enhance tumor chemosensitivity by increasing the pH of the tumor microenvironment. Recent clinical trials in animals with spontaneous tumors have indicated that patient alkalization is capable of reversing acquired chemoresistance in a large percentage of tumors that are refractory to chemotherapy. Of particular interest was the benefit of alkalization for patients undergoing metronomic regimens which are becoming more widely used in veterinary medicine. Overall, these results provide substantial new evidence that altering the acidic tumor microenvironment is an effective, well tolerated and low cost strategy for the overcoming of anticancer drug resistance.",

In this study, 91 A. baumannii isolates from patients in tertiary intensive care units of three university hospitals in the north, central, and south of Iran were selected and tested for susceptibility to 22 antimicrobials; amplified restriction fragment polymorphism and multiplex polymerase chain reaction methods were used to determine genetic relationships and International Clone (IC) of A. baumannii isolates, respectively. Twenty-four genotypes were identified in A. baumannii isolates. About 91.2% of isolates categorized into 4 distinct clusters; one was more heterogeneous and observed across the three locations. A considerable number of the isolates (27.5%) belonged to the novel IC variant, sequence group 7 (SG7), which was geographically widespread in three locations. The drug resistance pattern showed that 14.2%, 20%, and 77% of the A. baumannii isolates were resistant to colistin, tigecycline, and rifampicin, respectively. Nine percent of isolates (8) showed simultaneous resistance to colistin, rifampicin, and tigecycline. Interestingly, all of them were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam and/or tobramycin.

The case-fatality rate associated with BSIs in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) reaches 35%-50%. The emergence and diffusion of bacteria with resistance to antibiotics is a global health problem. Multidrug-resistant bacteria were detected in 50.7% of patients with BSIs in a recently published international observational study, with methicillin resistance detected in 48% of Staphylococcus aureus strains, carbapenem resistance detected in 69% of Acinetobacter spp., in 38% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and in 37% of Pseudomonas spp. Prior hospitalization and antibiotic exposure have been identified as risk factors for infections caused by resistant bacteria in different studies. Patients with BSIs caused by resistant strains showed an increased risk of mortality, which may be explained by a higher incidence of inappropriate empirical therapy in different studies. The molecular genetic characterization of resistant bacteria allows the understanding of the most common mechanisms underlying their resistance and the adoption of surveillance measures. Knowledge of epidemiology, risk factors, mechanisms of resistance, and outcomes of BSIs caused by resistant bacteria may have a major influence on global management of ICU patients.

We review the structural and functional impact of active-site mutations with respect to enzyme activity and antifolate resistance of DHFRs from mammals, protozoa and bacteria. The high structural homology between DHFRs results in a number of cross-species, active-site 'hot-spots' for broad-based antifolate resistance.

A. baumannii has exhibited the ability to develop multidrug resistance (MDR), including resistance to carbapenems, the last-line class of antibiotics to treat these infections. In particular, MDR A. baumannii International Clone (IC) 2 has disseminated worldwide causing substantial problems in hospitals, including in Asia and Oceania. The global spread of this clonal lineage emphasizes the importance of tracking molecular epidemiology to obtain greater understanding of the population dynamics of A. baumannii. Carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii occurs mainly as a result of acquisition of OXA-type carbapenemase genes, and to some extent by acquisition of metallo-\u03b2-lactamase genes. The acquisition of carbapenemase genes, particularly the blaOXA-23, blaOXA-40, and blaOXA-58, by specific clonal lineages may be one of the attributes responsible for the relative homogeneity of the MDR A. baumannii population.",

Mutations in the katG 315, fabG1-inhA, and oxyR-ahpC regulatory regions were detected in 58.3%, 18.7%, and 39.6% of isolates, respectively. The R463L polymorphism in the katG gene and the ahpC46A were detected with high frequency in both INH-resistant and -sensitive isolates. Spoligotyping and IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns revealed that most of the isolates containing ahpC46A and katG 463Leu polymorphism belonged to the Central Asian (CAS) super family. The tight relationship between ahpC46A and katG 463Leu polymorphisms and the CAS super family highlights the importance of the CAS super family in INH resistance in Iran. In conclusion, mutations at katG codon 315 or the fabG1-inhA regulatory region were identified in 77.0% of the INH-resistant isolates and in none of the INH-sensitive strains, and are highly predictive of isoniazid resistance in Iranian isolates.",

Data suggest that Lys137 --> Asn in parC may be a primary step in the development of high-level and multiple FQ resistance. An additional mutation of Ser81 --> Phe in gyrA resulted in high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and gatifloxacin, whereas Ser79 --> Phe in parC may exert an important role in the development of moxifloxacin resistance. Two novel amino acid changes in gyrB, Ala390 --> Val and Asn423 --> Thr, were found.

A rate of 46.7% of isolates was multidrug resistant. bla genes detected were blaTEM (96.8% of amoxicillin-resistant isolates), blaCTX-M-15 (4%), overexpressed blaAmpC (4%), blaSHV-2a, blaTEM-4, blaTEM-31, and blaTEM-35 (0.7%). All tetracycline-resistant isolates (51.3%) had tetA and/or tetB genes. Sulfonamides and trimethoprim resistance genes were sul2 (60.8%), sul1 (45.9%), sul3 (6.7%), dfrA14 (25.4%), dfrA1 (18.2%), dfrA12 (16.3%), and dfrA25 (5.4%). High-level fluoroquinolone resistance (22.7%) was mediated by mutations in gyrA (S83L-D87N) and parC (S80I-E84G/V or S80I) genes. qnrB5, qnrS1, and aac(6')-Ib-cr were rare (5.3%). Class 1 and/or class 2 integrons were detected (40.7%). Isolates belonged to phylogroups B2+D (50%), A+B1 (36%), and F+C+Clade I (13%). Most of D (72.2%) and 38.6% of B2 isolates were multidrug resistant; they belong to 14 different sequence types, including international successful ST131, ST73, and ST69, reported for the first time in the community in Algeria and new ST4494 and ST4529 described in this study. Besides multidrug resistance, B2 and D isolates possessed virulence factors of colonization, invasion, and long-term persistence. The study highlighted multidrug-resistant CA-UPEC with high virulence traits and an epidemic genetic background.",

        "abstract": "Mycoplasma genitalium is an important cause of non-gonococcal urethritis, cervicitis, and related upper genital tract infections. The efficacy of doxycycline, used extensively to treat non-gonococcal urethritis in the past, is relatively poor for M. genitalium infection; azithromycin has been the preferred treatment for several years. Research on the efficacy of azithromycin has primarily focused on the 1 g single-dose regimen, but some studies have also evaluated higher doses and longer courses, particularly the extended 1.5 g regimen. This extended regimen is thought to be more efficacious than the 1 g single-dose regimen, although the regimens have not been directly compared in clinical trials. Azithromycin treatment failure was first reported in Australia and has subsequently been documented in several continents. Recent reports indicate an upward trend in the prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. genitalium infections (transmitted resistance), and cases of induced resistance following azithromycin therapy have also been documented. Emergence of antimicrobial-resistant M. genitalium, driven by suboptimal macrolide dosage, now threatens the continued provision of effective and convenient treatments. Advances in techniques to detect resistance mutations in DNA extracts have facilitated correlation of clinical outcomes with genotypic resistance. A strong and consistent association exists between presence of 23S rRNA gene mutations and azithromycin treatment failure. Fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and sitafloxacin remain highly active against most macrolide-resistant M. genitalium. However, the first clinical cases of moxifloxacin treatment failure, due to bacteria with coexistent macrolide-associated and fluoroquinolone-associated resistance mutations, were recently published by Australian investigators. Pristinamycin and solithromycin may be of clinical benefit for such multidrug-resistant infections. Further clinical studies are required to determine the optimal therapeutic dosing schedules for both agents to effect clinical cure and minimize the risk of emergent antimicrobial resistance. Continual inappropriate M. genitalium treatments will likely lead to untreatable infections in the future.",

        "abstract": "In Denmark, tetracycline resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes is frequent (>30%)  whereas macrolide resistance is low (<5%). The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic background of tetracycline- and macrolide resistance in macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes (MRSP) and to investigate the correlation between the use of macrolide and tetracycline and macrolide resistance using international data. A total of 133 MRSP isolates were received at Statens Serum Institut from nine Danish clinical microbiology laboratories between. November 2000, and November 2002. The macrolide-resistance genes, erm(B), erm(A), and mef(A) were detected in 46%, 18%, and 32% of the tested MRSP isolates, respectively. In 4% of MRSP isolates, none of the MR genes were detected. Tetracycline resistance was found in 52% of MRSP. Tetracycline resistance was encoded by either tet(M) or tet(O). erm(B) and mef(A) were associated with tet(M). Sixteen different T types were detected among the 133 MRSP. Analysis of the importance of antibiotic use for development of macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes showed no correlation with macrolide use alone (p = 0.15) but a significant correlation (p = 0.03) for the combination of macrolide and tetracycline use. The frequency of macrolide resistance in Danish S. pyogenes was low and mainly due to erm genes. A high frequency of macrolide-tetracycline coresistance in S. pyogenes is found in many countries including Denmark, hence tetracycline use must be considered as a co-factor in selection of MRSP.",

The spread of antibiotic resistance among S. aureus strains is a major concern in the treatment of staphylococcal infections. Acquisition of resistance may involve mutation of a bacterial gene on the chromosome or transfer of a resistance gene from other organisms by some form of genetic exchange (conjugation, transduction, or transformation). Completion of whole genome sequences of three methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains has provided us a bird's-eye view of the distribution of the mobile genetic elements in the bacterial chromosome that encode antibiotic resistance as well as pathogenicity in S. aureus.

All E. coli exhibited resistance to five or more antimicrobial agents, and the majority of isolates carried one or more target antimicrobial resistance gene(s) in different combinations. The majority of E. coli showed resistance to ampicillin, aztreonam, cefaclor, cephalothin, cinoxacin, and nalidixic acid, and all isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol and florfenicol. Many STEC O157:H7 and O157:H7-isolates were susceptible to amikacin, carbenicillin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, moxalactam, norfloxacin, streptomycin, tobramycin, trimethoprim, and tetracycline. The majority of STEC O157:H7 (79.8%) and O157:H7- (91.7%) carried one or more antimicrobial resistance gene(s) regardless of whether phenotypically resistant or susceptible. Four tetracycline resistant STEC O157:H7 isolates carried both tetA and tetC. Other tetracycline resistance genes (tetB, tetD, tetE, and tetG) were not detected in any of the isolates. Among nine streptomycin resistant STEC O157:H7 isolates, eight carried strA-strB along with aadA, whereas the other isolate carried aadA alone. However, the majority of tetracycline and streptomycin susceptible STEC isolates also carried tetA and aadA genes, respectively. Most ampicillin resistant E. coli of both serotypes carried ampC genes. Among sulfonamide resistance genes, sulII was detected only in STEC O157:H7 (4 of 80 sulfonamide-resistant isolates) and sulI was detected in O157:H7- (1 of 16 sulfonamide resistant isolates). The emergence and dissemination of multidrug resistance in STEC can serve as a reservoir for different antimicrobial resistance genes. Dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes to commensal and pathogenic bacteria could occur through any one of the horizontal gene transfer mechanisms adopted by the bacteria.",

        "abstract": "Food safety has been an important issue globally due to increasing foodborne diseases and change in food habits. To inactivate foodborne pathogens, various novel technologies such as biopreservation systems have been studied. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized peptides or proteins with antimicrobial activity produced by different groups of bacteria, but the bacteriocins produced by many lactic acid bacteria offer potential applications in food preservation. The use of bacteriocins in the food industry can help reduce the addition of chemical preservatives as well as the intensity of heat treatments, resulting in foods that are more naturally preserved. However, the development of highly tolerant and/or resistant strains may decrease the efficiency of bacteriocins as biopreservatives. Several mechanisms of bacteriocin resistance development have been proposed among various foodborne pathogens. The acquiring of resistance to bacteriocins can significantly affect physiological activity profile of bacteria, alter cell-envelope lipid composition, and also modify the antibiotic susceptibility/resistance profile of bacteria. This article presents a brief review on the scientific research about the various possible mechanisms involved in the development of resistance to nisin and Class IIa bacteriocins among the foodborne pathogens.",

Methods: This study evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of 1,112 isolates of Group A Streptococcus during the period from 1993 to 2009 in Curitiba city, Brazil. Macrolide-resistant isolates were characterized by emm typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Results: All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, and tigecycline. On the contrary, 18.6% of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline, presenting a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)<sub>50</sub>/MIC<sub>90</sub> of 32/64 mg/L. Erythromycin resistance rose from 1.9% before 2000 to 4% after 2000 and was associated with a marked increased of MIC levels. Simultaneously, both the phenotype and genotype of macrolide resistance were modified as the M phenotypes (mef(A) genotype) were replaced by the cMLS<sub>B</sub> phenotypes (erm(B) genotype). Conclusion: This polyclonal spreading of cMLS<sub>B</sub> macrolide resistance has not been previously observed in South America and should stimulate further epidemiological surveillance in this part of the world.",

The aim of this investigation was to examine mechanisms of carbapenem resistance and genomic diversity in carbapenem-resistant MDR strains of P. aeruginosa, which caused an outbreak among patients in Clinical Hospital Rijeka. Most of the isolates showed decreased expression of porin that is important for the entry of carbapenems (oprD). Overexpression of MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, and MexEF-OprN efflux systems was observed in many of the isolates. Production of metallo-\u03b2-lactamases was not detected. Typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis discriminated the isolates into five clusters.

        "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly generated and eliminated in the biological system, and play important roles in a variety of normal biochemical functions and abnormal pathological processes. Growing evidence suggests that cancer cells exhibit increased intrinsic ROS stress, due in part to oncogenic stimulation, increased metabolic activity, and mitochondrial malfunction. Since the mitochondrial respiratory chain (electron transport complexes) is a major source of ROS generation in the cells, the vulnerability of the mitochondrial DNA to ROS-mediated damage appears to be a mechanism to amplify ROS stress in cancer cells. The escalated ROS generation in cancer cells serves as an endogenous source of DNA-damaging agents that promote genetic instability and development of drug resistance. Malfunction of mitochondria also alters cellular apoptotic response to anticancer agents. Despite the negative impacts of increased ROS in cancer cells, it is possible to exploit this biochemical feature and develop novel therapeutic strategies to preferentially kill cancer cells through ROS-mediated mechanisms. This article reviews ROS stress in cancer cells, its underlying mechanisms and relationship with mitochondrial malfunction and alteration in drug sensitivity, and suggests new therapeutic strategies that take advantage of increased ROS in cancer cells to enhance therapeutic activity and selectivity.

A bla(TEM) gene was found in 22 of the 25 ampicillin-resistant isolates, and the gene encoding CTX-M-14 beta-lactamase was identified in the two cefotaxime-resistant isolates (recovered from a common kestrel and a sparrowhawk), associated with bla(TEM-52) gene in one of them. Other resistance genes detected were as follows: aac(3)-II or aac(3)-IV genes in all gentamicin-resistant isolates; aadA1 or aadA2 in 22 of 25 streptomycin-resistant isolates; tet(A) and/or tet(B) in all 39 tetracycline-resistant isolates; and sul1 and/or sul2 and/or sul3 genes in all 21 SXT-resistant isolates. Two amino acid changes in GyrA protein (Ser83Leu + Asp87Asn) and one change in ParC protein (Ser80Ile) were identified in all 10 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates of our series.

In this study, we used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay to investigate the prevalence of aac(6\u2032)-Ie/aph(2\u2033), ant(4\u2032)-Ia, and aph(3\u2032)-IIIa, the genes encoding the most clinically prevalent aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, and simultaneous detection of the methicillin resistance gene, mecA, in Staphylococcus aureus isolates. A total of 100 S. aureus clinical isolates were collected and tested by disk diffusion and agar dilution method for susceptibility testing. All isolates were screened for the presence of the three aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme genes and the methicillin resistance gene. The ant(4\u2032)-Ia was the most frequent gene (58%), and aac(6\u2032)-Ie/aph(2\u2033) and aph(3\u2032)-IIIa genes were found in 46% and 6% of the isolates, respectively. All isolates harboring the aac(6\u2032)-Ie/aph(2\u2033) gene were resistant to gentamicin (100% concordance). Seventy-one percent of the isolates demonstrated resistance to at least one of the aminoglycosides tested. PCR results showed that 53% of all isolates harbored the mecA gene. Aminoglycoside resistance was closely associated with oxacillin resistance (p0.05). In conclusion, because of the high rate of aminoglycoside resistance among S. aureus clinical isolates observed in this study, periodic surveillance on the resistance prevalence should be performed.",

        "abstract": "Fluoroquinolones are frequently used to treat infectious disease that is caused by Escherichia coli in dairy cattle. However, fluoroquinolone resistance occurs and is due either to chromosomal mutations in the bacterial topoisomerase genes and/or to plasmid-mediated resistance genes. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and molecular characteristics of fluoroquinolone resistance determinants in E. coli strains (n=148) isolated from dairy cattle with bovine endometritis in Inner Mongolia (China). Analysis of the mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of resistant E. coli isolates confirmed previously reported substitutions in the GyrA and ParE. However, we identified additional substitutions in the ParC and GyrB that have not been reported earlier. No plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in any of the isolates were found. The number of point mutations found per isolate correlated with an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin. Overall, 45.5% of the isolates were positive for the class I integrase gene along with four gene cassettes that were responsible for resistance to trimethoprim (dfr1 and dfrA17) and aminoglycosides (aadA1 and aadA5), respectively. The prevalence of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs) was 100%, and the blaTEM gene was predominant in all of the isolates. In conclusion, our results identify the mechanism of quinolone resistance for the first time and reveal the prevalence of integron and ESBLs in E. coli isolates from dairy cattle with bovine endometritis in China after 20 years of quinolone usage in cattle.\\n",

        "abstract": "The optimal control group for case-control studies examining antibiotics as risk factors for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance is patients selected randomly from the total hospital population, while the selection of patients with a susceptible bacterium is deemed suboptimal. We sought to theoretically elaborate on potential parameters that introduce bias associated with the use of randomly selected control subjects, based on personal experience and data from the literature. In addition, we considered parameters that introduce potential bias associated with the definition of case patients. Parameters that may introduce potential bias associated with the randomly selected control subjects are use of antibiotics in the community (background exposure), availability of an antibiotic in a country, ability to purchase specific antibiotics or health care, the bacterial resistance pattern in the country, in vitro evaluation issues, source of admitting patients (nursing home or community), type of hospital to which patients are admitted (general or disease specific), and ward of hospital to which patients are admitted. Parameters that may introduce potential bias associated with the case definition are multidrug resistance versus resistance to only one antibiotic, resistance phenotype of the microbe, multistep versus one-step development of resistance, appropriateness versus adequacy of antibiotic treatment, antibiotic synergy, details regarding the daily dose and duration of administration of the specific antibiotic, and use of other antibiotics. In conclusion, selection of control subjects from the hospital population is also associated with bias. The most acceptable solutions to evaluate the risk factors for antimicrobial resistance are probably the case-control-control study design and the case-case-control study design.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate demographic characteristics, clinical presentations and findings, and antimicrobial resistance among infants and children hospitalized in Tabriz Children's Hospital, Tabriz, Iran.\\n\\nMETHODS: In this descriptive observational study, 100 children who had been admitted with UTI diagnosis to Tabriz Children's Hospital from March 2003 to March 2008 were studied. Demographic characteristics, chief complaints, clinical presentations and findings, urine analysis and cultures, antimicrobial resistance, and sonographic and voiding cystourethrographic reports were evaluated.\\n\\nRESULTS: The mean age of patients was 35.77 \u00b1 39.86 months. The male to female ratio was 0.26. The mean white blood cell count was 12,900 \u00b1 5226/mm(3). Sixty-two percent of patients had leukocytosis. The most common isolated pathogen was Escherichia coli spp (77%) followed by Klebsiella spp (10%), Enterobacter spp (9%), and Enterococcus spp (4%). Isolated pathogens were highly resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and cephalexin (71%-96%), intermediate sensitivity to third-generation cephalosporins, and highly sensitive to ciprofloxacin (84.4%), amikacin (83.8%), and nitrofurantoin (82.8%).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The most common pathogen of UTI in the hospitalized children was E. coli spp. The isolated pathogens were extremely resistant to ampicillin, and highly sensitive to ciprofloxacin and amikacin.",

In vitro, the growth rate of the susceptible (wild type) and resistant (mutant) strains did not differ when cultured separately. However, by conducting sequential passages of mixed cultures, the ratio of the resistant mutant to the susceptible strain decreased for C. coli but not for C. jejuni. When the wild type and the mutant were co-inoculated on food matrices, mutants were no longer detectable 3 to 5 days after artificial contamination, but the wild-type strains remained detectable for over 13 days. In mono-inoculated animals, no difference was observed between wild-type and mutant fecal titers. When co-inoculated into chickens, the susceptible strain outcompeted the resistant mutant for C. coli and for C. jejuni. However, for C. coli, if the resistant strain was already present in animals, it could persist at high titers in the digestive tract even in the presence of the wild-type strain. Together, these findings suggest that, depending on strain and study conditions, fluoroquinolone resistance can impose a fitness cost on Campylobacter.\\n",

        "abstract": "Little is known about the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance determinants in staphylococci isolated from food and food processing industries. Quaternary ammonium compound (QAC)-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolated from food and food-processing industries were investigated for the presence of genetic determinants (qacA/B and qacC/smr) encoding resistance to the QAC benzalkonium chloride (BC), several antibiotic resistance genes, and staphylococcal insertion sequences IS257 and IS256. Six qacA/B-harboring strains were resistant to penicillin and hybridized to a blaZ probe. The qacA/B and blaZ probes hybridized to plasmids of similar size in three isolates. Molecular and genetic characterization of the 23-kb plasmid (pST6) of Staphylococcus epidermidis St.6 revealed the presence of qacB adjacent to an incomplete beta-lactamase transposon Tn552 encoding the gene cluster blaZ, blaR, and blaI. Sequence analysis of flanking regions and the intergenic region between blaZ and qacB revealed the presence of IS257 downstream of blaZ as well as sin and binR between blaZ and qacB. In the three other BC and penicillin-resistant strains, the qacA/B and blaZ genes were located on separate plasmids. A qacC harboring S. epidermidis strain (St.17) also hybridized to tetK (tetracycline resistance) and ermB (erythromycin resistance) genes. The individual genes were located on separate plasmids, suggesting no linkage between QAC and antibiotic resistance determinants. Plasmid-free Staphylococcus aureus RN4220 allowed uptake of the pST6 plasmid DNA, indicating that the resistance genes could potentially be transferred to pathogens under selective stress. In conclusion, presence of both resistance determinants could lead to co-selection during antimicrobial therapy or disinfection in hospitals or in food industries.",

        "abstract": "To understand the mechanisms and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (AR), the genetic elements responsible must be identified. Due to the myriad of possible genes, a high-density genotyping technique is needed for initial screening. To achieve this, AR genes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database were identified by their annotations and compiled into a nonredundant list of 775 genes. A DNA microarray was constructed of 70mer oligonucelotide probes designed to detect these genes encoding resistances to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicols, glycopeptides, heavy metals, lincosamides, macrolides, metronidazoles, polyketides, quaternary ammonium compounds, streptogramins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprims as well as resistance transfer genes. The microarray was validated with two fully sequenced control strains of Salmonella enterica: Typhimurium LT2 (sensitive) and Typhi CT18 (multidrug resistance [MDR]). All resistance genes encoded on the MDR plasmid, pHCM1, harbored by CT18 were detected in that strain, whereas no resistance genes were detected in LT2. The microarray was also tested with a variety of bacteria, including MDR Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria spp., and Clostridium difficile. The results presented here demonstrate that a microarray can be designed to detect virtually all AR genes found in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, thus reducing the subsequent assays necessary to identify specific resistance gene alleles.",

The purpose of this study was to determine phenotypic, genotypic, and epidemiologic characteristics of 175 S. Typhimurium DT104 strains isolated from food-producing animals in Canada. More than 90% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin (Amp), chloramphenicol (Chl), florfenicol (Flo), sulfisoxazole (Sul), and tetracycline (Tet), 53% of the isolates were additionally resistant to spectinomycin (Spc) and streptomycin (Str), and 28% to kanamycin (Kan) and neomycin (Neo). Sixty-one percent of the strains harbored a single 60-MDa plasmid, 21% contained 60- and 2.0-MDa plasmids, and 4% had 60, 4.6- and 2.0-MDa plasmids. Resistance to Kan and Neo was encoded by the aminoglycoside aphA-1 gene on 2.0-MDa plasmids, whereas resistance to trimethoprim (Tmp) and Sul was encoded by the dhfrIb gene on 4.6-MDa plasmids. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) showed the presence of integrons with the ant (3\")-Ia aminoglycoside adenyltransferase and the bla(PSE-1) beta-lactamase gene cassettes, and the presence of the flost gene in all but one strain resistant to Spc and Str, Amp, and Chl and Flo, respectively. DT104 isolates from cattle at six feedlots represented a separate clone; they were sensitive to Str and Spc and lacked the ant (3\")-Ia gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using Bln I, Spe I, and Xba I resulted in 15, 12, and 8 PFGE patterns, respectively. In summary, we observed considerable diversity in phenotypic, genotypic, and epidemiological characteristics among the DT104 isolates.",

The bacterial isolates were identified by cultural characteristics, Gram stain, biochemical tests, and screened for the presence of E. coli O157:H7 serotype. Bacterial E. coli isolates were investigated for hemolysin production, biofilm formation, and \u03b2-lactamase production. Antibiotics susceptibility and plasmid content were determined.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of ten clinical and ten water E. coli isolates were studied. Results showed that all E. coli isolates give negative results for latex O157:H7. Virulence factors analysis showed that 6/10 water isolates and 2/10 clinical isolates were hemolytic, 5/10 water isolates and 3/10 clinical isolates were biofilm formation, and 7/10 water isolates and 4/10 clinical isolates were \u03b2-lactamase producer. Antibiotics profile showed that all bacterial isolates were multidrug resistant. All E. coli isolates (100%) were resistant to carbenicillin, cefodizime, imipenem, and piperacillin. The plasmid DNA analysis showed that all E. coli isolates contained plasmid with molecular weight range between 4.507 kbp and 5.07 kbp, but clinical isolates contained multiple small and mega plasmids.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our study revealed that E. coli isolates from river water exhibit a higher level of hemolysin production, \u03b2-lactamase production, and biofilm formation than feces isolates may be due to long adaptation. On the other hand, clinical E. coli isolates from feces showed higher level of antibiotic resistance and have multiple plasmids.",

Six (9.0%) S. Dublin isolates from 1996, four (4.2%) from 1997, and one (1.7%) from 1998 were resistant to nalidixic acid. Resistance was not observed among isolates from cattle in 1999.

All the nalidixic acid-resistant isolates had reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. Sequence analysis of the gyrA gene in 37 nalidixic-resistant isolates identified two different base substitutions at codon serine-83 and two at aspartate-87. The base substitutions in serine-83 were TCC (Ser)->TAC (Tyr), and TCC (Ser)->TTC (Phe). The base substitutions in aspartic -87 were GAC (Asp)->AAC (Asn), and GAC (Asp)->GGC (Gly). Sequence analysis of the gyrB and parC genes revealed no mutations in 27 selected isolates. This study showed that quinolone-resistant isolates have emerged in recent years among food-producing animals, especially among S.

PCR and sequencing were performed to identify mu- tations in gyrA, gyrB, parC, the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump regulator, acrR, and the global regulons marRAB and soxRS. All resistant strains showed mutations in the target genes leading to amino acid changes of Ser83Phe and Asp87Asn in GyrA and Ser80Ile in ParC. A mutation in gyrB was linked to the serotype genetic diver- sity but not to fluoroquinolone resistance. An efflux pump inhibitor, Phe-Arg-?-naphthylamide, caused four- fold lower MIC of ciprofloxacin in the resistant isolates, indicating that efflux systems are involved in fluoroquinolone resistance. Western blot analysis showed moderate overproduction of AcrA in fluoro- quinolone-resistant isolates. A mutation in acrR gave rise to an internal stop codon in both ciprofloxacin-re- sistant and -susceptible isolates, suggesting another serotype genetic diversity. No mutations were detected in marRAB and soxRS among the isolates examined. Cross-resistance to three fluoroquinolones was observed, but gatifloxacin demonstrated relatively lower MICs than those of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Fluoro- quinolone resistance in S. Choleraesuis appears to be the combination effect of multiple mutations in various target genes and overexpression of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump.",

A real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer PCR assay using a melting curve analysis was developed to identify these two point mutations and the wild-type genotype in thermophilic Campylobacter species such as C. coli, C. jejuni, and C. lari. Concerning these species, 141 strains were tested and a result obtained in 140 (99.3%). A single genotype was detected in 133 cases and two genotypes in seven cases. There was an agreement with the phenotypic methods except for one C. coli strain that was not amplified during the PCR assay. The A2075G mutation was mainly found among the 92 resistant strains tested (95.6%) and the A2074C mutation only twice (2.2%). One C. jejuni strain (1.1%) harbored both mutations on the same 23S rDNA copy. When compared to the phenotypic tests, the new real-time PCR assay was able to detect the correct genotype, in all cases except one (1.1%). This assay is more sensitive and more rapid than other PCR assays, the entire procedure taking less than 2 hr.",

The USA300 characteristically harbors Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) genes and the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME, type I). Prevalence and molecular characteristics of PVL(+) and/or ACME(+) S. aureus were investigated in a university hospital located in northern Japan, for 1,366 S. aureus isolates, including 601 MRSA strains derived from clinical specimens collected from 2008 to 2010. The PVL gene was identified in three MRSA strains with SCCmec IV, which belonged to ST8, spa type t008, coagulase type III, and agr type I. Two PVL-positive MRSA strains had also type I ACME, and were isolated from skin abscess of outpatients who have not travelled abroad recently. One of these PVL(+)/ACME(+) strains carried tet(K), msrA, and aph(3')-IIIa, showing resistance to kanamycin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin, suggesting acquisition of more resistance than ST8 CA-MRSA reported in Japan previously. In contrast, another PVL(+)/ACME(+) strain and a PVL(+)/ACME(-) strain were susceptible to more antimicrobials and had less virulence factors than PVL(-)/ACME(+) MRSA strains. Besides the two PVL(+) MRSA strains, ACME (type-\u0394II) was identified into seven MRSA strains with SCCmec II belonging to ST5, one of the three spa types (t002, t067, and t071), coagulase type II, and agr type II. These PVL(-)/ACME(+) MRSA strains showed multiple drug resistance and harbored various toxin genes as observed for ST5 PVL(-)/ACME(-) MRSA-II. The present study suggested the spread of ST8-MRSA-IV in northern Japan, and a potential significance of ACME-positive ST5-MRSA-II as an emerging MRSA clone in a hospital.",

One hundred thirty-eight CTX-M-producing E. coli isolates were subjected to fosfomycin susceptibility testing. The presence of acquired fosfomycin resistance genes such as fosA, fosA3, and fosC2 was explored, and the transmissibility of fosfomycin resistance, replicon type of plasmid, and genetic environment of fosA3 were investigated. Eight isolates (5.8%) showed resistance to fosfomycin, five of which harbored fosA3, which was in genetic linkage with blaCTX-M. The replicon types of the five transferred fosA3-carrying plasmids were as follows: IncI1 (n=2), IncN (n=1), and IncFII (n=2). Each fosA3 gene was located close to the blaCTX-M gene and was flanked by IS26 elements. These genetic environments of fosA3 in E. coli from healthy individuals were quite similar to those observed in the clinical and veterinary settings. Our results indicate that fosA3 genes possibly inserted by small mobile genetic elements flanked by two IS26 elements have already spread throughout the plasmids along with the blaCTX-M genes of commensal E. coli colonizing in healthy Japanese people.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are frequently used among people with sickle cell anemia (homozygous SS or HbSS disease), especially for prophylaxis. However, the relationship between antibiotic resistance and people with HbSS disease has not been adequately studied, especially in the developing world. The objectives of the study were (1) to compare antibiotic resistance patterns of nasal Staphylococcus aureus between children with HbSS disease and children without HbSS disease (healthy children) and (2) to evaluate nasopharyngeal carriage of antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae among children with HbSS disease.\\n\\nMETHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study, and the subjects were children under 12 years old. Nasal swabs were collected from 50 children with HbSS disease and 50 children without HbSS disease. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from another group of 92 children with HbSS disease. The nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs were cultured for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, respectively. Susceptibility testing was carried out on the S. aureus and S. pneumoniae isolates for various antibiotics, including penicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, erythromycin, cloxacillin, and cotrimoxazole.\\n\\nRESULTS: The carriage rates of S. aureus among pediatric subjects with HbSS disease and those without HbSS disease were 48% and 50%, respectively (P > 0.05). S. pneumoniae carriage among the pediatric subjects with HbSS disease was 10%. Antibiotic resistance patterns of S. aureus carried by children with HbSS disease and children without HbSS disease were similar, and the S. aureus resistance rates were >40% for the various antibiotics, with the exception of erythromycin and cloxacillin. Low levels of S. pneumoniae resistance (0%-11%) were observed for the various antibiotics tested except cotrimoxazole, which showed an extremely high-percentage resistance (100%).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Sickling status is not a risk factor for carriage of S. aureus. In this cohort of Ghanaian children with HbSS disease, S. aureus is higher in carriage and more antibiotic-resistant, compared to S. pneumoniae.",

Here, we review the most recent studies investigating how tumour-associated fibroblasts and macrophages as well as the extracellular matrix itself may be targeted to facilitate delivery of both low-molecular weight drugs and macromolecules. In addition, we summarize the current understanding of the use of vasoactive compounds, radiotherapy and vascular-disrupting agents as potential adjuvants to maximize tumour delivery of anti-cancer drugs. The impact of these strategies on the diffusive and convective modes of drug transport is discussed in the light of Fick's and Starling's laws. Finally, we discuss how transcytosis through caveolae may also be exploited to optimize the selective delivery of conventional chemotherapy to the subendothelial tumour cell compartment. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Seventy-nine chickens were contaminated with only one Salmonella serotype, 10 with two different serotypes, and 1 with four serotypes. The most prevalent serotypes were Enteritidis (47 strains) and Hadar (29 strains). The isolates were tested for their susceptibilities to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, gentamicin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethazole by disk diffusion assay. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, sulfonamides, and nalidixic acid were determined for the resistant strains by agar dilution method. Eleven isolates (10.7%) of the 103 tested were susceptible to all antimicrobials. Resistance was most observed to tetracycline (84.5%), streptomycin (44.7%), and nalidixic acid (34%). Forty-one isolates (39.8%) were multidrug resistant (resistant to three or more antimicrobials from different classes), of which 68.3% were Hadar and 21.9% Enteritidis. The most frequent resistant pattern in Hadar was streptomycin-tetracycline-nalidixic acid. These results highlight once more the need for surveillance of Salmonella contamination in poultry.\\n",

Susceptibility profiles showed that 56 (67%) of these isolates exhibited multiple drug resistance (MDR). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed that 73% of these resistant isolates were clustered into three predominant PFGE types: 6, 7, and 36. This suggested that the high number of isolates exhibiting MDR phenotypes observed in the hospital is, to some extent, due to the spread of these three resistant clones. Class 1 integrase genes were detected in all MDR isolates belonging to PFGE type 6, most MDR isolates belonging to PFGE type 7 and none of the isolates belonging to PFGE type 36. Five different class 1 gene cassette arrays, dfrA1-orfC, bla(IMP-14)-aac6', aacA4-catB8-aadA1, aacC1-orfX-orfX'-aadA1a, and aacC1-orfX-orfX-orfX'-aadA1a, were identified, of which the bla(IMP-14)-aac6' array has only been found in Thai isolates.

The 4 Salmonella serotypes lacked virulence genes gipA and spvC. Resistance to 7 of the 14 antimicrobials was detected. The frequency of resistance, to lincomycin and streptomycin (100% of the Salmonella Muenster [2/5], Salmonella Florian [1/5], Salmonella Omuna [1/5], and Salmonella Noya [1/5] isolates), chloramphenicol (100% of the Salmonella Muenster [2/5] and Salmonella Florian [1/5] isolates) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (100% of the Salmonella Florian [1/5] and Salmonella Omuna [1/5] isolates) was an outstanding feature.

In the field strains of ORT that were either less susceptible or, occasionally, resistant to enrofloxacin, point mutations had occurred in amino acids at positions 83 (serine) or 87 (aspartic acid) of the GyrA subunit. In the isolates showing reduced susceptibility following experimental enrofloxacin treatment (increase in MIC from < or =0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml), molecular analysis revealed a constantly recurring point mutation (G-->T) at nucleic acid position 646 (E. coli numbering) of gyrA resulting in an amino acid change from aspartic acid to tyrosine at position 87 of the GyrA subunit, which is a known hot spot for fluoroquinolone resistance. This study indicates that a single course of enrofloxacin treatment may contribute to the selection of the first mutant with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility in ORT. Acquired fluoroquinolone resistance is commonly encountered in ORT isolates. This is the first time that the causal mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance in ORT has been investigated.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalent serogroups and antibiotic resistance of NTS in our region. METHODS: We reviewed the serogroup distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of NTS strains obtained from 158 stool specimens of patients with acute diarrheal infection attending the outpatient and inpatient department at a university hospital in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia in the period from September, 2008 to April, 2011. A retrospective analysis of the 158 patients with NTS infection was conducted to determine the most prevalent NTS serogroups causing acute gastroenteritis and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. RESULTS: At this teaching hospital, a total of 17,436 fecal samples were analyzed during the 2008-2011 study period. Of these specimens, 158 tested positive for NTS, giving an overall prevalence of 9.06 per 1,000. Of 158 NTS cases, serogroup D1 (25.3%) was the most prevalent, followed by serogroup B (19.6%), and serogroup C1 (18.9). One third of all NTS serogroup strains tested were resistant to tetracycline. The NTS strains showed resistance to ampicillin (31.3%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (29.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (20.9%), and cefotaxime (14.93%). CONCLUSION: The findings of this study support the concern that use of antibiotics in animal feeds may contribute to acquisition of resistance in food-borne bacteria, such as Salmonella. Our study also concludes that the prevalence of NTS in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia is very low compared with other studies worldwide.",

It interferes with critical processes in the bacterial cell such as DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination by inhibiting bacterial topoisomerases. Levofloxacin has broad spectrum activity against several causative bacterial pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Oral levofloxacin is rapidly absorbed and is bioequivalent to the intravenous formulation such that patients can be conveniently transitioned between these formulations when moving from the inpatient to the outpatient setting. Furthermore, levofloxacin demonstrates excellent safety, and has good tissue penetration maintaining adequate concentrations at the site of infection. The efficacy and tolerability of levofloxacin 500 mg once daily for 10 days in patients with CAP are well established. Furthermore, a high-dose (750 mg) and short-course (5 days) of once-daily levofloxacin has been approved for use in the US in the treatment of CAP, acute bacterial sinusitis, acute pyelonephritis, and complicated urinary tract infections. The high-dose, short-course levofloxacin regimen maximizes its concentration-dependent antibacterial activity, decreases the potential for drug resistance, and has better patient compliance.",

Selected strains studied carried several mutations in the quinolone target genes, i.e., a double mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of gyrA leading to amino acid changes Ser83Ala and Asp87Asn, a single mutation in the QRDR of gyrB leading to amino acid change Ser464Phe, and a single mutation in the QRDR of parC leading to amino acid change Ser80Ile. Moreover, Western blot analysis showed overproduction of the AcrA periplasmic protein belonging to the AcrAB-ToIC efflux system. This suggested active efflux as additional resistance mechanism resulting in a multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) phenotype, which was measurable by an increased level of resistance to the structurally unrelated antibiotic florfenicol in the absence of the specific floR resistance gene. The importance of the AcrAB-TolC efflux system in high-level fluoroquinolone resistance was further confirmed by inactivating the acrB gene coding for the multidrug transporter. This resulted in a 32-fold reduction of resistance level to Enr (MIC = 2 microg/ml) and actually in a susceptible phenotype according to clinical breakpoints. Thus, AcrB plays a major role in high-level fluoroquinolone resistance, even when multiple target gene mutations are present. The same effect was obtained using the recently identified efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) Phe-Arg-naphthylamide also termed MC207,110. Among several fluoroquinolones tested in combination with EPI, the MIC of Enr was reduced most significantly. Thus, using EPI together with fluoroquinolones such as Enr may be promising in combination therapy against high-level fluoroquinolone-resistant S. enterica serovar Typhimurium.",

We examined 621 strains of 67 different serovars isolated in 1994, a total of 721 strains of 75 different serovars isolated in 1995, one thousand two hundred nineteen strains of 83 different serovars isolated in 1996 and 1336 Salmonella strains of 92 different serovars isolated in 1997, for resistance to 17 antibiotics at one to three different concentrations with the agar dilution method. The overall resistance magnitude regressed from 9.2% in 1994 to 8.1% in 1997. Resistance to streptomycin (30.4% of 3897 isolates), tetracycline (27.3%), and sulfisoxazole (23.7%) was highest. Resistance to streptomycin, tetracycline, kanamycin, and gentamicin declined during the 4-year period. Notable increases in resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and neomycin occurred during the 1994-97 years. None of the isolates was resistant to amikacin. None of the isolates was resistant to ciprofloxacin at 1, 2, and 4 \u00b5g/ml. S. bredeney isolates from turkeys showed a decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and were resistant at the low level of 0.125 \u00b5g/ml, but none of these isolates was resistant at 1 \u00b5g/ml. Resistance to nalidixic acid correlated significantly with decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin; 122 of 127 (96%) isolates resistant to nalidixic acid at 32 \u00b5g/ml were resistant to ciprofloxacin at 0.125 \u00b5g/ml but sensitive at 1 \u00b5g/ml. Resistance to S. typhimurium to each of the seven antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline increased persistently during each of the years 1994-1997, but none of the S. typhimurium isolates showed decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. Clinical isolates of Salmonella were twice as frequently resistant to the antimicrobials in the test panel than isolates obtained during surveys. Salmonella isolates from turkeys were more frequently resistant than isolates from pigs, cattle, and chickens.",

        "abstract": "Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are widely used biocides that possess antimicrobial effect against a broad range of microorganisms. These compounds are used for numerous industrial purposes, water treatment, antifungal treatment in horticulture, as well as in pharmaceutical and everyday consumer products as preserving agents, foam boosters, and detergents. Resistance toward QACs is widespread among a diverse range of microorganisms and is facilitated by several mechanisms such as modifications in the membrane composition, expression of stress response and repair systems, or expression of efflux pump genes. Development of resistance in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria has been related to application in human medicine and the food industry. QACs in cosmetic products will inevitably come into intimate contact with the skin or mucosal linings in the mouth and thus are likely to add to the selection pressure toward more QAC-resistant microorganisms among the skin or mouth flora. There is increasing evidence of coresistance and cross-resistance between QACs and a range of other clinically important antibiotics and disinfectants. Use of QACs may have driven the fixation and spread of certain resistance cassette collectors (class 1 integrons), currently responsible for a major part of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria. More indiscriminate use of QACs such as in cosmetic products may drive the selection of further new genetic elements that will aid in the persistence and spread of antimicrobial resistance and thus in limiting our treatment options for microbial infections.",

Any of the TC(R) genes was detected in 75.9% of all the enterococcal strains. The tet(M) was detected at highest rates in both E. faecalis (75.0%) and E. faecium (69.6%), followed by tet(L), which was harbored in 6.7% of E. faecalis isolates and 30.4% of E. faecium isolates. The tet(O), tet(S), and tet(T) were detected in E. faecalis at low frequencies mostly associated with tet(M), while tet(K) and tet(U) were not detected. Nucleotide sequences of tet(S) from E. faecalis strains were identical to that reported in Listeria monocytogenes. Sequences of tet(O) from two E. faecalis strains were almost identical to each other and also to those from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli, although minor sequence divergence was observed. The tet(T), which had been reported only in Streptococcus pyogenes, was found in five E. faecalis strains. Sequence of the enterococcal tet(T) differed from that of S. pyogenes by only four nucleotides (four amino acids) and showed high sequence identity (99.8%, amino acid level).

        "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is the most prevalent penta-resistant serovar isolated from animals by the U.S. National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System. Penta-resistant isolates are often resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. To investigate MDR in Salmonella Typhimurium (including variant 5-), one isolate each from cattle, poultry, and swine with at least the ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline phenotype were selected for each year from 1997 to 2007 (n = 33) for microarray analysis of antimicrobial resistance, incompatibility IncA/C, and HI1 plasmid genes. Cluster analysis based on these data separated 31 of the isolates into two groups A and B (15 and 16 isolates, respectively). Isolates in group A were phage type DT104 or U302 and were mostly swine isolates (7/15). Genes detected included intI1, bla(PSE-1), floR, aadA, sulI, tet(G), and tetR, which are often found in Salmonella Genomic Island I. Isolates in group B had numerous IncA/C plasmid genes detected and were mostly cattle isolates (9/16). Genes detected included bla(CMY-2), floR, aac(3), aadA, aphA1, strA, strB, sulI, sulII, dfrA, dhf, tet(A)(B)(C)(D), and tetR, which are often found on MDR-AmpC IncA/C plasmids. The IncA/C replicon was also detected in all group B isolates. The two remaining isolates did not cluster with any others and both had many HI1 plasmid genes detected. Linkage disequilibrium analysis detected significant associations between plasmid replicon type, phage type, and animal source. These data suggest that MDR in Salmonella Typhimurium is associated with DT104/Salmonella Genomic Island I or IncA/C MDR-AmpC encoding plasmids and these genetic elements have persisted throughout the study period.",

Thus, we performed a case-control study to evaluate risk factors for MDR among nosocomial bacteremia caused by ESBL-EK. All adult patients with ESBL-EK bacteremia from January 2009 through December 2010 were identified at our institution. MDR was defined as ESBL-EK that demonstrated in vitro resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), fluoroquinolone (FQ), and gentamicin. Case patients were those with an MDR ESBL-EK isolate, and control patients were those with a non-MDR ESBL-EK isolate. Among a total of 123 ESBL-EK isolates (74 [60.2%] E. coli and 49 [39.8%] K. pneumoniae) causing nosocomial bacteremia, 33 (26.8%) cases were due to MDR ESBL-EK. In a univariate analysis, the factors significantly associated with acquisition of MDR ESBL-EK were neutropenia, immunosuppressant use, urinary tract infection, and prior use of antibiotics, especially FQ (all p<0.05). A multivariable analysis showed that a prior receipt of FQ (odds ratio [OR]=2.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.07-8.01; p=0.036), percutaneous tube insertion (OR=4.04; 95% CI=1.56-10.75; p=0.005), and neutropenia (OR=4.22; 95% CI=1.56-11.45; p=0.005) were independent risk factors for MDR among ESBL-EK bacteremia in hospitalized patients. The CTX-M-15 enzyme was predominant in both the MDR ESBL-EK and non-MDR ESBL-EK groups (55% [11/20] vs. 55.6% [15/27]). Our data suggest that strategies designed to reduce MDR in ESBL-EK bacteremia should focus on limiting the use of FQ and minimizing invasive procedures such as tube insertion.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is not a matter of if but of when. Recently, azoles have been recommended for long-term prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections; hence, it could be argued that fungi also will become resistant to these agents. However, fungi are different from bacteria in several critical points. Bacteria display several resistance mechanisms: alteration of the target, limited access to the target and modification/inactivation of the antibacterial compound. In fungi some mechanisms of resistance to azoles are also known; with azoles for example, alterations of the 14??-demethylase target, as well as efflux pumps. It has been observed that these phenotypes develop in yeast populations either due to mutations or to selection processes. However, enzymes which destroy azoles are not found. Furthermore, a horizontal transfer of genes coding resistance traits does not occur in fungi, which means that an explosive expansion of resistances is unlikely to occur, especially in moulds. Indeed, in epidemiologic studies on human and environmental isolates there is convincing evidence that azole resistance is quite uncommon. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The mechanisms involved in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) are integrated in concert with master developmental and oncogenic pathways regulating in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, as well as the reprogrammation of specific gene repertoires ascribed to both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Consequently, it is not unexpected that EMT has profound impacts on the neoplastic progression, patient survival, as well as the resistance of cancers to therapeutics (taxol, vincristine, oxaliplatin, EGF-R targeted therapy and radiotherapy), independent of the \"classical\" resistance mechanisms linked to genotoxic drugs. New therapeutic combinations using genotoxic agents and/or EMT signaling inhibitors are therefore expected to circumvent the chemotherapeutic resistance of cancers characterized by transient or sustained EMT signatures. Thus, targeting critical orchestrators at the convergence of several EMT pathways, such as the transcription pathways NF-\u03baB, AKT/mTOR axis, MAPK, \u03b2-catenin, PKC and the AP-1/SMAD factors provide a realistic strategy to control EMT and the progression of human epithelial cancers. Several inhibitors targeting these signaling platforms are already tested in preclinical and clinical oncology. In addition, upstream EMT signaling pathways induced by receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. EGF-R, IGF-R, VEGF-R, integrins/FAK, Src) and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) constitute practical options under preclinical research, clinical trials or are currently used in the clinic for cancer treatment: e.g. small molecule inhibitors (Iressa: targeting selectively the EGF-R; CP-751,871, AMG479, NVP-AEW541, BMS-536924, PQIP, AG1024: IGF-R; AZD2171, ZD6474: VEGF-R; AZD0530, BMS-354825, SKI606: Src; BIM-46174: GPCR; rapamycin, CCI-779, RAD-001: mTOR) and humanized function blocking antibodies (Herceptin: ErbB2; Avastin: VEGF-A; Erbitux: EGF-R; Abegrin: \u03b1v\u03b23 integrins). We can assume that silencing RNA and adenovirus-based gene transfer of therapeutic miR and dominant interferring expression vectors targeting EMT pathways and signaling elements will bring additional ways for the treatment of epithelial cancers. Identification of the factors that initiate, modulate and effectuate EMT signatures and their underlying upstream oncogenic pathways should provide the basis of more efficient strategies to fight cancer progression as well as genetic and epigenetic forms of drug resistance. This goal can be accomplished using global screening of human clinical tumors by EMT-associated cDNA, proteome, miRome, and tissue arrays. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This is particularly true for the anticoccidial agents used for the prevention of coccidiosis caused by protozoa of the apicomplexan genus Eimeria in poultry. Resistance has been documented for all the dozen or so drugs approved for use in chickens and varying levels of resistance is present for those currently employed. A possible solution may be the introduction of drug-sensitive parasites into the houses where poultry are raised so that they may replace such drug-resistant organisms. This can be achieved by utilizing live vaccines that contain strains of Eimeria that were isolated before most anticoccidial compounds were introduced. Such strains are inherently drug-sensitive. Practical proposals to achieve this objective involve the alternation of vaccination with medication (known as rotation programs) in successive flocks reared in the same poultry house. A proposal for a yearly broiler production cycle involving chemotherapy and vaccination is presented. There are few, if any, examples in veterinary parasitology where it has proved possible to restore sensitivity to drugs used to control a widespread parasite. Further research is necessary to ascertain whether this can result in sustainable and long-term control of Eimeria infections in poultry.",

        "abstract": "Agents targeting EGFR and related ErbB family proteins are valuable therapies for the treatment of many cancers. For some tumor types, including squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN), antibodies targeting EGFR were the first protein-directed agents to show clinical benefit, and remain a standard component of clinical strategies for management of the disease. Nevertheless, many patients display either intrinsic or acquired resistance to these drugs; hence, major research goals are to better understand the underlying causes of resistance, and to develop new therapeutic strategies that boost the impact of EGFR/ErbB inhibitors. In this review, we first summarize current standard use of EGFR inhibitors in the context of SCCHN, and described new agents targeting EGFR currently moving through pre-clinical and clinical development. We then discuss how changes in other transmembrane receptors, including IGF1R, c-Met, and TGF-??, can confer resistance to EGFR-targeted inhibitors, and discuss new agents targeting these proteins. Moving downstream, we discuss critical EGFR-dependent effectors, including PLC-??; PI3K and PTEN; SHC, GRB2, and RAS and the STAT proteins, as factors in resistance to EGFR-directed inhibitors and as alternative targets of therapeutic inhibition. We summarize alternative sources of resistance among cellular changes that target EGFR itself, through regulation of ligand availability, post-translational modification of EGFR, availability of EGFR partners for hetero-dimerization and control of EGFR intracellular trafficking for recycling versus degradation. Finally, we discuss new strategies to identify effective therapeutic combinations involving EGFR-targeted inhibitors, in the context of new system level data becoming available for analysis of individual tumors. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Maintenance of both normal epithelial tissues and their malignant counterparts is supported by the host tissue stroma. The tumor stroma mainly consists of the basement membrane, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, immune cells, and vasculature. Although most host cells in the stroma possess certain tumor-suppressing abilities, the stroma will change during malignancy and eventually promote growth, invasion, and metastasis. There is growing evidence that the stroma influences importantly the response to radiation therapy (RT). On the one hand, irradiation releases numerous inflammatory cytokines within the extracellular matrix and activates tumor specific antigens presentation, triggering an immune reaction that contributes to the antitumor effect seen after RT. On the other hand, the stroma significantly contributes to radioresistance but also increases the metastatic risk. Indeed, fibroblasts, which are major actors of the impact of stroma on tumor response, are involved in activation of autocrine and paracrine molecular signaling pathways regulating tumor cell proliferation, cell death, response to hypoxia, DNA repair systems and mesenchymal-epithelial transition. They are also actors of the peritumoral desmoplastic reaction, which decreases tumor radiosensitivity. The irradiated stroma can also contribute to tumor relapse after RT through recruitment of bone marrow-derived progenitors that contribute to local tumor relapse through neovascularization. It is therefore time to question preclinical models that would not take into account this impact of stroma. The increasing knowledge of the relationship between stroma and response to IR could help developing innovative strategies for potentially improve antitumor effect of RT. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "The EGFR has been targeted through the development of selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that have proven effective in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, many bearing gain-of-function EGFR mutations or egfr gene amplification. However, the majority (\u223c80-90%) of NSCLC patients do not respond to EGFR-specific TKIs and a high rate of acquired resistance to these therapeutics is observed in those that do respond. Thus, EGFR-specific TKIs will not, as single agents, make a high impact on overall lung cancer survival. A number of studies support the activities of other receptor tyrosine kinase pathways including cMet, IGF-1R and FGFRs as mechanisms for both intrinsic and acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. While the role of cMet and IGF-1R signaling systems as mechanisms of resistance to EGFR TKIs has been widely reviewed in recent years, the potential role of FGFR-dependent signaling as a mechanism for EGFR TKI resistance has more recently emerged and will be highlighted herein. Due to the high degree of homology of FGFRs with VEGFRs and PDGFRs, FGFR-active TKIs already exist via development of VEGFR-targeted TKIs as angiogenesis inhibitors. Thus, these agents could be rapidly advanced into clinical investigations as FGFR inhibitors, either alone or in combination with TKIs selective for EGFR, cMet or IGF-1R as a means to expand the spectrum of NSCLC patients that can be effectively targeted with TKI-directed therapies. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Genes were identified to variant level by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis or sequencing. qnrA1, qnrB2, qnrB4, qnrB6, qnrB9, qnrS1, and the new qnrB variant qnrB26 were detected in 31 strains from six genera (Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Shigella spp., and Citrobacter spp.), four of which contained double qnr genes. Other PMQR genes, aac(6)-Ib-cr and qepA, were found in 12 (38.7%) and 5 (16.1%) of 31 isolates, respectively; while qepA was found in Shigella spp. for the first time. Eight types of -lactamase genes and eight other types of resistance genes were also present in the 31 qnr-positive isolates. The detection rate for five -lactamase genes (bla(TEM), bla(CTX), ampR, bla(DHA), and bla(SHV)) was >45%. Class 1 integrons and complex class 1 integrons were prevalent in these strains, which contained 15 different gene cassette arrays and 5 different insertion sequence common region 1 (ISCR1)-mediated downstream structures. qnrA1, qnrB2, and qnrB6 were present in three ISCR1-mediated downstream structures: qnrA1-ampR, sapA-like-qnrB2, and sdr-qnrB6. We also analyzed the horizontal transferability of PMQR genes and other resistance determinants. The qnr genes and some integrons and resistance genes from 18 (58.1%) of the 31 qnr-positive strains could be transferred to E. coli J53 Azi(R) or E. coli DH5 recipient strains using conjugation or transformation methods. The results showed that a high number of qnr genes were associated with other resistance genes in aquatic environments in Jinan. This suggests that we should avoid over-using antibiotics and monitor aquatic environments to control the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.",

        "abstract": "High-level antiseptic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus is mediated by multidrug efflux pumps encoded by qacA and qacB genes. We investigated distribution and genomic diversity of these antiseptic resistance genes in a total of 522 clinical strains of S. aureus isolated recently in a Japanese hospital. The qacA/B gene was detected in 32.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 7.5% of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), whereas the low-level resistance gene smr, which was examined simultaneously, was detected at lower frequencies in both MRSA (3.3%) and MSSA (5.9%). Epidemiologic typing of S. aureus isolates suggested that higher prevalence of qacA/B in MRSA may be due to spread of a single predominant MRSA strain carrying qacA/B in the hospital. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis indicated higher prevalence of the qacB-type gene (59.3%) than the qacA-type gene (40.7%) among the qacA/B genes detected. Nucleotide sequencing analysis revealed the presence of two genetic variants in qacA (V1 and V2) and four variants in qacB (V1-V4) that differ from the qacA prototype in pSK1 by 1-5 nucleotides and 7-9 nucleotides, respectively. Although most strains with qacA-V1, qacA-V2, qacB-V3, and qacB-V4 showed high-level resistance to ethidium bromide (EB)(MIC > 100 microg/ml), all of the S. aureus isolates carrying qacB-V1 and qacB-V2 showed lower MICs of EB and some monovalent cationic antiseptic substances. By analysis of the genomic organization of the qacA/B downstream region, divergent forms of this region rearranged with an insertion of IS256 or IS257 were found primarily for qacB. The downstream region of qacA-V1 was suggested to be an evolutionary origin for other divergent forms. These findings indicated that both qacA and qacB are prevalent in recent clinical isolates, especially in MRSA, and these genes consist of variable genetic variants that may be responsible for different resistance levels against antiseptic substances.",

        "abstract": "Drugs that interfere with the normal progression of mitosis belong to the most successful chemotherapeutic compounds currently used for anti-cancer treatment. Classically, these drugs are represented by microtubule binding drugs that inhibit the function of the mitotic spindle in order to halt the cell cycle in mitosis and to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. However, these compounds act not only on proliferating tumor cells, but exhibit significant side effects on non-proliferating cells including neurons that are highly dependent on intracellular transport processes mediated by microtubules. Therefore, there is a particular interest in developing novel anti-mitotic drugs that target non-microtubule structures. In fact, recently several novel drugs that target mitotic kinesins or the Aurora and polo-like kinases have been developed and are currently tested in clinical trials. In addition, approaches of cell cycle checkpoint abrogation during mitosis and at the G2/M transition inducing mitosis-associated tumor cell death are promising new strategies for anti-cancer therapy. It is expected that this \"next generation\" of anti-mitotic drugs will be as successful as the classical anti-microtubule drugs, while avoiding some of the adverse side effects. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The survey was online for 1 week, after which time the survey responses were downloaded and analyzed. Thirty percent of medical students responded to the survey (n = 304). The majority of third- and fourth-year medical students believe that antibiotics are overused in the hospital and in outpatient areas. Over three quarters of the students would like more education on antibiotic selection, and 83% wanted this education to be during the third year of medical school. The resources they used the most for antibiotic selection included other physicians and handheld programs such as Epocrates, but no clear resource emerged as the dominant preference.

The rate of qnr-positive isolates was 21.6% (49/226), 49.5% for aac(6')-Ib-cr (112/226), and 1.7% for qepA1 (4/226). Those isolates carried qnr genes corresponding to types qnrB (71.4%), qnrS1 (24.4%), and qnrA1 (18.3%). The distribution among bacterial species was as follows: 55.8% (19/34) to Enterobacter cloacae, 50% (28/56) to Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1.4% (2/136) to Escherichia coli. The characterization of qnr-positive isolates indicated the ESBL SHV-types as the most prevalent (81.6%), including the ESBLs SHV-12, SHV-5, and SHV-2a, followed by CTX-M-15 (44.9%) and TLA-1 (8.1%). In addition, for qnr-positive isolates, the prevalence of aac(6')-Ib-cr was 55.1%, but qepA was not identified. Alterations at codons Ser-83 and Asp-87 in GyrA and at codons Ser-80 in ParC were observed in 69% and 80% of the qnr-positive isolates, respectively. The analysis of the transconjugants revealed a cotransmission of bla<sub>CTX-M-15</sub> with qepA1 or aac(6')-Ib-cr and/or qnrA1 and bla<sub>SHV-type</sub> with qnrB5 and qnrB6 genes.

        "abstract": "Within three decades, anti-angiogenic therapy has rapidly evolved into an integral component of current standard anti-cancer treatment. Anti-angiogenic therapy has fulfilled a number of its earlier proposed promises. The universality of this approach is demonstrated by the broad spectrum of malignant and benign tumor entities, as well as non-neoplastic diseases, that are currently treated with anti-angiogenic agents. In contrast to tumor cell targeting therapies, the development of acquired drug resistance (e.g., via mutations in growth factor receptor signaling genes) has not been described yet for the principal target of anti-angiogenic therapy-the tumor endothelium. Moreover, the tumor endothelium has emerged as a critical target of conventional cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The presumption that tumor growth and metastasis are angiogenesis-dependent implies that the number of potential targets of an anti-cancer therapy could be reduced to those that stimulate the angiogenesis process. Therefore, the set of endogenous angiogenesis stimulants might constitute an \"Achilles heel\" of cancer. Direct targeting of tumor endothelium via, e.g., endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors poses another promising but clinically less explored therapeutic strategy. Indeed, the majority of current anti-angiogenic approaches block the activity of a single or at most a few pro-angiogenic proteins secreted by tumor cells or the tumor stroma. Based on our systems biology work on the angiogenic switch, we predicted that the redundancy of angiogenic signals might limit the efficacy of anti-angiogenic monotherapies. In support of this hypothesis, emerging experimental evidence suggests that tumors may become refractory or even evade the inhibition of a single pro-angiogenic pathway via compensatory upregulation of alternative angiogenic factors. Here, we discuss current concepts and propose novel strategies to overcome tumor evasion of anti-angiogenic therapy. We believe that early detection of tumors, prediction of tumor evasive mechanisms and rational design of anti-angiogenic combinations will direct anti-angiogenic therapy towards its ultimate goal-the conversion of cancer to a dormant, chronic, manageable disease. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Molecular links between apoptosis, tumorigenesis and drug resistance provide starting points for new therapeutic approaches and for a targeted cancer therapy. The discovery of the p53-related genes p63 and p73 raised the possibility that they may be cancer-associated genes and as a consequence that p53 is not the only component in predicting prognosis and response to chemotherapy, but instead the status of a network that contains p53, p73 and p63. This review focuses on the status and interrelationship of the p53 family members in human cancer as critical elements for tumor progression and response to therapy. Literature up to December 2006 is reviewed. p63 and p73 - as well as p53 - each use multiple promoters and alternative splicing to generate an array of isoforms, including full-length isoforms with a transactivation (TA-) domain homologous to that of full-length p53, and amino-terminally truncated (??N-) isoforms. Whereas the full-length TA isoforms of p63 and p73 can activate downstream target genes and induce apoptosis, the ??N isoforms which lack the transactivation domain can act as dominant inhibitors of the full-length forms of p53, p63 and p73, inhibiting transactivation of target genes and induction of apoptosis. Deregulated dominant negative p63 and p73 isoforms play an oncogenic role in human cancer and contribute to chemoresistance. Thus, therapeutic modulation of TAp63/??Np63, TAp73/??Np73 and mutant p53 levels might be used to target the large percentage of human tumors that harbor p53 mutations and/or overexpress ??Np63 or ??Np73. Interfering with the expression or function of ??Np63 and/or ??Np73 and/or mutant p53 in tumor cells may render such tumors more responsive to therapy and reduce their aggressiveness and metastatic capacity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "In addition to their well-known anti-malarial activity, artemisinin and its derivatives (1,2,4-trioxanes) possess potent activity against tumor cells in the nano- to micromolar range. Candidate genes that may contribute to the sensitivity and resistance of tumor cells to artemisinins were identified by pharmacogenomic and molecular pharmacological approaches. Target validation was performed using cell lines transfected with candidate genes or corresponding knockout cells. These genes are from classes with different biological function; for example, regulation of proliferation (BUB3, cyclins, CDC25A), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor, matrix metalloproteinase-9, angiostatin, thrombospondin-1) or apoptosis (BCL-2, BAX). Artesunate triggers apoptosis both by p53-dependent and -independent pathways. Anti-oxidant stress genes (thioredoxin, catalase, gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase, glutathione S-transferases) as well as the epidermal growth factor receptor confer resistance to artesunate. Cell lines over-expressing genes that confer resistance to established anti-tumor drugs (MDR1, MRP1, BCRP, dihydrofolate reductase, ribonucleotide reductase) were not cross-resistant to artesunate, indicating that this drug has a different target and is not subject to multidrug resistance. The Plasmodium translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) represents a known target protein of artemisinin and its derivatives in the malaria parasite. The microarray-based mRNA expression of human TCTP correlated with sensitivity to artesunate in tumor cells, suggesting that human TCTP contributes to response of tumor cells to the drug. The multi-factorial nature of cellular response to artemisinin and its derivatives may be beneficial to treat otherwise drug-resistant tumors and may explain why resistance development has not been observed in either cancer or malaria.",

        "abstract": "Transition-metal-based compounds constitute a discrete class of chemotherapeutics, widely used in the clinic as antitumor and antiviral agents. Examples of established antitumor metallodrugs, routinely used in the clinic, are cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)] and its analogues carboplatin and oxaliplatin. However, drug resistance and side effects have limited their clinical utility. These limitations have prompted a search for more effective and less toxic metal-based antitumor agents. Some of the efforts have been directed in the design of non-platinum, transition-metal-based antitumor agents and ruthenium complexes have attracted much interest as alternative drugs to cisplatin in cancer chemotherapy. Ruthenium complexes demonstrate similar ligand exchange kinetics to those of platinum(II) antitumor drugs already used in the clinic while displaying only low toxicity. This is in part due to the ability of ruthenium complexes to mimic the binding of iron to molecules of biological significance, exploiting the mechanisms that the body has evolved for transport of iron. In addition, the redox potential between the different accessible oxidation states occupied by ruthenium complexes enables the body to catalyze oxidation and reduction reactions, depending on physiological environment. The biochemical changes that accompany cancer alter physiological environment, enabling ruthenium complexes to be selectively activated in cancer tissues. Due to differing ligand geometry between their complexes, ruthenium compounds bind to DNA affecting its conformation differently than cisplatin and its analogues. In addition, non-nuclear targets, such as the mitochondrion and the cell surface, have also been implicated in the antineoplastic activity of some ruthenium complexes. Thus, ruthenium compounds offer the potential over antitumor platinum(II) complexes currently used in the clinic of reduced toxicity, a novel mechanism of action, the prospect of non-cross-resistance and a different spectrum of activity. In other words, some chemical properties make ruthenium compounds well suited for medicinal applications and as an alternative to platinum antitumor drugs in the treatment of cancer cells resistant to cisplatin. Although the pharmacological target for antitumor ruthenium compounds has not been unequivocally identified, there is a large body of evidence indicating that the cytotoxicity of many ruthenium complexes correlates with their ability to bind DNA although few exceptions have been reported. This review summarizes results demonstrating that several ruthenium compounds that exhibit antitumor effects different from cisplatin or its analogues bind DNA and modify it differently than cisplatin or its analogues. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Current standard of care treatment (SOC) with pegylated-interferon-\u03b1 2 and ribavirin (RBV) has a limited efficacy and is associated with significant side effects frequently associated with poor compliance or treatment discontinuation, requiring specialized and frequent monitoring. To overcome the limited efficacy of SOC, more than 50 direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) designed to target viral-encoded proteins essential in the HCV life cycle are currently under development. The rapid selection of resistant mutants associated with the quasispecies nature of HCV with high mutation and replication rates is one of the main challenges for the new HCV therapies.

However resistance was also common in other phage types, particularly DTs 193 and 208 and phage type U302. Multiresistant strains of DT208 appeared to be predominantly associated with pigs; for the other phage types, the human/food-producing animal relationships of drug-resistant isolates were more complex. For Enteritidis, Virchow, and Hadar, there were substantial differences in the resistance spectra of isolates from humans and food-producing animals, suggesting that food-producing animals bred in England and Wales may not be the primary sources of drug-resistant strains of these serotypes causing infections in humans.

The results show a significant increase of DA resistance in this relatively short period of time. In 1996, among the 39 isolates, 61.5% were found sensitive, 12.8% resistant and 25.7% had a mixed BclI-PCR-RFLP profile. In 2004, among the 38 isolates, 10.5% were found sensitive, 63.2% were resistant and 26.3% showed a mixed BclI-PCR-RFLP profile. In vivo tests in mice showed that isolates with a sensitive or mixed RFLP profile were sensitive to DA whereas isolates with a resistant RFLP profile were resistant. Since there are no indications that the drug pressure has increased between 1996 and 2003, it is suggested that genetic exchange of resistance genes might explain the increased frequency of resistance to DA. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In recent years, intermittent preventive treatment for pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has become policy in much of sub-Saharan Africa. But resistance to SP has been spreading across sub-Saharan Africa and thus the effectiveness of IPTp-SP has been questioned. The present study therefore sought to assess the incidence of placental malaria, low birth weight, and anemia of two IPTp-SP approaches (directly observed treatment scheme versus no directly observed treatment) in Anonkoua-Koute and Samo, Cote d'Ivoire where the reported prevalence of dfr single mutant 108 was 62% and 52.2%, respectively. METHODS: The study was a longitudinal design involving pregnant women and was conducted in Anonkoua-Koute, a suburban area, and Samo, a rural area, from January 2008 through March 2009. Women of a pregnancy less than 28 weeks duration were randomized to receive SP (1.5 g/0.075 g SP) in a single intake twice and were followed up monthly until delivery. Doses were administered under supervision in the controlled IPTp group, while SP was given free to women in the uncontrolled IPTp group with a recommendation to take it at home. The primary end point was the proportion of low birth weight infants (body weight < 2500 g) and the secondary end point was the rate of severe anemia and placental malaria detected at delivery. RESULTS: A total of 420 pregnant women were enrolled (212 and 208, respectively, in the controlled and uncontrolled groups). Delivery outcome was available for 378 women. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, low birth weight infants were born from 15.5% of women of the uncontrolled IPTp group and from 11.9% of women in the controlled IPTp group (P = 0.31). The per-protocol population analysis showed consistent results. The proportion of women with placental malaria infection, moderate anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL), and severe anemia (hemoglobin < 8 g/dL) at delivery were similar between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study showed that the two approaches were equivalent, suggesting that unsupervised IPTp-SP free of charge should be used in areas where implementation of the directly observed treatment scheme suffers from many constraints.",

        "abstract": "Conventional cancer treatment modalities have several limitations including lack of sufficient efficacy, serious untoward toxicity, as well as innate and acquired drug resistance. In contrast, targeted imaging agents can identify patients with receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells, thus allowing appropriate selection of patients for personalized treatment with a desirable targeted therapeutic. The folate receptor (FR) has been identified as a new molecularly targeted entity, which is highly overexpressed on the surface of a spectrum of solid tumor cells, including ovarian, kidney, lung, brain, endometrial, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, prostate, testicular, bladder, head and neck, breast, and non\u2013small cell lung cancer. Folic acid conjugation is a novel approach for targeting FR-expressing tissues for personalized treatment. With the development of FR\u03b1-targeted therapies comes a concomitant prerequisite for reliable methods for the quantification of FR\u03b1 tissue expression. Therefore, attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent, 99mTc-etarfolatide (99mTc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion diagnostic with the FR\u03b1-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to identify patients whose tumors express FR\u03b1. Vintafolide is a folic acid conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FR\u03b1-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization. 99mTc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FR\u03b1 expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors, indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting vintafolide response. Targeted therapies combined with a reliable companion diagnostic test represent a novel approach towards efficient personalized medicine for malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Furthermore, the recent availability of the crystal structures of FR\u03b1 and FR\u03b2 in complex with folates and antifolates forms a realistic basis for the rational design and implementation of novel FR-targeted drugs for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory disorders.",

        "abstract": "The mechanisms of high-level carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated in Japan were investigated. High-level carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae Mkp4437 and a less carbapenem-sensitive K. pneumoniae strain, Mkp4365, were recovered from the same patient. These two strains were found to be homologous by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and both strains contained blaIMP-1, blaDHA-1, blaCTXM-14, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-1. Based on the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, the lack of Ompk36 was observed in Mkp4437. Direct sequencing of the ompK36 gene demonstrated that a new insertional sequence in the open reading frame of the ompK36 gene was found in Mkp4437. Three clinical isolates (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 2-4 mg/L to imipenem) were identified upon screening the strains of K. pneumoniae isolated in the University hospital with MICs of >/=1 mg/L to imipenem. Interestingly, these three isolates all lacked OmpK36. Conjugation of the plasmid harboring IMP-1 to these three OmpK36-deficient strains led to the isolation of high-level carbapenem-resistant transconjugants. In conclusion, the mechanisms of high-level carbapenem resistance in K. pneumoniae entail not only the production of IMP-1 beta-lactamase but also the lack of OmpK36. It is vital to monitor for the presence of less carbapenem-sensitive K. pneumoniae strains, which lack OmpK36, because blaIMP-1 transmission to these strains may result in isolates with a high-level carbapenem-resistant phenotype.",

        "abstract": "An international expert panel was convened to deliberate the management of azole-resistant aspergillosis. In culture-positive cases, in vitro susceptibility testing should always be performed if antifungal therapy is intended. Different patterns of resistance are seen, with multi-azole and pan-azole resistance more common than resistance to a single triazole. In confirmed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to an azole-resistant Aspergillus, the experts recommended a switch from voriconazole to liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB; Ambisome<sup>\u00ae</sup>). In regions with environmental resistance rates of \u226510%, a voriconazole-echinocandin combination or L-AmB were favoured as initial therapy. All experts recommended L-AmB as core therapy for central nervous system aspergillosis suspected to be due to an azole-resistant Aspergillus, and considered the addition of a second agent with the majority favouring flucytosine. Intravenous therapy with either micafungin or L-AmB given as either intermittent or continuous therapy was recommended for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis due to a pan-azole-resistant Aspergillus. Local and national surveillance with identification of clinical and environmental resistance patterns, rapid diagnostics, better quality clinical outcome data, and a greater understanding of the factors driving or minimising environmental resistance are areas where research is urgently needed, as well as the development of new oral agents outside the azole drug class.",

        "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of chronic and hospital-acquired infections produced by multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This growing threat results from the extraordinary capacity of this pathogen for developing resistance through chromosomal mutations and from the increasing prevalence of transferable resistance determinants, particularly those encoding carbapenemases or extended-spectrum ??-lactamases (ESBLs). P. aeruginosa has a nonclonal epidemic population structure, composed of a limited number of widespread clones which are selected from a background of a large quantity of rare and unrelated genotypes that are recombining at high frequency. Indeed, recent concerning reports have provided evidence of the existence of MDR/XDR global clones, denominated high-risk clones, disseminated in hospitals worldwide; ST235, ST111, and ST175 are likely those more widespread. Noteworthy, the vast majority of infections by MDR, and specially XDR, strains are produced by these and few other clones worldwide. Moreover, the association of high-risk clones, particularly ST235, with transferable resistance is overwhelming; nearly 100 different horizontally-acquired resistance elements and up to 39 different acquired ??-lactamases have been reported so far among ST235 isolates. Likewise, MDR internationally-disseminated epidemic strains, such as the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES, ST146), have been noted as well among cystic fibrosis patients. Here we review the population structure, epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and virulence of the P. aeruginosa high-risk clones. The phenotypic and genetic factors potentially driving the success of high-risk clones, the aspects related to their detection in the clinical microbiology laboratory and the implications for infection control and public health are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "The cellular transcription factor E2F1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor regulating the activities of p53 and its homologue TAp73, and promoting apoptosis by the activation of a plethora of death pathways. More than 15 years of experimentation recognized E2F1 as the key player in apoptosis induced by DNA damage in all types of human cancer. This occurs by several mechanisms that affect RB-E2F1 interaction, E2F1 stability and its binding to promoters of E2F1-regulated genes. Recent progress has been made in revealing new proapoptotic genes regulated by E2F1 and it seems that many still remain to be discovered. However, whereas in the past one focused mainly on identifying E2F1 target genes translating cellular stress signals into cell death, today the DNA damage-induced regulatory network governing E2F1's ability to induce apoptosis is rapidly gaining attention as well. Notably, the lately uncovered role of pRB and E2F3 in triggering E2F1-dependent apoptosis through chemotherapy gains our understanding of the DNA damage response in normal and tumor cells. In this context a large body of evidence indicates that nuclear cofactors targeting E2F1 seem to have a major impact on its tumor suppressor function. These new findings are discussed in the context of preclinical studies applying E2F1 overexpression in combination with genotoxic anticancer agents - called chemogene therapy, thereby providing new mechanistic links between the E2F1-induced apoptotic programming and advanced cancer phenotype. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

Here, we review the progress of current research in this field, discuss some of the potential obstacles to developing and marketing a protective antifungal vaccine, and summarize two clinical trials of monoclonal antibodies as adjunctive treatment of established mycoses. In animal models of fungal infections, protective responses have been elicited with vaccines composed of whole organisms, soluble cell free fractions, purified proteins, glycans and nucleic acids.

        "abstract": "Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem with high mortality and morbidity rates, especially in low-income countries. Disturbingly, the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB cases has worsened the situation, raising concerns of a future epidemic of virtually untreatable TB. Indeed, the rapid diagnosis of MDR TB is a critical issue for TB management. This study is an attempt to establish a rapid diagnosis of MDR TB by sequencing the target fragments of the rpoB gene which linked to resistance against rifampicin and the katG gene and inhA promoter region, which are associated with resistance to isoniazid. Methods: For this purpose, 133 sputum samples of TB patients from Morocco were enrolled in this study. One hundred samples were collected from new cases, and the remaining 33 were from previously treated patients (drug relapse or failure, chronic cases) and did not respond to anti-TB drugs after a suffcient duration of treatment. All samples were subjected to rpoB, katG and pinhA mutation analysis by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Results: Molecular analysis showed that seven strains were isoniazid-monoresistant and 17 were rifampicin-monoresistant. MDR TB strains were identifed in nine cases (6.8%). Among them, eight were traditionally diagnosed as critical cases, comprising four chronic and four drug-relapse cases. The last strain was isolated from a new case. The most recorded mutation in the rpoB gene was the substitution TCG>TTG at codon 531 (Ser531 Leu), accounting for 46.15%. Signifcantly, the only mutation found in the katG gene was at codon 315 (AGC to ACC) with a Ser315Thr amino acid change. Only one sample harbored mutation in the inhA promoter region and was a point mutation at the -15p position (C > T). Conclusion: The polymerase chain reaction sequencing approach is an accurate and rapid method for detection of drug-resistant TB in clinical specimens, and could be of great interest in the management of TB in critical cases to adjust the treatment regimen and limit the emergence of MDR and XDR strains. \u00a9 2013 Zakham et al.

        "abstract": "Although the arsenal of agents with anti-Aspergillus activity has expanded over the last decade, mortality due to invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains unacceptably high. Aspergillus fumigatus still accounts for the majority of cases of IA; however less susceptible to antifungals non-fumigatus aspergilli began to emerge. Antifungal drug resistance of Aspergillus might partially account for treatment failures. Recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms of antifungal drug action in Aspergillus, along with the standardization of in vitro susceptibility testing methods, has brought resistance testing to the forefront of clinical mycology. In addition, molecular biology has started to shed light on the mechanisms of resistance of A. fumigatus to azoles and the echinocandins, while genome-based assays show promise for high-throughput screening for genotypic antifungal resistance. Several problems remain, however, in the study of this complex area. Large multicenter clinical studies--point prevalence or longitudinal--to capture the incidence and prevalence of antifungal resistance in A. fumigatus isolates are lacking. Correlation of in vitro susceptibility with clinical outcome and susceptibility breakpoints has not been established. In addition, the issue of cross-resistance between the newer triazoles is of concern. Furthermore, in vitro resistance testing for polyenes and echinocandins is difficult, and their mechanisms of resistance are largely unknown. This review examines challenges in the diagnosis, epidemiology, and mechanisms of antifungal drug resistance in A. fumigatus.",

An azole resistance mechanism typically decreases the activity of multiple azole compounds, depending on the mutation. As alternative treatment options are limited and in some isolates the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) increases by only a few two-fold dilutions steps, we investigated if voriconazole and posaconazole have a role in treating azole-resistant Aspergillus disease. The relation between resistance genotype and phenotype, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and (pre)clinical treatment efficacy were reviewed. The results were used to estimate the exposure needed to achieve the pharmacodynamic target for each MIC. For posaconazole adequate exposure can be achieved only for wild type isolates as dose escalation does not allow PD target attainment. However, the new intravenous formulation might result in sufficient exposure to treat isolates with a MIC of 0.5 mg/L. For voriconazole our analysis indicated that the exposure needed to treat infection due to isolates with a MIC of 2 mg/L is feasible and maybe isolates with a MIC of 4 mg/L. However, extreme caution and strict monitoring of drug levels would be required, as the probability of toxicity will also increase.",

        "abstract": "There is a growing need to optimize the use of old and new antibiotics to treat serious as well as less serious infections. The topic of how to use pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) knowledge to conserve antibiotics for the future was elaborated on in a workshop of the conference (The conference \"The Global Need for Effective Antibiotics - moving towards concerted action\", ReAct, Uppsala, Sweden, 2010). The optimization of dosing regimens is accomplished by choosing the dose and schedule that results in the antimicrobial exposure that will achieve the microbiological and clinical outcome desired while simultaneously suppressing emergence of resistance. PK/PD of antimicrobial agents describe how the therapeutic drug effect is dependent on the potency of a drug against a microorganism and the exposure (the concentration of antimicrobial available for effect over time). The description and modeling of these relationships quantitatively then allow for a rational approach to dose optimization and several strategies to that purpose are described. These strategies include not only the dosing regimen itself but also the duration of therapy, preventing collateral damage through inappropriate use and the application of PK/PD in drug development. Furthermore, PK/PD relationships of older antibiotics need to be urgently established. The need for global harmonization of breakpoints is also suggested and would add efficacy to antibiotic therapy. For each of the strategies, a number of priority actions are provided.",

        "abstract": "Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a serious problem throughout the world. Resistance to Rifampicin (RIF) is mainly caused by the mutations in the rpoB gene coding the (beta)-subunit of RNA polymerase. In this study, we aimed to detect the distribution of rpoB gene mutations in 80 RIF-resistant clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates from Turkey. The rpoB gene was amplified by PCR and mutations leading RIF resistance were determined by automated sequence analysis. A total of 72 of the 80 isolates (90%) were found to carry mutations in the amplified region, whereas eight isolates (10%) carried no mutations. Overall, 24 different missense mutations affecting 14 codons, and two deletion mutants were identified. Nine new mutations, six in the hot-spot region and three outside this region, were found. The codon numbers of the most frequently encountered mutations were 531 (51.4%), 526 (18.1%), 516 (13.9%), and 513 (12.5%). As a result, 90% of the RIF-resistant MTB isolates from the Turkish patients were found to carry a mutation in the rpoB gene, Ser531Leu being the most frequent one. Although molecular methods identify mutations leading to RIF resistance very quickly, results of the antimycobacterial susceptibility tests must be taken into consideration for the patients carrying no mutations in this region.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have reported that Escherichia coli in fecal samples of healthy humans could also serve as important reservoirs of drug-resistant bacteria. Limited data are available for E. coli-resistant profiles of healthy food handlers in hospitals who provide food service to inpatients and hospital staffs. E. coli isolates were recovered from hospital healthy food handlers, and one random selected isolate from each food handler was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, phylogenetic typing, and screening for antimicrobial-resistant mechanisms by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were further characterized by mutation analysis in the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of GyrA and ParC. And extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing isolates were screened for bla(CTX-M) by polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequence analysis. In total, more than 50% (47/92) of E. coli isolates from healthy food handlers showed multidrug-resistant profiles and 50% (46/92) isolates carried intI. Resistance prevalence of the B2 phylogenetic group was significantly lower than that of the non-B2 groups for all tested antimicrobials (p < 0.05) except chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Seven isolates of phylogenetic group A (n = 3) and D (n = 4) produced ESBL, and 12 isolates of phylogenetic group A (n = 5), B2 (n = 2), and D (n = 5) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Transferable quinolone resistance determinants were identified in four isolates. Point mutations in QRDRs of GyrA or ParC were identified among 59 out of 62 E. coli isolates showing decreased susceptibility or resistance to ciprofloxacin. Genes encoding CTX-M enzyme were identified in seven ESBL-producing isolates. The preponderance in hospital food handlers of multidrug-resistant E. coli makes it important to introduce control measures such as improved biosecurity to ensure that they do not pass through the food service and limit inpatient therapeutic options.",

        "abstract": "Hyaluronan not only is an important structural component of extracellular matrices but also interacts with cells during dynamic cell processes such as those occurring in cancer. Consequently, interactions of hyaluronan with tumor cells play important cooperative roles in various aspects of malignancy. Hyaluronan binds to several cell surface receptors, including CD44, thus leading to co-regulation of signaling pathways that are important in regulation of multidrug resistance to anticancer drugs, in particular anti-apoptotic pathways induced by activation of receptor tyrosine kinases. Emmprin, a cell surface glycoprotein of the Ig superfamily, stimulates hyaluronan production and downstream signaling consequences. Emmprin and CD44 also interact with various multidrug transporters of the ABC family and monocarboxylate transporters associated with resistance to cancer therapies. Moreover, hyaluronan-CD44 interactions are critical to these properties in the highly malignant, chemotherapy-resistant cancer stem-like cells. Perturbations of the hyaluronan-CD44 interaction at the plasma membrane by various antagonists result in attenuation of receptor tyrosine kinase and transporter activities and inhibition of tumor progression in vivo. These antagonists, especially small hyaluronan oligomers, may be useful in therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing tumor refractoriness or recurrence due to drug-resistant sub-populations within malignant cancers. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Raltegravir was also found to be highly active in antiretroviral-experienced patients with virological failure and displaying multiresistant virus, as shown with the BENCHMRK and ANRS 139 TRIO trials. Finally, the use of raltegravir was assessed in the context of a switch strategy in antiretroviral-experienced patients with virological success [human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA below detection limit], highlighting the following mandatory criteria in this strategy: the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors associated with raltegravir have to be fully active. In the different studies, raltegravir had a favorable safety and tolerability profile. In the clinical situation a switch in virologically suppressed patients receiving a protease inhibitor, an improvement of the lipid profile was observed. Overall, when analyzing the Phase II and III trials together, only a few patients on raltegravir discontinued for adverse events. The development of resistance to raltegravir mainly involved three resistance mutations in integrase gene: Q148H/K/R, N155H, and Y143C/H/R.

In solid organ transplant and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, cytomegalovirus infection is associated with high morbidity and preventable mortality. Prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus with currently approved antiviral drugs is often associated with side effects that sometimes preclude their use. Moreover, cytomegalovirus has developed mutations that confer resistance to standard antiviral drugs. During the last decade, there have been calls to develop novel antiviral drugs that could provide better options for prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus. Letermovir (AIC246) is a highly specific antiviral drug that is currently undergoing clinical development for the management of cytomegalovirus infection. It acts by inhibiting the viral terminase complex. Letermovir is highly potent in vitro and in vivo against cytomegalovirus. Because of a distinct mechanism of action, it does not exhibit cross-resistance with other antiviral drugs. It is predicted to be active against strains that are resistant to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. To date, early-phase clinical trials suggest a very low incidence of adverse effects. Herein, we present a comprehensive review on letermovir, from its postulated novel mechanism of action to the results of most recent clinical studies.",

Once the reproducibility of the M27-A document was established, tentative breakpoints for fluconazole and itraconazole were derived. The availability of a standardized procedure for determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antifungal agents is an important tool in drug discovery and development.

        "abstract": "The increased incidence of malignant melanoma in the last decades, its high mortality and pronounced therapy resistance pose an enormous challenge. Important therapeutic targets for melanoma are the induction of apoptosis and suppression of survival pathways. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and of death receptor ligands to trigger apoptosis in melanoma cells. In the clinical setting, BH3 domain mimics and death receptor agonists are therefore considered as promising, specific novel treatments to add to the conventional pro-apoptotic strategies such as chemo- or radiotherapy. However, constitutively activated survival pathways, in particular the mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase B/Akt and nuclear factor (NF)-??B, all may work in concert to prevent effective therapy. Thus, selective biologicals developed with the aim to inhibit pro-survival signaling are currently tested in melanoma. For highly therapy-resistant tumors such as melanoma, development of novel drug combinations will be essential, and combinations of survival inhibitors and pro-apoptotic mediators appear most promising. The challenge of the near future will be to make a rational choice of the multiple possible combinations and protocols. This review gives a critical overview of proteins involved in melanoma chemoresistance, which are targets for current drug development leading to the best choice for future trials. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Antimicrobials are among the most important and commonly prescribed drugs in the management of critically ill patients. Selecting the appropriate antimicrobial at the commencement of therapy, both in terms of spectrum of activity and dose and frequency of administration according to concentration or time dependency, is mandatory in this setting. Despite appropriate standard dosage regimens, failure of the antimicrobial treatment may occur because of the inability of the antimicrobial to achieve adequate concentrations at the infection site through alterations in its pharmacokinetics due to underlying pathophysiological conditions. According to the intrinsic chemicophysical properties of antimicrobials, hydrophilic antimicrobials (beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides) have to be considered at much higher risk of inter- and intraindividual pharmacokinetic variations than lipophilic antimicrobials (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, rifampicin [rifampin]) in critically ill patients, with significant frequent fluctuations of plasma concentrations that may require significant dosage adjustments. For example, underexposure may occur because of increased volume of distribution (as a result of oedema in sepsis and trauma, pleural effusion, ascites, mediastinitis, fluid therapy or indwelling post-surgical drainage) and/or enhanced renal clearance (as a result of burns, drug abuse, hyperdynamic conditions during sepsis, acute leukaemia or use of haemodynamically active drugs). On the other hand, overexposure may occur because of a drop in renal clearance caused by renal impairment. Care with all these factors whenever choosing an antimicrobial may substantially improve the outcome of antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients. However, since these situations may often coexist in the same patient and pharmacokinetic variability may be unpredictable, the antimicrobial policy may further benefit from real-time application of therapeutic drug monitoring, since this practice, by tailoring exposure to the individual patient, may consequently be helpful both in improving the outcome of antimicrobial therapy and in containing the spread of resistance in the hospital setting.",

        "abstract": "Since its discovery in England and France in 1986, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus has increasingly become a major nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Enterococci are prolific colonizers, with tremendous genome plasticity and a propensity for persistence in hospital environments, allowing for increased transmission and the dissemination of resistance elements. Infections typically present in immunosuppressed patients who have received multiple courses of antibiotics in the past. Virulence is variable, and typical clinical manifestations include bacteremia, endocarditis, intra-abdominal and pelvic infections, urinary tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, and, rarely, central nervous system infections. As enterococci are common colonizers, careful consideration is needed before initiating targeted therapy, and source control is first priority. Current treatment options including linezolid, daptomycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and tigecycline have shown favorable activity against various vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus infections, but there is a lack of randomized controlled trials assessing their efficacy. Clearer distinctions in preferred therapies can be made based on adverse effects, drug interactions, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Although combination therapies and newer agents such as tedizolid, telavancin, dalbavancin, and oritavancin hold promise for the future treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus infections, further studies are needed to assess their possible clinical impact, especially in the treatment of serious infections.",

Although mutations in M. tuberculosis KatG confer INH resistance in tuberculous patients, structural bases for INH-resistant mutations in the KatG gene remains poorly understood. Here, three M. tuberculosis KatG mutants bearing Arg418\u2192 Gln, Ser315 \u2192 Thr, or Trp321 \u2192 Gly replacement were assessed for changes in catalase-peroxidase activities and possible structure bases relevant to such changes. These three M. tuberculosis KatG mutants exhibited a marked impairment or loss of catalase-peroxidase activities. The possible structural bases for the mutant-induced loss of enzyme activities were then analyzed using a three-dimensional model of M. tuberculosis KatG protein constructed on the basis of the crystal structure of the catalase-peroxidase from Burkholderia pseudomallei. The model suggests that three M. tuberculosis KatG mutants bearing Arg418 \u2192 Gln, Ser315 \u2192Thr, or Trp321\u2192 Gly replacement affect enzyme activities by different mechanisms, although each of them impacts consequently on a heme-associated structure, the putative oxidative site. Moreover, in addition to the widely accepted substrate-binding site, M. tuberculosis KatG may bear another H2O2 binding site. This H2O2 binding site appears to interact with the catalytic site by a possible electron-transfer chain, a Met255-Tyr229-Trp107 triad conserved in many catalase-peroxidases. The Ser315 \u2192 Thr mutant may have direct effect on the catalytic site by interfering with electron transfer in addition to the previously proposed mechanism of steric constraint.",

The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of multidrug-resistant MRSA strains in clinical specimens and to investigate the sensitivity pattern of these strains against various antibiotics used for treating hospitalized and out patients. Strains were identified using standard procedures, and their sensitivity pattern was investigated using such techniques as disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and the mecA gene PCR. Among 783 isolates of S. aureus, 301 (38.44%) were methicillin-resistant, of which 217 (72.1%) were found to be multidrug-resistant. Almost all MRSA strains were resistant to penicillin, 95.68% were resistant to cotrimoxazole, 92.36% were resistant to chloramphenicol, 90.7% were resistant to norfloxacin, 76.1% were resistant to tetracycline, and 75.75% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Vancomycin was the most effective drug, with only 0.33% of MRSA strains being resistant to it. It is concluded that antibiotics other than vancomycin can be used as anti-MRSA agents after a sensitivity test so as to preclude the emergence of resistance to it and that prevailing problems in chemotherapy will escalate unless indiscriminate and irrational usage of antibiotics is checked.",

This study investigated bla CTX-M-I ESBL production among Salmonella isolates from hospitalized patients.\\n\\nMETHODS: Patients (158 total) made up of two groups were evaluated. Group A was composed of 135 patients with persistent pyrexia and group B was composed of 23 gastroenteritis patients and their stool samples. Samples were cultured, and isolates were identified and were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing by standard methods. Isolates were further screened for ESBL production, bla CTX-M-I genes and transferability by double disk synergy test, plasmid extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and conjugation experiment.\\n\\nRESULTS: Thirty-five (25.9%) Salmonella isolates were identified from group A, of which 74.3% were S. typhi, 22.9% were S. paratyphi and two (5.7%) were invasive non-typhoidal S. enteritidis. Nine Plasmodium falciparum infections were recorded, four of which were identified as co-infections with typhoidal Salmonella. Only two (8.7%) S. enteritidis samples were obtained from group B (P>0.05). A total of 24 isolates were ESBL-positive, eliciting resistance to five to seven antibiotics, and were multiple-drug resistant. ESBL production due to the bla CTX-M-I gene cluster was detected in eleven (45.8%) Salmonella isolates. Nine (81.8%) of the eleven bla CTX-M-I ESBL producers were S. typhi and two (18.2%) isolates were S. enteritidis. Four of nine S. typhi bla CTX-M-I ESBL-producing strains harbored 23 kb self-transmissible plasmid that was co-transferred with cefotaxime and augmentin resistance to Escherichia coli j53-2 transconjugants.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This study revealed the emergence of bla CTX-M-I S. typhi as an agent of persistent pyrexia with potential to spread to other Enterobacteriaceae in Lagos, Nigeria. Cautionary prescription and judicious use of third-generation cephalosporins, particularly cefotaxime, for the treatment of typhoid fever and routine screening for P. falciparum co-infection with ESBL-producing Salmonella in the laboratories during diagnosis of persistent pyrexia conditions in patients are recommended.",

In this chapter, we consider the dynamics of drug resistance in blood cancer and the related issue of the dynamics of cancer stem cells. After describing the main types of chemotherapeutic agents available for cancer treatment, we review the different mechanisms of drug resistance development. Various mathematical models of drug resistance found in the literature are then reviewed. Given the well-known hierarchy of the hematopoietic system, it is critical to focus on those cells that have the ability to self-renew, since these will be the only cells able to induce long-term drug resistance. Thus, a recent mathematical model taking into account the complex dynamics of the leukemic stem-like cells is described. The chapter closes with a few applications of this model to chronic myeloid leukemia.",

        "abstract": "Correlation has been widely accepted between quinolone resistance and topoisomerase point mutations in quinolone resistance determination regions (QRDRs). Acquirement of point mutations in QRDRs usually increases the microbial resistance to both nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones. The quinolone-resistant mechanisms accumulated in a lab-selected mutant were characterized through the construction of isogenic mutants using phage \u03bb Red recombinase system and phage P22. The function of a quinolone-resistant mechanism that increased resistance to fluoroquinolones, but decreased resistance to nalidixic acid was fully characterized. A previous reported point mutation in ParC (G78D) was identified in the lab-selected mutant LT2-128. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of isogenic mutants showed that acquirement of this point mutation in the host with topoisomerase mutations in GyrA could increase 8- to 32-fold fluoroquinolones MICs, but decrease eight-fold nalidixic acid MICs. Multiple-resistant mechanisms, such as the overexpressed effluxes, were accumulated besides the point mutations in QRDRs in LT2-128 during the mutant selection process. Through biological costs comparison among isogenic mutants, we found the biological cost in LT2-128 was not from the mutations in QRDRs, instead it was from other mutations accumulated during the mutant selection process, such as the mechanisms related to constitutively overexpressed effluxes. Mutation in ParC (G78D) was responsible for the increased resistance to fluoroquinolones, but decreased resistance to nalidixic acid. The existence of this mechanism demonstrated mutations in ParC could play different roles in nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistance.",

Afterward, one isolate of P. aeruginosa recovered from urine of an ambulatory patient in 1998 showed high resistance to imipenem and meropenem. The resistance to carbapenems in these strains was associated with the production of a class B beta-lactamase, as was demonstrated by imipenem hydrolysis and inhibition by EDTA. Using primers described for bla(IMP) and bla(VIM), the amplification of the latter was observed in all isolates and a VIM-2 metallo-enzyme was identified.

Emphasis was placed on extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR). Resistance-carrying plasmids were characterized in size, group of incompatibility and ability to conjugate. Isolates were compared by their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. Detailed description of 19 E. coli isolates with either ESBL or PMQR genes carried on multiresistant plasmids of different groups of incompatibility indicates that dogs, despite never being treated by antibiotics, are important reservoirs and transmitters of AMR in the study area.",

Susceptibility tests were carried out for 805 strains (697 Campylobacter jejuni and 108 Campylobacter coli) against nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, tetracycline, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol using the disk-diffusion method. Quinolone resistance was the most abundant overall (74.9%) and at each stage of production. The second largest resistance was for tetracycline with 48.2%. The resistance against amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol was not found. The percentages of resistance and multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates were always higher in the PBFs than in the GPBFs. However, pan-susceptible populations (total 10.3%) were isolated in our survey. C. coli isolates were more resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin (96.3% and 23.1%, respectively) than for C. jejuni (40.7% and 0%, respectively) and were more MDR (33.3% vs. 11.9%). In conclusion, as other authors have shown, even in the absence of antibiotic pressure, relatively high rates of quinolone resistance are found in Campylobacter. However, a decrease in quinolone resistance has been observed compared to other studies in Spain [i.e., 99%; Saenz et al. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44(2): 267-271]. MDR, fluoroquinolone-, macrolide-, and tetracycline-resistant Campylobacter populations are issues of concern in public health.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, several novel approaches have been developed to overcome tumor cell resistance to conventional therapeutics. Such approaches include genetic manipulations, vaccine development and exploitation of the anti-tumor host immune response. The overall development of tumor cell resistance to therapeutics is, in large part, the result of the ability of tumor cells to develop specific mechanisms to overcome cell death or apoptosis. Therefore, the possibility to interfere selectively in the regulation of the apoptotic signaling pathways may result in either the direct induction of cell death and/or sensitization of the cells to cytotoxic stimuli. A novel approach based on modifying gene products that regulate resistance to apoptosis involves nitric oxide (NO). NO is a ubiquitous molecule with diverse cellular effects that depend on the source, concentration, latency, cell type and phenotype. This review describes the role played by NO in cancer including carcinogenesis, pathogenesis, angiogenesis, chemoprevention and as a novel therapeutic to overcome resistance when used alone or as a sensitizing agent used in combination with other therapeutics. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A retrospective analysis on serotypes, biotypes, and antimicrobial resistance of Hi invasive strains obtained through Hi survey was conducted to document the characteristics of this pathogenic agent during a decade prior the use of Hib vaccine. A total 3,204 strains from 1990 to 1999 were studied, being 88.2% isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, 10.7% from blood, and 1.1% from pleural fluid. The rate of 90.9% of strains was obtained from children up to 4 years old, and the age group >6 months old to 1 year was the higher risk to Hi infection. Type b was, by far, the most common type (97.8%), followed in frequency by type a (0.5%); only 1.5% was a nontypable strain. Biotypes I and II accounted for 97.8% of isolates. Resistance to ampicillin (AM) and chloramphenicol (CO) was detected at rates of 18.1% and 19.1%, respectively, whereas simultaneous resistance to AM and CO was identified in 13.9% of strains. Total concordance was found between AM resistance and beta-lactamase production. No strain showed resistance to ceftriaxone and rifampicin. In conclusion, the data generated through this laboratory-based surveillance should serve as a reference for assessing the impact of Hib vaccination and to detect changes on the pattern of Hi diseases in the country.",

Fifty-nine strains showing resistance to at least one of the drugs were examined by PCR for the presence of class 1 integrons, which were identified in 17 strains. Integrons were found more frequently in strains belonging to serogroups O111 and O26 than in the O157 isolates. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that most of the integrons contained the aadA1 gene cassette conferring resistance to streptomycin/ spectinomycin, alone or associated with the drfA1 gene cassette conferring resistance to trimethoprim. One integron, identified in a O157:H7 strain, carried the aadA2 and dfrA12 gene cassettes, conferring resistance to streptomycin/spectinomycin and trimethoprim, and the open reading frame F (OrfF) encoding unknown functions. Most of the integrons were carried by Tn21 derivative transposons and were transferable by conjugation to an E. coli K-12 strain. In conclusion, integrons and antibiotic resistance genes can be frequently found in EHEC strains, particularly E. coli O111 and E. coli O26, and their presence could complicate therapeutic trials.",

If antimicrobial use is the major selective pressure encouraging the development of resistance, then reduced use should result in decreased resistance. We compared antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained from milk samples from 22 organic (nonantibiotic using) dairy herds to isolates from 16 conventional dairy herds. Susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion, and zone diameters were recorded in millimeters for 144 isolates from organic farms and 117 isolates from conventional farms and were also classified as susceptible or not-susceptible (intermediate and resistant categories combined). Strength of association between high or low use and proportion susceptible was evaluated by Chi-square analysis and differences in mean zone diameter for isolates from organic farms versus isolates from conventional farms were compared by analysis of variance. Analysis was done for each antimicrobial and deemed significant at p < or = 0.05. Differences in antimicrobial susceptibility were observed between S. aureus isolates from organic and conventional herds for seven of the nine antibiotics studied. Herds that were certified organic had S. aureus isolates that were more susceptible to antimicrobials. Overall, S. aureus isolates from both organic and conventional herds showed good susceptibility to most commonly used bovine mastitis antimicrobials; however, isolates from organic herds were significantly more susceptible. Longitudinal studies of herds undergoing the transition to organic farming would help elucidate the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance and the potential return of antimicrobial susceptibility.",

        "abstract": "We have previously observed high rates of acquired antibiotic resistance in commensal Escherichia coli from healthy children living in urban areas of Bolivia and Peru, including resistance to tetracycline and quinolones, which are not routinely used in childhood. In this work we investigated acquired resistance in commensal E. coli from healthy children and home-raised chickens in 12 households from one of the previously surveyed urban area in Bolivia, to ascertain the possibility of human-animal exchange of resistant strains in similar settings. The resistance rates to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and trimethoprim-sulphametoxazole were overall high (>=50%) and comparable between children and chickens, whereas those to quinolones were significantly higher in chickens (81% vs. 29% for nalidixic acid; 43% vs. 10% for ciprofloxacin). Molecular characterization of tetracycline- and quinolone-resistant isolates (n=66) from children and chickens of three selected households revealed a remarkable clonal diversity and, in some cases, the presence of the same resistant strains among children or among chickens living in the same household, but not between children and chickens. Several resistance plasmids were characterized, but inter-clonal plasmid dissemination was not detected. Overall, the results from the present study suggested that cross-transmission between children and home-raised chickens could not represent a major spreading mechanism for resistant E. coli in households of resource-limited settings with high human-animal promiscuity.",

We analyzed data of 2,033 women with a diagnosis of APN admitted to Catholic University St. Vincent's Hospital. Of those, we enrolled 274 cases of community-acquired uncomplicated APN due to Escherichia coli who received gentamicin as initial antibiotics. Of these 274 patients, 47 patients had gentamicin-resistant (GM-R) E. coli APN, and 227 patients had gentamicin-susceptible (GM-S) E. coli APN. The early clinical response rates were 55.3% (26/47) versus 81.5% (185/227) at 72 hours; 61.7% (29/47) versus 96.9% (220/227) at 96 hours in the GM-R and GM-S groups, which was significantly higher in the GM-S group (p < 0.001). Overall clinical cure rates were 100% (47/47) and 99.6% (226/227) in the GM-R and GM-S groups, respectively. APN patients in the GM-R group had longer hospitalization (9.72 +/- 3.46 and 7.89 +/- 2.27 days; p < 0.001) than those in the GM-S group. Resistance of E. coli to gentamicin, bacteremia, and C-reactive protein level showed independent effects on early clinical failure. Aminoglycoside such as gentamicin can be an alternative antibiotic option for initial empirical therapy of community-acquired uncomplicated APN as the fluoroquinolone-sparing or broad-spectrum cephalosporin-sparing agents in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, especially in areas where medical resources are limited or antibiotic resistance rate of the uropathogens is high.",

        "abstract": "Erythromycin-resistant Campylobacter organisms were isolated from swine, and their resistance to the antibiotic was characterized. One hundred fourteen Campylobacter organisms were isolated from 572 swine intestinal samples. All isolates were identified as Campylobacter coli by sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene and polymerase chain reactions with primers specific to hippuricase gene in Campylobacter jejuni and aspartokinase gene in C. coli. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of erythromycin were determined by using the agar dilution method, and 80 isolates were found to be resistant to erythromycin (MIC >= 4 mu g/ml). Of these, 31 isolates had low-level resistance (MIC =4-16 mu g/ml), and 49 isolates had high-level resistance (HLR, MIC >= 32 mu g/ml). The HLR isolates carried a point mutation at position A2075 -> G in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene, whereas the low-level resistance isolates carried no mutation. These 49 HLR isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing to study their genetic diversity. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified 16 distinct types with 50% genetic similarity as the cutoff. On the other hand, 28 different sequence types (STs), including 10 new STs, were identified with multilocus sequence typing. Forty-six of 49 erythromycin HLR isolates showed crossresistance to 6 macrolide derivatives. The correlation between the inhibitory activity of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and the existence of cmeB, which is responsible for efflux in HLR isolates, was found to be low. Erythromycin resistance was transferred from 38 of the 43 HLR isolates to susceptible C. coli by natural transformation, with a frequency of 1.217x10(-8)-4.618x10(-5) per recipient cell. All transformants were erythromycin resistant and had A2075 -> G mutation in at least one of three copies of the 23S rRNA gene. Results indicate that variable genotypes of HLR C. coli coexist in swine and high-level erythromycin resistance can be transferred to other strains.",

This mini-review briefly discusses its currently known functions in apoptosis and drug sensitivity. As an inhibitor of cell proliferation, p21WAF1/Cip1 plays an important role in drug-induced tumor suppression. Nevertheless, a number of recent studies have shown that p21WAF1/Cip1 can assume both pro- or anti-apoptotic functions in response to anti-tumor agents depending on cell type and cellular context. This dual role of p21WAF1/Cip1 in cancer cells complicates using p21WAF1/Cip1 status to predict response to anti-tumor agents. However, it is possible to develop p21WAF1/Cip1-targeted reagents or p21WAF1/Cip1 gene transfer techniques to have a beneficial effect within a well-defined therapeutic context. Better understanding of the roles of p21WAF1/Cip1 in tumors should enable a more rational approach to anti-tumor drug design and therapy.",

Point mutations were detected at codons 531, 516, 526, and 513 of the RNA polymerase beta- subunit gene (rpoB) in 10 (47.6%), five (23.8%), three (14.3%), and three (14.3%) of the 21 RIF-resistant isolates, respectively. Of the five isolates having mutations in codon 516, three also had mutations at codon 527; one had a concurrent mutation at codon 572. Mutations at codon 315 of the catalase-peroxidase-encoding gene (katG) were found in 17 (63.0%) of the 27 INH-resistant isolates. Interestingly, the katG codon 315 mutation was observed at a much higher frequency in MDR isolates than in INH-mono-resistant isolates ( approximately 79% vs. 25%). This study provided the first molecular characterization of INH and RIF resistance of M. tuberculosis clinical isolates from Eastern Turkey, and extended our knowledge of molecular basis of M. tuberculosis drug resistance.",

PCR-based assays to define ExPEC-associated traits were performed in resistant strains. Consumption of antimicrobial drugs by poultry in the Czech Republic was also analyzed.

Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnrB19 and qnrS1, were detected in 1 and 3 of 93 resistant isolates, respectively. Twenty-three percent of resistant isolates were considered as ExPEC. In total, 972 kg of flumequine, enrofloxacin, and difloxacin were used in poultry in the Czech Republic during 2008. High prevalence of broilers with ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates was linked to consumption of quinolones in poultry.

Susceptibility of 200 isolates from urine samples of patients suffering from urinary tract infections to 13 antibiotics was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The existence of class1 and 2 integrons in resistant isolates was assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing. Antibiotic resistance patterns were observed as follows: amoxicillin 78%, tetracycline 76.1%, co-trimoxazole 67.7%, cephalotin 60%, nalidixic acid 57.4%, chloramphenicol 49%, gentamicin 46.4%, ceftazidim 38.1%, ciprofloxacin 36.2%, nitrofurantoin 33.5%, amikacin 32.1%, norfloxacin 36.1%, and imipenem 27.1%. Of 200 isolates, 155 (77.5%) were multidrug resistant (MDR). The existence of integrons was confirmed in 50.3% of isolates. Three class 1 integron types, aadA2 being the most frequently found, and four class 2 integron types are described. Significant association between resistance to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, cephalotin, ceftazidim, imipenem, chloramphenicol, and nalidixic acid with the existence of integrons was observed. Multidrug resistance suggests that the strategy for treatment of patients with E.coli infections needs to be revised. Furthermore, it was shown that integrons may be partly responsible for multidrug resistance. Imipenem and norfloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against isolates.",

The production of GES-5 was observed in 1.25% of HSP isolates. No extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-encoding genes were detected in the VCU isolates. Expression of efflux systems genes (mexB, mexD, mexF, and mexY) was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR.

Acquired resistance to streptomycin was detected in 83%, to oxytetracycline in 81%, and to trimethoprim in 71% of the isolates, as indicated by a bimodal distribution of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these antimicrobials. The MICs of enrofloxacin displayed a monomodal distribution with tailing toward the higher MIC values, possibly indicating reduced susceptibility of a minority of isolates (3 out of the 64). For the quinolone antimicrobial agents flumequin and oxolinic acid, acquired resistance was encountered in 8% and 6% of the strains, respectively. All strains were intrinsically resistant to the polypeptide antimicrobial agent colistin. Seventy-three percent of the isolates were shown to have acquired resistance to at least three antimicrobial agents.

        "abstract": "Today's drug therapy regimens rely on the anticipated relation between drug dose, acquired plasma level and desired effect. However, the capacity of individual patients to absorb and metabolise drugs may differ significantly, part of which is due to genetic factors. These genetic factors can be used to predict the drug metabolizing potential of patients before starting therapy. A major challenge is to identify the genetic polymorphisms which are relevant for a particular therapy and to determine the clinical consequences with respect to dosing, or choice of drug, based on the outcome of pharmacogenetic analyses. For the cytochrome P450 system, which catalyzes oxidative reactions, many new genetic polymorphisms have been identified in the last years. In this review, the current knowledge of cytochrome P450 polymorphisms with respect to cancer treatment is described, highlighting the potential of reaching considerable benefit from personalized therapy, either by improving efficacy or reducing the toxicity of current treatment regimens. This review specifically addresses the knowledge today on cytochrome P450 pharmacogenetics for tamoxifen, docetaxel, paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, imatinib, gefitinib, irinotecan, etoposide, teniposide, thalidomide and vincristine therapies, discussing its current potential for individualized therapy based on cytochrome P450 genetic polymorphisms. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Challenge with sublethal doses of antibiotics also increased proteolytic activity of biofilm cells. Additionally, the LPS profile of P. aeruginosa showed pattern alterations of the biofilm that can contribute to biofilm resistance and survival. These observations provide evidence for the involvement of bacterial proteolytic activity and LPS profile in the resistance of biofilm bacteria to antibiotics compared to their planktonic counterparts.",

Amino acid alterations were found in GyrB in five strains and in ParE in three strains with MIC of norfloxacin > or = 8 mg/L, and it is likely that some of the alterations contribute to the quinolone resistance exhibited by these strains. Seventeen of the 20 strains overproduced mRNA for one or more pump proteins (MexB, MexD, MexF, or MexY), which caused multidrug resistance phenotype in more than half of strains. Two strains were hypermutable and one of them was highly resistant, but the other strain was only moderately resistant",

Studies have suggested that resistance and recurrence of Lyme disease might be due to formation of different morphological forms of B. burgdorferi, namely round bodies (cysts) and biofilm-like colonies. Better understanding of the effect of antibiotics on all morphological forms of B. burgdorferi is therefore crucial to provide effective therapy for Lyme disease.",

In the present study, both aspects were investigated for 141 Pasteurella multocida and 34 Mannheimia haemolytica sensu lato isolates recovered from the upper respiratory tract of healthy calves. This was performed on the one hand by comparing of classical phenotyping with tDNA-PCR genotyping and on the other hand by pairwise comparison of disk diffusion with agar dilution results for seven antimicrobial compounds (ampicillin, ceftiofur, oxytetracycline, gentamicin, florfenicol, enrofloxacin, and the combination trimethoprim-sulfonamides). Phenotyping and genotyping correlated well (>90%). The pairwise comparisons of the susceptibility methods were investigated traditionally by means of error binding rates and sensitivity and specificity test characteristics. Obtained sensitivities (indication for absence of false susceptible results) were often lower than 85%, especially for older antimicrobial agents (oxytetracycline, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfonamides) and when M. haemolytica sensu lato was considered. Specificities (indication for absence of false-resistant results) exceeded 90% for almost all antimicrobial-bacterial combinations. The calculated test characteristics (sensitivities and specificities) were subsequently used in a second dataset of Pasteurellaceae from intensively (n = 99) and extensively housed calves (n = 196), to modify the apparent prevalence of antimicrobial resistance based upon disk diffusion results into an estimated true prevalence. It was concluded that the disk diffusion method is reliable in epidemiological studies like surveillance programs if resistance is sparse, whereas it needs to be interpreted with caution in situations where resistance is abundantly present.",

About 20.5% of these isolates presented blaVIM-2, which was found to be widespread in both hospitals. Clonal diversity was observed within hospitals, and no interhospital spread was observed. Ten of the blaVIM-2-positive isolates (44%), from both hospitals, presented one or two class 1 integrons.

Susceptibility of Acinetobacter baumanii improved relating to gentamicin, but it worsened in relation to imipenem, subsequent to this restriction. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, there was no change in antimicrobial susceptibility. For Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp, there were improvements in susceptibility relating to ciprofloxacin.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Restriction of cefepime use had a positive impact on K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp, given that after this restriction, their susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin improved.

Prevalence was estimated in plate count agar (PCA) and R2A media with or without antibiotics. Clonal relatedness of isolates was established by repetitive extragenic palindroitic (REP)-PCR. Phylogeny was based on the 16S rRNA gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by disc diffusion methods. Genes encoding beta-lactamases and integrases were inspected by PCR. CRB ranged from 0.02% to 15.9% of cultivable bacteria, while ampicillin-resistant bacteria ranged from 1.5% to 31.4%. Carbapenem-resistant isolates affiliated with genera Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas, Janthinobacterium, Chryseobacterium, Sphingobacterium, Acidovorax, Caulobacter, Cupriavidus, and Sphingomonas. CRB were highly resistant to beta-lactams, but mostly susceptible to other classes. Transmissible beta-lactamase genes and integrase genes were not detected. The genus-specific bla(L1) was detected in 61% of the Stenotrophomonas isolates. Contrarily to what has been reported for extensively used antibiotics, low levels of carbapenem resistance were detected in untreated drinking water, often represented by intrinsically resistant genera. Production of chromosomal-encoded carbapenemases was the prevalent carbapenem resistance mechanism. Results suggest that the dissemination of anthropogenic-derived carbapenem resistance is at an early stage. This presents an opportunity to rationally develop monitoring strategies to identify dissemination routes and assess the impact of human actions in the environmental resistome.",

Iberian wolf, due to his predatory and wild nature, may serve as an important indicator of environmental contamination with antimicrobial resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to characterize the diversity of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli isolates within the fecal microbiota of Iberian wolf. Additionally, the identification of other associated resistance genes, phylogenetic groups, and the detection of virulence determinants were also focused on in this study. From 2008 to 2009, 237 fecal samples from Iberian wolf were collected in Portugal. E. coli isolates with TEM-52, SHV-12, CTX-M-1, and CTX-M-14-type ESBLs were detected in 13 of these samples (5.5%). This study reveals the presence of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates, in a wild ecosystem, which could be disseminated through the environment. Moreover, the presence of resistant genes in integrons and the existence of virulence determinants were shown. The association between antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants should be monitored, as it constitutes a serious public health problem.",

This is largely due to the spread of genes encoding extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes that can inactivate many cephalosporins. Recently, these resistance mechanisms have been identified in Salmonella isolated from humans in the United States. Due to the potential for trans- mission of resistant bacteria to humans via food animals, Salmonella animal isolates were monitored for ESBL production. During 2000\u20132004, Salmonella cattle slaughter isolates (n\u00bc3,984) were tested, and 97 (2.4%) of these were found to have decreased susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] >32 mg=ml) to the third- generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone. The majority of these were serotypes Newport (58) and Agona (14), some of which were genetically indistinguishable by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. None of the isolates had an ESBL phenotype; all were susceptible to the fourth-generation cephalosporins cefepime and cefquinome. PCR and sequence analysis for resistance genes detected the blaCMY-2 gene in 93 isolates and the blaTEM-1 gene in 12 isolates; however, neither gene encodes an ESBL. These data indicate that bovine Salmonella isolates from the United States with decreased susceptibility or resistance to ceftriaxone do not exhibit an ESBL phenotype and most contain the blaCMY-2 gene",

Sixteen MRSA isolates (one/sample) were recovered from nasal samples of dogs, and they were typed by molecular methods (S. aureus protein A [spa]-, multilocus sequence typing-, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec-typing). MRSA isolates were investigated for their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents by disk-diffusion test. The presence of resistance genes and of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene (lukF-lukS) was analyzed by PCR. Four different spa-types were identified among our MRSA isolates (t032, t432, t747, and t4726), with t032 as the most frequently detected. The sequence-type ST22 was identified in four tested MRSA isolates with different spa-types. All 16 isolates presented the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type IV. Most of MRSA isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and clindamycin (94%-100%), and no resistance was identified to chloramphenicol, mupirocin, and trimethoprim-sulfametoxazole. The ermC and tetM resistance genes were detected in all MRSA isolates. The amino acid changes Ser84Leu in GyrA protein and Ser80Phe in GrlA protein were the most prevalent ones in our MRSA isolates.

Tet(M) was the most frequent TET resistance gene; msr(C) was the sole ERY resistance gene detected. blaZ was found in 29/45 AMP-resistant isolates; however, no \u03b2-lactamase production was detected. Antibiotic-resistant enterococci were recovered 2\u2009km off the coast despite the absence of selective pressure exerted by antibiotic use. The occurrence of resistant strains in the absence of the tested genes may indicate the presence of less common resistance determinants. This first evidence of resistant enterococci at a Mediterranean aquaculture site suggests the existence of a marine reservoir of antibiotic resistances potentially transmissible to virulent strains that could be affected by mariculture in an antibiotic-independent manner.",

        "abstract": "To screen for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) colonization in hospitalized patients and to study molecular evolution and alterations of Tn1546-like elements in VRE among potentially at-risk patients, a 3-year surveillance protocol in an Intensive Care Unit was performed. A total of 397 patients were screened in the period June, 1997-June, 2000, and VRE were isolated from rectal swabs taken at admission, weekly, and when clinically indicated. The susceptibility of the enterococci was determined by the disk diffusion and broth dilution methods. The presence of vancomycin-resistance genes (vanA, vanB, and vanC) was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); genetic clonality of isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE); Tn1546 types were obtained by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of Tn1546 PCR fragments. Thirty-four strains, 31 identified as Enterococcus faecium and 3 strains as E. faecalis, were isolated from 12 of the 397 patients (3.0%); all strains were VanA as assessed by PCR and were resistant to the other antibiotics tested and showed high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. Enterococci isolated during the study period showed that different genetic backgrounds of strains, determined by PFGE combined with RFLP of Tn1546, are present in all the strains isolated in the study. PFGE type B was predominant in 1998 and 1999, and insertion sequence movements were found to have a role in the evolution of VanA resistance elements found in all strains. This study demonstrates that single patients may be colonized by closely related VRE with several PFGE types containing a wide variety of VanA elements. Moreover, isolates with identical PFGE types may contain different VanA elements reflecting rearrangements mediated by insertion sequences in VRE strains during their stay in the gastrointestinal tract.",

A total of 167 S. pneumoniae invasive isolates (received between 1994 and 1999 in 9 hospitals in Bogota, Medellin and Cali) with diminished susceptibility to penicillin (DSP) were studied. The techniques used were pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) genes (2B, 2X, and 1A). 49 serotype 23F isolates were grouped in 2 clusters: 15 (31%) multiresistant isolates showed PFGE pattern A and PBP I profile, thus making them indistinguishable from Spain<sup>23F</sup>-1 clone, and 34 (69%) with PFGE pattern C, PBP II profile, and intermediate level resistance (ILR) to penicillin and TMP-SMX, features unique to a Colombian clone. 55 serotype 14 isolates were assigned to PFGE B pattern, PBP III profile, having high-level resistance to penicillin, and TMP-SMX, similar to the France<sup>9V</sup> variant 14. This same pattern was present in 5 capsular type 9V isolates. Four serotype 14 isolates were assigned to PFGE pattern F, and appeared to be similar to Slovakia<sup>14</sup>-10 PFGE pattern, although they had different PBP profiles. Nine capsular type 6B and one 6A isolates belonged to PFGE pattern M, similar to Spain<sup>6B</sup>-2, although they showed different PBP profiles. The remaining 44 isolates, corresponding to serotypes 14, 6B, 19F, and 34, showed variable PFGE and PBP patterns. These results show that as many as 2 international clones may be circulating in Colombia as well as a unique, widely distributed 23F clone with ILR to penicillin. Additionally, some Colombian isolates capsular type 14 and 6B might be related to Slovakia<sup>14</sup>-10 Spain<sup>6B</sup>-2 clones, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobials are an extremely valuable resource across the spectrum of modern medicine. Their development has been associated with dramatic reductions in communicable disease mortality and has facilitated technological advances in cancer therapy, transplantation, and surgery. However, this resource is threatened by the dwindling supply of new antimicrobials and the global increase in antimicrobial resistance. There is an urgent need for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) to protect our remaining antimicrobials for future generations. AMS emphasizes sensible, appropriate antimicrobial management for the benefit of the individual and society as a whole. Within the English National Health Service (NHS), a series of recent policy initiatives have focused on all aspects of AMS, including best practice guidelines for antimicrobial prescribing, enhanced surveillance mechanisms for monitoring antimicrobial use across primary and secondary care, and new prescribing competencies for doctors in training. Here we provide a concise summary to clarify the current position and importance of AMS within the NHS and review the evidence base for AMS recommendations. The evidence supports the impact of AMS strategies on modifying prescribing practice in hospitals, with beneficial effects on both antimicrobial resistance and the incidence of Clostridium difficile, and no evidence of increased sepsis-related mortality. There is also a promising role for novel diagnostic technologies in AMS, both in enhancing microbiological diagnosis and improving the specificity of sepsis diagnosis. More work is needed to establish an evidence base for interventions to improve public and patient education regarding the role of antibiotics in common clinical syndromes, such as respiratory tract infection. Future priorities include establishing novel approaches to antimicrobial management (eg, duration of therapy, combination regimens) to protect against resistance and working with the pharmaceutical industry to promote the development of new antimicrobials.",

        "abstract": "Molecularly targeted therapies aim to interfere with molecular mechanisms, selectively involved in carcinogenesis and tumor growth in order to optimize the efficacy and minimize the side effects of anticancer treatment. In the last decade, several receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have become approved for therapeutic use in hematological malignancies as well as solid tumors. However, a major challenge remains in the selection of patients most likely to respond to these agents. Successful examples of personalizing molecularly targeted therapies based on biomarkers include the use of trastuzumab in HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer and imatinib in c-KIT expressing gastrointestinal stromal tumor. In contrast, EGFR and anti-angiogenic TKIs have mostly been evaluated in unselected patient groups and so far no biomarkers that predict or reflect the efficacy of these TKIs have been validated in clinical practice. Nevertheless, potential biomarkers, including EGFR gene copy number and the absence of K-ras mutations for anti-EGFR agents, and functional imaging for anti-angiogenic agents, have been identified. These biomarkers await validation in randomized phase III trials to confirm their value in predicting drug efficacy. In order to maximize efficiency in the search for valid predictive biomarkers, there is an urgent need for the standardization of their assessment, as well as the techniques employed in their assays. This article will focus on studies that address biomarker discovery or validation for EGFR and anti-angiogenic TKIs, differentiating those markers that predict for drug efficacy (predictive markers) from those that reflect drug mechanisms of action or effects (pharmacodynamic markers). ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The emergence of resistance to the carbapenems, the last resort antibiotic for difficult to treat bacterial infections, affords clinicians few therapeutic options, with a resulting increase in morbidities, mortalities, and healthcare costs. However, the molecular epidemiology of carbapenemases throughout Africa is less described. Research articles and conference proceedings describing the genetic environment and molecular epidemiology of carbapenemases in Africa were retrieved from Google Scholar, Scifinder, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases. Predominant carbapenemase genes so far described in Africa include the blaOXA-48 type, blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaNDM in Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter spp., and Escherichia coli carried on various plasmid types and sizes, transposons, and integrons. Class D and class B carbapenemases, mainly prevalent in A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, Citrobacter spp., and E. coli were the commonest carbapenemases. Carbapenemases are mainly reported in North and South Africa as under-resourced laboratories, lack of awareness and funding preclude the detection and reporting of carbapenemase-mediated resistance. Consequently, the true molecular epidemiology of carbapenemases and their genetic environment in Africa is still unknown.",

Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of E. coli were assessed. All 38 cefotaxime-resistant (CTX-R) isolates were found to be extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-positive by the double-disc synergy test. Thirty-two of those isolates produced enzymes of CTX-M-1 family, five of CTX-M-9 family, and one isolate both CTX-M types. Genotyping by multilocus sequence typing classified all ESBL-producing isolates into 13 sequence types (STs). ST131 was the most prevalent and was exclusively correlated with E. coli belonging to the more-virulent phylogroup B2. blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-9-like genes were mainly carried by plasmids belonging to the IncF group, while replicon I1 was predominant among CTX-M-1-encoding plasmids. Additionally, 63% of the ESBL-producing isolates were also resistant to ciprofloxacin. Sequence analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA and parC revealed the presence of amino acid substitutions in 22 out of 23 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. The acc(6')-Ib-cr and qnrB1 plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were also detected in some of the isolates.

Chemo-resistance remains a major problem in the treatment of NSCLC patients with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore main research efforts are focused on the development of novel targeted agents. In this review we provide an overview on the use of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor targeting agents in NSCLC models and in early clinical studies. Different TRAIL receptor targeting agents are available which have been tested in NSCLC models and some were tested in the clinic. The efficacy of these drugs as single agents in NSCLC models is discussed as well as different mechanisms of resistance that are found in NSCLC cell lines. In order to maximize sensitivity to TRAIL receptor targeting drugs, combined use with other drugs is of interest. The current status of tested combinations of TRAIL receptor targeting agents with other therapeutics, such as classical cytotoxics, Bcl-2 family targeting agents, proteasome inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors and COX-2 inhibitors as well as their mechanisms in preclinical studies are discussed.

Methods: Seventy six P. aeruginosa and 75 A. baumannii isolates were collected from three University affiliated hospitals in Tehran. MIC determination of amikacin and gentamicin as well as the disk diffusion method for tobramycin, netilmicin, and kanamycin were carried out. Nine AMEs genes and three RNA methylases were investigated in all isolates using the PCR method. Clonality for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa was investigated using repetitive extragenic palindromic and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, respectively. Results: aph(3')-VIa (90.6%) and aph(3')-IIb (61.8%) were the most prevalent AME genes in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Eight (26%) amikacin highly resistant A. baumannii isolates were positive for armA methylase. Phenotypes and clonality did not link to the genetic determinants of resistance to aminoglycosides in our isolates. Conclusions: AMEs genes are disseminated in different clones of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates in Iran. Other than AMEs, there are more complex and multifactorial mechanisms that result in aminoglycoside-resistant phenotypes.",

Three household aggregates (HA A, B, and C) were selected for this study. Information was collected on individual and clinical parameters of both humans and animals that cohabit. For this study, samples of feces, oral secretions, skin and fur of pets, as well as owners' feces and hands and exposed household surfaces and objects were also collected. All enterococci isolates were analyzed for antimi-crobial susceptibility. Based on the antimicrobial resistance patterns and origin of isolates, ERIC-PCR analysis was performed on selected isolates to evaluate phylogenetic relationships. In all three HA, Enterococcus faecalis clonal spread was detected between pets and the respective owners, confirming the in-home interanimal species dis-semination. Additionally, fecal enterococci colonization of other body parts of the same animal and dissemination of those same enterococci to household surfaces and objects were also observed. Our results demonstrate that enterococcal clones were found in pets in multiple body sites, their human cohabitants, and shared domestic objects.",

TEM and CTX-M beta-lactamase genes were the most prevalent. One hundred and forty-four E. coli and 35 K. pneumoniae were positive for the class 1 integrase gene; among them, 99 E. coli and 14 K. pneumoniae detected gene cassettes. Gene cassette regions were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysis. Eleven distinct gene cassette arrays were found in E. coli isolates, and seven distinct gene cassette arrays were found in K. pneumoniae isolates. The cassette array aacA4-catB8-aadA1 was first found in E. coli and dfrA1-orfC was first reported in K. pneumoniae. Most of the gene cassettes found in this class 1 integrons were for aminoglycoside resistance. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction fingerprint patterns revealed the isolates carrying gene cassettes were genetically unrelated. In conclusion, we studied the class 1 integrons among urinary isolates of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae in Southern China during the past 5 years and found that class 1 integrons were widely disseminated and played a major role in antibiotic resistance.",

An increase in resistance to these agents would render many infections untreatable. We tested the activity of polymyxin B and the novel polymyxin analogue CB-182,804 against over 5,000 recent Gram-negative clinical isolates from New York City, a region with a high prevalence of multiresistant strains. Over 96% of Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa were susceptible to polymyxin B; only 76% of Enterobacter spp. was susceptible. The MICs of CB-182,804 were generally two-fold higher than polymyxin B and cross-resistance was observed. The addition of rifampin resulted in synergistic inhibition and bactericidal activity in time kill studies, and restored activity against all polymyxin-resistant strains. The synergistic effect of the combination with rifampin was most pronounced against A. baumannii strains, and was slightly greater with CB-182,804 than with polymyxin B against K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. Despite considerable usage of polymyxin B and colistin in this region, polymyxin B retains excellent activity against most Gram-negative isolates. CB-182,804 shows similar activity, particularly when combined with rifampin. The clinical utility of CB-182,804 remains to be determined.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The characteristics and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Staphylococcus aureus differs according to geographical regions and in relation to antibiotic usage. The aim of this study was to determine the biochemical characteristics of the prevalent S. aureus from Ekiti State, Nigeria, and to evaluate three commonly used disk diffusion methods (cefoxitin, oxacillin, and methicillin) for the detection of methicillin resistance in comparison with mecA gene detection by polymerase chain reaction.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 208 isolates of S. aureus recovered from clinical specimens were included in this study. Standard microbiological procedures were employed in isolating the strains. Susceptibility of each isolate to methicillin (5 \u03bcg), oxacillin (1 \u03bcg), and cefoxitin (30 \u03bcg) was carried out using the modified Kirby-Bauer/Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute disk diffusion technique. They were also tested against panels of antibiotics including vancomycin. The conventional polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect the presence of the mecA gene.\\n\\nRESULTS: Phenotypic resistance to methicillin, oxacillin, and cefoxitin were 32.7%, 40.3%, and 46.5%, respectively. The mecA gene was detected in 40 isolates, giving a methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) prevalence of 19.2%. The S. aureus isolates were resistant to penicillin (82.7%) and tetracycline (65.4%), but largely susceptible to erythromycin (78.8% sensitive), pefloxacin (82.7%), and gentamicin (88.5%). When compared to the mecA gene as the gold standard for MRSA detection, methicillin, oxacillin, and cefoxitin gave sensitivity rates of 70%, 80%, and 100%, and specificity rates of 76.2%, 69.1%, and 78.5% respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: When compared with previous studies employing mecA polymerase chain reaction for MRSA detection, the prevalence of 19.2% reported in Ekiti State, Nigeria in this study is an indication of gradual rise in the prevalence of MRSA in Nigeria. A cefoxitin (30 \u03bcg) disk diffusion test is recommended above methicillin and oxacillin for the phenotypic detection of MRSA in clinical laboratories.",

        "abstract": "Eighty-four multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (MDR-KP) isolates from a Chinese hospital from January to October 2012 were evaluated to characterize the coexistence of 16S rRNA methylase, extended-spectrum b-lactamase, carbapenemase, and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants and their association with mobile genetic elements. Among the 84 MDR-KP isolates studied, 19 isolates exhibited high-level resistance to amikacin mediated by the production of the 16S rRNA methylase. They carried 19 armA genes (22.9%) and three rmtB genes (3.6%). CTX-M genes were found in all of the isolates. Among these armA-or rmtB/CTX-M-producing K. pneumoniae isolates, 31.6% carried the carbapenemase genes (bla KPC-2 [26.3%], bla IMP-4 [10.5%], and bla NDM-1 [5.3%]), which made them resistant to imipenem (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 16 mg/L). All positive strains possessed qnr-like genes (16 qnrA1, 10 qnrS1, and 7 qnrB4 genes) and 18 harbored an aac(6\u00a2)-Ib-cr gene. Mobile elements ISEcp1, IS26, ISCR1, ISAba125, and sul-1 integrons were detected in 19/19 (100%), 16/19 (84.2%), 18/19 (94.7%), 9/19 (47.4%), and 18/19 (94.7%) isolates, respectively. The mobilizing elements occurred in different combinations in the study isolates. Ma-jority of armA and qnr genes were in MDR-KP strains carrying integrons containing the ISCR1. Close to 80% of bla TEM-1 and bla SHV-12 were linked to IS26 while 90% of bla CTX-Ms and bla CMYs were linked to ISEcp1. ISAba125 was located upstream of bla NDM-1 and some bla CMY-2 genes. In addition, seven transconjugants were available for further analysis, and armA, qnrS1, acc(6\u00a2)-Ib-cr, bla CTX-M-15 , bla TEM-1 , and bla NDM-1 were co-transferred. This study points to the dissemination of 16S rRNA methylase genes and the prevalence of selected elements implicated in evolution of resistance determinants in collection of clinical K. pneumoniae in China.",

The occurrence of random E. coli isolates recovered from MacConkey agar plates with non-wild-type minimal inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime and ceftazidime reached 0.6% in layers, 2.3% in turkey, and 4.7% in broilers, whereas all cattle and pigs isolates fell into the wild-type subpopulation. The use of MacConkey agar supplemented with cefotaxime (2 mg/L) increased the recovery of resistant strains up to 33.3% of samples from pigs, 42.3% from layers, 48.0% from turkey, and 54.5% from broilers. Still, no cephalosporin-resistant E. coli was found in cattle. E-test identified extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and ampC-type resistance phenotypes in 15 and 33 strains, respectively. Molecular characterization identified CTX-M-1 gene in 13 ESBL strains, 5 of which possessed also TEM-1b. One strain harbored SHV-12 gene. CMY-2 was found in all of 20 tested ampC-type cephalosporinase-positive strains either alone (n = 14) or in combination with mutations in ampC promoter region (n = 6). CTX-M-1 and CMY-2 genes were noted also in five strains from laying hens and broilers originated from Belgium and Germany. Nosocomial infections in Poland are caused by E. coli carrying other determinants than those found in our study. Thus, our results indicate that animals colonized with cephalosporin-resistant strains might not be the major source of human infections in Poland. However, the contribution to community-acquired infections by spread of resistant clones or resistance genes may not be excluded.",

        "abstract": "Deficiencies in the oxygenation of solid tumors are associated with poor patient prognosis due to changes in cell metabolism, angiogenesis, invasiveness and resistance to therapy. Work over the past 10 years has defined several distinct oxygen sensing pathways that together determine the cellular response to hypoxia. These include both a transcriptional response initiated by oxygen-dependent stabilisation of the HIF-1 transcription factor and an mRNA translational response characterized by activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and inhibition of mTOR signalling. Laboratory experiments have established the importance of these hypoxic response pathways for tumor growth and resistance to treatment. This has led to the development of agents aimed at targeting hypoxic response pathways in tumors, several of which are in clinical trials. However, several important features of the tumor microenvironment that may affect the success of these new therapies have not been thoroughly evaluated. Oxygenation patterns in human tumors have proven to be highly complex, leading to a large degree of heterogeneity with respect to the severity and duration of hypoxic exposure. Because both of these properties strongly influence the known cellular responses to hypoxia, this heterogeneity is expected to be a strong determinant of the fate of hypoxic cells and the success of new hypoxia-directed therapies. Here we summarize the important oxygen response pathways that currently serve as targets for therapy and their dependence on the specific oxygenation patterns that are expected in human tumors. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Two of the 12 patients died from infections caused by KPC-2-producing pathogens, while the rest of the patients with KPC-2-producing pathogens improved or were cured. The majority of the clinical isolates exhibited a high-level of resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and carbapenems, and possessed self-transferable bla KPC-2 -carrying plasmids with sizes ranging from 20 to 120 kb. Most isolates carried bla CTX-M and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, while some isolates produced 16S rRNA methylases (ArmA or RmtB). The genetic environment of bla KPC-2 of most clinical strains was consistent with the genetic structure surrounding bla KPC-2 on the plasmid pKP048, which contains an integration structure of a Tn3-based transposon and partial Tn4401 segment. Inserted fragments (truncated bla TEM) were detected upstream of the bla KPC-2 gene for two E. aerogenes strains. In conclusion, the enterobacterial isolates exhibited sporadic emergence and did not arise by clonal spread at our hospital. The outcome of infections caused by KPC-producing enterobacterial isolates and their mortality were closely associated with the baseline condition of patients. The spread of bla KPC-2 gene between different enterobacterial species in China was mainly mediated by horizontal transfer of the Tn3-based transposons and not the bla KPC-2 -carrying plasmids.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objective: AmpC in Escherichia coli is noninducible but is regulated by promoter and attenuator mechanisms and can be expressed at high levels as a result of a mutation. This study was undertaken to characterize the AmpC hyperproducing clinical isolates of E. coli. Methods: E. coli isolates recovered from three major hospitals in Zahedan, South Eastern Iran, were selected on the basis of resistance phenotype to the third-generation cephalosporins and cefoxitin. Phenyl boronic acid as an inhibitor and cefoxitin were used to confirm the overexpression of AmpC. The presence of genes encoding ACC, FOX, MOX, DHA, CIT, and EBC was detected using multiplex PCR. The existence of mutations in the regulatory region of the chromosomal ampC gene was assessed using PCR and sequencing. Results: Thirteen of 392 E. coli isolates were selected as high-level AmpC producers. Eleven of the 13 isolates contained the blaCMY-2 gene; 12 of the 13 AmpC hyperproducing strains harbored changes in the promoter/attenuator region, which could explain the increased expression of the chromosome-encoded AmpC enzyme. In 10 of the 13 strains, we found both chromosomal- and plasmid-mediated mechanisms responsible for AmpC production. Interpretation and Conclusions: AmpC hyperproducing E. coli isolates exhibit significant resistance to cephalosporins. This work showed that strains hyperproducing chromosomal AmpC could be as frequent as strains with plasmid-mediated AmpC hyperproduction.",

In Norway, the bacterium has mainly been isolated from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and brown trout (Salmo trutta L.). In the present study, 26 isolates from Norwegian farmed salmonids were examined. All isolates were tested for susceptibility towards various antibacterial drugs by the disk diffusion method, and minimum inhibitory concentration values for oxolinic acid and flumequine were established for selected isolates. All isolates from rainbow trout displayed reduced susceptibility towards quinolones, while brown trout and Atlantic salmon isolates were susceptible. The quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of the gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes were sequenced. Sequence analysis of the QRDR of gyrA in quinolone resistant isolates revealed a threonine:arginine amino acid substitution at position 82 in all 16 isolates from Norwegian rainbow trout and a single reference strain isolated from rainbow trout in Sweden. No evidence for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance was found in any of the isolates. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and phylogenetic analysis of parC and gyrB sequences indicate a clonal relationship between rainbow trout isolates. \u00a9 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Staphyloxanthin is a virulence factor which protects Staphylococcus aureus in stress conditions. We isolated two pigment variants of S. aureus and one strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from a single wound infection. S. aureus variants displayed white and yellow colony phenotypes. The sequence of the operons for staphyloxanthin synthesis indicated that coding and promoter regions were identical between the two pigment variants. Quorum sensing controls pigment synthesis in some bacteria. It is also shown that P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing molecules affect S. aureus transcription. We explored whether the co-infecting P. aeruginosa can affect pigment production in the white S. aureus variant. In co-culture experiments between the white variants and a selected number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, only P. aeruginosa induced pigment production in the white variant. Gene expression analysis of the white variant did not indicate upregulation of the crtM and other genes known to be involved in pigment production (sigB, sarA, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase gene [FPP-synthase], hfq). In contrast, transcription of the catalase gene was significantly upregulated after co-culture. P. aeruginosa-induced pigment synthesis and catalase upregulation correlated with increased resistance to polymyxin B, hydrogen peroxide, and the intracellular environment of macrophages. Our data indicate the presence of silent but functional staphyloxanthin synthesis machinery in a white phenotypic variant of S. aureus which is activated by a co-infecting P. aeruginosa via inter-species communication. Another S. aureus virulence factor, catalase is also induced by this co-infecting bacterium. The resulting phenotypic changes are directly correlated with resistance of the white variant to stressful conditions.",

Each isolate was biochemically identified and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method. A sorbitol fermentation test of all the E. coli isolates was done and the minimum inhibitory concentration of suspected STEC was measured by the standard broth microdilution method to determine antibiotic resistance. The genotypes of stx1, stx2, and hlyA were determined by polymerase chain reaction assay.\\n\\nRESULTS: The majority of subjects were aged \u226540 years (41.6%) and were female (61.9%). Of the 202 subjects, 86.1% had STEC isolates (P<0.05). A high rate of STEC isolates resistant to amoxicillin (90.6%), cefotaxime (77.7%), and cefuroxime (75.7%) was observed. Resistance to amoxicillin, gentamicin, and cefotaxime was demonstrated with a minimum inhibitory concentration >16 \u03bcg/mL in 13.9%, 11.4%, and 10.4% of the isolates, respectively. The prevalence of stx1, stx2, and hlyA was 13.9%, 6.9%, and 2.0%, respectively; 5.5% of stx1 were in the 0-10-year-old age group, 3.5% of stx2 were aged \u226540 and above, and 1.0% of the hlyA isolates were in the 0-10-year-old age group.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The prevalence of virulent STEC is a public health concern.

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. Despite many therapeutic opportunities, prognosis remains dismal for patients with metastatic disease, and a significant portion of early-stage patients develop recurrence after chemotherapy. Epigenetic gene regulation is a major mechanism of cancer initiation and progression, through the inactivation of several tumor suppressor genes. Emerging evidence indicates that epigenetics may also play a key role in the development of chemoresistance. In the present review, we summarize epigenetic mechanisms triggering resistance to three commonly used agents in colorectal cancer: 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. Those epigenetic biomarkers may help stratify colorectal cancer patients and develop a tailored therapeutic approach. In addition, epigenetic modifications are reversible through specific drugs: histone-deacetylase and DNA-methyl-transferase inhibitors. Preclinical studies suggest that these drugs may reverse chemoresistance in colorectal tumors. In conclusion, an epigenetic approach to colorectal cancer chemoresistance may pave the way to personalized treatment and to innovative therapeutic strategies. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

To determine if DST140 persists in Taiwan, we have used multilocus sequence typing to characterize the genetic profiles of 31 resistant isolates (MICs\u226564 \u00b5g/ml), together with 19 susceptible isolates (MICs\u226416 \u00b5g/ml) collected in TSARY 2006. Among the 50 isolates, 33 distinct DSTs were detected. Of the 31 resistant isolates, 11 (35.5%) belonged to two closely related DSTs (140 and 98), whereas none of the 19 susceptible isolates did (p=0.004). The isolates belonging to DST140 and 98 were from different geographic regions instead of a restricted area. Thus, our data show temporal and spatial transmission of C. tropicalis clones with high fluconazole MICs in Taiwan from 1999 to 2006.",

Indeed, cancer cells often present with mutations in the apoptotic machinery that result in resistance to most anticancer therapies and contribute to a relatively low response rate to therapies based on the use of pro-apoptotic strategies. (Macro-)autophagy can be a highly efficient mode of cell death induction by excessive self-digestion as demonstrated by our experiments that studied the effect of radiation to induce autophagy cell death in apoptosis-deficient cells. Despite current controversies on the possible role of autophagy in the process of carcinogenesis and cancer progression by promoting cell survival, autophagy can be seen as a backup cell death mechanism, when other cell death mechanisms fail. This review will focus on the pathways linking autophagy and cancer that are relevant for target identification and on pharmaceuticals that can be utilized to improve cancer therapy by targeting the autophagic pathway. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In general, the extracellular pH (pHe) in human tumors is below 7.0, whereas the intracellular pH (pHi) is maintained at neutral range, i.e.,>7.0, by powerful pHi control mechanisms. The low pHe and the significant gradients between pHe and pHi affect markedly the response of tumors to various treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hyperthermia. For instance, the acidic pHe increases the cellular uptake of weakly acidic drugs such as cyclophosphamide and cisplatin and thus increases the effect of the drugs, whereas the acidic pHe retards the uptake of weakly basic drug such as doxorubicin and vinblastine, thereby reducing the effect of the drugs. The radiationinduced apoptosis is suppressed by an acidic environment, whereas the hyperthermiainduced cell death is potentiated by an acidic environment. Better understanding of the control mechanisms of pHe and pHi in tumors may lead to device effective treatment strategy of human tumors.",

In this study, the prevalence and characteristics of cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin co-resistant Escherichia coli isolates were investigated in retail chicken and ground pork samples from four provinces of China. The isolates were subjected to phylogenetic group typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. All isolates were further characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine the genetic relatedness. These isolates were also screened for beta-lactamase genes, quinolone resistance determinants by PCR, and followed by DNA sequence analysis. Cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin co-resistant E. coli isolates with diverse genetic origins were recovered in 31.9% (106/332) of retail meat samples. E. coli isolates of phylogenetic group A were dominant (59.4%, 63/106), and all isolates showed multidrug resistant profiles. The dominant resistant profiles were AMP-CAZ-CTX-CIP-CHL-GEN-SXT-TET (n=43) and AMP-CAZ-CTX-CIP-CHL-SXT-TET (n=43). Point mutations in quinolone resistance determination regions of topoisomerases were identified in all the isolates, and most of the isolates accumulated three (n=78) or four (n=21) point mutations. Plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistant determinants were identified in 68 isolates, including oqxAB (n=66), qnrS1 (n=7), qnrS2 (n=4), and aac(6')-Ib-cr (n=9). Eight subtypes of blaCTX-M were identified in 103 E. coli isolates, and blaCTX-M-55 (n=90) was dominant.

Serotype 19A strains account for an increasing proportion of penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Sequential transformations of the Tenn (23F)-4 clone (penicillin MIC 0.1 mu g/ml) were performed with four penicillin-nonsusceptible serotype 19A international clones (penicillin MIC): S.

Fifty-two transformants were characterized by MICs, serogroup-specific PCR, pbp PCR restriction profile and sequence, pspA PCR restriction profile, and erm/mef PCR. A subset was analyzed with multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Serotype 23F transformants with penicillin MIC >= 8 mu g/ml were detected through a single transformation with the Hungary (19A)-6 clone or serial transformations using two to three different clones. Forty-four percent (14/32) of the transformants incorporated >= 1 new MLST allele. Using encapsulated donors, very-high-level penicillin-resistant variants of the Tenn (23F)-4 clone were detected. In addition to detecting stepwise increases in penicillin MIC, a 12-fold increase in penicillin MIC was achieved through a single transformation. This large increase in MIC may explain why this clone is commonly associated with very-high-level resistance in natural populations. Recombination within the MLST housekeeping genes was commonly detected in the transformants that had acquired penicillin resistance.",

Tumor growth can be promoted by PDGF via autocrine stimulation of malignant cells, by overexpression or overactivation of PDGFRs, or by stimulation of angiogenesis within the tumor. These mechanisms could provide possible therapeutic targets. PDGFR blockade may also lower the interstitial fluid pressure within solid tumors and enhance drug delivery. Here we discuss the possible therapeutic roles of PDGFR antagonists in the treatment of cancer, alone and in combination with chemotherapy or other targeted agents. Extensive experimental data highlight the potential therapeutic advantage of targeting PDGFR. However, recent clinical data suggest that antagonism of this growth factor is associated with fluid accumulation that could obscure any clinical benefit.

The efficacy of the drugs currently available for clinical use (amphotericin B and itraconazole) is limited and the frequent occurrence of therapeutic failures in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis emphasizes the need for the development of new agents. Cell wall biosynthetic pathways have been recognized for a long time as essential and unique specific drug targets. Recent studies of the chemical organization of the cell wall of A. fumigatus together with comparative analysis of yeast cell wall data have shown that beta 1-3 glucan branching and chitin-beta 1-3 glucan binding are essential exocellular enzymatic steps in cell wall biosynthesis. The enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and remodeling of cell wall polysaccharides especially in A. fumigatus are reviewed.",

Clavulanic acid restored the activity of expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, suggesting the production of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESbetaL). A crude extract of FL-424/98 showed the presence of two beta-lactamase activities focusing at pH 5.3 and 7.6, respectively. The ESbetaL activity, purified by means of three chromatographic steps, was found to correspond to the pI 5.3 enzyme. Determination of kinetic parameters confirmed that the enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam. A colony-blot hybridization revealed the presence of bla(PER)-related sequences in FL-424/98, and sequencing confirmed the identity of this determinant with bla(PER-1), previously detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, and Salmonella clinical isolates from Turkey. Finding of bla(PER-1) in a species that can be part of the resident human microbiota raises the possibility that it could be an efficient shuttle for spreading of this resistance gene among other opportunistic pathogens that are normally members of the resident microbiota. Kinetic parameters determined for the PER-1 enzyme with some cephalosporin substrates were somewhat different from those previously reported.",

However, little is known about the variability in antimicrobial susceptibility within a population of a single bacterial respiratory pathogen on a pig farm. This study examined the antimicrobial susceptibility of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae using multiple isolates within a pig and across the pigs in three different slaughter batches. Initially, the isolates from the three batches were identified, serotyped, and subsample genotyped. All the 367 isolates were identified as A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 1, and only a single genetic profile was detected in the 74 examined isolates. The susceptibility of the 367 isolates of A. pleuropneumoniae to ampicillin, tetracycline and tilmicosin was determined by a disc diffusion technique. For tilmicosin, the three batches were found to consist of a mix of susceptible and resistant isolates. The zone diameters of the three antimicrobials varied considerably among isolates in the second sampling. In addition, the second sampling provided statistically significant evidence of bimodal populations in terms of zone diameters for both tilmicosin and ampicillin. The results support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial susceptibility of one population of a porcine respiratory pathogen can vary within a batch of pigs on a farm.",

Three of the 112 fecal samples (2.7%) harbored ESBL-positive E. coli isolates and the blaCTX-M-1, blaTEM-52, and blaSHV-12 genes were identified in these isolates. The blaTEM-52-containing isolate showed a phenotype of multiresistance that included fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol; sul1, sul3, and cmlA genes were detected in this isolate, in addition to two amino acid changes in GyrA (Ser83Leu+Asp87Asn) and one in ParC protein (Ser80Ile). The ESBL isolates corresponded to phylogroup A (one isolate), B1 (one isolate), and D (one isolate). vanA-containing Enterococcus faecium isolates were detected in 13 of the 112 fecal samples (11.6%), and vanC-1 isolates were found in 2 samples. A diversity of resistance genes [(tet(M), tet(L), erm(B), aph(3\u2032)-IIIa, ant(6)-Ia, catA, and vat(E))] were found in VRE isolates.

For those patients in whom surgical resection is not possible, other therapeutic approaches are necessary. Disordered apoptosis has been linked to cancer development and treatment resistance. Apoptosis occurs via extrinsic or intrinsic signaling each triggered and regulated by many different molecular pathways. In recent years, the selective induction of apoptosis in tumor cells has been increasingly recognized as a promising approach for cancer therapy. A detailed understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of apoptosis is essential for developing novel effective therapeutic approaches. Apoptosis can be induced by many different approaches including activating cell surface death receptors (for example, Fas, TRAIL and TNF receptors), inhibiting cell survival signaling (such as EGFR, MAPK and PI3K), altering apoptosis threshold by modulating pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, down-regulating anti-apoptosis proteins (such as XIAP, survivin and c-IAP2), and using other pro-apoptotic agents.

Nine isolates were linked with hospitalization abroad. Molecular epidemiology was investigated by multilocus sequence typing, multiplex PCRs for major international clones/sequence groups (SGs), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. OXA-carbapenemase genes/genetic surroundings and class 1 integrons were examined by PCRs and sequencing. The isolates belonged to sequence type (ST) 2/international clone II (n=6), ST23/SG5 (n=2), ST25 (n=2), ST5/SG7 (n=1), and ST109 (n=2). OXA-58, OXA-23, and OXA-24 were detected in seven, five, and one isolate, respectively. Different genetic structures surrounded the bla(OXA-58-like) and bla(OXA-23-like) genes. Interestingly, ISAba825 was detected upstream bla(OXA-58-like) in two isolates. Class 1 integrons with three different variable regions (VR) were detected. VR1 (aacA4-orfO-bla(OXA-20)) was found in four isolates from ST2/international clone II, with three of them imported from Greece. VR2 (aadB-aadA1-IS) was detected in one ST5 isolate imported from Poland, and VR3 (bla(GES-11)-aacA4-dfrA7) was present in a nonimport ST25 isolate.

        "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that predominates during the later stages of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections. Over many years of chronic lung colonization, P. aeruginosa undergoes extensive adaptation to the lung environment, evolving both toward a persistent, low virulence state and simultaneously diversifying to produce a number of pheno-typically distinct morphs. These lung-adapted P. aeruginosa strains include the small colony variants (SCVs), small, autoaggregative isolates that show enhanced biofilm formation, strong attachment to surfaces, and increased production of exopolysaccharides. Their appearance in the sputum of CF patients correlates with increased resistance to antibiotics, poor lung func-tion, and prolonged persistence of infection, increasing their relevance as a subject for clinical investigation. The evolution of SCVs in the CF lung is associated with overproduction of the ubiquitous bacterial signaling molecule cyclic-di-GMP, with increased cyclic-di-GMP levels shown to be responsible for the SCV phenotype in a number of different CF lung isolates. Here, we review the current state of research in clinical P. aeruginosa SCVs. We will discuss the phenotypic characteristics underpinning the SCV morphotype, the clinical implications of lung colonization with SCVs, and the molecular basis and clinical evolution of the SCV phenotype in the CF lung environment.",

        "abstract": "By controlling ion fluxes at multiple time scales, ion channels shape rapid cell signals, such as action potential and synaptic transmission, as well as much slower processes, such as mitosis and cell migration. As is currently increasingly recognized, a variety of channel types are involved in cancer hallmarks, and regulate specific stages of neoplastic progression. Long-term in vitro work has established that inhibition of these ion channels impairs the growth of cancer cells. Recently, these studies have been followed up in vivo, hence revealing that ion channels constitute promising pharmacological targets in oncology. The channel proteins can be often accessed from the extracellular milieu, which allows use of lower drug doses and decrease untoward toxicity. However, because of the central physiological roles exerted by ion channels in excitable cells, other types of side effects may arise, the gravest of which is cardiac arrhythmia. A paradigmatic case is offered by K<inf>v</inf>11.1 (hERG1) channels. HERG1 blockers attenuate the progression of both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, but may also lead to the lengthening of the electrocardiographic QT interval, thus predisposing the patient to ventricular arrhythmias. These side effects can be avoided by specifically inhibiting the channel isoforms which are highly expressed in certain tumors, such as K<inf>v</inf>11.1B and the neonatal forms of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Preclinical studies are also being explored in breast and prostate cancer (targeting voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels), and gliomas (targeting CLC-3). Overall, the possible approaches to improve the efficacy and safety of ion channel targeting in oncology include: (1) the development of specific inhibitors for the channel subtypes expressed in specific tumors; (2) drug delivery into the tumor by using antibodies or nanotechnology-based approaches; (3) combination regimen therapy and (4) blocking specific conformational states of the ion channel. We believe that expanding this relatively neglected field of oncology research might lead to unforeseen therapeutic benefits for cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter spp. are important human pathogens. Serious infections due to these organisms are usually treated with extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs). However, in the past two decades we have faced a rapid increasing of infections and colonization caused by ESC-resistant (ESC-R) isolates due to production of extended-spectrum-\u03b2- lactamases (ESBLs), plasmid-mediated AmpCs (pAmpCs) and/or carbapenemase enzymes. This situation limits drastically our therapeutic armamentarium and puts under peril the human health. Animals are considered as potential reservoirs of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms. The massive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine has contributed to the selection of ESC-R E. coli, ESC-R Salmonella spp. and, to less extent, MDR Acinetobacter spp. among animals, food, and environment. This complex scenario is responsible for the expansion of these MDR organisms which may have life-threatening clinical significance. Nowadays, the prevalence of food-producing animals carrying ESC-R E. coli and ESC-R Salmonella (especially those producing CTX-M-type ESBLs and the CMY-2 pAmpC) has reached worryingly high values. More recently, the appearance of carbapenem-resistant isolates (i.e.; VIM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and NDM-1 or OXA-23-producing Acinetobacter spp.) in livestock has even drawn greater concerns. In this review, we describe the aspects related to the spread of the above MDR organisms among pigs, cattle, and poultry, focusing on epidemiology, molecular mechanisms of resistance, impact of antibiotic use, and strategies to contain the overall problem. The link and the impact of ESC-R organisms of livestock origin for the human scenario are also discussed. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Time-kill studies of the reference strains showed reduction rates from 3 log10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml to more than 5 log10 CFU/ml for 200 and 400 mg/L polyhexanide within 5-30 min. Testing of polyhexanide in combination with antibiotics showed indifference with amoxicillin, cefotaxime, imipenem, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin; no antagonism was found. As no resistance and no antagonism with antibiotics were detected, polyhexanide is regarded as suitable agent for topical eradication of gram-negative bacteria. \u00a9 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Resistance to anticancer drugs is often related to deficient cell death execution pathways in cancer cells. Apoptosis, which denotes a form of cell death executed by caspases, was traditionally considered as the only physiological and programmed form of cell death. However, recent evidence indicates that programmed cell death (PCD) can occur in complete absence of caspase activation. Indeed, a large number of caspase-independent models are now defined and a key protein implicated in this type of PCD, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), has been identified. AIF is a mitochondrial protein with two faces looking in opposite life/death directions. Recently, the identification of five different isoforms allowed a better characterization of AIFs life/mitochondrial versus death/nuclear functions, as well as definition of its pro-apoptotic region and some of its nuclear partners. Importantly, much work on caspase-independent PCD has revealed that AIF participates in more PCD systems than initially thought. A wider molecular knowledge of AIF, and of the caspase-independent PCDs in which it is involved, are key to provide new insights into the role of PCD. There is no doubt that these insights will lead to the development of more selective and efficient drugs against cancer, degenerative diseases, and other pathological disorders implicating AIF. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Isolates identified as ESBL producer by the Phoenix automated system were collected prospectively and sub- jected tomolecular analysis for the most common ESBLs TEM, SHV, and CTX-M, as well as OXA and GES. Both the Etest ESBL and double-disk synergy test were performed as confirmatory tests. The estimated prevalence of ESBLs was 2.1% in E. coli, 5.2% in K. pneumoniae, and 2.4% in K. oxytoca. TEM-12 and -26, SHV-5 and -12, and CTX-M groups 1 and 9 were the most frequent ESBLs found. Isolates identified as ESBLs by the Phoenix were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in only 42%. In ESBL PCR-positive E. coli and K. pneumoniae, both confirmatory tests were positive in 95% of the isolates. In 28% of the Etest and 13% of the double-disk synergy test-positive isolates, PCR could not detect any ESBL gene. In these cases, other resistance mechanisms may play a role. Confirmatory tests were unreliable for K. oxytoca. A previously described mutation in the K1 enzyme was detected in one ceftazidime-resistant K. oxytoca. The prevalence of ESBLs in The Netherlands is increasing. The predominant molecular types of ESBLs detected were comparable to other studies.

Nursing homes may be a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, we determined the prevalence of, and risk factors associated with, fecal carriage of CTX-M-type \u03b2-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae among nursing home residents. A total of 225 stool samples were collected for phenotypic and genotypic identification of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the risk factors associated with fecal carriage of CTX-M producers. The prevalence of CTX-M-type ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, as confirmed by phenotypic and genotypic methods, was 19.6% (44 of 225 samples). Escherichia coli was the predominant CTX-M-type ESBL-producing bacterium among these isolates (41 of 44 isolates). Genotyping of bla CTX-M gene-positive isolates showed that 30 (68.2%), 13 (29.5%), and 1 (2.3%) of 44 samples belonged to groups CTX-M-9, CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-2, respectively. Among the CTX-M-type ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae found in nursing homes, 95.5% (42 of 44 isolates) were co-resistant to quinolone antibiotics. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, inability to turn over in bed, diabetes, and invasive procedures within the last 2 years were the only variables independently associated with fecal carriage of CTX-M-type ESBL producers. Nursing home residents in Japan exhibit a high prevalence of CTX-M-type ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae carriage, with a high level of co-resistance to quinolones.",

Shortly after admission she became colonized with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and developed 12 distinct episodes of serious infection associated with it. The course of VRE colonization and infections in this patient was studied through analysis of 40 representative isolates obtained from different sites during distinct episodes of infection. Standard microbiological techniques, automated ribosomal DNA typing, polymerase chain reaction, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were used. All isolates except for the one associated with the initial episode of bacteremia were VRE, and were multidrug resistant. The last four episodes of infection were caused by isolates resistant to all tested antibiotics except for intermediate susceptibility to chloramphenicol. The vanA genotype was a source of vancomycin resistance in all VRE isolates. Both ribotyping and PFGE showed two distinct clones of VRE in clinical and stool surveillance isolates: one was associated with clinical illness and the other was not associated with infection. Recurrent VRE infections occur as a consequence of prolonged gastrointestinal colonization. Morbidity is associated with host factors, the presence of co-pathogens, and possibly intrinsically more virulent VRE strain.",

The susceptibilities of beta-lactam antibiotics of 30 K. pneumoniae strains associated with primary liver abscess and 30 noninvasive strains were analyzed. The beta-lactamase genes of randomly selected 24 strains from community-acquired infection and 7 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) strains were identified by PCR and DNA sequencing. Protein expression and the ESBL phenotype of beta-lactamase were determined. All 60 strains were ampicillin resistant and cefotaxime susceptible, whereas no strain was ESBL producing. In the 24 selected strains, shv-1a was found in 14, shv-1 in 7; shv-26, shv-27, and shv-41 were detected in one. However, all of these 24 strains had the tem-116 gene. In 7 ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains, shv-5a was found in 5, whereas shv-5 and ctx-m-9 group were detected in I strain. Two previously reported ESBL genes, shv-27 and tem-116, as well as a suspected ESBL gene, shv-41, were found in non-ESBL-producing strains. Transformation of these genes conferred ampicillin resistance but not the ESBL-producing phenotype in Escherichia coli. beta-Lactamase protein expression of these strains was further confirmed by western blotting. In conclusion, ESBL is rare in community-acquired K. pneumoniae infection and is not associated with PLA in Taiwan. The shv-5a, shv-5, and ctx-m-9 groups are present in ESBL-producing strains in Taiwan, but shv-27, shv-41, and tein-116 are not ESBL genes.",

        "abstract": "Staphylococcus epidermidis have become important causes of nosocomial infections, as its pathogenesis is correlated with the ability to form biofilms on polymeric surfaces. Production of poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) is crucial for S. epidermidis biofilm formation and is synthesized by the gene products of the icaADBC gene cluster. Production of PNAG/polysaccharide intercellular adhesin and biofilm formation are regulated by the alternative sigma factor, \u03c3(B), and is influenced by a variety of environmental conditions including disinfectants and other antimicrobial substances. The susceptibility of five S. epidermidis strains to antibiotics alone and in double combination was previously tested. Our results demonstrated that some combinations are active and present a general broad spectrum against S. epidermidis biofilms, namely rifampicin-clindamycin and rifampicin-gentamicin. In the present study, it was investigated whether the combination of rifampicin with clindamycin and gentamicin and these antibiotics alone influence the expression of specific genes (icaA and rsbU) of S. epidermidis within biofilms using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The data showed that in most cases the expression of both genes tested significantly increased after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone and in combination. Besides having a similar antimicrobial effect, rifampicin combined with clindamycin and gentamicin induced a lower expression of biofilm-related genes relatively to rifampicin alone. Associated with the advantage of combinatorial therapy in avoiding the emergence of antibiotic resistance, this study demonstrated that it can also cause a lower genetic expression of icaA and rsbU genes, which are responsible for PNAG/polysaccharide intercellular adhesin production, and consequently reduce biofilm formation recidivism, relatively to rifampicin alone.",

Specimens were collected by lightly rubbing the inferior palpebral conjunctival sac with a sterile cotton swab 2 weeks before surgery, and then cultured for isolation of bacteria and antimicrobial sensitivity testing. The bacterial isolates and percentage of drug-resistant isolates were compared among age groups and according to whether or not patients had diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, dialysis therapy, oral steroid use, dry eye syndrome, or allergic conjunctivitis.\\n\\nRESULTS: The bacterial isolation rate was 39.2%. There were 191 strains of Gram-positive cocci, accounting for the majority of all isolates (67.0%), among which methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci was the most frequent (127 strains, 44.5%), followed by methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (37 strains, 12.7%). All 76 Gram-positive bacillary isolates (26.7%) were from the genus Corynebacterium. Among the 16 Gram-negative bacillary isolates (5.9%), the most frequent was Escherichia coli (1.0%). The bacterial isolation rate was higher in patients >60 years old, and was lower in patients with dry eye syndrome, patients under topical treatment for other ocular disorders, and patients with hyperlipidemia. There was no significant difference in bacterial isolation rate with respect to the presence/absence of diabetes mellitus, steroid therapy, dialysis, or a history of allergic conjunctivitis. Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci showed a significantly higher detection rate in diabetic patients than nondiabetic patients (20.3% versus 7.0%, P < 0.05). The percentage of all isolates resistant to levofloxacin, cefmenoxime, and tobramycin was 14.0%, 15.2%, and 17.9%, respectively, with no significant differences among these drugs.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The high bacterial isolation rate in patients >60 years old and the high methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolation rate in patients with diabetes are important to consider for prevention of perioperative infections.",

We compared equine fecal samples (n=264) from 138 horses from hospital and nonhospital (livery stable and riding school) premises in North West England to determine the prevalence of Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter and rates of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli strains. Campylobacter jejuni was detected only in hospitalized horses (1.1%), and no Salmonella was identified. Data analysis of the horses' management and veterinary treatments (Tx) identified risk factors associated with shedding of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli. The hospital was the major source of resistant and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) E. coli. Moreover, shedding of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli was associated significantly with hospitalization for a gastrointestinal problem (odds ratio [OR]:\u00b195% confidence intervals=8.50:1.79-40.32), receipt of oral antimicrobial Tx (OR=3.52:1.11-11.10), multiple antimicrobial Tx in hospital (OR/Tx=1.05:1.01-1.09), or geldings (OR=4.62:1.23-17.46). Interestingly, intravenous antimicrobial Tx was negatively associated with shedding of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli (OR=0.18:0.04-0.76). MDR E. coli was associated with hospitalization, antimicrobial Tx in hospital (OR/Tx=3.65:1.54-8.68), and increased age (OR/year=1.11:1.03-1.19). Thus, equine hospitals in this geographic location appear to be an important source of antimicrobial-resistant and MDR E. coli strains, but unlikely reservoirs of Salmonella or Campylobacter. Thus, it is important to moderate antimicrobial Tx given to hospitalized horses to lessen exposure and fecal shedding of resistant pathogens.\\n",

Physicians must be aware of typical clinical presentations (such as cervicofacial actinomycosis following dental focus of infection, pelvic actinomycosis in women with an intrauterine device, and pulmonary actinomycosis in smokers with poor dental hygiene), but also that actinomycosis may mimic the malignancy process in various anatomical sites. Bacterial cultures and pathology are the cornerstone of diagnosis, but particular conditions are required in order to get the correct diagnosis. Prolonged bacterial cultures in anaerobic conditions are necessary to identify the bacterium and typical microscopic findings include necrosis with yellowish sulfur granules and filamentous Gram-positive fungal-like pathogens. Patients with actinomycosis require prolonged (6- to 12-month) high doses (to facilitate the drug penetration in abscess and in infected tissues) of penicillin G or amoxicillin, but the duration of antimicrobial therapy could probably be shortened to 3 months in patients in whom optimal surgical resection of infected tissues has been performed. Preventive measures, such as reduction of alcohol abuse and improvement of dental hygiene, may limit occurrence of pulmonary, cervicofacial, and central nervous system actinomycosis. In women, intrauterine devices must be changed every 5 years in order to limit the occurrence of pelvic actinomycosis.",

There has been an increasing resistance by these bacteria to the commonly available antibiotics.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of UTI, the common causative bacteria, and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern among pregnant women with UTI.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY: This is a descriptive study that was carried out at the Obstetrics Department of two tertiary institutions in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria (Federal Medical Center and Ebonyi State University Teaching Hospital) over a period of 12 months. Midstream urine specimens from selected pregnant women with clinical features of UTI were collected for microscopy, culture, and sensitivity. The results were analyzed with the 2008 Epi Info\u2122 software.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 542 pregnant women presented with symptoms of UTI and were recruited for the study over the study period. Of the 542 pregnant women, 252 (46.5%) had significant bacteriuria with positive urine culture and varying antibiotic sensitivity pattern. The prevalence of symptomatic UTI was 3%. Escherichia coli was the most common bacteria isolated with a percentage of 50.8%. Other isolated micro organisms included Stapylococcus aereus (52 cultures, 20.6%), Proteus mirabilis (24 cultures, 9.5%), S. saprophyticus (18 cultures, 7.1%), Streptococcus spp. (14 cultures, 5.6%), Citrobacter spp. (5 cultures, 2.0%), Klebsiella spp. (4 cultures, 1.6%), Enterobacter spp. (4 cultures, 1.6%), and Pseudomonas spp. (3 cultures, 1.2%). Levofloxacin had the highest overall antibiotic sensitivity of 92.5%. Others with overall antibiotic sensitivity pattern greater than 50% included cefpodoxime (87.3%), ofloxacin (77.4%), ciprofloxacin (66.7%), ceftriaxone (66.7%), and gentamicin (50.8%).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: E. coli was the most common etiological agent of UTI in pregnancy with Enterococcus (Staphylococcus) gaining prominence. Cephalosporin and quinolones were shown to be very effective against the organisms causing UTI in these pregnant women.",

In this study, we investigated the burden of infection and the resistance pattern in the bacterial etiology, in the only tertiary pediatric hematology and oncology center in Qatar.\\n\\nMETHODS: All pediatric cancer patients (n=185) were evaluated retrospectively during the period 2004-2011; a total of 70 (38%) patients were diagnosed with bloodstream infections. Bacterial etiology was determined, along with their susceptibility patterns. Neutropenia, duration of neutropenia, fever, duration of fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated throughout the study.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 70 patients (38%) were diagnosed with acute leukemias, lymphomas, solid tumors, or brain tumors; those patients experienced 111 episodes of bacteremia. The most common Gram-positive (n=64 [55%]) isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=26), Staphylococcus hominis (n=9), and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=7), and the common Gram-negative (n=52 [45%]) isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=10), and Escherichia coli (n=7). There was a significant association observed between fever with positive blood culture and different types of cancer (P=0.035). The majority of bacteremia (n=68 [61.3%]) occurred in nonneutropenic episodes. Elevated values of CRP (\u22655 mg/L) were detected in 82 (95.3%) episodes and were negatively correlated with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (r=-0.18; P=0.248) among all cases. However, the infection-related fatality rate was 2.2% (n=4), with three caused by Gram-negative pathogens. Multidrug resistant organisms were implicated in 33 (28.4%) cases and caused three of the mortality cases.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Multidrug resistant organisms cause mortality in pediatric cancer patients. Investigation of antimicrobial susceptibility of these organisms may guide successful antimicrobial therapy and improve the surveillance and quality of pediatric malignancy care.",

However, there is little information about the prevalence of pathogenic and/or antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus faecalis in ready-to-eat foods in Nigeria. Here we report the pathogenic potential of three selected antibiotic-resistant E. faecalis strains isolated from food canteens and food outlets with different virulence determinant genes, including EFC 12 (with gel+, esp+, cylA+, and asa1+), EFT 148 (with gel+, ace+, and asa1+), and EFS 18 (with esp+ and cylA+) in an animal model. Enterococcemia, hematological parameters, and histopathological changes in organ tissues were examined in experimental animals. The results showed differences in enterococcemia and hematological parameters between the control group and experimental animal group. Enterococcemia was observed for 7 days, and the animal group infected with EFC 12 showed the highest growth rate, followed by EFT 148, with the lowest growth rate seen in the EFS 18-infected group. White blood cell count, packed cell volume, and platelets were significantly reduced (P,0.05) in the experimental animals compared with the controls. White blood cells decreased drastically during the study period in rats challenged with EFC 12 (from 7,800 to 6,120 per mm3) but levels remained higher in the control group (from 9,228 to 9,306 per mm3). Histopathological changes included areas of pronounced hemorrhage, necrosis, and distortion in liver tissues, which were more marked in rats infected with EFC 12, followed by EFT 148, then EFS 18. The results of this study suggest the presence of potentially pathogenic E. faecalis strains in food canteens and food outlets; hence, there is a need for strict adherence to good hygiene practices in the study area owing to the epidemiological significance of foods.",

        "abstract": "Although the role of the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway has been most extensively studied in hematopoietic cells and hematologic malignancies, it is also activated in epithelial tumors, including those originating in the lungs and head and neck. The canonical pathway involves the activation of JAK following ligand binding to cytokine receptors. The activated JAKs then phosphorylate STAT proteins, leading to their dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. In the nucleus, STATs act as transcription factors with pleiotropic downstream effects. STATs can be activated independently of JAKs, most notably by c-Src kinases. In cancer cells, STAT3 and STAT5 activation leads to the increased expression of downstream target genes, leading to increased cell proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis, and immune system evasion. STAT3 and STAT5 are expressed and activated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) where they contribute to cell survival and proliferation. In HNSCC, STATs can be activated by a number of signal transduction pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ??7 nicotinic receptor, interleukin (IL) receptor, and erythropoietin receptor pathways. Activated STATs are also expressed in lung cancer, but the biological effects of JAK/STAT inhibition in this cancer are variable. In lung cancer, STAT3 can be activated by multiple pathways, including EGFR. Several approaches have been used to inhibit STAT3 in the hopes of developing an antitumor agent. Although several STAT3-specific agents are promising, none are in clinical development, mostly because of drug delivery and stability issues. In contrast, several JAK inhibitors are in clinical development. These orally available, ATP-competitive, small-molecule kinase inhibitors are being tested in myeloproliferative disorders. Future studies will determine whether JAK inhibitors are useful in the treatment of HNSCC or lung cancer. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Inhibition of the program of apoptosis has been reported to have little or no effect on clonogenic survival after treatment with drugs or radiation in several tumor cell lines. A decrease in apoptosis is compensated in such cell lines by an increase in the fractions of cells that undergo permanent growth arrest with phenotypic features of cell senescence, or die through the process of mitotic catastrophe. Most of the tested tumor cell lines have retained the capacity of normal cells to undergo accelerated senescence after treatment with DNA-interactive drugs, ionizing radiation, or cytostatic agents. p53 and p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) act as positive regulators of treatment-induced senescence, but they are not required for this response in tumor cells. The senescent phenotype distinguishes tumor cells that survived drug exposure but lost the ability to form colonies from those that recover and proliferate after treatment. Although senescent cells do not proliferate, they are metabolically active and may produce secreted proteins with potential tumor-promoting activities. The expression of such proteins is mediated at least in part by the induction of p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1). The other anti-proliferative response of tumor cells is mitotic catastrophe, a form of cell death that results from abnormal mitosis and leads to the formation of interphase cells with multiple micronuclei. Mitotic catastrophe is induced by different classes of cytotoxic agents, but the pathways of abnormal mitosis differ depending on the nature of the inducer and the status of cell-cycle checkpoints. Mitotic catastrophe can also develop as a consequence of aberrant reentry of tumor cells into cell cycle after prolonged growth arrest. Elucidation of the factors that regulate different aspects of treatment-induced senescence and mitotic catastrophe should assist in improving the efficacy and decreasing side effects of cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Blue light, particularly in the wavelength range of 405-470 nm, has attracted increasing attention due to its intrinsic antimicrobial effect without the addition of exogenous photosensitizers. In addition, it is commonly accepted that blue light is much less detrimental to mammalian cells than ultraviolet irradiation, which is another light-based antimicrobial approach being investigated. In this review, we discussed the blue light sensing systems in microbial cells, antimicrobial efficacy of blue light, the mechanism of antimicrobial effect of blue light, the effects of blue light on mammalian cells, and the effects of blue light on wound healing. It has been reported that blue light can regulate multi-cellular behavior involving cell-to-cell communication via blue light receptors in bacteria, and inhibit biofilm formation and subsequently potentiate light inactivation. At higher radiant exposures, blue light exhibits a broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Blue light therapy is a clinically accepted approach for Propionibacterium acnes infections. Clinical trials have also been conducted to investigate the use of blue light for Helicobacter pylori stomach infections and have shown promising results. Studies on blue light inactivation of important wound pathogenic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have also been reported. The mechanism of blue light inactivation of P. acnes, H. pylori, and some oral bacteria is proved to be the photo-excitation of intracellular porphyrins and the subsequent production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. Although it may be the case that the mechanism of blue light inactivation of wound pathogens (e.g., S. aureus, P. aeruginosa) is the same as that of P. acnes, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. Limited and discordant results have been reported regarding the effects of blue light on mammalian cells and wound healing. Under certain wavelengths and radiant exposures, blue light may cause cell dysfunction by the photo-excitation of blue light sensitizing chromophores, including flavins and cytochromes, within mitochondria or/and peroxisomes. Further studies should be performed to optimize the optical parameters (e.g., wavelength, radiant exposure) to ensure effective and safe blue light therapies for infectious disease. In addition, studies are also needed to verify the lack of development of microbial resistance to blue light.",

The aim of this study was to detect and determine the genes encoding the ESBLs including bla(TEM), bla(SHV), and bla(CTX-M) groups among the K. pneumoniae isolates at Labbafinejad Hospital by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and characterize them by direct sequencing of PCR products. Eighty-nine isolates were isolated from patients at different wards during March 2008-March 2009. They were identified as K. pneumoniae using biochemical tests. Susceptibility of isolates to 17 different antimicrobial agents was determined using agar disk diffusion method. The phenotypic confirmatory test was used to screen the isolates for production of ESBLs. To amplify the bla(SHV) the template DNA was extracted by boiling method. Plasmid DNA was extracted using minipreparation kit and used as template in PCR for detection of bla(TEM) and bla(CTX-M). The selected PCR products were sequenced and analyzed. All 89 strains were susceptible to imipenem. The rates of resistance to different antibiotics were in the following order: aztronam (79.7%), cefexime (67.4%), cefpodoxime (66.2%), cefotaxime (65.1%), ceftazidime (61.7%). The phenotypic confirmatory test detected 62 isolates (69.7%) as ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. The prevalence of genes encoding ESBLs were as follows: bla(TEM) 54% (n = 48), bla(SHV) 67.4% (n = 60), bla(CTX-M-I) 46.51% (n = 40), and bla(CTX-M-III) 29% (n = 25). The bla(CTX-M-II) and bla(CTX-M-IV) were not detected. All bla(TEM) types were characterized as bla(TEM-1) and all bla(CTX-M-I) were identified as bla(CTX-M-15). The SHV types were characterized as SHV-5, SHV-11, and SHV-12. The rate of ESBL at Labbafinejad Hospital was 25% increase in a 4-year study that ended in March 2009. It appears that bla(TEM-1), bla(SHV-5), bla(SHV-11), bla(SHV-12), and bla(CTX-M-15) are the dominant ESBLs among the resistant strains of K. pneumoniae in Iran.",

The same CBP (susceptible (S): MIC ??? 2 mcg/ml; non-S: MIC > 2 mcg/ml) was applied to all echinocandins and species. More data now allow reassessment of these CBPs. We examined cases of echinocandin failure where both MICs and fks mutations were assessed; wild type (WT) MICs and epidemiological cutoff values (ECVs) for a large Candida collection; molecular analysis of fks hotspots for Candida with known MICs; and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data. We applied these findings to propose new species-specific CBPs for echinocandins and Candida. Of 18 candidiasis cases refractory to echinocandins and with fks mutations, 28% (CSF), 58% (ANF) and 66% (MCF) had MICs in the S category using CBP of ???2 mcg/ml, while 0-8% would be S using CBP of ???0.25 mcg/ml. WT MIC distributions revealed ECV ranges of 0.03-0.25 mcg/ml for all major species except C. parapsilosis (1-4 mcg/ml) and C. guilliermondii (4-16 mcg/ml). Among Candida tested for fks mutations, only 15.7-45.1% of 51 mutants were detected using the CBP for NS of >2 mcg/ml. In contrast, a cutoff of >0.25 mcg/ml for C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, and C. dubliniensis detected 85.6% (MCF) to 95.2% (CSF) of 21 mutant strains. Likewise, a cutoff of >0.12 mcg/ml for ANF and CSF and of >0.06 mcg/ml for MCF detected 93% (ANF) to 97% (CSF, MCF) of 30 mutant strains of C. glabrata. These data, combined with PK/PD considerations, support CBPs of ???0.25 mcg/ml (S), 0.5 mcg/ml (I), ???1 (R) for CSF/MCF/ANF and C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. krusei and ???2 mcg/ml (S), 4 mcg/ml (I), and ???8 mcg/ml (R) for these agents and C. parapsilosis. The CBPs for ANF and CSF and C. glabrata are ???0.12 mcg/ml (S), 0.25 mcg/ml (I), and ???0.5 mcg/ml (R), whereas those for MCF are ???0.06 mcg/ml (S), 0.12 mcg/ml (I), and ???0.25 mcg/ml (R). New, species-specific CBPs for Candida and the echinocandins are more sensitive to detect emerging resistance associated with fks mutations, and better able to predict risk for clinical failure. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the details regarding the quantitative/qualitative state of ESBL-producing bacterial spread in Southeast Asia are currently unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the state of ESBL-producing bacterial spread in community residents from the Indochinese peninsula, as a representative region of Southeast Asia. In order to achieve this aim, local community residents in Laos and Vietnam were examined for fecal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and the findings were compared with data from a previous study in Thailand which was conducted in the same manner as this study. Between 47.0%-70.2% of the Laotian and Vietnamese residents carried ESBL-producing CTX-M genotype Enterobacteriaceae. The most common sub-genotypes of CTX-M were CTX-M-1 (33.0%-47.5%) and CTX-M-9 (47.5%-64.1%), and these rates were similar among all three countries.

From November 2005 to October 2006, 198 beef and 120 mutton carcass excision samples, and 232 chicken carcasses (whole and pieces) were randomly collected from different retail stores and meat-processing plants in Istanbul. TCS were isolated from 11.1%, 21.6%, and 50.4% of beef, mutton, and chicken samples tested, respectively. There was no significant seasonal variation in the prevalence of TCS. A total of 292 Campylobacter isolates were obtained from the samples (56.5% C. jejuni, 33.9% C. Coli, and 9.6% C. lari). C. jejuni was the species most commonly isolated from chicken meat (56.5%<65.9 from table 2>), while C. coli was the most common in beef (63.3%) and mutton (63.9%) carcasses. Susceptibilities of 246 strains for eight antimicrobial drugs were determined using disk diffusion assay. Campylobacter isolates were most often resistant to tetracycline (69.1%), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (64.2%), nalidixic acid (58.1%), erythromycin (56.9%), enrofloxacin (48.8%), ciprofloxacin (42.7%), chloramphenicol (36.2%), and gentamicin (26.0%). The results of this study suggest that a high proportion of meat samples, particularly chicken carcasses, are contaminated by TCS, most of which are antimicrobial-resistant strains. Since campylobacteriosis is transmitted primarily through food of animal origin, the presence of antimicrobial-resistant strains in meat has important implications for public health and food safety.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, invasive meningococcal disease affects about 500,000 people annually. Case fatality in developed countries averages 10%, and higher rates are reported in less prosperous regions. According to the World Health Organization, the most important pathogenic serogroups are A, B, C, W-135, X, and Y. Clinical features of invasive meningococcal disease make diagnosis and management difficult. Antibiotic measures are recommended for prophylaxis after exposure and for treatment of invasive meningococcal disease cases; however, resistant strains may be emerging. Vaccines are generally regarded as the best preventative measure for invasive meningococcal disease. Polysaccharide vaccines against serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y using protein conjugation technology have clear advantages over older plain polysaccharide formulations without a protein component. The first quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-D) was licensed in the US in 2005. More recently, MenACWY-CRM (Menveo(\u00ae)) was licensed in Europe, the US, the Middle East, and Latin America. MenACWY-CRM uses cross-reactive material 197, a nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin, as the carrier protein. MenACWY-CRM offers robust immunogenicity in all age groups, with a tolerability profile similar to that of a plain polysaccharide vaccine. Given its potential for protecting persons from infancy to old age, MenACWY-CRM offers the opportunity to protect broad populations against invasive meningococcal disease. The most optimal strategy for use of the vaccine has to be assessed country by country on the basis of local epidemiology, individual health care systems, and need.",

        "abstract": "The reasoning that improved hand hygiene compliance contributes to the prevention of health care-associated infections is widely accepted. It is also accepted that high hand hygiene alone cannot impact formidable risk factors, such as older age, immunosuppression, admission to the intensive care unit, longer length of stay, and indwelling devices. When hand hygiene interventions are concurrently undertaken with other routine or special preventive strategies, there is a potential for these concurrent strategies to confound the effect of the hand hygiene program. The result may be an overestimation of the hand hygiene intervention unless the design of the intervention or analysis controls the effect of the potential confounders. Other epidemiologic principles that may also impact the result of a hand hygiene program include failure to consider measurement error of the content of the hand hygiene program and the measurement error of compliance. Some epidemiological errors in hand hygiene programs aimed at reducing health care-associated infections are inherent and not easily controlled. Nevertheless, the inadvertent omission by authors to report these common epidemiological errors, including concurrent infection prevention strategies, suggests to readers that the effect of hand hygiene is greater than the sum of all infection prevention strategies. Worse still, this omission does not assist evidence-based practice.",

        "abstract": "Cancer cells contain multiple signal transduction pathways whose activities are frequently elevated due to their transformation, and that are often activated following exposure to established cytotoxic therapies including ionizing radiation and chemical DNA damaging agents. Many pathways activated in response to transformation or toxic stresses promote cell growth and invasion and counteract the processes of cell death. As a result of these findings many drugs, predominantly protein and lipid kinase inhibitors, of varying specificities, have been developed to block signaling by cell survival pathways in the hope of killing tumor cells and sensitizing them to toxic therapies. Unfortunately, due to the plasticity of signaling processes within a tumor cell, inhibition of any one growth factor receptor or signaling pathway frequently has only modest long-term effects on cancer cell viability, tumor growth, and patient survival. As a result of this realization, a greater emphasis has begun to be placed on rational combinations of drugs that simultaneously inhibit multiple inter-linked signal transduction/survival pathways. This, it is hoped, will limit the ability of tumor cells to adapt and survive because the activity within multiple parallel survival signaling pathways has been reduced. This review will discuss some of the approaches that have been taken to combine signal transduction modulatory agents to achieve enhanced tumor cell killing. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of PVL genes in clinical S. aureus isolates and to determine the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) types of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains obtained from inpatients and outpatients of two hospitals in Turkey. Of the 304 S. aureus strains (230 hospital acquired [HA] and 74 community-onset [CO]), 261 were MRSA and 43 were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). PVL positivity was determined in 12 (1 HA and 11 community acquired) strains. Eight were MRSA, and four were MSSA. Seven of the PVL-positive strains were isolated from wound specimens, four from urine, and one from synovial fluid. SCCmec type III (93.78%) was more prevalent among HA-MRSA strains, and SCCmec type IIIB (41.18%) was more prevalent among CO-MRSA strains. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of the PVL-positive isolates were different. Our results indicate that PVL-positive strains are able to cause infection in nearly every system without the need for additional risk factors. Our PVL-positive CO-MRSA strains carry SCCmec types other than types IV and V. Due to the presence of PVL-positive strains in the hospitals, it is important to establish appropriate infection control measures to prevent their spread in the community and in hospitals.",

This review highlights some of the connections between opposite-acting pathways. Thus, we discuss the role of cyclins in the apoptotic process, and in the regulation of cell proliferation. CDKs and their inhibitors like the INK4-family (p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p18Ink4c, p19Ink4d), and the Cip1/Waf1/Kip1-2-family (p21Cip1/Waf1, p27Kip1, p57Kip2) are shown both in the context of proliferation regulators and as contributors to the apoptotic machinery. Bcl2-family members (i.e. Bcl2, Bcl-XL Mcl-1L; Bax, Bok/Mtd, Bak, and Bcl-XS; Bad, Bid, BimEL, Bmf, Mcl-1S) are highlighted both for their apoptosis-regulating capacity and also for their effect on the cell cycle progression. The PI3-K/Akt cell survival pathway is shown as regulator of cell metabolism and cell survival, but examples are also provided where aberrant activity of the pathway may contribute to the induction of apoptosis. Myc/Mad/Max proteins are shown both as a powerful S-phase driving complex and as apoptosis-sensitizers. We also discuss multifunctional proteins like p53 and Rb (RBL1/p107, RBL2/p130) both in the context of G1-S transition and as apoptotic triggers. Finally, we reflect on novel therapeutic approaches that would involve redirecting over-active survival and proliferation pathways towards induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For all antimicrobial agents tested at both temperatures, 95-100% of the QC MIC results fell within recommended QC ranges. Twenty-one Campylobacter clinical isolates, encompassing five species of Campylobacter (C. jejuni, C. coli, C. jejuni, subsp. doylei, C. fetus, and C. lari) were tested in conjunction with the C. jejuni QC strain. While C. jejuni and C. coli could be reliably tested under both test conditions, growth of C. jejuni subsp. doylei, C. fetus, and C. lari isolates was inconsistent when incubated at 42 degrees C.

There are currently at least eight PARP inhibitors in clinical trial development. In vitro data, in vivo preclinical data and most recently early clinical trial data suggests that PARP inhibitors could be used not only as chemo/radiotherapy sensitizers but also as single agents to selectively kill cancers defective in DNA repair, specifically cancers with mutations in the breast cancer associated (BRCA)1 and BRCA2 genes. This theory of selectively exploiting cells defective in one DNA repair pathway by inhibiting another is a major breakthrough in the treatment of cancer.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Some cases of sudden death (SD) have been attributed to communicable  diseases (CD) in middle- and low-income countries of the world even in this 21st century. CDs produce clinical symptoms and signs over several days before culminating in death. They are also amenable to treatment with antimicrobials if affected persons present early. We sought to find out the incidence of CD-related SD at the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Teaching Hospital (Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria) - a tertiary health facility in southwest Nigeria - and the prevailing associated factors. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of CD-related SD in adult patients aged 18 years and older that occurred from January 2003 to December 2011. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16 was used for analysis of the generated data. Percentages and frequencies were calculated. RESULTS: There were 17 (39.6%) CD-related SDs out of the 48 cases of SD studied. CD-related SD also accounted for 2.4% of all adult medical admissions. The mean age of the patients was 37.6 +/- 11.6 years, age range of 25-62 years, mode of 25 years, and median 34 years. The male-to-female ratio was 1.8:1. Typhoid sepsis was responsible for SD in 47.1% of patients, pulmonary tuberculosis in 17.7% of patients, and lobar pneumonia in 17.7% of patients. The most affected age group was the 20-29-year-old group (41.2%), while the unskilled occupational group was the most affected occupational group with 35.3% of them having SD. Most of the patients with acute bacterial infection died of multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need to step up public health strategies to curtail infections in this environment, encourage better use of the existing health facilities by the people, and the government should strive hard to make health a top priority.",

        "abstract": "The Kr??ppel-like zinc finger transcription factor (KLF6) gene encodes a family of proteins generated through alternative splicing involved in the regulation of cancer development and progression. Alternative splicing of the KLF6 gene results in the production of at least four alternatively spliced isoforms, two of which are extensively discussed in this review. The full length form of the KLF6 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated by loss of heterozygozity (LOH), somatic mutation, and/or decreased expression in human cancer. While the exact mechanisms underlying KLF6's tumor suppressor roles are not completely known, a number of highly relevant, overlapping pathways have been described: transactivation of p21 in a p53-independent manner, reduction of cyclin D1/cdk4 complexes via interaction with cyclin D1, inhibition of c-Jun proto-oncoprotein activities, decreased VEGF expression, and induction of apoptosis. Kruppel-like factor 6 splice variant 1 (KLF6-SV1) is an oncogenic splice variant of the KLF6 tumor suppressor gene that is specifically overexpressed in a number of human cancers. Increased KLF6-SV1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in prostate, lung, and ovarian cancer. Furthermore, KLF6-SV1 has been shown to be biologically active, antagonizing the tumor suppressor function of KLF6 and promoting tumor growth and dissemination in both ovarian and prostate cancer models. In addition, a common germline polymorphism in the KLF6 gene associated with increased prostate cancer risk in a large multi-institutional study of 3411 men results in increased expression of KLF6-SV1. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that targeted reduction of KLF6-SV1 results in the induction of spontaneous apoptosis in cell culture, synergizes with chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin, and results in significant tumor regression in vivo. Combined, these data make the KLF6 gene family a compelling therapeutic target for both the treatment of localized as well as metastatic cancer. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Results: In the first episode, S. aureus was recovered from the wound and inguinal folds; in the second, S. aureus was recovered from a lower abdomen furuncle, inguinal folds, and patellar fold. Molecular typing identified CA-MRSA clone USA300 in all samples as spa-type t008, ST8, SCCmecIVa, and a typical PFGE pattern. The strain carried virulence genes pvl and ACME type I. Five SSTI episodes were documented despite successful resolution by antibiotic treatment, with and without incision and drainage. Conclusions: The source of the USA300 strain remains unknown. The isolate may represent a persistent strain capable of surviving extensive antibiotic pressure or a persistent environmental reservoir may be the source, possibly in the patient's household, from which bacteria were repeatedly introduced into the skin flora with subsequent infections.",

        "abstract": "Ideal oncology drugs would be curative after a short treatment course if they could eliminate epithelium-originated carcinomas at their non-invasive, pre-malignant stages. Such ideal molecules, which are expected to molecularly abrogate all the instrumental mechanisms acquired by migrating cancer stem cells (CSCs) to by-pass tumour suppressor barriers, might already exist. We here illustrate how system biology strategies for repositioning existing FDA-approved drugs may accelerate our therapeutic capacity to eliminate CSC traits in pre-invasive intraepithelial neoplasias. First, we describe a signalling network signature that overrides bioenergetics stress- and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) phenomena in CSCs residing at pre-invasive lesions. Second, we functionally map the anti-malarial chloroquine and the anti-diabetic metformin (\"old drugs\") to their recently recognized CSC targets (\"new uses\") within the network. By discussing the preclinical efficacy of chloroquine and metformin to inhibiting the genesis and self-renewal of CSCs we finally underscore the expected translational impact of the \"old drugs-new uses\" repurposing strategy to open a new CSC-targeted chemoprevention era. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "The development of new drugs able to directly activate the apoptotic machinery in tumors is a promising approach in the treatment of cancer as it is independent of sensors and checkpoints, which are frequently mutated in cancer hampering current anti-proliferative chemotherapy. The Fas death receptor (CD95 or APO-1) conveys apoptotic signals through binding to its cognate ligand, FasL (CD95L). Unfortunately, the putative clinical antitumor action of FasL cannot be realized because of severe liver toxicity due to the high presence of Fas in hepatocytes. However, recent evidence for FasL-independent activation of Fas suggests that the death receptor can also be activated intracellularly, in the absence of its ligand. Unraveling the mechanisms that underlie the intracellular activation of Fas can provide the basis for novel therapeutic strategies and for the development of new compounds able to exploit cytoplasmic triggers of apoptosis. This is of importance in apoptosis-deficient disorders such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Fas-mediated apoptosis involves translocation of Fas - and downstream signaling molecules - into lipid rafts, a process that can be pharmacologically modulated. FasL-independent clustering of Fas in membrane rafts generates high local concentrations of death receptor providing scaffolds for coupling adaptor and effector proteins involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Thus, lipid rafts act as the linchpin from which a potent death signal is launched, becoming a new promising anticancer target. These findings set a novel framework for the development of more targeted therapies leading to intracellular Fas activation and recruitment of downstream signaling molecules into Fas-enriched lipid rafts. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past decade, the role of p53 as apoptotic trigger has been well demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Many chemotherapeutic agents cause DNA damage and activate the p53 pathway to induce growth arrest and apoptosis. However, the p53 function is often inactivated or suppressed in human cancers. Thus, functional restoration of this pathway is an attractive therapeutic strategy. In recent years, a number of therapeutic approaches aiming at modulation of the p53 pathway have been developed and will be reviewed here.

In the two hospitals of Verona, Italy, the incidence of carbapenem-nonsusceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae (CNSKP) began to increase by the first months of 2011, reached a peak in the summer of the same year, and currently is around 30%. Contrary to what was reported by other hospitals and although significant percentages of CNSKP were detected in respiratory samples, blood and pus, urine from hospitalized patients, mainly geriatrics, are the clinical samples with the highest incidence of these strains. Elder patients are frequently transferred from the hospital to their own homes or long-term care facilities and vice-versa. Moreover, urinary tract infections are not considered as a severe pathology and frequently is asymptomatic in elderly. For these reasons, the presence of carbapenem non-susceptible bacteria in the urinary tract of geriatric patients might be an underestimated cause of multiresistant strain spreading to the non-hospitalized population and the community.",

Preclinical and clinical evaluations of a variety of Hsp90 inhibitors have shown anti-tumor effect as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy. Current Hsp90 inhibitors are categorized into several classes based on distinct modes of inhibition, including (i) blockade of ATP binding, (ii) disruption of co-chaperone/Hsp90 interactions, (iii) antagonism of client/Hsp90 associations and (iv) interference with post-translational modifications of Hsp90. The different functions of Hsp90 isoforms and the isoform selectivity of drugs need further investigation. The correlation of cell surface Hsp90 with cancer metastasis and the emerging involvement of Hsp90 inhibition in cancer stem cells have become exciting areas that could be exploited.

All NF-GNB isolates were included, except those phenotypically identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobial agents were determined by using the E-test technique. The following microorganisms were identified: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=72), Pseudomonas spp. (n=30), Achromobacter xylosoxidans (n=25), Acinetobacter spp. (n=18), Burkholderia cepacia complex (n=9), Alcaligenes faecalis (n=7), and Delftia spp. (n=5). All isolates of Acinetobacter spp., A. faecalis, and Delftia spp. were susceptible to the three carbapenems. Imipenem exhibited the lowest MICs against Pseudomonas spp., and meropenem, as compared with imipenem and doripenem, displayed an interesting antimicrobial activity against A. xylosoxidans and B. cepacia complex isolates. Conversely, no carbapenem exhibited any activity against S. maltophilia. Except for S. maltophilia isolates, tigecycline and colistin exhibited higher MICs than carbapenems, but covered most of the microorganisms tested in this study. To our knowledge, no prior study has compared antimicrobial activity of these five antibiotics, often considered as \"last-resort\" treatment options for resistant Gram-negative infections, against unusual NF-GNB clinical isolates. Further studies should be carried out to assess the potential clinical use of these antibiotics for the treatment of infections due to these microorganisms.",

Microscopy detection rates before and after concentration of specimens by both methods, were also compared. The study had two phases. Phase I: comparison of the gold standard NALC-NaOH and HS-SH on paired samples involving respiratory clinical specimens by means of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Phase II: blinded, randomized trial to assess the performance of HS-SH versus NALC-NaOH in clinical practice. Phase I: Positive microscopy rate was significantly increased in around 2.2% after concentration in comparison to that of specimens without concentration. The calculated sensitivity values for microscopy detection increased between 15.2% (HS-SH: 73.5%) to 16.7% (NALC-NaOH: 75.0%) over those without concentration (58.3%). Phase II: similar diagnostic rates by microscopy and cultures were obtained by either HS-SH or NALC-NaOH. The clinical performances were also very similar.

Among 95 patients, 15 (15.8%) patients were positive for MRSA on PCR and/or culture; 6.3% (6/95) of patients were positive on admission, and 9.5% (9/95) became positive during the stay after admission. The major primary diagnoses in MRSA-positive patients were trauma and cerebrovascular diseases. Nine (60%) of 15 patients were MRSA-positive on both PCR and culture, compared with three (20%) of 15 who were PCR-positive but culture-negative. The other three (20%) of 15 patients were PCR-negative but culture-positive. Furthermore, there was a tendency for younger age and shorter stay to be associated with PCR-positive but culture-negative results.

However, recent new evidence demonstrated that millimolar concentrations of noncanonical D-amino acids are synthesized and released to the environment by bacteria from diverse phyla. These D-amino acids help bacteria adapt to environmental challenges by modulating the structure and composition of the peptidoglycan (PG). This regulation, which appears to be well conserved among bacterial species, occurs principally through the incorporation of the D-amino acids into the terminus of the peptide moiety of muropeptides. These findings revived interest in studies investigating D-amino acids as an exciting and trendy topic in current microbiology, which considers them as fundamental players in different aspects of bacterial physiology. In this article, we provide an overview of the origins of research on the effects of D-amino acids in the biology of bacterial cell walls, including their recent implication as key factors for stress-associated PG remodeling.",

Into each line day data, we inputed AUD and device utilization ratios, number of central line days, and CLABSI.

Of a total of 9,997 line days over 24 months, CLABSI was present in 33 cases (3.3 \u2030), 14 (42.4%) of which were on surgical wards out of nine wards. Of a total of 43 strains isolated, eight (18.6%) were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); none of the MRSA-positive patients had received cefotiam before the onset of infection. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that central line day 7 had the highest accuracy. Logistic regression analysis showed the central line day showed an odds ratio of 5.511 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.936-15.690 as did AUD of cefotiam showing an odds ratio of 0.220 with 95% confidence interval of 0.00527-0.922 (P=0.038).

Here we give an overview of the \"signaling pathway-selective\" compounds that are currently in use or under clinical development in the setting of colorectal cancer (CRC) and we discuss promising targets, based on our current knowledge of colorectal tumor cell biology, such as Src family, Wnt and Hegdehog signaling. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The cost-effectiveness of routine screening for ASB in pregnancy is controversial. In populations with high prevalence, however, it is worthwhile and justifiable.\\n\\nAIM: To determine the profile, prevalence, microbiological isolates, and risk factors of ASB among booking antenatal clinic attendees in Abakaliki, Nigeria.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving booking antenatal clinic attendees at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, who met the inclusion criteria. This study occurred between January and December, 2012. The midstream urine samples of these women were subjected to microscopy, culture, and sensitivity.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 300 randomly selected booking antenatal clinic attendees participated in the study; 74 of them had ASB, giving a prevalence of 24.7%. With the exception of rural residence, sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics did not influence the risk of ASB among the participants in this study. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest organism isolated. The majority of the organisms were sensitive to ofloxacin and ceftriaxone.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of ASB among pregnant women in Abakaliki. With the exception of rural dwelling, sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics did not significantly influence the risk of ASB among these pregnant women. Therefore, routine ASB screening of pregnant women is recommended in our environment.",

        "abstract": "Recent developments in anti-cancer gene therapy suggest that the idea of a magic bullet for cancer may not be a pipe dream. Viral-based anti-cancer vectors for gene therapy have been used preferentially in this regard, but recent results from clinical trials have raised serious concerns as to their safety. For this reason, the development of non-viral vectors able to deliver drugs or suicide genes specifically to cancer cells is of paramount importance. In this context, great interest has been raised by recent reports that several proteins, including viral protein 3 (VP3 or Apoptin) from Chicken Anemia Virus, are capable of selectively killing tumor cells. Intriguingly, VP3's anti-cancer activity is strongly linked to its ability to localize more efficiently in the nucleus of cancer and transformed cells than that of normal, non-transformed cells with a tumor cell-specific nuclear targeting signal (tNTS) located at the C-terminus of the protein. Clearly, the VP3 tNTS is an exciting prospect to enhance non-viral-mediated cancer cell killing. This review will discuss recent advances in the understanding of the mechanism responsible for VP3 tumor-specific nuclear localization, including its specific phosphorylation, and the implications for the enhancement of anti-cancer therapy. It also proposes alternative strategies to develop tNTSs for anti-cancer therapies. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Recently, a higher genomic variety has been observed among the SPM-1-producing P. aeruginosa isolates. The principal aim of this study was to analyze through multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis whether the recently isolated SPM-1-producing P. aeruginosa descend or not from a common ancestor. A total of 50 SPM-1-producing P. aeruginosa exhibiting 11 distinct ribotyping genotypes collected from 11 different Brazilian cities were studied. Three IMP-1-producing P. aeruginosa and two non-metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa isolates were included in the study as controls. For assignment of allelic numbers and subsequent determination of sequence type (ST), the obtained sequences were compared to existing sequences in the MLST database (www.pubmlst.org/paeruginosa). The eBURSTv3 software was used in this study for establishing the evolutionary relationship and phylogenetic analysis. A total of 5 different STs were identified among 55 P. aeruginosa isolates. All of the SPM-1-producing P. aeruginosa presented an identical allelic profile (ST277), except for one strain. The three IMP-1-producing P. aeruginosa strains were classified as belonging to the ST593, whereas the non-metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa showed two new distinct STs, ST594 and ST595. Our study shows that SPM-1-producing P. aeruginosa isolates as well as the IMP producers evaluated in this study descend from a common ancestor.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae. It is an old virus that has re-emerged globally over the past 20 years and now causes a global burden of 50 million infections per year across approximately 100 countries. Despite this, there is no safe vaccine available, and therapy is largely supportive. Its pathogenesis is multifaceted and currently still poorly understood, leading to a lack of disease-specific therapy. Propolis is a natural antiviral and anti-inflammatory product derived from the saps of plants and mixed with the saliva of honeybees. Propoelix\u2122 is a uniquely potent and water-soluble extract of propolis containing high concentrations of anti-inflammatory compounds like caffeic acid phenethyl ester.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness of a unique propolis extract (Propoelix\u2122) on the clinical course of patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The secondary objective is to examine the effect of Propoelix\u2122 on tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) levels in patients with DHF.\\n\\nMETHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at the Department of Internal Medicine, Gatot Soebroto Central Army Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia, from May 2012 to July 2013. Sixty-three patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the trial. Patients were randomized to receive either two capsules of Propoelix\u2122 200 mg three times a day or placebo daily for 7 days. Clinical and laboratory variables of both groups, including the anti-inflammatory marker TNF-\u03b1, were investigated. Patients were deemed technically fit for discharge if their platelet counts had recovered and exceeded 100,000/\u03bcL but were all observed as inpatients for 7 days.\\n\\nRESULTS: There were 31 patients in the Propoelix\u2122 treatment group and 32 patients in the placebo group. Platelet counts in the Propoelix\u2122-treated group showed a trend toward a faster recovery by day 3 of admission and became statistically significant by day 6 (101.42\u00b148.79 vs 80.78\u00b143.35 [10(3)/mL], P=0.042) and day 7 (146.67\u00b164.68 vs 107.84\u00b157.22 [10(3)/mL], P=0.006). Patients treated with Propoelix\u2122 had a significantly greater decline in TNF-\u03b1 levels on day 7 of therapy compared with patients in the placebo group (P=0.018). They also had a significantly shorter length of hospitalization compared with those in the placebo group (4.69\u00b10.78 days vs 5.46\u00b11.16 days, P=0.012).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Propoelix\u2122 appears to hasten the improvement in platelet counts and TNF-\u03b1 levels and shortens the duration of hospitalization in patients with DHF.",

We studied four SCVs and their corresponding parent strains: one clinical strain pair, one menaquinone-deficient spontaneous mutant, and two constructed mutants obtained by inactivation of hemB in S. aureus 8325-4 and COL, respectively. SCVs growing in chemically defined medium (CDM) with glucose limitation and enhanced buffering capacity were found to generate deltapsi of -120 to -140 mV, which is comparable to the parent strains. However, glucose is consumed inefficiently with small growth yields. In contrast to wild-type strains, deltapsi dropped immediately to values below -100 mV when glucose expired and other nutrients such as acetate and lactate did not allow for further growth. Accordingly, the sensitivity of SCVs toward antibiotics known to be taken up through deltapsi, such as aminoglycosides, dropped 10- to 30-fold when compared to the parent strain under routine MIC determination conditions. When growing in CDM, the susceptibility of SCVs varied according to the magnitude of deltapsi.",

Each year, there are ~50 million dengue infections and ~500,000 individuals are hospitalized with DHF, mainly in Southeast Asia. Dengue in India has dramatically expanded over the last few decades, with rapidly changing epidemiology. The first major DHF outbreak in the entire nation occurred in 1996 by dengue virus serotype 2, and after a gap of almost a decade, the country faced yet another DF outbreak in the year 2003 by dengue virus serotype 3. A dramatic increase in the number and frequency of outbreaks followed, and, at present, in most of the states of India, dengue is almost endemic. At present, all the four serotypes are seen in circulation, but the predominant serotype keeps changing. Despite this trend, surveillance, reporting, and diagnosis of dengue remain largely passive in India. More active community-based epidemiological studies with intensive vector control and initiatives for dengue vaccine development should be geared up to control the spread of dengue in India.

Intracellular persistence in human mammary epithelial cells (HBL100cell line) monolayer revealed that SCV102 isolate had minimal cytopathological effects compared with its parent strains. SCV102 isolate and its parent strain S. aureus 101 indicate similar resistant pattern to four antibiotics. On the contrary, the minimal inhibitory concentrations values for chloramphenicol and sulfadimethoxine were much higher in SCV102 than that of S. aureus 101.

Despite being first described as an oncogene, p53 has long been recognized as a major tumor suppressor and the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. The frequent inactivation of p53 in tumors fostered the attractive notion that its functional reinstatement would constitute an effective tumor-specific therapy. Strategies aimed at restoring wild-type p53 function in tumors are being actively pursued and some have reached clinical trials, highlighting the important translational potential of this new field of research. The therapeutic impact of those strategies in human cancer was recently modeled in mice where a clear, even if limited, therapeutic benefit of p53-targeted therapies was established. As unexpected aspects of p53 tumor suppressive function continue to be uncovered, new opportunities arise to further improve p53 therapy outcome. In this review we discuss the in vivo mechanisms underlying p53-mediated tumor prevention, the impact of p53 functional restoration in tumors and how this knowledge may be exploited to improve the efficacy of p53-targeted cancer therapy. A particular emphasis is given to the newly identified metabolic functions of p53. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

A 60-month study was attempted to ascertain the association between inpatient MRSA ratio and ward-specific AUDs as well as the former and latter study intervals, specimen types, and ward specialty. During the study, the professionals in infection control regulated the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials and those for MRSA. By both month and ward, the ratio of inpatients positive for MRSA to those positive for S. aureus was calculated. Factors associated with MRSA ratio included AUDs averaged for the sampling month and its previous month, outpatient MRSA ratio by age, ward specialty, specimen type, and half intervals to represent historical changes. Of a total of 4,245 strains of S. aureus isolated during the 5-year study, 2,232 strains (52.6%) were MRSA. By year, outpatient MRSA ratio at age \u226515 decreased in later years, as did inpatient MRSA ratio. Multivariate analysis for inpatient MRSA ratio revealed a positive risk in AUDs for meropenem (odds ratio [OR] 1.761; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.761-2.637, P = 0.01), imipenem-cilastatin (OR 1.583; 95% CI 1.087-2.306, P = 0.02), ampicillin-sulbactam (OR 1.623; 95% CI 1.114-2.365, P = 0.01), and minocycline (OR 1.680; CI 1.135-2.487, P = 0.01), respiratory care ward (OR 2.292; 95% CI 1.085-4.841, P = 0.03), and outpatient MRSA ratio (OR 1.536; 95% CI 1.070-2.206, P = 0.02).

Many cases, particularly in low-prevalence settings, result from the reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI); potentially acquired years prior to active disease. Up to one-third of the world's population has been infected with LTBI, and so may be at risk for future active TB disease. A variety of antituberculosis medications and treatment regimens have now been evaluated in the management of LTBI, with the aim of eradicating tuberculosis bacilli and reducing the likelihood of subsequent reactivation disease. This article reviews LTBI therapies and their use in clinical contexts, and considers future directions for individual and population-based strategies in LTBI management.",

        "abstract": "The mortality rate for candidemia is approximately 30%-60%. However, prognostic factors in patients with candidemia have not yet been elucidated in detail. The aim of the present study was to analyze prognostic factors for candidemia using the mortality rate and Candida isolates of patients with candidemia. Seventy-five patients with candidemia were analyzed between January 2007 and December 2013. The main outcome of this study was the 30-day mortality rate after the diagnosis of candidemia. The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score (APACHE II score) was measured in 34 patients (45.3%). Odds ratios (ORs) for death due to candidemia were analyzed using a multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. Twenty (26.6%) patients died within 30 days of being diagnosed with candidemia. Non-survivors had a significantly higher APACHE II score (n=7, mean; 18.9\u00b14.5) than that of survivors (n=27, mean; 14.0\u00b15.0). Advanced age (OR =1.1, 95% confidence interval =1.01-1.23, P=0.04) was a significant risk factor for a high mortality rate, whereas removal of a central venous catheter (OR =0.03, 95% confidence interval =0.002-0.3, P=0.01) was associated with a lower mortality rate. Seventy-six Candida spp. were isolated from blood cultures: Candida albicans 28 (36.8%), Candida parapsilosis 23 (30.2%), Candida guilliermondii 16 (21.0%), Candida glabrata four (5.2%), Candida tropicalis two (2.6%), and Candida spp. three (3.9%) that could not be identified. C. parapsilosis was the most frequently isolated species in younger patients (<65 years), whereas C. albicans was the most frequently isolated in elderly patients (\u226565 years). Physicians who treat candidemia need to consider removing the central venous catheter and pay attention to the general condition of patients, particularly that of elderly patients.",

At the Veterans Affairs New Jersey Healthcare System (VA NJHCS), we investigated the virulence and plasmid transferability of 60 clinically unique KPC-containing K. pneumoniae isolates. All 60 isolates were negative for known virulence factors K1, K2, and K5 capsular antigens; rmpA; and the aerobactin gene by polymerase chain reaction. Isolates varied in their susceptibility to neutrophil phagocytosis, but were less resistant than the virulent serotype K1 isolate. Additionally, no deaths were seen on murine lethality studies. Conjugation results of this study showed that the blaKPC gene can be transferred into an Escherichia coli J-53 strain but not to E. coli JP-995. However, the stability is very limited as E. coli J-53 does not retain blaKPC-containing plasmids for any period of time. The lack of virulence factors in the set of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae studied suggests that morbidity and mortality may be due to detection issues or lack of effective antibiotics.",

In June 2012, 295 inpatients and 199 healthcare workers from three hospitals in Luanda, Angola were nasal swabbed for S. aureus and MRSA carriage. A total of 117 individuals (23.7%) were S. aureus nasal carriers, out of which 68 (58.1%) were colonized with MRSA. The majority of the MRSA isolates (74%) belonged to a single clonal lineage, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) A-ST5-IVa associated with three spa types (spa types t105/t311/t11657), followed by PFGE C-ST88-IVa (spa types t186/t325/t786/t1951/t3869) (n=9; 12%); the other 11 MRSA isolates were representatives of 4 additional lineages. Almost half (49%) of the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates belonged to three major clones: PFGE B-ST508 (spa types t050/t861/t1346/t1574/t2626/t12218), PFGE D-ST45 (spa types t939/t11656), and PFGE E-ST30 (spa types t1202/t9118). MSSA isolates presented a high variability of virulence factors, including Panton-Valentine leukocidine (7.9%).

To assess temporal trends of established genotypes associated with tolerance to clinically important antimalarials used in Kenya over the last two decades, we sequenced a region of the pfcrt locus encompassing codons 72-76 of the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter, full-length pfmdr1 - encoding multi-drug resistance protein, P-glycoprotein homolog (Pgh1) and pfdhfr encoding dihydrofolate reductase, in 485 archived Plasmodium falciparum positive blood samples collected in coastal Kenya at four different time points between 1995 and 2013. Microsatellite loci were also analyzed to compare the genetic backgrounds of parasite populations circulating before and after the withdrawal of chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Our results reveal a significant increase in the prevalence of the pfcrt K76 wild-type allele between 1995 and 2013 from 38% to 81.7% (p<. 0.0001). In contrast, we noted a significant decline in wild-type pfdhfr S108 allele (p<. 0.0001) culminating in complete absence of this allele in 2013. We also observed a significant increase in the prevalence of the wild-type pfmdr1 N86/Y184/D1246 haplotype from 14.6% in 1995 to 66.0% in 2013 (p<. 0.0001) and a corresponding decline of the mutant pfmdr1 86Y/184Y/1246Y allele from 36.4% to 0% in 19. years (p<. 0.0001). We also show extensive genetic heterogeneity among the chloroquine-sensitive parasites before and after the withdrawal of the drug in contrast to a selective sweep around the triple mutant pfdhfr allele, leading to a mono-allelic population at this locus. These findings highlight the importance of continual surveillance and characterization of parasite genotypes as indicators of the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarials, particularly in the context of changes in malaria treatment policy.",

        "abstract": "PMA1 is a yeast gene that codes for the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase, a protein commonly referred to as Pma1p. Ebselen (2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one) is a synthetic selenium-containing compound that has recently been shown to display antimicrobial activity owing to its ability to inhibit Pma1p. Ebselen is able to block the activity of Pma1p not only in opportunistic pathogens such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans but also in nonpathogenic yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A series of in vitro studies aimed at evaluating the antifungal activity of ebselen were performed. At low concentrations (<10 microM), ebselen was fungistatic against three strains of S. cerevisiae (IC(50) approximately 3 microM) and one fluconazole-resistant strain of C. albicans (IC(50) approximately 6 microM), and at a high concentration (30 microM) it was fungicidal against C. albicans. Moreover, ebselen was found to inhibit medium acidification by the fluconazole-resistant strain of C. albicans in a concentration-dependent manner. In comparison to currently used antifungal agents represented by azole (itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole) and polyene (amphotericin B) compounds, ebselen was at least 10-fold more potent than fluconazole but less active than the other compounds tested. The present results suggest that the growth inhibitory activity of ebselen toward fluconazole-resistant yeast cells is due, at least in part, to inhibition of Pma1p. Ebselen may also serve as a useful agent in the treatment of infections caused by fluconazole-resistant fungi.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bacteriuria in the form of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is common in the elderly. There is no clinical benefit obtained by treating elderly individuals with ASB. However, its high prevalence leads to the overdiagnosis of UTI and unnecessary antibiotic use, which can result in adverse events, including Clostridium difficile diarrhea and reinfection with antibiotic-resistant organisms.\\n\\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective audit that assessed the management of nosocomial bacteriuria in elderly patients admitted to the over-65 years rehabilitation unit of a secondary level care hospital in New Zealand. Identified bacteriuria episodes had the timing of sample collection relative to admission, microbial etiology, antibiotic susceptibility profile, inflammatory marker level, and treatment determined. Episodes were classified into six different clinical groups based on the presence or absence of signs and symptoms, urinary catheter status, and systemic inflammatory response. The proportion of bacteriuria episodes by clinical grouping and the level of treatment by clinical group were determined, followed by assessment of the amount of overtreatment in terms of the number of unnecessary antibiotic courses and unnecessary antibiotic treatment days.\\n\\nRESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was identified in 30% of patients, with 35% of urine samples collected in the immediate postadmission period. Fifty-four percent of the bacteriuria episodes were ASB or catheter-associated ASB (CA-ASB) without an inflammatory response, 24% were ASB or CA-ASB with raised inflammatory markers, and 22% were UTI or CA-UTI. The most common cause of bacteriuria was Escherichia coli, although the etiology was diverse, especially after prolonged hospitalization or in catheterized patients. A large proportion of organisms were resistant to one or more of the commonly used oral antibiotics. Treatment of ASB and CA-ASB accounted for 43% of all antibiotic courses received. Furthermore, treatment of ASB and CA-ASB combined with unnecessarily prolonged treatment days for clinically relevant infections accounted for 55% of all antibiotic treatment days received.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The results suggest that inappropriate urine screening was occurring and that 43% of antibiotic courses and 55% of all antibiotic treatment days were unnecessary. Current practice is amenable to improvement by performing urine culture only when clinically indicated, focusing on clinical signs and symptoms to diagnose clinically significant UTI rather than a positive culture, and using, where possible, the ecologically least damaging antibiotic for the shortest duration required.",

In Germany alone, approximately 14,000 cases of MRSA-associated NP occur annually, which may have a significant impact on health care resource use and associated economic costs. The objective of this study was to investigate the economic impact of linezolid compared with that of vancomycin in the treatment of hospitalized patients with MRSA-confirmed NP in the German health care system.\\n\\nMethods\\nA 4-week decision tree model incorporated published data and expert opinion on clinical parameters, resource use, and costs (2012 euros) was constructed. The base case first-line treatment duration for patients with MRSA-confirmed NP was 10 days. Treatment success (survival), failure due to lack of efficacy, serious adverse events, and mortality were possible outcomes that could impact costs. Alternate scenarios were analyzed, such as varying treatment duration (7 or 14 days) or treatment switch due to a serious adverse event/treatment failure (at day 5 or 10).\\n\\nResults\\nThe model calculated total base case inpatient costs of \u20ac15,116 for linezolid and \u20ac15,239 for vancomycin. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio favored linezolid (versus vancomycin), with marginally lower costs (by \u20ac123) and greater efficacy (+2.7% absolute difference in the proportion of patients successfully treated for MRSA NP). Approximately 85%\u201387% of the total treatment costs were attributed to hospital stay (primarily in the intensive care unit). Sensitivity analysis yielded similar results.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe model results show that linezolid is a cost-effective alternative to vancomycin for MRSA-confirmed NP, largely attributable to the higher clinical response rate of patients treated with linezolid.",

Its divergent actions reflect the complexity of this protein, because in certain types of cancers, such as melanomas and gliomas, SPARC is associated with a highly aggressive tumor phenotype, while in others, mainly ovarian, neuroblastomas and colorectal cancers, SPARC may function as a tumor suppressor. Recent studies have also demonstrated a role for SPARC in sensitizing therapy-resistant cancers. Here, the role of SPARC in cancer progression and its potential application in cancer therapy is discussed. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This group is composed of three categories as per the 2002 WHO guidelines: (1) well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS/DDLPS); (2) myxoid and round cell liposarcoma (MLS and RCL); and (3) pleomorphic liposarcoma (PLS). While clustered together, these histological subtypes are widely diverse in their clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics. In general, surgery still remains the mainstay of LPS therapy and the only approach offering the potential of cure. Effective therapeutic strategies for locally advanced and metastatic disease are currently lacking and are crucially needed. With the current gradually increasing knowledge of LPS genetic- and epigenetic-associated deregulations, the ultimate goal is to develop drugs that can specifically eliminate LPS cells while sparing normal tissues. This tumor-tailored target-orientated approach will hopefully result in a significant improvement in the outcome of patients suffering from these poor prognosis malignancies. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was performed to investigate the clinical features and outcomes for ESBL-producing ECSM bloodstream infections. Patients with ECSM bloodstream infection were enrolled from October 2006 to March 2008. Of 124 patients with ECSM bacteremia, 30 cases (24.2%) were ESBL-producing isolates. Immunosuppressive drugs use within 30 days (p=0.028), indwelling device at the time of bacteremia (p=0.042) and antibiotics use within 3 months (p=0.022) were independently associated with ESBL production in multivariate analysis. Overall 30-day mortality rate was 19.4% (24/124). When the 30-day mortality rate was evaluated, no significant difference was found between the ESBL group (16.6%; 5/30) and non-ESBL group (20.2%; 19/94). Hospitalization was longer in the ESBL group than in the non-ESBL group (65.4\u00b192.8 vs. 32.9\u00b137.8 days, respectively; p=0.007). The recent use of antibiotics (especially broad-spectrum cephalosporins and other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics) was an important risk factor for ESBL among ECSM bacteremia. ESBL production of ECSM isolates was not significantly associated with mortality but ESBL-producing organisms have an important impact on the duration of hospital stay and subsequent medical cost.",

A case-control survey among Swedish patients was performed at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital to identify risk factors for developing an infection with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in a low endemic country. METHODS: We used a computerized database to identify patients with growth of ESBL-producing E. coli (n = 109) in urine or blood cultures and an equal number of controls matched for age and gender with non ESBL-producing E. coli in urine and blood diagnosed between January and October 2008. We used unadjusted P-values. RESULTS: Patients with ESBL-producing E. coli had a significantly (P < 0.05) higher likelihood of having traveled to Asia including Turkey and the Middle East including Egypt (14/58) than the non-ESBL-positive group (4/53). Hospital stay during the previous year (P < 0.04), especially for more than one month, was another significant (P = 0.01) risk factor for infection with ESBL-producing E. coli (8/58). A stay in the surgical department was a further risk factor (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified 22 of 58 (38%) patients with ESBL-producing E. coli by considered significant risk factors before starting antibiotics.",

We therefore applied POT to 91 MRSA isolates detected in cultures from inpatients at our hospital between May and October 2014. Among the 91 isolates, 12 POT types comprising 38 isolated MRSA strains were considered as overlapping. Five of them were detected in different wards, whereas the remaining seven were found in the same ward, including the emergency department. Three of seven POT number 93-155-111 strains were detected in the surgical ward, and all of four POT number 93-157-61 strains were detected in the cardiosurgical ward. These data suggested that transmission of the MRSA strains with the same POT-types from the same wards was nosocomial, and that POT accurately and rapidly identified MRSA strains, which allowed effective control of infection and transmission.",

This breakthrough in medicine is expected to be achieved largely due to the implementation of \"lab-on-the-chip\" technology capable of performing hundreds, even thousands of biochemical, cellular and genetic tests on a single sample of blood or other body fluid. Focusing on a few disease-specific examples, this review discusses selected technologies and their combinations likely to be incorporated in the \"lab-on-the-chip\" and to provide rapid and versatile information about specific diseases entities. Focusing on breast cancer and after an overview of single-nucleofide polymorphism (SNP)-screening methodologies, we discuss the diagnostic and prognostic importance of SNPs. Next, using Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) as an example, we provide a brief overview of powerful and innovative integration of traditional immuno-histochemistry techniques with advanced biophysical methods such as NMR-spectroscopy or Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. A brief overview of the challenges and opportunities provided by protein and aptamer microarrays follows. We conclude by highlighting novel and promising biochemical markers for the development of personalized treatment of cancer and other diseases: serum cytochrome c, cytokeratin-18 and -19 and their proteolytic fragments for the detection and quantitation of malignant tumor mass, tumor cell turn-over, inflammatory processes during hepatitis and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and apoptotic/necrotic cancer cell death.

The novel \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor avibactam (NXL104) is a potent inhibitor of both class A and class C enzymes. The potential of avibactam for induction of ampC expression in Enterobacter cloacae was investigated by ampC messenger ribonucleic acid quantitation. Cefoxitin and clavulanic acid were confirmed as ampC inducers, whereas avibactam was found to exert no effect on ampC expression.

A higher genetic diversity was found among methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates where 58.5% (n=24) belonged to four major lineages: PFGE type A-ST15-t084; PFGE C-ST508-t861 or related; PFGE D-ST152-t355 or related; and PFGE G-ST121-t159/t2304. Despite the common nonmultiresistant profile, 98% of the isolates harbored two or more virulence factors. Panton-Valentine leukocidine was detected in 36% of the isolates, all MSSA. S. aureus cross-transmission between HCW and patients in the pediatric and medicine wards and the detection of identical MRSA strains among patients in two different wards evidenced the need of implementation of additional infection control measures in this hospital.",

This study was performed to evaluate risk factors and clinical outcomes of community-onset bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. A total of 435 patients with community-onset K. pneumoniae bacteremia were included and data from patients with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae bacteremia were compared to those with non-ESBL-producing bacteremia. Isolates with ESBLs were microbiologically characterized. Of 435 patients with community-onset K. pneumoniae bacteremia, 33 (7.6%) were infected with ESBL producers, of which 25 were further classified as healthcare-associated infections. The most common underlying diseases were solid tumors (n = 20, 60.6%) and diabetes mellitus (n = 10, 30.3%), and the most common infection was intra-abdominal infection (n = 20, 60.6%). Multivariate analysis showed that corticosteroid use (odds ratio [OR] = 13.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.93-97.6, p = 0.009), percutaneous tubes (OR = 7.30, 95% CI = 2.41-22.12, p < 0.001), and prior receipt of antibiotics (OR = 5.65, 95% CI = 2.43-14.16, p < 0.001) were significant factors associated with ESBL producers.

Among 16 isolates, for which the ESBL characterization was performed by PCR, the most common types of ESBLs were SHV (n = 16) and cefotaxime-M-2 (n = 5).

Thirty six isolates were vancomycin-resistant and five were vancomycin-susceptible. eBURST analysis of MLST sequence types generated two groups: (1) group 1 (27 isolates) forming a clonal complex (CC17) with the predicted founder corresponding to ST17, a genotype identified in 1994, that included esp-positive and -negative clones isolated from hospitalized patients; and (2) group 2 (14 isolates) including esp-negative clones from different sources (hospitalized patients, healthy persons and non-human sources). The hyl gene was found in five strains with different PFGE types, all belonging to group 1, whereas cylA, gelE, and asa1, were not detected in any of the isolates. Our data showed that the evolution of the MLST C1 epidemic lineage has been continuing in several Italian areas and generating new clones with different PFGE patterns. The main, though not the sole, mechanism that has driven this evolution was confirmed to be linked to the presence of the esp gene",

Although RhoGDIs are known to inhibit Rho activities, recent studies indicate that RhoGDIs can also act as positive regulators through their ability to target Rho GTPases to specific subcellular membranes or to protect the GTPases from degradation by caspases. RhoGDIs are aberrantly expressed in human tumors and this may contribute to Rho-induced cancer progression. This review will discuss the dual roles of RhoGDIs in the regulation of Rho GTPases, highlighting a possible role in regulating tumorigenicity. In addition, the potential for targeting RhoGDIs for anticancer therapy will be discussed. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The lack of a std. method to detect ESBL in Enterobacter spp. has led to underestimating its frequency. The aim of this study was to evaluate ESBL detection in Enterobacter spp. By the double-disk synergy test (DDST) and combined disk test (CDT) assay using cefepime, cefotaxime, and ceftazime as substrates for ESBL, plus AmpC inhibitors in different assocns. A total of 83 Enterobacter spp. ESBL and 31 non-ESBL Enterobacter spp. were tested, and a cutoff point \u22653 mm was defined using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for combined disk methods. All tests showed 100% specificity. The sensitivity was 89.2% for DDST and CDT without AmpC inibitor, 90.4% in the combined disk test in Mueller-Hinton agar contg. phenylboronic acid (CDT-PBAA), and 94% in the combined disk test in Mueller-Hinton agar contg. cloxacillin (CDT-CLXA). Cefepime was the best substrate, mainly when AmpC inhibitors were not used. However, superior results were achieved when all cephalosporins were evaluated together. In conclusion, to improve ESBL detection in Enterobacter spp., some modifications in phenotypic tests are needed, such as to reduce the distance between the disks to 20 mm in DDST, to use a cutoff point for \u22653 mm on the CDT, and to include a cefepime disk or an inhibitor of AmpC in all tests.

Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined with EUCAST methodology. Bacteriologic cure was defined as <10(3) CFU/ml at follow-up (30 days), and clinical cure as resolved UTI symptoms after completed treatment. All patients receiving pivmecillinam had good clinical response (8/8), but bacteriological cure rates were low (2/8). However, none of the patients with persisting bacteriuria had a relapse of UTI symptoms within 6 months. All isolates were susceptible to the given antimicrobial. Most isolates belonged to the CTX-M-1 group (n=11, 65%) or CTX-M-9-group (n=4, 24%). Four E. coli isolates belonged to the international clone O25b-ST131 (25%). In conclusion, pivmecillinam had good clinical activity against lower UTI caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, but bacteriological cure rates were low.

Rectal or cloacal swabs were obtained from cattle, pigs, chicken, ducks, geese, and pigeons in slaughterhouses or wholesale markets over a 5-month period in 2002. Antibiotic-containing medium was used for selective isolation of potentially ESBL-producing E. coli. Of 734 samples analyzed, six (2%) from pigs, three (3.1%) from cattle, and one (3%) from pigeons had E. coli strains with the ESBL phenotype. The ESBL content for the 10 isolates include CTX-M-3 (n = 4), CTX-M-13 (n = 3), CTX-M-14 (n = 2), and CTX-M-24 (n = 1). In five isolates, the blaCTX-M gene was encoded on transferable plasmids (60 or 90 kb), and the gene was found to transfer to E. coli (J53 or JP995) with frequencies of 10-7 to 10-3 per donor cells. The ten isolates had five distinct pulsotypes with some clonal spread. However, the isolates from the different kinds of animals were not clonaly related. These findings imply that bacteria of animal origins may serve as reservoirs of some ESBL genes. \u00a9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",

METHODS: This retrospective observational medical chart review study enrolled physicians from four UAE sites to collect data for 24 patients with documented MRSA complicated skin and soft tissue infections, hospitalized between July 2010 and June 2011, and discharged alive by July 2011. Data include clinical characteristics and outcomes, hospital length of stay (LOS), MRSA-targeted IV and PO antibiotic use, and ES and ED eligibility using literature-based and expert-validated criteria. RESULTS: Five included patients (20.8%) were switched from IV to PO antibiotics while being inpatients. Actual length of MRSA-active treatment was 10.8\u00b17.0 days, with 9.8\u00b16.6 days of IV therapy. Patients were hospitalized for a mean 13.9\u00b19.3 days. The most frequent initial MRSA-active therapies used were vancomycin (37.5%), linezolid (16.7%), and clindamycin (16.7%). Eight patients were discharged with MRSA-active antibiotics, with linezolid prescribed most frequently (n=3; 37.5%). Fifteen patients (62.5%) met ES criteria and potentially could have discontinued IV therapy 8.3\u00b16.0 days sooner, and eight (33.3%) met ED criteria and potentially could have been discharged 10.9\u00b15.8 days earlier. CONCLUSION: While approximately one-fifth of patients were switched from IV to PO antibiotics in the UAE, there were clear opportunities for further optimization of health care resource use. Over half of UAE patients hospitalized for MRSA complicated skin and soft tissue infections could be eligible for ES, with one-third eligible for ED opportunities, resulting in substantial potential for reductions in IV days and bed days.",

        "abstract": "Lantibiotics are a unique group within the antimicrobial peptides characterized by the presence of thioether amino acids (lanthionine and methyllanthionine). These peptides are produced by and primarily act on Gram-positive bacteria exerting multiple activities at the cytoplasmic membrane of susceptible strains. Previously, the cell wall precursor lipid II was identified as the molecular target for the prototype lantibiotic nisin. Binding and sequestration of lipid II blocks the incorporation of the central cell wall precursor into the growing peptidoglycan network, thereby inhibiting the formation of a functional cell wall. Additionally, nisin combines this activity with a unique target-mediated pore formation, using lipid II as a docking molecule. The interaction with the pyrophosphate moiety of lipid II is crucial for nisin binding. We show that, besides binding to lipid II, nisin interacts with the lipid intermediates lipid III (undecaprenol-pyrophosphate-N-acetyl-glucosamine) and lipid IV (undecaprenol-pyrophosphate-N-acetyl-glucosamine-N-acetyl-mannosamine) of the wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis pathway. Binding of nisin to the precursors was observed at a stoichiometry of 2:1. The specific interaction with WTA precursors further promoted target-mediated pore formation in artificial lipid bilayers. Specific interactions with lipid III and lipid IV could also be demonstrated for related type A lantibiotics, for example, gallidermin, containing the conserved lipid-II-binding motif.",

A retrospective review of hospitalized patients with deep neck abscess diagnosed at a tertiary-care, general hospital between April 2001 and October 2006. The study enrolled 100 patients. The bacterial cultures of 89 patients yielded positive results (89%). The predominant aerobes were viridans streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The predominant anaerobes included species of Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, and Bacteroides. Five different combinations of empiric antibiotics, namely regimen 1: penicillin G and clindamycin and gentamicin, regimen 2: ceftriaxone and clindamycin, regimen 3: ceftriaxone and metronidazole, regimen 4: cefuroxime and clindamycin, and regimen 5: penicillin and metronidazole, were compared using the antimicrobial susceptibility of 89 cases. The coverage rates of regimens 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 67.4%, 76.4%, 70.8%, 61.8%, and 16.9%, respectively. The coverage of regimen 5 was considerably worse than that of the other four regimens (p < 0.001). Regimen 2 was significantly better than regimen 4 (p < 0.001). Regimen 2 had better coverage than regimens 1 (p = 0.096) and 3 (p = 0.302), but the difference was not statistically significant.

These infections are suspected to be related to increased mortality. We aimed to estimate the difference in mortality due to bloodstream infections (BSIs) with ESBL-positive and ESBL-negative E. coli isolates and to determine the molecular epidemiology of our ESBL-positive isolates.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cohort study on consecutive patients with E. coli BSI between 2008 and 2010 at the Charit\u00e9 University Hospital. Collected data were ESBL production, basic demographic parameters, and underlying diseases by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). The presence of ESBL genes was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Phylogenetic groups of ESBL-positive E. coli were determined by PCR. Risk factors for mortality were analyzed by multivariable regression analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS: We identified 115 patients with BSI due to E. coli with ESBL phenotype and 983 due to ESBL-negative E. coli. Fifty-eight percent (n=67) of the ESBL-positive BSIs were hospital-acquired. Among the 99 isolates that were available for PCR screening and sequencing, we found mainly 87 CTX-M producers, with CTX-M-15 (n=55) and CTX-M-1 (n=21) as the most common types. Parameters significantly associated with mortality were age, CCI, and length of stay before and after onset of BSI.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The most common ESBL genotypes in clinical isolates from E. coli BSIs were CTX-M-15 (58%) and CTX-M-1 (22%). ESBL production in clinical E. coli BSI isolates was not related to increased mortality. However, the common occurrence of hospital-acquired BSI due to ESBL-positive E. coli indicates future challenges for hospitals.",

The strains were selected in the period between June and August 2012, according to their susceptibility patterns to carbapenems. Resistant isolates were screened for metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) production with the use of the imipenem-EDTA disk synergy test, and positive findings were confirmed by PCR. The type of VIM beta-lactamase gene was determined by sequencing of PCR products. The genetic relatedness was evaluated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis.

Five patients were infected and one patient was colonized with a single clone of multidrug-resistant VIM-1-producing E. cloacae susceptible only to colistin. Three cases of lower respiratory tract infections, one case of bacteremia, and one case of intra-abdominal infection were identified. All cases were hospital-acquired after prolonged stay in ICU.

The discovery of this activity renewed the interest in this colicin and opened the way for biochemical and structural analyses of this new class of enzyme (phosphoesterase). The identification of a few orthologs produced by pathogenic strains of Pseudomonas further enlarged the field of investigation.

This study compares the in vitro activity of tigecycline (TIG), recently introduced to Egyptian market, to other potentially active antimicrobials as Colistin (COL), imipenem (IPM), levofloxacin (LEV), and piperacillin/tazobactam (PIP/TAZ) against 67 Gram-negative clinical isolates obtained from El- Meery Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. El-Meery Hospital is a 1,500-bed tertiary teaching hospital where TIG has not been previously used. Based on MIC(90)s, TIG was found to be a comparator to IPM and COL (MIC(90)= 8 mug/ml). LEV and PIP/TAZ were less active than TIG exhibiting high MIC(90)s. TIG inhibited 100% of Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae and 60% of Ps. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates. In time-kill studies against IPM-resistant isolates, TIG showed bactericidal activity after 6 hours of contact against the Enterobacteriaceae isolates and after 3 hours for the tested Ps. aeruginosa isolates at 4x and 8x MIC. Against A. baumannii, TIG exerted a bacteriostatic effect. TIG demonstrated variable ability to suppress biofilm formation affecting mainly E. coli and A. baumannii isolates. These results point TIG to be a promising agent in treatment of infections caused by strains for which adequate therapy has been limited. As far as we know, this is the first report evaluating the in vitro activity of TIG against Egyptian clinical isolates.",

The present study examined the effects of daily bathing with CHG on the recovery and antimicrobial susceptibility of cultivable cutaneous bacteria. The objectives of this study were to (1) explore the effects of clinical CHG bathing on cultivable cutaneous bacteria, (2) study the relationship between CHG minimum inhibitory concentration and antimicrobial susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci, and (3) demonstrate the feasibility of the approach so a more definitive study may be performed. Significant decreases in bacterial colony counts and phenotypic diversity occurred with greater CHG exposure. The findings also suggest an inverse relationship between CHG minimum inhibitory concentration and antimicrobial susceptibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the appropriate use of imipenem/cilastatin in a local tertiary care hospital. The study assessed the indication both empirically and after the culture results were available, the dose and dose adjustment in renal failure, as well as the incidence of seizure in hospitalized patients receiving imipenem/cilastatin. Methods: This observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital over a 3-month period. The treatment of 100 patients with imipenem/cilastatin was evaluated both empirically and after culture results were available. Analysis of the appropriateness of imipenem/cilastatin indication, dose, and monitoring of seizure frequency was based on the package insert, updated published guidelines, and clinical judgment. Results: Patients from internal medicine and intensive care units comprised approximately 50% of the population in the study. The patients received imipenem/cilastatin mainly for urinary tract infections (27%) or for sepsis of an unknown focus (22%). The use of imipenem/cilastatin empirically was appropriate in 97.2% (n=69/71) of the cases, and its use postculture in 86% of the cases. There were 29% of the patients who were not started on imipenem/cilastatin empirically. Four patients out of the 29 patients (13.8%) who were not started on imipenem/cilastatin empirically inappropriately received imipenem/cilastatin post-culture results. Thirty-three patients (33%) were not dosed appropriately, 30 of whom had renal impairment and creatinine clearance fluctuations. Only one patient developed a seizure while on imipenem/cilastatin. Conclusion: The prescription of imipenem/cilastatin at our setting was mostly appropriate to what is recommended in the guidelines and the literature, although a few cases could have been managed better. Dosage adjustment, however, was not as appropriate, mainly in patients who did not have a stable creatinine clearance.",

Delay in treatment, with subsequent huge soft tissue loss and associated severe sepsis, remains a major cause of death in the management of NF.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore clinical characteristics that may be used to predict severe sepsis in patients with NF, in the context of routine clinical practice in northern Thailand.\\n\\nMETHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted. The patient cohort in this study consisted of all patients who were diagnosed with NF by surgical or pathological confirmation. The follow-up period started with the admission date and ended with the discharge date. The clinical variables were collected from patients registered at three provincial hospitals in northern Thailand from 2009 to 2012. The clinical predictors for severe sepsis were analyzed using multivariable risk regression.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 1,452 patients were diagnosed with NF, either with severe sepsis (n=237 [16.3%]) or without severe sepsis (n=1,215 [83.7%]). From the multivariable analysis, female sex (relative risk [RR] =1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.04-2.20), diabetes mellitus (RR =1.40; 95% CI =1.25-1.58), chronic heart disease (RR =1.31; 95% CI =1.15-1.49), hemorrhagic bleb (RR =1.47; 95% CI =1.32-1.63), skin necrosis (RR =1.45; 95% CI =1.34-1.57), and serum protein <6 g/dL (RR =2.67; 95% CI =1.60-4.47) were all predictive factors for severe sepsis.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The clinical predictors for severe sepsis in patients with suspicion of NF included female sex, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart disease, hemorrhagic bleb, skin necrosis, and serum protein <6 d/dL. The risk ratio was much higher in patients with total protein less than 6 g/dL, which is associated with malnutrition. Therefore, provision of sufficient nutritional support and close monitoring for these clinical predictors may be beneficial to reduce morbidity and mortality.",

        "abstract": "Although Lyme disease remains a controversial illness, recent events have created an unprecedented opportunity to make progress against this serious tick-borne infection. Evidence presented during the legally mandated review of the restrictive Lyme guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has confirmed the potential for persistent infection with the Lyme spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, as well as the complicating role of tick-borne coinfections such as Babesia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, and Bartonella species associated with failure of short-course antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, renewed interest in the role of cell wall-deficient (CWD) forms in chronic bacterial infection and progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of biofilms has focused attention on these processes in chronic Lyme disease. Recognition of the importance of CWD forms and biofilms in persistent B. burgdorferi infection should stimulate pharmaceutical research into new antimicrobial agents that target these mechanisms of chronic infection with the Lyme spirochete. Concurrent clinical implementation of proteomic screening offers a chance to correct significant deficiencies in Lyme testing. Advances in these areas have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease in the coming decade.",

During the 8-week period from April to May, 2001, 27 hospitals participated in a nationwide surveillance program for VISA and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) in Korea. After screening on brain-heart infusion agar containing 4 \u03bcg/ml of vancomycin as previously described, 100 isolates with confluent growth were tested. The medical records of the patients involved were reviewed. Even though VISA or VRSA was not detected among 3,756 MRSA isolates, 18 (0.5%) had a vancomycin MIC of 4 \u03bcg/ml The infections in 12 of these patients, excluding 5 that were colonized, were 8 chronic osteomyelitis, 1 surgical site infection, 1 pneumonia, 1 intra-abdominal infection, and 1 catheter-related infection. Although 11 cases were exposed to glycopeptides for a long time (median 56 days), the site of infection became culture-negative in only 1 case. Two patients died of their S. aureus infections. MRSA with a vancomycin MIC of 4 \u03bcg/ml was rare. Chronic osteomyelitis was the most common type of infection, and prolonged exposure to glycopeptides was associated with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. \u00a9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",

In this study, we intend to not only, assess the evolution of the invasive MRSA in Portuguese hospitals, but also to evaluate the invasive methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) population and the relationship between both populations. In the current study, two major MRSA clones were identified: EMRSA-15 that has been dominant for more than 10 years and accounts for 75% of the MRSA isolates, and ST105-II, a clone related with the New York/Japan clone (ST5-II). In contrast, among MSSA, several clonal backgrounds were identified. Despite of the massive predominance of EMRSA-15 in the last decade, an increase in spa diversity has been observed in the last few years, which suggests a recent and local diversification of this clone. Interestingly, MRSA and MSSA populations with related clonal backgrounds appear to have increased as a result of the dissemination of MRSA to the community environment.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Early identification of microbial organisms from respiratory secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is important to guide therapeutic decisions. The objective was to compare the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) relative to the conventional phenotypic method in identifying common bacterial isolates, including nonfermenting Gram-negative bacteria, in a cohort of patients with CF. METHODS: A total of 123 isolates from 50 patients with CF representing 14 bacterial species from respiratory specimens were identified using MALDI-TOF MS in parallel with conventional phenotypic methods. Discrepancies were confirmed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing in five Gram-negative isolates. RESULTS: The MALDI-TOF MS managed to identify 122/123 (99.2%) bacterial isolates to the genus level and 118/123 (95.9%) were identified to the species level. The MALDI-TOF MS results were 100% consistent to the species level with conventional phenotypic identification for isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and other uncommon organisms such as Chryseobacterium gleum and Enterobacter cloacae. The 5/123 (4.6%) isolates misidentified were all Gram-negative bacteria. The isolation of E. cloacae and Haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus may extend the potentially pathogenic list of organisms isolated from patients with CF. CONCLUSION: Although the technique provides an early identification and antimicrobial therapy approach in patients with CF, limitation in the diagnosis of uncommon Gram-negative bacteria may exist.",

        "abstract": "A prospective cohort study was undertaken to describe the epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBLKp) acquisition at an intensive care unit (ICU) in a non-outbreak setting. Surveillance for ESBLKp colonization and infection was performed in patients admitted at the ICU from January, 2000, to May, 2001. Screening for ESBLKp intestinal colonization was done by culturing rectal swab specimens at admission, 72 hr after admission and weekly until discharge or detection of ESBLKp. The incidence of ESBLKp intestinal colonization was 5.8/1,000 patient-days (95%CI, 3.4-10.1), and of ESBLKp infection was 1.7/1,000 patient-days (95%CI, 0.7-4.2). Use of vancomycin (OR 6.6; 95%CI, 1.73-25.28), amphotericin B (OR 12.0; 95%CI, 1.79-80.51), metronidazole (OR 5.3; 95%CI, 1.10-25.65), and ciprofloxacin (OR 0.1; 95%CI, 0.01-0.97) were independently associated with ESBLKp intestinal colonization. Previous ESBLKp colonization (OR 60.6; 95%CI, 56.33-578.73) was independently associated with ESBLKp infection. Each ICU-acquired ESBLKp isolate belonged to a different genotype by ERIC-PCR or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and had a different plasmid profile, suggesting that cross transmission was not the main source for ESBLKp acquisition. Factors associated with ESBLKp in the non-outbreak setting were different from those previously reported during outbreaks. Intestinal ESBLKp colonization was confirmed as a risk factor for infection by this pathogen.",

From 2011 to 2012, we collected ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from patients with bloodstream infections in 13 hospitals in Korea and compared clinical characteristics and outcomes between ST131 and non-ST131 clones. Of the 110 ESBL-producing isolates, the most common ST was ST131 (30.9%). Multivariate analysis showed that recent operation was the only variable associated with the ST131 clone; other comorbid conditions and clinical features were similar between ST131 and non-ST131 clones. CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15 were the predominant types of ESBLs, and CTX-M-15 was significantly associated with ST131. The rate of nonsusceptibility to ciprofloxacin was higher in ST131 than in non-ST131 clones (94.1% vs. 75.0%). No significant differences in 30-day mortality rates were found between ST131 and non-ST131 clones. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age (odds ratio [OR]=5.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-23.89; p=0.027), nosocomial infection (OR=4.81, 95% CI 1.15-20.15; p=0.032), and higher Pitt bacteremia score (OR=7.26, 95% CI 1.41-37.42; p=0.018) were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. The ESBL-producing E. coli ST131 clone has emerged and disseminated in Korea. Our findings reveal similarities in clinical and demographic characteristics between ST131 and non-ST131 clones.

Mid-stream urine samples were collected from apparently healthy elderly and middle-aged volunteers who were participating in community health screening. Samples were processed and bacterial isolates were identified following standard procedures. In total, 128 volunteers (48 men, 76 women) participated in the study. Twenty-eight (22.6%) urinary pathogens were isolated, comprising Klebsiella species in five (17.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one (3.6%), Escherichia coli in 19 (67.9%), and Proteus species in three (10.7%) cases. Women were identified as being at higher risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and the prevalence also increased with increasing age in men. The elderly in this community have a high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and screening for comorbid medical conditions may be of benefit.",

        "abstract": "Acute gastroenteritis, characterized by the onset of diarrhea with or without vomiting, continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children in mostly resource-constrained nations. Although generally a mild and self-limiting disease, gastroenteritis is one of the most common causes of hospitalization and is associated with a substantial disease burden. Worldwide, up to 40% of children aged less than 5 years with diarrhea are hospitalized with rotavirus. Also, some microorganisms have been found predominantly in resource-constrained nations, including Shigella spp, Vibrio cholerae, and the protozoan infections. Prevention remains essential, and the rotavirus vaccines have demonstrated good safety and efficacy profiles in large clinical trials. Because dehydration is the major complication associated with gastroenteritis, appropriate fluid management (oral or intravenous) is an effective and safe strategy for rehydration. Continuation of breastfeeding is strongly recommended. New treatments such as antiemetics (ondansetron), some antidiarrheal agents (racecadotril), and chemotherapeutic agents are often proposed, but not yet universally recommended. Probiotics, also known as \"food supplement,\" seem to improve intestinal microbial balance, reducing the duration and the severity of acute infectious diarrhea. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Society of Paediatric Infectious Diseases guidelines make a stronger recommendation for the use of probiotics for the management of acute gastroenteritis, particularly those with documented efficacy such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Saccharomyces boulardii. To date, the management of acute gastroenteritis has been based on the option of \"doing the least\": oral rehydration-solution administration, early refeeding, no testing, no unnecessary drugs.",

New target-based molecular diagnostic strategies have the potential to identify resistant organisms faster than current culture-based assays. It was the objective of this study to determine whether target site mutations and/or drug pump over-expression are suitable surrogate markers of drug resistance that could aid new molecular-based diagnostic assays. A collection of 59 clinical isolates displaying a range of azole susceptibilities were assayed for mutations within the target gene Erg 11 and for over-expression of drug-efflux pumps Cdr 1, Cdr 2, Flu 1, and Mdr 1, as well as drug target gene Erg 11 by quantitative real-time PCR with molecular beacons. A fluconazole-resistant (MIC>or=64 microg/ml) phenotype was closely associated with over-expression of Cdr 1 (p=0.005), Cdr 2 (p=0.01), and Mdr 1 (p=0.03) along with four mutations in Erg 11 (T 229 A, Y 132 F, S 405 F, G 464 S). Changes in expression levels for Erg 11 and Flu 1 were not statistically correlated with resistance (p=0.27 and p=0.86, respectively). Overall, these findings provide a statistical basis to establish Erg 11 mutations and drug pump over-expression as surrogate markers for phenotypic fluconazole resistance.",

We tested the effect of three efflux inhibitors, reserpine, verapamil, and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), on changes in the OFX minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using Resazurin microtitre assay. These three inhibitors changed the MICs from 2- to 32-fold, with CCCP having the strongest effect. A total of 55%, 74%, and 83% of the tested isolates had changes in MIC of more than two-fold by reserpine, verapamil, and CCCP, respectively. The inhibitors led to similar fold-changes of OFX MICs in the XDR, MDR, PDR, and single OFX-resistant isolates. For each inhibitor, a higher resistance to OFX was associated with the greater efflux pump activity. There were no significant differences in the effect of efflux pump inhibitors upon Beijing and non-Beijing M. tuberculosis genotypes. Taken together, these results indicate that the efflux pump activity was greater in the isolates higher resistant to OFX and had similar effects on isolates with different drug resistant pattern, and had similar effects on Beijing and non-Beijing genotypes.",

We investigated target mutations and resistant genes involved in erythromycin and tetracycline resistance and determined the roles of the bacterial drug efflux systems (cmeB, cmeF, and cmeR) in antimicrobial resistance. Our data show that most of the high-level erythromycin resistance and all of the tetracycline resistance can be explained through mutations in 23S rRNA and the presence of the tetO gene, respectively. The EPIs show the ability to partly reverse drug resistance in these Campylobacter isolates. Based on a fourfold or greater reduction in the erythromycin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), PA\u00dfN and NMP had clear effects in almost of all of the isolates tested. PA\u00dfN had a highly selective action on the ciprofloxacin and tetracycline MICs. Inactivation of cmeB increased susceptibility to all of the antimicrobials tested, whereas inactivation of cmeF and cmeR had no effects. A notable decrease in resistance to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of EGCG demonstrates the resistance-modifying activities of this natural EPI, and indicates its potential use in the control of Campylobacter spp. in the food chain.",

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy is dramatically limited by both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. Several new technologies have been developed over the last decade to more rapidly identify underlying genetic alterations that impart a drug-resistant phenotype. Techniques such as cDNA-based subtraction technologies, SAGE analysis, and most recently cDNA array and high-density micro-array technologies have rapidly expanded our ability to detect changes in RNA transcription in drug-resistant tumors. These technologies are currently being applied to generate a large number of new hypotheses regarding the regulatory molecules underlying the drug-resistance phenotype. These techniques suggest that there is a large number of transcriptional changes which occur in the drug-resistance phenotype and future work will need to focus on dissecting which of these transcriptional changes are central to the drug resistance phenotype, both in vitro, and more importantly within clinical neoplasia.

Results were interpreted following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (2005). Analysis was done according to three periods (1998-2001; 2002-2005; 2006-2008), age, and site of infection.\\nRESULTS: Penicillin nonsusceptibility (PNS) increased significantly over time (15.6%, 17.8%, and 24.8%; p=0.003). Levels of PNS have changed as well: in 2006-2008, 9.1% of the isolates had an MIC \u22652\u2009\u03bcg/ml versus 7.7% in 2002-2005 and 3.4% in 1998-2001. The PNS increase was particularly marked in pediatric isolates (21.4%, 25.5%, and 43.3%; p=0.001). There was no significant difference between the rates of PNS in invasive and noninvasive isolates from children, whereas in adults noninvasive isolates were more penicillin nonsusceptible. Amoxicillin and ceftriaxone nonsusceptible isolates were very rare. An increase of resistance rates was also noticed for erythromycin (9.4%, 12.2%, and 14.4%), tetracycline (20%, 18.6%, and 30.5%), and chloramphenicol (5.6%, 5.6%, and 8.1%). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance rates remained stable (22.8%, 20%, and 23.8%). Proportions of dual nonsusceptibility to penicillin and erythromycin, increased from 5.6% to 8.9%. Multiple drug resistance (resistance to 3 or more antibiotic classes) was found in 0%, 2.4%, and 7.7% of all isolates, respectively.\\nCONCLUSION: The results reported here maybe useful for guiding update of treatment recommendations and suggest the need for continuous surveillance. Increase of antibiotic resistance correlated with antibiotic consumption, stressing the need for elaboration of antibiotic policy in Morocco.",

        "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is the major cause of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer in humans. Treatment involves a two or three drug cocktail, typically including amoxicillin. Increasing levels of resistance to amoxicillin contribute to treatment failures, and higher levels of resistance are believed to be due to multiple genetic mutations. In this study, we examined the progression of spontaneous genetic mutations that contribute to amoxicillin resistance in H. pylori when exposed to increasing concentrations of amoxicillin in vitro. During the selection process, we isolated five strains each of which had progressively higher levels of resistance. Using a whole genome sequencing approach, we identified mutations in a number of genes, notably pbp1, pbp2, hefC, hopC, and hofH, and by sequencing these genes in each isolate we were able to map the order and gradual accumulation of mutations in these isolates. These five isolates, each expressing multiple mutated genes and four transformed strains expressing individually mutated pbp1, hefC, or hofH, were characterized using minimum inhibitory concentrations, amoxicillin uptake, and efflux studies. Our results indicate that mutations in pbp1, hefC, hopC, hofH, and possibly pbp2 contribute to H. pylori high-level amoxicillin resistance. The data also provide evidence for the complexity of the evolution of amoxicillin resistance in H. pylori and indicate that certain families of genes might be more susceptible to amoxicillin resistance mutations than others.",

        "abstract": "The oncologist's challenges, particularly with advanced cancers, are (a) how to predict tumor response to a given drug or regimen; (b) how to predict which tumors of identical histology will remain indolent and which will be likely to progress; and (c) how to determine the appropriate timing of the emergence of drug-resistant cancer cells and hence switch to appropriate therapy. These issues are still unresolved; current clinical practice is hampered by the complexity and heterogeneity of anti-tumor drug resistance where multiple cellular, tumor microenvironment and host factors operate simultaneously. The rapid accumulation of genomic and proteomic databases for complex biological systems, such as cancer, together with advances in technology platforms, have paved the way to an increased molecular understanding and prediction of antitumor drug response. The complex phenotype of drug resistance can now be dissected and specific, clinically relevant markers pinpointed. Several microarray studies of genetic patterns from untreated and pre-treated cancers have provided \"fingerprints\" that can predict response to therapeutics. Nevertheless, such approaches require further validation in experimental models and in large clinical trials before their routine clinical use. Moreover, comparative transcriptional profiling alone is unlikely to predict drug sensitivity/resistance, a dynamic process where protein phosphorylation, protein trafficking, and protein-protein interactions with secondary effectors play key roles in the fate of cancer cells following therapeutic stress. Functional proteomics is potentially more predictive, but still faces technical challenges with regards to sampling, tumor heterogeneity, and lack of standardized methodologies. These obstacles are surmountable with current concerted research efforts and availability of powerful high-throughput genomic and proteomic instrumentations, and thus approaches to predict and overcome drug resistance could be rationalized.",

Fish pond water samples were collected from four sampling sites between March and September 2014. A total of 56 samples were collected and screened for the isolation of Vibrio species using standard culture-based methods. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to confirm the identities of the Vibrio species using the genus-specific and species-specific primers. Vibrio species were detected at all the study sites at a concentration on the order of 10(3) and 10(6) CFU/100\u2009ml. A total of 550 presumptive Vibrio isolates were subjected to PCR confirmation. Of these isolates, 334 isolates tested positive, giving an overall Vibrio prevalence rate of 60.7%. The speciation of the 334 Vibrio isolates from fish ponds yielded 32.63% Vibrio fluvialis, 20.65% Vibrio parahaemolyticus, 18.26% Vibrio vulnificus, and 28.44% other Vibrio species. In all, 167 confirmed Vibrio isolates were selected from a pool of 334 confirmed Vibrio isolates for antibiogram profiling. The susceptibility profiles of 20 antimicrobial agents on the isolates revealed a high level of resistance for AMP(R), ERY(R), NAL(R), SUL(R), TMP(R), SXT(R), TET(R), OTC(R), and CHL(R). The percentage of multiple drug resistance Vibrio isolates was 67.6%. The multiple antibiotic resistance index mean value of 0.365 for the Vibrio isolates found in this study indicated that the Vibrio isolates were exposed to high-risk sources of contamination when antibiotics were frequently used. The resistant Vibrio strains could be transmitted through the food chain to humans and therefore constitutes a risk to public health.",

About 96.9% of tetracycline-resistant isolates were positive for tetM, compared to 26.9% of sensitive strains. Ninety percent of tetracycline-resistant strains were also erythromycin-resistant versus 11.5% of tetracycline-sensitive strains. The intTn gene was present in 87.6% of S. pneumoniae strains and correlated with erythromycin and tetracycline resistance.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance has been central to tuberculosis research in recent times. DNA microarray technology provides the platform to study the genomic variations related to these mechanisms on a comprehensive level. To investigate the role of efflux pumps in drug resistance, we have constructed a custom DNA microarray containing 25 drug efflux pump genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Indian Patent file no. 2071/DEL/2007) and monitored changes in the expression of these genes on exposure of common anti-tuberculous drugs. Expression profiling of efflux pump genes in multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates showed overexpression of 10 genes following exposure to various anti-tuberculous drugs. Although two of these genes (Rv3065 and Rv2938) have already been reported to be active drug efflux pumps in M. tuberculosis in earlier studies, the increased activities of other eight efflux pump genes (Rv1819, Rv2209, Rv2459, Rv2477c, Rv2688, Rv2846, Rv2994, and Rv3728) have been demonstrated in multidrug-resistant isolates by us for the first time. After confirmation of differential expressions of these genes by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, it was observed that a simultaneous overexpression of efflux pump genes Rv2459, Rv3728, and Rv3065 was associated with resistance to the combination of isoniazid and ethambutol, and these drugs, along with streptomycin, were identified to group together, where efflux-mediated drug resistance appears to be important in M. tuberculosis and follows a constant pattern of induction in multidrug-resistant isolates. Isoniazid and ethambutol combination was also found to be affected in 10% (6/60) of the clinical isolates in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chloro phenylhydrazone in resazurin microtitre plate assay, supporting the role of efflux pumps in the resistance to these drugs. Overexpression of two of the genes (Rv2477 and Rv2209) has also been observed with ofloxacin stress in M. tuberculosis.",

Cross-resistance among these drug classes occurs and information on the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), above the normal wild-type distribution, may be useful in identifying isolates that are still accessible to drug treatment. Isolates from the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa were subjected to DNA sequencing of the rrs (1400-1500 region) and tlyA genes.

Isolates with an rrs A1401G mutation showed high-level resistance to AMK (>20\u2009mg/L) and decreased phenotypic susceptibility to CAP (MICs 10-15\u2009mg/L). The MICs of CAP were below the bioavailability of the drug, which suggests that it may still be effective against multi- or extensively drug resistant tuberculosis [M(X)DR-TB].

        "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent a common infection in the pediatric population. Escherichia coli is the most common uropathogen in children, and antimicrobial resistance in this species complicates the treatment of pediatric UTIs. Despite the impact of resistance on empiric antibiotic choice, there is little data on multidrug resistance in pediatric patients. In this paper, we describe characteristics of multidrug-resistant E. coli in pediatric patients using a large national database of uropathogens antimicrobial sensitivities. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to commonly prescribed antibiotics were performed on uropathogens isolated from children presenting to participating hospitals between 1999 and 2001. Data were analyzed separately for four pediatric age groups. Single and multidrug resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) were performed on all specimens. There were a total of 11,341 E. coli urine cultures from 343 infants (0-4 weeks), 1,801 toddlers (5 weeks-24 months), 6,742 preteens (2-12 years), and 2,455 teens (13-17 years). E. coli resistance to ampicillin peaked in toddlers (52.8%) but was high in preteens (52.1%), infants (50.4%), and teens (40.6%). Resistance to two or more antibiotics varied across age groups, with toddlers (27%) leading preteens (23.1%), infants (21%), and teens (15.9%). Resistance to three or more antibiotics was low in all age groups (range 3.1-5.2%). The most common co-resistance in all age groups was ampicillin/TMP-SMZ. In conclusion, less than half of all pediatric UTIs are susceptible to all commonly used antibiotics. In some age groups, there is a significant percentage of co-resistance between the two most commonly used antibiotics (ampicillin and TMP-SMZ).",

        "abstract": "Community-based information on antibiotic susceptibility of urinary bacteria is useful in clinical practice, including empiric therapy. Owing to evidence of coselection of metal and antibiotic resistance, there is growing concern on testing of such selective pressure in clinical as well as environmental bacterial isolates. We examined arsenic tolerance and antibiotic resistance in urinary isolates and their possible coselection among arsenic-exposed subjects. Urinary arsenic levels were assessed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Antibiotic resistance and arsenic tolerance of urinary bacteria were observed by modified Kirby-Bauer and minimum inhibitory concentration methods, respectively. The percentage of one, two, and multidrug-resistant urinary isolates were 30.4%, 37%, and 30.4%, respectively. Isolates showed variable tolerance to arsenic species. Gram-negative isolates were more tolerant to arsenic species than Gram positive. Although statistically insignificant, arsenic tolerance tended to increase from total susceptible to two-drug resistance. However, multiple drug resistance was not induced by the urinary arsenic (p>0.05). We observed moderately positive correlation between urinary arsenic level to arsenic tolerance of isolates (p<0.05). Although tolerance significantly correlated to urinary arsenic level, coselection/coresistance of arsenic to the antibiotic resistance in urinary isolates is inconclusive and remains to be further elucidated.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and genetic determinants of resistance of Campylobacter isolated from raw milk and beef carcasses in Tanzania. The antimicrobial resistance genes tested included blaOXA-61 (ampicillin), aph-3-1 (aminoglycoside), tet(O) (tetracycline), and cmeB (multi-drug efflux pump). The prevalence of Campylobacter was 9.5% in beef carcasses and 13.4% in raw milk, respectively. Using multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we identified 58.1% of the isolates as Campylobacter jejuni, 30.7% as Campylobacter coli, and 9.7% as other Campylobacter spp. One isolate (1.6%) was positive for both C. jejuni and C. coli specific PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion assay and the broth microdilution method showed resistance to: ampicillin (63% and 94.1%), ciprofloxacin (9.3% and 11.8%), erythromycin (53.7% and 70.6%), gentamicin (0% and 15.7%), streptomycin (35.2% and 84.3%), and tetracycline (18.5% and 17.7%), respectively. Resistance to azithromycin (42.6%), nalidixic acid (64.8%), and chloramphenicol (13%) was determined using the disk diffusion assay only, while resistance to tylosin (90.2%) was quantified using the broth microdilution method. The blaOXA-61 (52.6% and 28.1%), cmeB (26.3% and 31.3%), tet(O) (26.3% and 31.3%), and aph-3-1 (5.3% and 3.0%) were detected in C. coli and C. jejuni. These findings highlight the extent of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter occurring in important foods in Tanzania. The potential risks to consumers emphasize the need for adequate control approaches, including the prudent use of antimicrobials to minimize the spread of antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter.",

        "abstract": "From 2001 to 2004, 824 consecutive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates obtained from all the teaching hospitals and primary-care centers serving all of Kuwait were studied for their susceptibility to a number of antibiotics. Of these, 514 (63%) were resistant to penicillin, 55% of which were of intermediate resistance, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.16-1 microg/ml, and 8% were of full resistance (MIC > or =2 microg/ml). The prevalence of penicillin resistance was significantly higher among the eye isolates than the rest of the isolates combined. Resistance across all classes of antibiotics was more common with the isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, imipenem, meropenem, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was observed in 15%, 12.8%, 10.2%, 8.6%, 42%, and 69% of isolates, respectively. Multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae was isolated mostly from invasive diseases. There has been a remarkable increase in the prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Kuwait over the past 20 years, and Kuwait has thus joined the league of hyperendemic countries for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). It is also conceivable that Kuwait, with a large expatriate population of workers, may serve as a focal point for further dissemination of resistant clones to the rest of the world. These data are unique because they are representative of the whole Kuwaiti population.",

Samples originated from cattle, turkey, chicken, and swine presented at federally inspected slaughter and processing plants. Large plasmids (33-291 kb) were present in 83% of the isolates resistant to five or more antimicrobials; however, 16% of the pan-susceptible isolates also had large plasmids. The presence of large plasmids did not correspond to the isolate source or the year the isolate was recovered but did appear to correspond to XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. Two sizes of large plasmids appeared most often: 145.4 kb and 97 kb. Class 1 integrons were not detected on plasmids but were detected on the chromosome of 8% (2/25) of the pan-susceptible isolates and 49% (17/35) of the isolates with multiple drug resistance. Expression of multiple drug resistance among S. Agona isolates occurred regardless of the presence of class 1 integrons, suggesting that plasmids play an equally important role in the development of resistant S. Agona. More research is needed to understand better the mechanisms by which S. Agona acquires, harbors, and transfers resistance determinants.",

Twenty-three fluoroquinolone-resistant, of which 16 were also ESBL-positive, enterobacterial and nonrelated isolates were studied. PCR with primers specific for qnrA and qnrS genes and primers specific for a series of ESBL genes were used. A qnrA gene was identified in two ESBL-positive isolates, whereas no qnrS-positive strain was found. The QnrA1 determinant was identified in an Enterobacter cloacae isolate and in a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate, both of which expressed the same ESBL SHV- 12. Whereas no plasmid was identified in the E. cloacae isolate, K. pneumoniae K149 possessed two conjugative plasmids, one that harbored the qnrA and bla (SHV)-12 genes whereas the other expressed the carbapenemase gene bla (IMP-4). The qnrA gene, was located in both cases downstream of the orf513 recombinase gene and upstream of the qnrA1 gene, a structure identical to that found in sul1-type integron In36 and qnrA-positive strains from Shanghai, China. However, the gene cassettes of the sul1-type integrons were different. This study identified the first plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant in Enterobacteriaceae in Australia.",

Erythromycin resistance was higher in tonsillitis/pharyngitis (27.4%) and skin infection isolates (21.1%), than in carriage and invasive isolates (<or=10%). Differences in erythromycin resistance among children and adults were noticed only for carriage isolates (9.3% in children and 21.1% in adults). Most erythromycin-resistant isolates from carriage (82.4%) and tonsillitis/pharyngitis (71.9%) showed the M phenotype. All M phenotype isolates (n=53) carried mef(A), whereas all MLS(B) phenotype isolates (n=19) carried erm(B) and not erm(A). Resistance to tetracycline [mediated by tet(M) in most isolates] was <or=6% in tonsillitis/pharyngitis and carriage isolates, 36.8% in skin infection isolates, and 44.1% in invasive isolates. The M phenotype increased since 2000, linked to a decrease of tetracycline resistance, and was predominantly associated with T1 in 2000-2001 and T12 in 2002 among carriage isolates, and with T8/25/Imp19 through 2000-2002 among tonsillitis/pharyngitis isolates. The majority (53%) of the tetracycline-resistant invasive isolates were nontypable. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin and chloramphenicol. This study showed that tetracycline and macrolide resistance frequency and phenotypes differ among GAS from various origins and changed over time. Moreover, T typing suggested that most drug-resistant isolates causing oropharyngeal carriage are distinct from the majority of isolates causing noninvasive and invasive infection.",

Drug use data were expressed in number of defined daily doses/100 bed-days; antimicrobial resistance were given as percentages of resistant isolates. Thirty-five and 48 different antibiotic drugs were used in Vilnius and Huddinge, respectively. The overall consumption of antibiotics was 15 DDD/100 bed-days in Vilnius and 43 DDD/100 bed-days in Huddinge. Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and aminoglycosides were the major antibiotics in Vilnius; beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins, cefalosporins, and quinolones in Huddinge. In Vilnius, gentamicin made up one-quarter of the use. Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative isolates from wounds and blood were more resistant to gentamicin in Vilnius. S. aureus was more often methicillin resistant in Vilnius than in Huddinge. There was no S. aureus-resistant to vancomycin in either hospital. The vancomycin-resistant enterococci made up from 4% to 10% in Vilnius hospital, but they were not detected in Huddinge hospital (0%). The majority of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were sensitive to benzylpenicillin in both hospitals. The higher resistance of microorganisms to some antibiotics in Vilnius may be explained by heavy use of few antibiotics. Lower level of hygiene procedures, sampling bias, and other methodological issues may also have contributed. Guidelines for antibiotic use and hygienic procedures are now under development in Vilnius.",

This study was undertaken to investigate the molecular epidemiology of non-penicillin-susceptible pneumococci isolated in Ankara, Turkey. Among a population of 246 pneumococci, 90 pneumococci with penicillin MIC > or = 0.1 microg/ml were serotyped, genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and sequence typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The overall resistance to penicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin were 36.6%, 4%, 27.6%, 10.9%, 5.3%, 22.4%, 4.5%, 2%, and 0, respectively. The most frequent serotypes were 14, 23B, 9V, 19F, 19A, and 23F. PFGE types represented 17 genetic clusters. PFGE and MLST data revealed that there were isolates identical or closely related to the Spain(9V)-3 ST 156 clone, Portugal(19F)- 21 ST 177 clone, and Spain(23F)-1 ST81 clone. Eleven serotype 14 isolates with emerging resistance to penicillin belonged to the ST 230 complex, a predominantly susceptible clone. Serotype 19A, 19F, and 7F variants of the ST 230 clone were also identified in the study population. Eight serotype 23B isolates with a new ST 1349 (18-13-8-6-3-6-8) created another clone with no relation to the currently defined international clones. Although the pandemic clones Spain(9V)-3, Portugal1(9F)-21, and Spain(23F)-1 are present in our region, the emergence of a new 23B clone with a unique ST and the emergence of resistance in the ST230 clone, has presumably contributed to the increase in the prevalence of drug-resistant pneumococci in Turkey.",

Sixty sows from three herds and three of their piglets were sampled at several time points. Antimicrobial usage data during parturition and farrowing were collected. Clinical resistance was determined for two isolates per sampling time point for sows and piglets using disk diffusion. Only 27.4% of E. coli isolates from newborn piglets showed no resistance. Resistance to one or two antimicrobial classes equaled 41.2% and 46.8% in isolates from sows and piglets, respectively, for the overall farrowing period. Multiresistance to at least four classes was found as frequently in sows (15.6%) as in piglets (15.2%). Antimicrobial resistance in piglets was influenced by antimicrobial use in sows and piglets and by the sow resistance level (p\u22640.05). Using aminopenicillins and third-generation cephalosporins in piglets affected resistance levels in piglets (odds ratios [OR] >1; p\u22640.05). Using enrofloxacin in piglets increased the odds for enrofloxacin resistance in piglets (OR=26.78; p\u22640.0001) and sows at weaning (OR=4.04; p\u22640.05). For sows, antimicrobial exposure to lincomycin-spectinomycin around parturition increased the resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, trimethoprim-sulfadiazine in sows (OR=21.33, OR=142.74, OR=18.03; p\u22640.05) and additionally to enrofloxacin in piglets (OR=7.50; p\u22640.05). This study demonstrates that antimicrobial use in sows and piglets is a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance in the respective animals. Moreover, resistance determinants in E. coli from piglets are selected by using antimicrobials in their dam around parturition.",

        "abstract": "The emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria reflects both, a gradual, completely Darwinian evolution, which mostly yields slight decreases in antibiotic susceptibility, along with phenotypes that are not precisely characterized as \"resistance\"; and sudden changes, from full susceptibility to full resistance, which are driven by a vast array of horizontal gene transfer mechanisms. Antibiotics select for more than just antibiotic resistance (i.e., increased virulence and enhanced gene exchange abilities); and many non-antibiotic agents or conditions select for or maintain antibiotic resistance traits as a result of a complex network of underlying and often overlapping mechanisms. Thus, the development of new antibiotics and thoughtful, integrated anti-infective strategies is needed to address the immediate and long-term threat of antibiotic resistance. Since the biology of resistance is complex, these new drugs and strategies will not come from free-market forces, or from \"incentives\" for pharmaceutical companies.",

        "abstract": "Foodborne bacteria are often associated with human infections; these infections can become more complicated to treat if the bacteria are also resistant to antimicrobials. In this study, prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and genetic relatedness of Escherichia coli among food producing animals from Lagos, Nigeria, was investigated. From December 2012 to June 2013, E. coli were isolated from fecal samples of healthy cattle, chicken, and swine. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing against 22 antimicrobials was performed using broth microdilution with the Sensititre\u2122 system. Clonal types were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). From the analysis, 211/238 (88.7%), 170/210 (81%), and 136/152 (89.5%) samples from cattle, chicken, and swine, respectively, were positive for E. coli. A subset of those isolates (n=211) selected based on \u03b2-lactamase production was chosen for further study. Overall, E. coli exhibited the highest resistance to tetracycline (124/211; 58.8%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (84/211; 39.8%), and ampicillin (72/211; 34.1%). Approximately 40% of the isolates were pan-susceptible, and none of the isolates were resistant to amikacin, cefepime, ceftazidime, ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Among the resistant isolates, 28 different resistance patterns were observed; 26 of those were characterized as multi-drug resistant (MDR; resistance to \u22652 antimicrobials). One isolate was resistant to 13 different antimicrobials representing five different antimicrobial classes. Using PFGE, MDR E. coli were genetically diverse and overall did not group based on source; identical PFGE patterns were detected among isolates from different sources. These results suggest that isolates cannot be attributed to specific sources, and some may be present across all of the sources. Results from this study indicate that food-producing animals in Nigeria are a reservoir of MDR E. coli that may be transferred to humans via the food chain.",

The obtained isolates were further examined for genetic polymorphism and genetic background of resistance. A total of 59 isolates of S. pseudintermedius originating from 96 samples of 91 dogs in five different regions in Norway were included in this study. Susceptibility testing was performed using a broth dilution method. Resistant isolates were subjected to polymerase chain reaction for detection of resistance genes. All isolates were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to examine the genetic polymorphism. In total, 19% of the isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents included. Resistance to penicillin was most prevalent (70%), followed by resistance to fusidic acid (49%) and oxytetracycline (42%). Resistance to quinolones or cephalosporins was not observed. Resistance to penicillin, tetracycline, and erythromycin was mediated by the blaZ beta-lactamase gene, the tetM gene, and the ermB gene, respectively. One of the fusidic acid-resistant isolates harbored a fusC gene, whereas the mechanisms involved in resistance in the other fusidic acid-resistant isolates remained unknown. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed a high genetic polymorphism of S. pseudintermedius. This study indicates that the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance is common among S. pseudintermedius from dogs unexposed to antimicrobial treatment before sampling, and that there is a high genetic polymorphism among S. pseudintermedius.",

In 32 broiler farms, cloacal samples were taken during two production rounds, with one production round in between. For 10 of the sampled flocks, samples from the carcasses at the slaughterhouse were also collected. For E. coli, high levels of resistance were found for ampicillin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, tetracycline, and the combination of trimethoprim and sulfonamide. Over 58% of all the isolates showed resistance to four or more antimicrobial agents. Only 4.8% were fully susceptible for all 14 drugs tested. A remarkably high resistance rate (up to 41%) to ceftiofur was found. The enterococci were frequently resistant to macrolides, tetracycline, and the combination quinopristin/dalfopristin. Over 80% displayed acquired resistance to four or more antimicrobial agents, and 3.9% were fully susceptible for the eight agents tested. Resistance was found to persist over consecutive production rounds. There was a good correlation between results obtained with cloacal samples of the live animals and caecal content samples collected in the slaughterhouse for both E. coli and E. faecium. For E. coli but not for E. faecium, the resistance profile of neck skin isolates was different from that of cloacal isolates.",

The frequent use and misuse of disinfectants based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in food-processing industries have imposed a selective pressure and may contribute to the emergence of disinfectant-resistant microorganisms. A total number of 1,325 Gram-negative isolates (Escherichia coli, other coliforms Vibrio spp., and Aeromonas spp.) and 500 Enterococcus spp. from food and food-processing industries and fish farming were screened for natural resistance to the QAC-based disinfectant benzalkonium chloride (BC). Of the 1,825 isolates, 16 strains, mainly from meat retail shops, showed low-level resistance to BC. None of the Enterococcus spp. from broiler, cattle, and pigs, the antibiotic-resistant E. coli from pig intestine and fish pathogens Vibrio spp. and Aeromonas spp. from the Norwegian fish farming industry were resistant to BC. The BC-resistant strains were examined for susceptibility to 15 different antibiotics, disinfectants, and dyes. No systematic cross-resistance between BC and any of the other antimicrobial agents tested was detected. Stable enhanced resistance in Enterobacter cloacae isolates was demonstrated by step-wise adaptation in increasing concentrations of BC. In conclusion, BC resistance among food-associated Gram-negative bacteria and Enterococcus spp. is not frequent, but resistance may develop to user concentrations after exposure to sublethal concentrations of BC.",

        "abstract": "Triclosan is a widely used biocide that is considered as an effective antimicrobial agent against different microorganisms. It is included in many contemporary consumer and personal health-care products, like oral and dermal products, but also in household items, including plastics and textiles. At bactericidal concentrations, triclosan appears to act upon multiple nonspecific targets, causing disruption of bacterial cell wall functions, while at sublethal concentrations, triclosan affects specific targets. During the 1990s, bacterial isolates with reduced susceptibility to triclosan were produced in laboratory experiments by repeated exposure to sublethal concentrations of the agent. Since 2000, a number of studies have verified the occurrence of triclosan resistance amongst dermal, intestinal, and environmental microorganisms, including some of clinical relevance. Of major concern is the possibility that triclosan resistance may contribute to reduced susceptibility to clinically important antimicrobials, due to either cross-resistance or co-resistance mechanisms. Although the number of studies elucidating the association between triclosan resistance and resistance to other antimicrobials in clinical isolates has been limited, recent laboratory studies have confirmed the potential for such a link in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Thus, widespread use of triclosan may represent a potential public health risk in regard to development of concomitant resistance to clinically important antimicrobials.",

All mef(A) strains showed a typical M phenotype (resistance to 14- and 15-membered macrolides, and sensitivity to lincosamides and streptogramin B), whereas erm(B) strains had the MLSB phenotype (resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B antibiotics). erm(TR) was found in 10 strains, always together with other resistance genes. In seven cases erm(TR) was associated with erm(B), and three cases with mef(A). In two isolates with the M phenotype (1.9%), it was not possible to detect the presence of any of the three macrolide resistance genes tested. Inducible resistance to macrolides was shown for 24 out of the 53 MLSB strains.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two rural counties in eastern China: Deqing with over 10 years' DOTS implementation and Guanyun under its second year of DOTS. The subjects were all culture-positive pulmonary TB patients newly diagnosed or re-treated during 12 months of 2004-2005. The proportion method was used for drug susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Among the 399 subjects, 283 were new TB cases and 116 were previously treated. The rates of overall resistance (i.e., resistance to at least one drug) in new cases were 50.4% (67) and 63.4% (95), respectively, in Deqing and Guanyun (p = 0.028), and 67.3% (33) and 83.6% (56), respectively, in previously treated cases (p = 0.0410). The rates of MDR-TB in new cases were 3.8% (5) in Deqing and 14.7% (22) in Guanyun (p = 0.0018), and 16.3% (8) and 34.3% (23) in previously treated cases (p = 0.0305). CONCLUSIONS: Newly diagnosed and previously treated TB patients from the short-term DOTS-covered county were at higher risk for overall drug-resistance TB and MDR-TB.

Our results were analyzed taking into consideration the current practices of Austrian veterinarians with regard to their use of antibiotic drugs during pig, poultry, and beef production. Resistant isolates were found most often in pork (76%) followed by poultry (63%) and beef (40%). On wild deer carcasses purchased from Austrian hunters only one isolate was found to be resistant. The latter indicates that antimicrobial resistance is not yet an environmental problem in animals living in the wild. The common use of tetracyclines in veterinary medication in various animal species is clearly reflected in the incidence of antimicrobial resistant isolates in commensal E. coli. The intensive use of fluoroquinolones in poultry could explain the high numbers of nalidixic acid resistant isolates found on poultry meat.

Data on 190 patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia were analyzed retrospectively. Antimicrobial resistance to antipseudomonal antibiotics was evaluated. The main outcome measure was 30-day mortality. In P. aeruginosa bacteremia, resistance rates to piperacillin (PIP), ceftazidime (CAZ), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and imipenem (IPM) were 29 (56/190), 19 (36/190), 17 (32/190) and 15% (28/190), respectively. Prior uses of fluoroquinolones or carbapenems were independent risk factors for resistance to CIP and IPM, and prior use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins was a risk factor for PIP-R. An indwelling urinary catheter was a risk factor for PIP-R, CAZ-R, and CIP-R. An invasive procedure was a risk factor for CIP-R and IPM-R. The 30-day mortality rate was 44% (33/75) in patients infected by strains resistant to any of the antipseudomonal antibiotics, but 33.9% (39/115) in those by strains susceptible to all antipseudomonal antibiotics (p = 0.161).

In this study regarding P. aeruginosa bacteremia, prior uses of fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, or extended-spectrum cephalosporins, a prior invasive procedure, and an indwelling urinary catheter were found to be associated with antimicrobial resistance.

        "abstract": "Background: Clarithromycin is the most commonly suggested antibiotic in Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens. Increasing antibiotic resistance rate to clarithromycin is the main reason for therapeutic failure. The resistance is associated with mutations in the 23S rRNA gene.; Aim: The purpose of this study was to determine the clarithromycin resistance rate of isolated H. pylori strains from referral patients in Kashan, Iran.; Methods: In total 95 H. pylori strains isolated from gastric mucosa of 246 patients with different clinical signs underwent gastroscopy in Kashan, Iran in 2013. The Epsilometer test was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of clarithromycin (CLR) in isolated H. pylori strains. Occurrence of mutation in 23S rRNA gene of clarithromycin-resistant strains was investigated with polymerase chain reaction-sequencing method.; Results: Antibiotic susceptibility pattern showed that 32 strains (33.7%) were resistant to clarithromycin (MICs \u22651 \u03bcg/ml), 33.7% were intermediate resistant, while 31 of H. pylori strains (32.6%) were susceptible. The 23S rRNA gene mutations at positions A2143G and A2142G were detected in H. pylori clarithromycin-resistant strains.; Conclusion: The resistance rate to clarithromycin in Iran is high. H. pylori clarithromycin-resistant strains were not associated with sex, age, and disease. The A2143G mutation in clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori strains was the predominant finding.;",

All Pn isolates were tested for anti-biotyping and drug-resistant pneumococci (DRPn) were further tested by serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Overall carriage of Pn was very high (71.2%) and 39.9% of the isolates were resistant to antimicrobials (22.5% with decreased susceptibility to penicillin and 17.4% susceptible to penicillin and resistant to other antimicrobials). Serotypes 6B, 14, 23 F, 19F, and 19 A were prevalent among the 1,287 DRPn and 5.8% of the isolates were non-typeable. Eighty PFGE patterns were identified among 1,285 DRPn, and 93.1% of the DRPn belonged to 26 major clonal types that comprised: Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network (PMEN) clones (76.3%), Portuguese (PT)-DCC clones, previously detected in 1996-1999 (14.3%), and EURIS PT-DCC new clones, identified for the first time in the EURIS study, during 2001-2003 (9.4%). Comparing with previous Portuguese surveillance studies carried out since 1996, we observed that carriage increased from 47% to 71%, but no major changes were detected on the prevalence of pneumococcal serotypes. Moreover, although PMEN clones were predominant in all DCCs, in the present study the majority of them were gradually decreasing in time whereas several PT-DCC and new clones seemed to be increasing.",

        "abstract": "It is assumed that bacteria always pay a significant physiological price for the acquisition of resistance to antibiotics. To test whether this was the case for a strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae that develops resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, we selected resistance to these agents in a wild-type strain and measured their fitness in comparative growth experiments. The relative growth rate of a mutant strain selected on ciprofloxacin (parC Serine 79 to Tyrosine) was compared with its susceptible isogenic parent and no significant deficit was found (relative fitness 1.15 95% C.I. +/- 0.2.). A double mutant, however, had a relative fitness of 0.81 (parC Serine 79 to Tyrosine gyrA Serine 81 to Tyrosine). Mutant strains selected on gemifloxacin had only a modest increase in minimum inhibitory concentration; thus, second-round mutants were competed with a first-round gyrA Serine 81 to Tyrosine or the susceptible isogenic parent. The growth rate of three double-mutant strains parC Serine 79 to Tyrosine gyrA Serine 81 to Phenylanine, parC Serine 79 to Tyrosine, and Asparagine 83 to Phenylalanine were similar to the isogenic susceptible parent 1.16 (95% C.I. +/- 0.17), 0.99 (95% C.I. +/- 0.05), and 0.95 (95% C.I. +/- 0.05), respectively. These data suggest that mutation in the parC and gyrA genes may, on some occasions, not be associated with a physiological deficit.",

In all five resistant isolates, one point mutation (C --> A) in parC was found, resulting in an amino acid change from serine to tyrosine at position 80 (Escherichia coli numbering). For four of these isolates, this was the only mutation found.

A range of natural plasmids was used as targets for the translocation of resistance. Plasmids that acquired resistance from the DT104 chromosome were segregated by conjugation into Escherichia coli K12. Plasmids R751, R388, and RP4::Tn7 acquired several combinations of resistance determinant (including single cassettes) at frequencies comparable with transposition. RP4 and pOG660 did not acquire any determinants from DT104. Phenotypic and PCR-based analysis of all the transconjugants that were translocated-both cassettes and more complex combinations of determinants-was carried out to determinate the genetic content. Translocation to R751 and R388 was associated with the loss of the indigenous trimethoprim cassette to both plasmids and also acquisition of sulfonamide resistance by R751 and RP4::Tn7, which indicated movement of the 3' terminus of one or both of the DT104 integrons. Sequencing of the R751 transconjugants confirmed these findings and showed that the translocation of streptomycin and ampicillin cassettes was associated with the precise excision of dhfrIIc and orfD cassettes. Furthermore, the translocation of multiple determinants occurred by at least two mechanisms, one of which was likely to involve a circular intermediate analogous to a composite cassette. Instability was detected in some of the transconjugants. The implication of the findings for the dissemination of resistance among clinical isolates is discussed.",

Seven of the 29 streptomycin-resistant isolates harbored both the strA and strB genes. Twenty-one of isolates had the strA, strB, and aadA1 genes. The strA gene was disrupted by a functional trimethoprim gene, dfrA14 in 10 of the 21 isolates harboring the three streptomycin resistance genes. Physical linkage of intact strA and sul2 genes was found in two different plasmids from four isolates. Linkage of cassette-borne aadA1 and dfrA1 genes in class 1 integrons was found in two of the isolates. Chloramphenicol resistance was due to the gene catA1 in all the chloramphenicol resistant isolates. The strB, strA, and catA1 genes were transferable by conjugation and this points to the significance of conjugative resistance plasmids in the spread and persistence of streptomycin and chloramphenicol resistance in food animals in Kenya.",

        "abstract": "Carbapenems are last-resort antibiotics to handle serious infections caused by multiresistant bacteria. The incidence of resistance to these antibiotics has been increasing and new resistance mechanisms have emerged. The dissemination of carbapenem resistance in the environment has been overlooked. The main goal of this research was to assess the prevalence and diversity of carbapenem-resistant bacteria in riverine ecosystems. The presence of frequently reported carbapenemase-encoding genes was inspected. The proportion of imipenem-resistant bacteria was on average 2.24\u2009CFU/ml. Imipenem-resistant strains (n=110) were identified as Pseudomonas spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aeromonas spp., Chromobacterium haemolyticum, Shewanella xiamenensis, and members of Enterobacteriaceae. Carbapenem-resistant bacteria were highly resistant to other beta-lactams such as quinolones, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Carbapenem resistance was mostly associated with intrinsically resistant bacteria. As intrinsic resistance mechanisms, we have identified the blaCphA gene in 77.3% of Aeromonas spp., blaL1 in all S. maltophilia, and blaOXA-48-like in all S. xiamenensis. As acquired resistance mechanisms, we have detected the blaVIM-2 gene in six Pseudomonas spp. (5.45%). Integrons with gene cassettes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides (aacA and aacC genes), trimethoprim (dfrB1b), and carbapenems (blaVIM-2) were found in Pseudomonas spp. Results suggest that carbapenem resistance dissemination in riverine ecosystems is still at an early stage. Nevertheless, monitoring these aquatic compartments for the presence of resistance genes and its host organisms is essential to outline strategies to minimize resistance dissemination.",

Eleven feline and three canine enterococcal isolates contained the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia gene encoding high-level resistance to gentamicin, an antibiotic often used for treating enterococcal infections in humans. The combination of erm(B) and vat(E) genes encoding resistance to streptogramins was detected in one canine quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolate. Four quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant enterococci only contained the erm(B) gene. Cross resistance against macrolides and lincosamides (30%) and resistance against tetracyclines (55%) was found to be widely distributed among enterococci from pets. In all of the feline and in 93% of the canine macrolide and lincosamide-resistant isolates, this resistance was encoded by the erm(B) gene. tet(M) was the most prevalent tetracycline resistance gene. It was detected in 91% of the feline and 86% of the canine tetracycline- resistant enterococci. A high occurrence of the Tn916/Tn1545 transposon family was found among these tet(M)-positive isolates. Enterococci from pet animals with resistance against vancomycin were not found. This study shows that enterococci from the intestinal microbiota of cats and dogs may act as a reservoir of resistance genes for animal or human pathogens.",

        "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer between commensal and pathogenic Neisseriae is the mechanism proposed to explain how pathogenic species acquire altered portions of the penA gene, which encodes penicillin binding protein 2. These changes resulted in a moderately penicillin-resistant phenotype in the meningococci, whose frequency of isolation in Spain increased at the end of the 1980s. Little has been published about the possibility of this gene transfer in nature or about its simulation in the laboratory. We designed a simple microcosm, formed by solid and liquid media, that partially mimics the upper human respiratory tract. In this microcosm, penicillin-resistant commensal strains and the fully susceptible meningococcus were co-cultivated. The efficiency of gene transfer between the strains depended on the phase of bacterial growth and the conditions of culture. Resistance of penicillin was acquired in different steps irrespective of the source of the DNA. The presence of DNase in the medium had no effect on gene transfer, but it was near zero when nicked DNA was used. Cell-to-cell contact or membrane blebs could explain these results. The analysis of sequences of the transpeptidase domain of PBP2 from transformants, and from donor and recipient strains demonstrated that the emergence of moderately resistant transformants was due to genetic exchange between the co-cultivated strains. Finally, mechanisms other than penA modification could be invoked to explain decreased susceptibility.",

Portugal also presents high levels of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (1.5%, primary rate and 2.4%, in retreatment cases). In the present study we have characterized 58 MDR-TB clinical isolates by: (i) determining the resistance profile to first- and second-line drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis; (ii) genotyping all isolates by MIRU-VNTR; (iii) analyzing mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and ethambutol, in katG, mabA-inhA, rpoB, rpsL, rrs, and pncA genes. We have therefore established the prevalence of the most common mutations associated with drug resistance in the Lisbon Health Region: C-15T in mabA-inhA for isoniazid; S531L in rpoB for rifampicin; K43R in rpsL for streptomycin; and V125G in pncA for pyrazinamide. By genotyping all isolates and combining with the mutational results, we were able to assess the isolates' genetic relatedness and determine possible transmission events. Strains belonging to family Lisboa, characterized several years ago, are still responsible for the majority of the MDR-TB. Even more alarming is the high prevalence of extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) among the MDR-TB isolates, which was found to be 53%. The TB status in Portugal therefore requires urgent attention to contain the strains continuously responsible for MDR-TB and now, XDR-TB.",

        "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae strains with very high levels of penicillin resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] >or=8 microg/ml) emerged in the 1990 s. Previous studies have traced the changes in penicillin binding proteins (PBP) that result in decreased penicillin susceptibility, and the role of several PBP genes in high-level resistance. In the present study, we investigated the changes that occurred at the two highest levels of penicillin resistance using NimbleGen's Comparative Genome Sequencing (CGS) technology. DNA from a highly resistant (Pen MIC 16 microg/ml) pneumococcus was used to serially transform the R6 strain to high-level resistance. Four distinct levels of penicillin resistance above the susceptible R6 strain (MIC 0.016 microg/ml) were identified. Using CGS technology, the entire genome sequences of the two highest levels of resistant transformants were examined for changes associated with the resistance phenotypes. At the third level of resistance, changes in PBPs 1a, 2b, and 2x were found, very similar to previous reports. At the fourth resistance level, two additional changes were observed in the R6 transformants. More changes were observed in PBP2x, as well as in peptidoglycan GlcNAc deacetylase (pdgA), which had a missense mutation in the coding region. Genetic transformation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products generated from the high-level resistant parent containing either the additional PBP2x or mutant pdgA gene did not increase the MIC of the third-level transformant. Only when both PCR products were simultaneously transformed into the third-level transformant did colonies emerge that were at the highest level of resistance (16-32 microg/ml), equivalent to the highly resistant parent strain. This is the first instance of the involvement of a variant pdgA gene in penicillin resistance. It is also clear from these experiments and the literature that there are multiple paths to the pneumococcus achieving high-level penicillin resistance.",

The strains originated from dogs of 92 different owners and from eight breeding kennels. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the resistance situation in the intestinal flora of the dog to assess the possible role of the dog flora as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance. Multiple resistance was rarely found in E. coli strains collected from individually owned dogs, in contrast with strains from kennel dogs. Resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole was significantly less prevalent in E. coli from privately owned dogs than in strains from kennel dogs. Resistance rates against tetracycline and macrolides were unexpectedly high in E. faecalis strains. Two and three E. faecalis strains from individually owned dogs and kennel dogs, respectively, were resistant to gentamicin, an antibiotic often used for treating enterococcal infections in humans. This study demonstrates that resistance percentages may fluctuate with the choice of dog population. The observed antimicrobial resistance percentages indicate that the flora of healthy dogs may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.",

        "abstract": "A total of 254 isolates of Campylobacter jejuni and three isolates of Campylobacter coli, isolated from Sweden, Canada, and Egypt, were screened for kanamycin resistance. Eight strains of C. jejuni contained large plasmids that carried the aphA-3 kanamycin-resistance marker. In six plasmids, the aphA-3 gene was located downstream of an apparent insertion sequence, designated IS607*, which showed a considerable similarity to IS607, characterized on the chromosome of some Helicobacter pylori strains. In contrast, the other plasmids carried the aphA-3 gene as a part of a resistance cluster. This included three resistance markers encoding 6'-adenylyltransferase (aadE), streptothricin acetyltransferase (sat), and 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type III (aphA-3). The genetic organization of this resistance cluster suggests that it has been acquired by C. jejuni from a Gram-positive organism. The IS607* element was also observed in kanamycin-susceptible strains of C. jejuni on plasmids mediating tetracycline resistance. The kanamycin-resistance phenotype transferred along with tetracycline resistance by conjugation from four representative C. jejuni strains to a recipient strain of C. jejuni. The kanamycin-resistance determinant (aphA-3) was stably transferred from one of the four C. jejuni strains to a recipient strain of Escherichia coli. However, the C. jejuni plasmid, which also carries the tetO gene, was not maintained in E. coli. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the integration of approximately 50 kb of the plasmid into the chromosome of the E. coli recipient.",

Fifty fecal samples were analyzed, and one colony per sample was recovered and identified by biochemical and molecular tests. Forty-one E. coli isolates were obtained (82%). MIC testing was performed by agar dilution with 18 antibiotics, and the mechanisms of resistance were analyzed. Ampicillin resistance was detected in 24 isolates (58.5%), and blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaOXA type genes were studied by PCR and sequencing. The following beta-lactamases were detected (number of isolates): TEM (20), SHV-1 (1), and OXA-30 (1). The number of aminoglycoside-resistant isolates detected was as follows: streptomycin (15), tobramycin (1), gentamicin (1), and kanamycin (4). The aac(3)-IV gene was detected in the only gentamicin-resistant isolate. Nine (22%) and 2 (5%) isolates showed nalidixic acid (NALR) and ciprofloxacin resistance (CIPR), respectively. Mutations in GyrA and ParC proteins were shown in both NAL(R)-CIP(R) isolates and were the following: (1) GyrA (S83L + D87N), ParC (S801); and (2) GyrA (S83L + A84P), ParC (S80I + A108V). A single mutation in the S83 codon of the gyrA gene was found in the remaining seven NAL(R)-CIP(S) isolates. Tetracycline resistance was identified in 21 isolates (51%) and the following resistance genes were found (number of isolates): tetA (12), tetB (5), and tetD (1). Chloramphenicol resistance was detected in five isolates (12%). These results show that the intestinal tract of healthy children constitutes a reservoir of resistant bacteria and resistance genes.",

The highest percentage of resistance was found to oxytetracycline (34.2%), streptomycin (32.5%), sulfamethizole (27.6%), and ampicillin (24.9%). Three of the isolates showed resistance to cephalosporins and none to second-generation fluoroquinolones. Multiresistance (resistance to > or =2 antimicrobials) was observed in 33.2% of the strains. Differences in resistance patterns were observed between and within serotypes as well as genotypes. A significant lower proportion (p < 0.01) of resistant strains was recovered in fecal samples from sows (23/56) than from fattening pigs during the weaning (30/30), growing (79/85), and finishing periods (45/52). The proportion of resistant strains recovered from fecal samples taken at the herd (154/167) was higher than in the samples collected at the slaughterhouse (75/140). When designing antimicrobial resistance surveillance programs for Salmonella in pigs, it is important to take multiple samples within each herd from both sows and fattening pigs at different time points.",

Fecal E. coli isolates from 250 pigs (one isolate each from a pig per farm) were examined for antimicrobial resistance. Information on the use of antimicrobials within preceding 6 months and types of farms recorded in JVARM was collected and statistically analyzed against the resistance patterns. In the univariate analysis, associations between both therapeutic and feed additive use of antimicrobials, and resistance to dihydrostreptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, ampicillin, cefazolin, ceftiofur, oxytetracycline, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, colistin, and bicozamycin, and husbandry factors were investigated. In multivariable analysis, generalized estimating equations were used to control geographical intraclass correlation. Confounding for structurally unrelated associations was tested using generalized linear models. The results suggested direct and cross selections in the associations between use of aminoglycosides in reproduction farms and resistance to kanamycin, use of tetracyclines in larger farms and resistance to oxytetracycline, use of beta-lactams and resistance to ampicillin, use of phenicols and resistance to chloramphenicol, and use of fluoroquinolones and resistance to nalidixic acid and enrofloxacin. Coselection was suggested in the use of tetracyclines and chloramphenicol resistance. The associations between use of beta-lactams and dihydrostreptomycin resistance, use of macrolides and ampicillin and oxytetracycline resistance, and use of colistin and kanamycin resistance were significant, but were confounded by the simultaneous use of homologous antimicrobials.",

METHODS: Eighteen strains of Uu clinical isolates with different phenotypes of resistance to Macrolide antibiotics were screened for mutations in 23S rRNA in comparison with the reference strain ATCC 27618 and AF272627-1 in GenBank, which is susceptible to Macrolide antibiotics. RESULTS: Compared to the sequence of reference strains ATCC 27618 and AF272627-1, three transitions were found in 23S rRNA of Uu clinical isolates with acquired resistance to Macrolide antibiotics. The C2243N (T or C) transition was found in the 23S rRNA sequence of five strains with the phenotype of acquired resistance to Roxithromycin (ROM) and Azithromycin (AZM). The two changes of A2149C and A2181T were found in the 23S rRNA sequence of nine strains with the phenotype of resistance to ROM and midrange resistance to AZM, and they were also found in that of four strains with the phenotype of sensitivity to macrolides (Josamycin, Clarithromycin, ROM, and AZM). No mutation was found in the ATCC 27618. CONCLUSION: The mechanisms of Uu resistance to ROM and AZM may be associated with the C2243N (T or C) mutation in 23S rRNA. Further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.",

Resistance patterns were determined to extended-spectrum penicillin (ampicillin), broad-spectrum cephalosporins (cefotaxime and ceftriaxone), aminoglycosides (streptomycin, neomycin, gentamicin, amikacin, and tobramycin), narrow-spectrum quinolone (nalidixic acid), broad-spectrum quinolone (ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin), tetracycline, trimethoprim, and chloramphenicol. Antimicrobial resistance patterns varied among serotypes, but isolates from a single serotype consistently showed the same resistance profile. All isolates were resistant to tetracycline, streptomycin, and nalidixic acid. One isolate, Salmonella Rissen, was also resistant to cefotaxime and tobramycin. All serotypes were susceptible to ceftriaxone, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol. The high resistance to tetracycline and streptomycin may be linked to their common use as therapeutic drugs on the tested farms.

        "abstract": "Ampicillin and vancomycin are important antibiotics for the therapy of Enterococcus faecalis infections. The ampicillin resistance gene pbp5 is intrinsic in Enterococcus faecium. The vanC1 gene confers resistance to vancomycin and serves as a species marker for Enterococcus gallinarum. Both genes are chromosomally located. Resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin was determined in 484 E. faecalis of human and porcine origin by microdilution. Since E. faecalis are highly skilled to acquire resistance genes, all strains were investigated for the presence of pbp5 (and, in positive strains, for the penicillin-binding protein synthesis repressor gene psr) and vanC1 (and, in positive strains, for vanXYc and vanT) by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One porcine and one human isolate were phenotypically resistant to ampicillin; no strain was vancomycin resistant. Four E. faecalis (3/1 of porcine/human origin) carried pbp5 (MIC=1 mg/L), and four porcine strains were vanC1 positive (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]=1 mg/L). Real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR revealed that the genes were not expressed. The psr gene was absent in the four pbp5-positive strains; the vanXYc gene was absent in the four vanC1-positive strains. However, vanT of the vanC gene cluster was detected in two vanC1-positive strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence of pbp5, identical with the \"E. faecium pbp5 gene,\" and of vanC1/vanT in E. faecalis. Even if resistance is not expressed in these strains, this study shows that E. faecalis have a strong ability to acquire resistance genes-and potentially to spread them to other bacteria. Therefore, close monitoring of this species should be continued.",

If the intestine of houseflies is a suitable site for the transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), houseflies could also serve as a biological vector for ARB. To clarify whether cephalosporin resistance genes are transferred efficiently in the housefly intestine, we compared with conjugation experiments in vivo (in the intestine) and in vitro by using Escherichia coli with eight combinations of four donor and two recipient strains harboring plasmid-mediated cephalosporin resistance genes and chromosomal-encoded rifampicin resistance genes, respectively. In the in vivo conjugation experiment, houseflies ingested donor strains for 6\u2009hr and then recipient strains for 3\u2009hr, and 24\u2009hr later, the houseflies were surface sterilized and analyzed. In vitro conjugation experiments were conducted using the broth-mating method. In 3/8 combinations, the in vitro transfer frequency (Transconjugants/Donor) was \u22651.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-4); the in vivo transfer rates of cephalosporin resistance genes ranged from 2.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-4) to 5.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-5). Moreover, cephalosporin resistance genes were transferred to other species of enteric bacteria of houseflies such as Achromobacter sp. and Pseudomonas fluorescens. These results suggest that houseflies are not only a mechanical vector for ARB but also a biological vector for the occurrence of new ARB through the horizontal transfer of ARGs in their intestine.",

Two hundred sixty-three of the 1,739 isolates were subjected to SCCmec typing and 42 to MLST, spaA, and coa typing. ST239-MRSA-III was prevalently identified along with one distinct coa type HIJKL and 2 spaA types (WGKAOMQ-t037 and WGKAQQ-t030). Class 1 integrons were commonly detected (31.6%), although none of the integron-positive MRSA strains had been isolated since 2009.

        "abstract": "Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are widely used as disinfectant in medical and food environments. There is a growing concern about the increasing incidence of disinfectant-resistant microorganisms from food. Disinfectant-resistant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) may survive disinfection and cause spoilage problems. Moreover, resistant LAB may potentially act as a reservoir for resistance genes. A total number of 320 LAB from food industry and meat were screened for resistance to the QAC benzalkonium chloride (BC). Out of 320 strains, five strains (1.5%) were considered to be resistant and 56 (17.5%) were tolerant to BC. The resistant strains were isolated from food processing equipment after disinfection. The resistant, tolerant, and some sensitive control bacteria were examined for susceptibility to 18 different antibiotics, disinfectants, and dyes using disc agar diffusion test and microdilution method. Little systematic cross-resistance between BC and any of the antimicrobial agents tested were detected except for gentamycin and chlorhexidine. A BC-tolerant strain was much easier to adapt to higher levels of BC as compared to a BC-sensitive strain. No known gram-positive QAC resistance genes (qacA/B, qacC, qacG, and qacH) were detected in the BC-resistant strains. Identification to species level of the BC-resistant isolates was carried out by comparative analysis of 16S-rDNA sequencing. In conclusion, resistance to BC is not frequent in LAB isolated from food and food environments. Resistance may occur after exposure to BC. The BC resistant isolates showed no cross-resistance with other antimicrobial compounds, except for gentamycin and chlorhexidine. Nevertheless, BC-resistant LAB may be isolated after disinfection and may contribute to the dissemination of resistance.",

        "abstract": "Streptococcus suis (S. suis) has often been reported as an important swine pathogen and is considered as a new emerging zoonotic agent. Consequently, it is important to be informed on its susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. In the current study, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) population distribution of nine antimicrobial agents has been determined for nasal S. suis strains, isolated from healthy pigs at the end of the fattening period from 50 closed or semiclosed pig herds. The aim of the study was to report resistance based on both clinical breakpoints (clinical resistance percentage) and epidemiological cutoff values (non-wild-type percentage). Non-wild-type percentages were high for tetracycline (98%), lincomycin (92%), tilmicosin (72%), erythromycin (70%), tylosin (66%), and low for florfenicol (0%) and enrofloxacin (0.3%). Clinical resistance percentages were high for tetracycline (95%), erythromycin (66%), tylosin (66%), and low for florfenicol (0.3%) and enrofloxacin (0.3%). For tiamulin, for which no clinical breakpoint is available, 57% of the isolates did not belong to the wild-type population. Clinical resistance and non-wild-type percentages differed substantially for penicillin. Only 1% of the tested S. suis strains was considered as clinically resistant, whereas 47% of the strains showed acquired resistance when epidemiological cutoff values were used. In conclusion, MIC values for penicillin are gradually increasing, compared to previous reports, although pigs infected with strains showing higher MICs may still respond to treatment with penicillin. The high rate of acquired resistance against tiamulin has not been reported before. Results from this study clearly demonstrate that the use of different interpretive criteria contributes to the extent of differences in reported antimicrobial resistance results. The early detection of small changes in the MIC population distribution of isolates, while clinical failure may not yet be observed, provides the opportunity to implement appropriate risk management steps.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies of resistance gene ecology have focused primarily on populations such as hospital patients and farm animals that are regularly exposed to antibiotics. Also, these studies have tended to focus on numerically minor populations such as enterics or enterococci. We report here a cultivation-independent approach that allowed us to assess the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in the numerically predominant populations of the vaginal microbiota of two populations of primates that are seldom or never exposed to antibiotics: baboons and mangabeys. Most of these animals were part of a captive colony in Texas that is used for scientific studies of female physiology and physical anthropology topics. Samples from some wild baboons were also tested. Vaginal swab samples, obtained in connection with a study designed to define the normal microbiota of the female vaginal canal, were tested for the presence of two types of antibiotic resistance genes: tetracycline resistance (tet) genes and erythromycin resistance (erm) genes. These genes are frequently found in human isolates of the two types of bacteria that were a substantial part of the normal microbiota of primates (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes). Since cultivation was not feasible, polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were used to detect and characterize these resistance genes. The tet(M) and tet(W) genes were found most commonly, and the tet(Q) gene was found in over a third of the samples from baboons. The ermB and ermF genes were found only in a minority of the samples. The ermG gene was not found in any of the specimens tested. Polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that at least some tet(M) and tet(Q) genes were genetically linked to DNA from known conjugative transposons (CTns), Tn916 and CTnDOT. Our results raise questions about the extent to which extensive exposure to antibiotics is the only pressure necessary to maintain resistance genes in natural settings.",

A total of 1,395 GBS isolates were collected from June 2001 to April 2007. Forty-four percent of the GBS isolates were resistant to erythromycin, and 39% were resistant to clindamycin. The annual erythromycin resistance rate increased from 32% in 2001 to 51% in 2004; a significant decrease was observed in 2005 (47%), 2006 (42%), and 2007 (38%). Percentage of erythromycin-resistant isolates with erm(B) gene significantly increased from 72% in 2001 to 90% in 2007. We found that the plasmid encoded zeta gene was present in 13% of the resistant isolates, along with erm(B). When compared to our previous study (1991 to May 2001), the overall erythromycin resistance rate increased from 30% to 44%. erm(B) was the major resistant determinant, and zeta toxin encoding plasmid has a limited role in mediating erythromycin resistance unlike in GAS isolates as reported earlier.",

Mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance among IRT-producing strains were also studied. Isolates with susceptibility to cephalosporins and amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC) resistance were collected in our hospital (November 2011-July 2012) from both outpatients and hospitalized patients. Among 70 AMC-resistant E. coli strains, 28 (40%) produced IRT enzymes. Most of them were uropathogens (82.1%) and recovered from outpatients (75%). Seven different IRT enzymes were identified with TEM-30 (IRT-2) being the most prevalent, followed by TEM-40 (IRT-11). A high rate of ciprofloxacin resistance was found among IRT-producing strains (50%). Most of the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates showed ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration >32 mg/L and contained two mutations in both gyrA and parC genes. Four IRT enzyme producers harbored the qnr gene. ST131 clone was mainly responsible for both IRT enzyme production and ciprofloxacin resistance. In conclusion, data from this study show that the frequency of IRT producers was 40% and a high rate of ciprofloxacin resistance was found among IRT-producing isolates. Current and future actions should be taken into account to avoid or reduce the development of AMC and fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli.",

All the macrolide-resistant isolates expressed the constitutive macrolide, lincosamide, and streptograminB phenotype and harbored the erm(B) gene. Resistance to tetracycline was mainly due to the tet(M) gene, which is commonly associated with the conjugative transposon Tn916. No significant association was found between erm(B) and tet(M) genes. The tetracycline-resistant strains belonged to 28 distinct emm types. Among them, emm118 was the most prevalent type, followed by emm42, std432, emm76, and emm18.

In Korea, over 70% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates are methicillin-resistant and erythromycin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is also prevalent. We investigated the frequency of MLS resistance in erythromycin-resistant S. aureus isolates. A total of 682 isolates of S. aureus were collected in a nationwide antibiotic resistance survey. Susceptibility to erythromycin, clindamycin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin was tested by disk diffusion. In all, 37% of the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and 97% of the MRSA isolates were resistant to at least one of the MLS antibiotics, whereas all were susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Out of 518 strains that were resistant to erythromycin, 60 clindamycin-susceptible (30 MSSA, 30 MRSA) and 44 clindamycin-resistant isolates (14 MSSA, 30 MRSA) were selected at random from these strains. Thirteen genes related to MLS resistance were detected in these isolates by PCR. Of the 104 MSSA and MRSA strains tested, 98 harbored one or more erm gene. The most common was erm(A), with erm(C) next. But, msr(A), lnu(A), and mef(A) were rare and no resistance to streptogramin A was encountered.",

Isolates were tested against 11 antimicrobials. A total of 25 different profiles were observed, involving resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, and/or a trimethoprim/sulfonamide combination. No isolates were resistant to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, or chloramfenicol, whereas resistance against neomycin and nalidixic acid was sporadically detected in isolates from grower pigs. A model that clusters pigs within-sampling time as a repeated factor and clusters isolates within individual pigs as a random factor was used. For sows, the variance component ratio of sampling time to residuals was 0.28-0.56 for the different antimicrobials (except ampicillin) and 0.85-1.79 for grower pigs. The variance components for within-sample variation were zero or close to zero, except in isolates from sows where resistance to ampicillin explained 14.8 times more of the variation compared to residuals. Thus, the effect of an animal's status at a given sampling time was more influential on the variability in antimicrobial resistance than within-animal diversity. We conclude that repeated sampling and analysis of one isolate per animal each time may be preferable for screening general tendencies, whereas several isolates have to be tested when individual animals are focused.",

A total of 152 erythromycin-resistant isolates of this species from southern Italian regions were characterized for the macrolide-resistance phenotype and screened by PCR for the corresponding genetic determinant. A close correlation was found between these phenotypic/genotypic data concerning macrolide resistance and results of Sma I macrorestriction fragment patterns (PFGE) analysis. In fact, the vast majority of the isolates assigned to individual PFGE classes mostly belonged to a single phenotype of macrolide resistance. All untypeable isolates belonged to the M phenotype. Twenty-two distinct PFGE types were recognized, of which 11 were recorded in only one isolate (one-strain type); about 50% of typeable isolates fell into five type clusters and 70% in seven. The increased erythromycin resistance among Italian isolates of S. pyogenes does not appear to be due to the spread of a single clone, but results indicate that the majority of group A streptococci examined are probably spread from a limited number of clones.",

Nine H (flagellar) types were identified including nonmotile (n = 24), 32 (n = 12), negative (n = 5), and 56 (n = 3). Thirty-five (70%) isolates possessed at least one Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli (STEC)-associated virulence determinants (eae, stxl, stx2, hlyA) via PCR analysis. Of these 35 isolates, 20 possessed eae, stxl, and hlyA genes, whereas three isolates possessed eae, stxl, stx2, and hylA genes. Multiple antibiotic resistance was observed in 70% of the 50 E. coli O111 isolates. The majority of isolates displayed resistance to streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and kanamycin. Bacterial resistance to ampicillin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim and apramycin was also observed. Integrons were identified in 23 (46%) of the E. coli isolates assayed, with a 1-kb amplicon being most frequently observed. DNA sequencing of these integrons revealed the presence of the aadA gene, encoding resistance to streptomycin. Two integrons of 1.5 and 2 kb contained the aadA2 and either dfrI or dfrXII genes, encoding resistance to streptomycin and trimethoprim, respectively. Integrons were also identified from isolates dating back to 1982. Isolates were further genetically characterized via ribotyping, which identified 15 distinct ribogroups, with 62% of isolates clustering into four major ribogroups. Certain riboprint patterns from different animal species, including humans, were observed in isolates spanning the 24-year collection period, suggesting the dissemination of specialized pathogenic O111 clones.",

The subject of the study was to examine the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) antibiotic resistance in 99 lipophilic strains of Corynebacterium genus isolated from the skin of healthy men. Over 70% of the tested strains were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. All of which demonstrated a constitutive type of MLSB resistance mechanism. In all strains, there were being investigated the erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), erm(X), lin(A), msr(A), and mph(C) genes that could be responsible for the different types of resistance to marcolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B. In all strains with the MLSB resistance phenotype, the erm(X) gene was detected. None of the other tested genes were discovered. Strains harboring the erm(X) gene were identified using a phenotypic method based on numerous biological and biochemical tests. Identification of the chosen strains was compared with the results of API Coryne, MALDI-TOF MS, and 16S rDNA sequencing methods. Only 7 out of the 23 investigated resistant strains provided successful results in all the used methods, showing that identification of this group of bacteria is still a great challenge. The MLSB resistance mechanism was common in most frequently isolated from healthy human skin Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and Corynebacterium jeikeium strains. This represents a threat as these species are also commonly described as etiological factors of opportunistic infections.",

The possible occurrence of a similar mutation in Brachyspira pilosicoli was studied and the MICs of six antimicrobial agents for Swedish field isolates of B. pilosicoli were determined. Of 10 isolates with high MICs of macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics, six had a mutation in nucleotide position 2058 or 2059 in the 23S rRNA gene as compared to the wild type of Escherichia coli, whereas none of 10 tylosin-susceptible isolates were mutated in this region. The mutations found in position 2058 were A --> T transversions, and in position 2059 either A --> G transitions or A --> C transversions. The MICs at which 90% of the B. pilosicoli field isolates were inhibited by tylosin, erythromycin, clindamycin, virginiamycin, tiamulin, and carbadox, were >256, >256, >4, 4, 2, and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively. In conclusion, point mutations in positions 2058 and 2059 of the 23S rRNA gene can cause macrolide and lincosamide resistance in B. pilosicoli. Macrolide resistance is widespread among Swedish field isolates of B. pilosicoli. Notably also a few isolates with elevated MICs of tiamulin were found.",

These infections are often associated with foreign material implants and/or a compromised immune system in the patient. Multiresistant strains are increasingly common in the hospital environment and there is concern that the infections will become difficult or impossible to treat. This report is based on a study of 75 patients, with postoperative infections caused by CoNS after thoracic surgery. All patients were treated with surgical revision and antibiotic therapy. One or more bacterial cultures were made in each case, and the resistance pattern of the CoNS found was determined. The goal of the study was to evaluate possible relationships between antibiotic therapy and the appearance of resistance to antibiotics in CoNS found. To describe this relationship, three models were constructed and analyzed by multiple logistic regression. The results indicate an increased resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and clindamycin after the use of cephalosporins. Also, the use of vancomycin or vancomycin in combination with rifampicin or fusidic acid increases the risk for development of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, clindamycin, netilmycin, and rifampicin. The hypothesis that a combination of antibiotics will curtail the development of resistance was not supported in this study.",

The objective of this study was to analyze serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella spp. isolated from healthy chickens and pigs in Iceland during 2001-2005. A total of 163 Salmonella strains, isolated in the national Salmonella surveillance program, were available for study. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using a microbroth dilution method (VetMIC) and resistant strains were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and phage typing. The most commonly isolated serotypes were Salmonella Infantis (61%) and S. Typhimurium (33%); other serotypes were less prevalent. The overall prevalence of resistance was 13.6% in chickens and 12.8% in pigs. Twenty one isolates (12.8%) were resistant to one or more antimicrobials, 19 S. Typhimurium strains, one S. Infantis strain, and one S. Worthington strain. Sixteen out of the 19 resistant S. Typhimurium strains were multiresistant (to > or =3 antimicrobial agents), and, of these, 15 had identical or closely related PFGE patterns (previously phage typed as DT104). The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella spp. in pigs and poultry in Iceland is low; however, we found a multiresistant S. Typhimurium clone that causes concern. Continuous resistance surveillance is important, and further research on the source of resistant clones and possible transmission to humans is needed.",

        "abstract": "The aims of the present study were to investigate at the farm-owner level the effect of prescribed tetracycline consumption in pigs and different Salmonella Typhimurium phage types on the probability that the S. Typhimurium was resistant to tetracycline. In this study, 1,307 isolates were included, originating from 877 farm owners, and data were analyzed using logistic regression. The analysis showed that both the S. Typhimurium phage type (p < 0.0001) and an increase in tetracycline consumption (p = 0.0007) were significantly associated with tetracycline resistance. In particular, the phage type was strongly associated with tetracycline resistance. A further analysis of data from the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring and Research Programme (DANMAP) indicates that the tetracycline-susceptible phage types only slowly become tetracycline resistant, although tetracycline consumption more than doubled at the national level from 12,000-13,000 kg of active compound in 1996-1998 to 29,000 kg of active compound in 2004. Instead, tetracycline-resistant S. Typhimurium phage types became more prevalent. This suggests that the spread of already established or new resistant clones, rather than conversion of \"old\" well-established susceptible clones to resistant clones by uptake of resistance genes, explains most of the increased levels of tetracycline resistance in S. Typhimurium in Danish swine production in response to increased tetracycline consumption.",

We report the characterization of 32 optochin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains from 10 laboratories that constituted 3.2% of all isolates recovered in 2005 in 30 laboratories in Portugal. Resistant isolates consisted of bile-soluble optochin-susceptible and optochin-resistant subpopulations with identical antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, capsular types and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. The most frequent serotypes--1, 19A, 11A, 3, 8, and 15A--were all common serotypes present in infection and colonization isolates in the country. The PFGE profiles of the 32 isolates corresponded to those of previously identified clones and confirmed that the emergence of these strains could not be attributed to clonal expansion. Clinical laboratories must be aware that optochin-resistant pneumococci are presently circulating in the community. Because accurate identification of S. pneumoniae is essential for correct diagnosis and adequate therapy of patients, we recommend that at least the bile solubility test should be routinely performed in cases of suspected pneumococcal etiology, even if the isolates are optochin-resistant.",

The region containing most of the antibiotic resistance genes in R1033 and R934 was mapped using polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Both plasmids contained a copy of the class II transposon Tn1, but it was located at different sites between the position of Tn1 and the tet(A) determinant in RP1. Thus, Tn1 and the ampicillin resistance gene contained in it were acquired by the IncP1-\u03b1 backbone on three separate occasions. In R1033, Tn1696 is located nearby, between Tn1 and the tet(A) determinant, and an IS186 insertion sequence was also found in this region. In R934, a defective class II transposon carrying a partial mercuric ion resistance (mer) module was found within the Tn1. These findings show that R1033 is not derived directly from RP1/RP4, refining the evolutionary pathways previously predicted for the IncP-1\u03b1 plasmid family.",

S. aureus SK982 carrying the qacA gene encoding for resistance to QACs was grown in the presence of stable or gradually increasing concentrations of BAC, or it was exposed to this antiseptic in the exponential phase of growth. Bacteria cultivated in the highest BAC concentrations that did not retard their growth comparing to the untreated control were subjected to real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis for relative expression of the efflux genes qacA and norA. Under such conditions, S. aureus SK982 tolerated a relatively low stable concentration of BAC (1.22\u2009mg/L) when compared with a gradually increasing antiseptic concentration (tolerance of 4.88\u2009mg/L). However, in both cases, qacA expression was not significant. The culture exposed in the exponential phase of growth tolerated the highest concentration of BAC (9.76\u2009mg/L) as also accompanied by significant overexpression of qacA. Expression of norA was relatively low regardless of the conditions tested. It seems that under the short-term conditions, the phase of bacterial growth is more important for the expression of BAC resistance than the capability to adapt to this antiseptic. This study provides a deeper insight into the relevance of the qac genes in conferring resistance to QACs.",

Therefore, after slaughter, the lower intestinal tract of 19 calves was sampled at five locations (duodenum, jejunum, cecum, colon, and rectum), and up to three E. coli isolates per sample underwent susceptibility testing for seven antimicrobial agents (gentamicin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, tetracycline, trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and enrofloxacin), using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Multiresistance (resistance to more than two compounds) was present in 93.5% of all isolates (n = 179). For gentamicin, nalidixic acid, and enrofloxacin, the percentage of resistant E. coli isolates was significantly lower in the duodenum and jejunum than in the cecum, colon, and rectum. For ampicillin, the percentage of resistance was significantly lower in the jejunum, compared to the other segments of the intestinal tract. For the other antimicrobials tested, no significant differences in the percentage of resistant isolates throughout the intestinal tract were detected. In conclusion, resistance among enteric E. coli from veal calves can reach high levels and prevalence depends on localization of sampling. These considerations should be taken into account when further fine-tuning sampling protocols for indicator bacteria.",

        "abstract": "Five genotypes of acquired glycopeptide resistance have been documented in enterococci, with vanA and vanB being the most globally widespread and prevalent. Resistance results from the production of peptidoglycan precursors with reduced binding affinity for glycopeptides and is encoded by complex clusters of van genes. The prototype VanA element is Tn1546, a 10.8-kb transposon that carries the vanRSHAXYZ genes. Diverse VanA elements exist, but all share the vanRSHAX cluster and are believed to be derived from a Tn1546 progenitor. The sequences of these genes are remarkably conserved, with only a few point mutations identified. VanA elements do however vary by the presence of deletions and insertion sequences (IS) in nonessential genes (orf1, orf2, vanY, and vanZ) and intergenic regions. IS transposition probably plays a key role in VanA element evolution. By contrast, vanB gene clusters show greater sequence divergence. Three vanB alleles have been reported, of which vanB2 appears to be the most widespread, generally as part of Tn5382 and related elements. To date, only four Enterococcus faecium strains with VanD resistance have been reported, and each contained a distinct vanD allele. The VanE and VanG types have each been identified in single strains of Enterococcus faecalis. The existence of distinct genotypes, together with the allelic nature of vanB and vanD, suggests that van clusters have transferred to enterococci on multiple occasions from undefined donor species, with subsequent horizontal dissemination, particularly of VanA and VanB elements, among enterococci. Characterization of glycopeptide resistance elements yields information on their evolution and broadens our insights into the epidemiology of resistant enterococci.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), introduced in February 2000, covered 82% of the U.S. pediatric population in 2005. Changes over time in serogroup prevalence and multidrug-resistance (MR) to antimicrobials were evaluated using the U.S. SENTRY surveillance program. METHODS: The study included 704 U.S. isolates, with equal numbers before (1998-1999) and after the introduction of the vaccine (2003-2004). Demographic data, serotype, and resistance profiles for five antimicrobial classes were analyzed. Strains displaying resistance to >or=2 classes were considered MR. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Prevalence of PCV7 serotypes was 68.5% in the prevaccine years, dropping to 29.3% in the postvaccine period. Among PCV7 serotypes, only 19F persisted, with nonvaccine (NV) serotype 19nonF strains increasing from 3% to 20% of total p<0.001. NV serotypes were 1.9 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.1) more likely to acquire MR over time. Although PCV7 serotypes constituted 84% of all MR isolates in the prevaccine era, MR was unchanged in the postvaccine period due to increased prevalence and acquisition of resistance by NV serotypes. MR among invasive isolates did not change over time, but increased among noninvasive NV isolates by 17% (95% CI 12-22%). CONCLUSIONS: The complete switch in prevalence of PCV7 by NV serotypes has been aided by a herd effect in adults and older children. NV serotypes have acquired MR at a rate that is proportional to the replacement process.",

The plasmid insertion generated a mutant in which the MIC value for oxacillin was reduced from 400 microg/ml of the parental strain to 0.75 microg/ml in 90% of the cells of the mutant cultures that were heterogeneous: they contained subpopulations of bacteria with a frequency of 10(-3) that were capable of expressing resistance at nearly the parental level. The impact of the murF mutation on antibiotic resistance was selective for beta-lactam antibiotics: there was no change in the susceptibility of the mutant to D-cycloserine, fosfomycin, beta-D-chloro-alanine, moenomycin, bacitracin, or vancomycin. Analysis of the mutant peptidoglycan showed decrease in the percentage of oligomeric components in rough proportion to the accumulation of several abnormal muropeptide components, which were identified as structural variants of the disaccharide tripeptide monomer. An abnormal cell wall precursor identified as UDP MurNac tripeptide was also detected in the cytoplasmic pool of the mutant strain. A normal proportion of oligomers and a greatly reduced representation of the disaccharide tripeptide were demonstrated in the cell wall of the murF mutant's subpopulation that has retained the parental level of resistance. Northern analysis demonstrated a drastic reduction in the transcription rate of mecA in mutant F9 whereas mecA transcription increased in the subpopulation of bacteria that retained high-level resistance.",

        "abstract": "A clone of Hungarian pneumococcal strains has recently been isolated with notably high levels of beta-lactam resistance (penicillin MIC, 16 microg/mL; cefotaxime MIC, 4 microg/mL). The role that each penicillin-binding protein (PBP) plays in the development of resistance in these strains was investigated via transformation of susceptible strain R6 with pbp DNA from resistant strain 3191. Transformation of strain R6 with pbp2X DNA resulted in transformants with penicillin and cefotaxime MICs of 0.06 and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Further introduction of pbp2B and 1A DNA increased penicillin MICs to 0.25 and 4 microg/mL, respectively. Transformation of strain R6 with a combination of pbp2X and pbp1A DNA produced R63191/2X/1A strains with an unexpected low cefotaxime MIC of 0.5 microg/mL. This low-level of cefotaxime resistance was surprisingly increased from 0.5 to 2 microg/mL in R63191/2X/2B/1A strains. This suggests the involvement of altered PBP 2B in cefotaxime resistance. Therefore, within this particular setting of resistance, the environmental presence of selectors for altered PBP 2B (penicillin or piperacillin) are required for the development of high-level cefotaxime resistance. The MICs of R63191/X/2B/1A strains never reached the MICs of the donor strain. Full MICs of the donor were eventually reached by transforming R63191/2X/2B with chromosomal3191 DNA. Resultant transformants revealed the introduction of altered PBP 1A, while unaltered PBPs 1B, 2A, and 3 proved that these PBPs were not involved in resistance. A non-PBP resistance determinant has therefore made up the difference in resistance between R63191/2X/2B/1A and donor strain 3191. Beta-lactamase activity and efflux systems have so far been eliminated as causes of resistance. This resistance determinant represents a novel mechanism for beta-lactam resistance in clinical isolates of pneumococci, operates at the highest level of resistance, and remains to be identified.",

        "abstract": "The enzymes responsible for peptidoglycan amidation in Staphylococcus aureus, MurT and GatD, were recently identified and shown to be required for optimal expression of resistance to beta-lactams, bacterial growth, and resistance to lysozyme. In this study, we analyzed the impact of peptidoglycan amidation in representative strains of the most widespread clones of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The inhibition of the expression of murT-gatD operon resulted in different phenotypes of resistance to beta-lactams and lysozyme according to the different genetic backgrounds. Further, clonal lineages CC1 and CC398 (community-acquired MRSA [CA-MRSA]) showed a stronger dependency on MurT-GatD for resistance to beta-lactams, when compared to the impact of the impairment of the cell wall step catalyzed by MurF. In the remaining backgrounds similar phenotypes of beta-lactam resistance were observed upon the impairment of both cell-wall-related genes. Therefore, for CA-related backgrounds, the predominant beta-lactam resistance mechanism seems to involve genes associated with secondary modifications of peptidoglycan. On the other hand, the lack of glutamic acid amidation had a more substantial impact on lysozyme resistance for cells of CA-MRSA backgrounds, than for hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). However, no significant differences were found in the resistance level of the respective peptidoglycan structure, suggesting that the lysozyme resistance mechanism involves other factors. Taken together, these results suggested that the different genetic lineages of MRSA were able to develop different molecular strategies to overcome the selective pressures experienced during evolution.",

Serotype deduction was performed by sequential multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), employing mutagenic PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism for discrimination of 6A/C and 6B/D. Unaltered three PBP genes and macrolide resistance genes erm(B) and mef(A/E) were detected by multiplex PCR. Among isolates from children, 25 serotypes, including the prevalent types 6B (17.5%), 19F (15.6%), 23F (12.2%), and 6C (11.6%), were identified, revealing the PCV7 and PCV13 coverage rates as 48.2% and 60.3%, respectively, while serotype 3 was the most frequent (19.0%) among isolates from adults. Most of the pediatric isolates (96.8%) exhibited resistance to EM (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], \u22651\u2009\u03bcg/ml), with a higher prevalence of erm(B) (67.2%) than mef(A/E) (39.7%). erm(B) was associated with high-level EM resistance (MIC, \u2265128\u2009\u03bcg/ml) and distributed at high detection rates to major serotypes 23F (85.2%) and 6B (85.1%), as well as minor serotypes 3, 10A, 14, 15B, 15C, 19A, and 23A (>90%). While penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) (penicillin G-MIC, 2-3\u2009\u03bcg/ml) was detected in 7.8% of isolates from children, the most common PBP gene genotype was gPRSP (three altered genes pbp1a, 2x, and 2b; 38.3%), which was detected at higher rates (>60%) in the dominant serotypes 23F, 6B, and 19F, and minor serotypes 6D and 15A. Dominant serotypes in the S. pneumoniae isolates were generally similar to those reported for invasive strains, despite lower coverage rates by PCV7/13. The importance of further surveillance on incidence and drug resistance in the post-PCV7 period was suggested for non-PCV7/13 serotypes 6C, 6D, 10A, 15A, 15B, 15C, 23A, and 35B.",

This was a retrospective cohort study that included adult patients who stayed in the hospital >2 days. We analyzed data using shared frailty Cox models and tested our approach using a priori hypotheses based on biology and epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. For gram-negative bacteria, the use of the major selecting antibiotic by an individual was the main risk factor for acquiring resistant species. Hazard ratios (HRs) were strikingly high for ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter species (HR=11.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.67-22.02), ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (HR=4.41; 95% CI: 2.14-9.08), and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (HR=7.92; 95% CI: 4.35-14.43). Ward-level use was significant for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (HR=1.40; 95% CI: 1.07-1.83) and for imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (HR=1.40; 95% CI: 1.08-1.83). Previous incidence of infection in the same ward increased the risk of acquiring methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HR=1.22; 95% CI: 1.15-1.30) and VRE (HR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.38-1.70). Our results were consistent with our hypotheses and showed that combining population- and individual-level data is crucial for the exploration of antimicrobial resistance development.",

An 81-bp region of the rpoB gene was also sequenced in 17 rifampin-resistant strains. Alterations in the katG gene were detected in 55% of the isolates. Mutation in codon 315 was the most prevalent (32%). Strains showed a high level of resistance, and most maintained a substantial catalase-peroxidase activity. Three strains with an isoniazid MIC of >or=32 microg/ml lacked catalase-peroxidase activity. Two of them had deletions in the catalytic domain of the KatG protein. One strain with deletion and three strains with mutations in the C-terminal domain showed low-level resistance and conserved the catalase-peroxidase activity. Mutations in the mabA-inhA regulatory region were identified in 32% of the isolates. All had low-level resistance, and the vast majority conserved catalase-peroxidase activity. Seventeen percent of the isoniazid-resistant isolates had no detectable alterations at the studied loci. Resistance to rifampin was associated with mutations in the 81-bp of the rpoB gene in all cases. IS6110 analysis indicated that recent transmission contributed substantially to the emergence of isoniazid- resistant tuberculosis in Barcelona through short transmission chains. A rapid genotypic assay, including the 315-katG codon and the -15 nucleotide of the mabA-inhA regulatory region, may cover 62% of isoniazid- resistant strains in Barcelona. In contrast, the targeting of the 81-bp region of rpoB would detect all our rifampin-resistant isolates.",

        "abstract": "Macrolides and related antibiotics are used to control mycoplasma infections in the pig industry worldwide. Some porcine mycoplasmas, however, survive these treatments by acquiring resistance. The mechanism of acquired resistance to macrolides and lincosamides was studied in more detail for Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae by comparing both the phenotype and genotype of a resistant field isolate to five susceptible isolates. The MICs were significantly higher for the resistant strain for all antibiotics tested. The MICs for the 16-membered macrolide tylosin ranged from 8 to 16 microg for the resistant strain and from 0.03 to 0.125 microg/ml for the five susceptible strains. The MICs for the 15-membered macrolides and lincosamides were higher than 64 microg/ml for the resistant strain while only 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml for the susceptible strains. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae strains are intrinsically resistant to the 14-membered macrolides due to a G 2057 A transition (E. coli numbering) in their 23S rDNA. Therefore, high MICs were observed for all strains, although the MICs for the resistant strain were clearly increased. An additional, acquired A 2058 G point mutation was found in the 23S rRNA gene of the resistant strain. No differences linked to resistance were found in the ribosomal proteins L4 and L22. The present study showed that 23S rRNA mutations resulting in resistance to macrolides and lincosamides as described in other Mycoplasma spp. also occur under field conditions in M. hyopneumoniae.",

Fecal samples (n = 1560) were collected via rectal palpation and cultured for Salmonella, and one isolate from each positive sample was serotyped. Three isolates of each serotype, with the exception of Salmonella Newport (n = 12), were examined for susceptibility to 17 antimicrobial agents. Twenty-two different serotypes were identified from a total of 393 Salmonella isolates. Montevideo was the predominant serotype (27%) followed by Mbandaka (15%), Senftenberg (11.4%), Newport (6.4%), Anatum (4.8%), and Give (4.8%). Salmonella Typhimurium and Dublin, two frequently reported serotypes, accounted for only 1% of the observed serotypes in this study. Sixty-four percent of the serotypes were susceptible to all 17 antimicrobials, 14% were resistant to a single agent, and 22% were multiresistant (2-11 types of resistance). All isolates tested were susceptible to amikacin, apramycin, imipenem, ceftriaxone, nalidixic acid, and ciprofloxacin. The most frequent types of resistance were to sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, streptomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin (ranging from 8.9 to 22.4%). Serotypes demonstrating multiple resistance included Dublin and Give (resistant to three or more antibiotics), Typhimurium (resistant to five antibiotics), and Newport (four and two isolates resistant to six and nine antibiotics, respectively). Class 1 integrons were present in only two Salmonella Dublin isolates and one Salmonella Newport isolate. The most prevalent resistance patterns observed in this study were toward antimicrobial agents commonly used in cattle, while all Salmonella isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin, antibiotics used in human medicine.",

We compared these results to the standard EM/CM double disk diffusion assay of 46 isolates. Given that these genes are present in other CVR flora and are found on mobile genetic elements, the PCR assay was unable to predict GBS resistance directly from the swabs. Therefore, PCR can only accurately detect resistance genes and predict the resistance phenotype from purified GBS isolates.",

Yet, in the same cultures, subpopulations of bacteria exhibiting very high levels of resistance are also present with variable frequencies, which are characteristic of the particular MRSA lineage. The mechanism of heterogeneous resistance is not understood. We describe here an experimental system for exploring the mechanism of heterogeneous resistance. Copies of the resistance gene mecA cloned into a temperature-sensitive plasmid were introduced into the fully sequenced methicillin-susceptible clinical isolate S. aureus strain 476. Transductants of strain 476 expressed methicillin resistance in a heterogeneous fashion: the great majority of cells showed only low MIC (0.75 \u03bcg/ml) for the antibiotic, but a minority population of highly resistant bacteria (MIC >300 \u03bcg/ml) was also present with a frequency of \u223c10(-4). The genetic backgrounds of the majority and minority cells were compared by whole-genome sequencing: the only differences detectable were two point mutations in relA of the highly resistant minority population of bacteria. The relA gene codes for the synthesis of (p)ppGpp, an effector of the stringent stress response. Titration of (p)ppGpp showed increased amounts of this effector in the highly resistant cells. Involvement of (p)ppGpp synthesis genes may explain some of the perplexing aspects of \u03b2-lactam resistance in MRSA, since many environmental and genetic changes can modulate cellular levels of (p)ppGpp.",

MIC values for all antibiotics varied widely between strains. The analysis of both absolute MICs and their distribution was used to define new susceptibility-resistance cutoff values for all antibiotics, except for streptomycin. Based on these new cutoffs, the studied strains were nearly all identified as either susceptible (ampicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and gentamicin) or intrinsically resistant (streptomycin). The exceptions were four strains with MICs for tetracycline higher than the cutoff point (64 microg ml(1)); these were suspected to harbor acquired resistance determinants.",

Multiple mutant strains were obtained from the selection. Most of the high-level macrolide-resistant strains derived from the selection exhibited the A2074C transversion in all three copies of 23S rRNA and displayed strong stability in the absence of antibiotic selection pressure. The competition experiments demonstrated that the strains containing the A2074C transversion imposed a fitness cost in competition mixtures. In addition, the fitness cost of the mutation was not ameliorated after approximately 500 generations of evolution under laboratory conditions. These findings indicate that the A2074C transversion in C. jejuni is not only correlated with stable and high-level macrolide resistance but also associated with a fitness cost.",

On the other hand, similarity, topology, and hydropathy analyses of some representatives from 12-transmembrane segments (TMS) and 14-TMS proteins lead us to perform meaningful sequence alignments of recognized or putative 12-TMS and 14-TMS proteins truncated to their first 200 amino acids (alpha-domain of the protein). For all aligned truncated proteins, including old and recently discovered tetracycline resistance determinants, significant similarities along this segment were demonstrated and three new conserved motifs identified, reinforcing the hypothesis of a common ancestry for the alpha-domain of all tetracycline-efflux pumps.",

The strains originated from Finland, France, Japan, Norway, Scotland, Switzerland, and the United States. Additional resistance determinants in strains with class 1 integrons were also determined. Of 21 strains containing a class 1 integron, 19 had a single gene cassette, 1 strain had two cassettes, and 1 strain was found to lack an integrated gene cassette. In the integrons with single cassettes, aadA2 was present in eight strains, dfr16 in five strains, and aadA1 and dfrIIc in three strains each. In the integron with two cassettes, qacG and orfD were present. Tetracycline resistance was observed in 20 of the integron-positive strains, caused by the determinants Tet A and Tet E, in which Tet A frequently was associated with Tn1721. Class 1 integrons seem to be important in mediating antibiotic resistance also in the marine environment. The gene cassettes reported in this study are all described in bacteria associated with humans, and this demonstrates once more how the common gene pool is shared between organisms belonging to different environments.",

Strains harboring the A2142G mutation showed 5.3-fold higher clarithromycin MIC50 than those harboring the A2143G mutation. The A2143G mutation alone was 1.7-fold more common in vacA i2 strains compared with vacA i1 strains, while the A2142G mutation alone was 3-fold more frequent in vacA i1 strains than vacA i2 strains and 3.1-fold more common in metronidazole-susceptible compared with metronidazole-resistant strains. Briefly, clarithromycin resistance mutations were significantly linked to vacA i allele and metronidazole susceptibility. This is the first report about associations between the A2143G mutation and less virulent vacA i2 strains, and between the A2142G mutation and more virulent vacA i1 strains. As the 2143G mutation often predicts eradication failure by clarithromycin-based regimens, the results may be linked to the better eradication of more virulent strains compared with the less virulent strains.",

Thus, in addition to 38 (7%) resistant isolates, there were 30 (5.5%) reduced-susceptible isolates and 473 (87.5%) susceptible isolates. A total of 34 isolates consisting of nine resistant, 13 reduced-susceptible, and 12 susceptible isolates were assessed for point mutations in gyrA and parC and the outer membrane profiles. The susceptibility to fluoroquinolone of 13 reduced-susceptible isolates was not altered in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an efflux inhibitor, showing that efflux is not a major contributor to reduced susceptibility. In addition to single mutation in gyrA, OmpK35 porin loss can also be the first step for developing fluoroquinolone resistance. No strain possesses a parC mutation without the simultaneous presence of a gyrA mutation, suggesting that mutations in parC play a complementary role for higher-level of fluoroquinolone resistance and fluoroquinolone resistance is a multistep process.",

        "abstract": "The genetic basis for multidrug resistance (mdr) due to overexpression of mdr efflux pumps in Escherichia coli usually includes alterations in genes encoding global regulators, like MarA, SoxS, and Rob. In Salmonella, in addition to these regulators, Rma, for which no homolog exists in E. coli, seems to play a role in the regulation of efflux pumps. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the influence of the regulator Rma on the expression of mdr efflux pumps in Salmonella Hadar by overexpression of the potential activator. Overexpression of rma (about 80-fold) from a plasmid led to an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of (fluoro)quinolones (2-4-fold), chloramphenicol (3-fold), tetracycline (4-fold), and novobiocin (3-fold), which is associated with an elevated expression of the mdr efflux pumps AcrAB-TolC, AcrEF-TolC, and MdtABC (formerly known as YegMNO)-TolC (all about 15-fold) as has been demonstrated by quantitative real-time PCR experiments. To assess a putative general relevance of Rma for fluoroquinolone resistance, clinical isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 and DT204c and Salmonella Hadar, which showed elevated MICs, were investigated concerning rma and acrA gene expression levels. All clinical isolates showed an elevated expression of rma (up to 16-fold) and acrA (up to 3-fold) compared to the respective wild-type strains. Thus, the global regulator Rma is important in Salmonella concerning elevated expression of several mdr efflux pumps and hence resulting increase in antibiotic resistance.",

We report regional and temporal variations in antibiotic resistance for 4,105 invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates collected from Latin American children <5 years, between 1993 and 1999. Reduced susceptibility to penicillin was detected in 1,182 isolates (28.8%); 36% of these were resistant (> or = 2 microg/ml), including 12.6% with MIC > or = 4 microg/ml, occurring primarily in serotypes 14 and 23F. Reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins was detected in 12.1% of the collection. Mexico had the highest proportion of reduced susceptibility to penicillin (51.6%) and to third-generation cephalosporins (22%), whereas Brazil had the lowest at 20.9% and 0.7%, respectively. Isolates cultured from patients with pneumonia were more likely to have reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins than isolates from patients with meningitis (p < 0.0001). Susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and vancomycin was tested by disk diffusion for 2.899 isolates. Reduced susceptibility was observed for 45.6%, 11.5%, 6.9%, and 0%, respectively. Thirty-one percent of the strains were resistant to > or = 2 drugs. High levels of antibiotic resistance in Latin America emphasize the need for the development of and adherence to rational antibiotic use guidelines.

This study aimed to identify the resistance genes and their location. Polymerase chain reaction was used to screen for resistance genes and sul2 (sulphonamide resistance) and strA and strB (streptomycin resistance) were detected. A small streptomycin and sulfonamide resistance plasmid carrying the three resistance genes was recovered from these isolates by transformation and was shown to be essentially identical to the small IncQ plasmid RSF1010. The sequences of one plasmid, pSRC15, and RSF1010 differed at only a few positions that may be errors in the older sequence. RSF1010 has been recovered from many species and in many countries since its first isolation in the early 1970s. We conclude that this plasmid has persisted unchanged in the environment for over 30 years. The antibiotic resistance gene cluster containing strA, strB, and sul2 genes has clearly arisen from other known entities by a combination of transposition and homologous recombination using a short segment of homology. This resistance gene cluster is now widely distributed in plasmids and genomic islands in a number of contexts.",

        "abstract": "Campylobacter are the most commonly reported bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis, and they are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, including macrolides and fluoroquinolones, those most frequently used for the treatment of campylobacteriosis. Active efflux mechanisms are involved in resistance of Campylobacter to a broad spectrum of antimicrobials, and are also essential for Campylobacter colonization in the animal intestine, through mediation of bile resistance. Acquisition of antibiotic resistance through resistance-conferring mutations can impose a fitness cost of Campylobacter. The aim of the present study was to determine whether macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter affects their tolerance to bile salts and sodium deoxycholate through the most frequent resistance-conferring mutations. Antimicrobial efflux was studied on the basis of restored sensitivity in the presence of the efflux-pump inhibitors (EPIs) phenylalanine-arginine beta-naphthylamide (PA\u03b2N) and 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine. In the 15 Campylobacter jejuni and 23 Campylobacter coli strains examined here, both of these EPIs partially reversed the resistance to bile salts and sodium deoxycholate. Erythromycin-sensitive C. coli strains were more resistant to bile salts and sodium deoxycholate than erythromycin-resistant strains. PA\u03b2N had greater effects on bile salt and sodium deoxycholate resistance in these erythromycin-resistant strains compared to erythromycin-sensitive strains. However, no differences were seen between the ciprofloxacin-sensitive and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains.",

The proportion of MRSA isolated increased in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, and Darwin, but not in Brisbane. The proportion in Hobart peaked in 1994. MRSA in Perth were predominantly non-multiresistant (nmMRSA) throughout the survey (i.e., resistant to less than three of eight indicator antibiotics) due mainly to local strains that originated in the community. The proportion of nmMRSA increased to modest levels in the other cities. In eastern cities, this was due to the appearance of strains closely related to nmMRSA seen in other countries of the southwestern Pacific.",

        "abstract": "The acquisition of resistance to amoxicillin, tetracycline, and enrofloxacin by Escherichia coli MG 1655 was examined by exposing growing cells to constant or stepwise increasing concentrations of these compounds. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of E. coli for amoxicillin increased from 4-8 to 32\u2009\u03bcg/ml after growth in the presence of 1.25 or 2.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml. By stepwise increasing the exposure, an MIC of 512\u2009\u03bcg/ml was reached. This high MIC was maintained after removal of the antibiotics, whereas the lesser increase after exposure to low levels was reversed, indicating that the high MIC was due to a genetic change, but the lower one to phenotypic adaptation only. The MIC for tetracycline increased from 2\u2009\u03bcg/ml to maximally 32\u2009\u03bcg/ml. The MIC decreased to control levels in the absence of tetracycline, so no genetic changes seem to have occurred. The MIC for enrofloxacin increased from 0.25\u2009\u03bcg/ml to maximally 512\u2009\u03bcg/ml depending on the concentration during growth. These data mostly support the \"radical-based\" theory that bactericidal antibiotics induce a common mechanism that contributes to cell killing. Our findings indicate that exposure to low levels of antibiotics causes an increase in MIC above the concentration that the cells were exposed to. The implication is that exposure to low levels of antibiotics should be prevented as much as possible, because this causes resistance far more than high concentrations that inhibit growth or kill the cell and thus prevent acquisition of resistance.",

The purpose of studies described in this communication was to understand better the role of murMN in penicillin resistance. Deletion of murM in the penicillin-resistant strain Pen6, which causes reduction in the penicillin MIC from 6.0 to 0.03 microg/ml, was successfully complemented to recover the original high level of penicillin resistance in transformants that received functional murM alleles cloned in plasmid pLS578. Inactivation of penicillin resistance was not accompanied by any detectable change in the low affinity or abnormal molecular size pattern of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) nor in the mosaic sequence of PBP2X typical of resistant strain Pen6. Exposure of strain Pen6 with inactivated murM to 0.05 microg/ml of penicillin (i.e., a concentration more than 100 times below the MIC of the parental strain) initiated a phenotypic response typical of penicillin-susceptible strains of pneumococci: inhibition of growth followed by rapid and extensive loss of viability and lysis. Unexpectedly, inactivation of murMN also caused hypersensitivity to lysis by low concentrations of a variety of cell wall active antibiotics such as fosfomycin, D-cycloserine, and nisin, suggesting that the murMN operon may perform an important regulatory role in the control of the irreversible antimicrobial effects of cell wall inhibitors.",

A bla(TEM) gene was found in 22 of the 25 ampicillin-resistant isolates, and the gene encoding CTX-M-14 beta-lactamase was identified in the two cefotaxime-resistant isolates (recovered from a common kestrel and a sparrowhawk), associated with bla(TEM-52) gene in one of them. Other resistance genes detected were as follows: aac(3)-II or aac(3)-IV genes in all gentamicin-resistant isolates; aadA1 or aadA2 in 22 of 25 streptomycin-resistant isolates; tet(A) and/or tet(B) in all 39 tetracycline-resistant isolates; and sul1 and/or sul2 and/or sul3 genes in all 21 SXT-resistant isolates. Two amino acid changes in GyrA protein (Ser83Leu + Asp87Asn) and one change in ParC protein (Ser80Ile) were identified in all 10 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates of our series.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Widespread multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) strains have limited therapeutic options for treating intensive care unit (ICU) patients with MDR-AB infection in Iran. We aimed to evaluate MDR-AB diversity and antimicrobial susceptibility in Tehran (Iran) to address the need for feasible and effective control approaches against severe MDR-AB infections. METHODS: We used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations to compare genotypic diversity and susceptibility patterns of 100 MDR-AB isolates from ICU patients in two medical centers in Tehran (Iran), from 2006 to 2011. RESULTS: Within 5 years, drastic genotypic changes occurred among MDR-AB isolates, and resistance to antimicrobials increased 0-30%. In 2011, 6-100% of isolates were resistant to every agent tested. All isolates remained susceptible to either minocycline or tobramycin, however, MIC50 concentrations against these agents increased. Novel international clone (IC) variants (not IC I-III types) comprised 36% MDR-AB isolates in 2011. CONCLUSIONS: The MDR-AB population in Tehran is rapidly changing toward growing resistance to various antimicrobials, including colistin and tigecycline. Although increasing resistance to last-resort antimicrobials is alarming, simultaneous susceptibility of all MDR-AB isolates to some conventional antibiotics highlights the merits of investigating their synergistic activity against extended-spectrum and pandrug resistant A. baumannii. Integrating the novel Iranian MDR-AB IC variants into epidemiologic clonal and susceptibility profile databases can help global efforts toward the control of MDR-AB pandemic.",

        "abstract": "Elements carrying more than one antibiotic resistance gene have never been found in Clostridium difficile, one of the major causes of nosocomial diarrheic diseases. In this study, C. difficile isolates were investigated for a possible genetic linkage between tet(M) and erm(B), the most frequent genes found in strains resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin. In the majority of C. difficile strains, tet(M) is carried by Tn5397. However, tet(M) genes carried by Tn916-like elements have been found in recent clinical isolates. As far as erythromycin resistance is concerned, the only completely characterized transposon harboring an erm(B) gene in C. difficile is Tn5398, even if ErmB determinants probably carried by other elements have been identified. Among the 100 C. difficile isolates screened in this study, 27 were positive for tet(M) and erm(B). Twenty five of these strains were positive for tndX, used as marker for Tn5397, whereas two were positive for int, used as marker for Tn916-like elements. The latter isolates showed two tet(M) genes: one was carried by a Tn916-like element, able to transfer to a recipient C. difficile strain, whereas the second was genetically linked to an erm(B) in a composite element probably unable to conjugate. Molecular analysis of C. difficile cd1911 tet(M)-erm(B) DNA sequence demonstrated that this region has arisen by recombination of DNA fragments from different plasmids and transposons. This is the first demonstration that C. difficile is able to accumulate and maintain antibiotic resistance genes, as observed in other pathogens.",

Risk factors were time, age, sex, census region, location (Ward or ICU), and isolate source. Antimicrobial susceptibility data were available for carbapenems, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Multiclass resistance was defined as nonsusceptibility to carbapenems and two or more additional classes. Odds of resistance were obtained using a logistic regression model with cubic splines. Carbapenem-associated multiclass resistance has had a 3.7-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4-4.3) increase from 20.6% in 2002 to 49.2% in 2008. Among blood isolates the increase was by 2.2 times (95% CI 1.7-2.9). Subjects <18 years old had significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) lower rates in 2002 (6.9%) than those 65 years or older (21.5%), but by 2008 this difference diminished as rates increased to 44.2% and 54.2%, respectively. A similar divergence was also observed between ICU and Ward, with no differences in 2002, whereas in 2008\u2009ICU isolates had significantly higher rates (55.2%, 95% CI 53.6%-56.9%) than Ward isolates (45.6%, 95% CI 44.2%-47.0%). Over half of all A. baumannii-resistant isolates were carbapenem and multiclass resistant in 2008. Rates among subjects <18 years old have increased faster than those of the elderly, and in the ICU as compared to Ward.",

PBP 4, although not essential for survival, has been associated with low-level resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. To determine its contribution to survival of Staphylococcus aureus cells exposed to beta-lactams, the PBP 4 gene (pbp4) was disrupted and then complemented in the methicillin-susceptible strain RN4220 and the homogeneous methicillin-resistant strain COL. Depending on the antibiotic tested, the presence or absence of an intact pbp4 has no effect or only a modest effect on growth measured by population analysis.

The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of mortality and evaluate the clinical impact of antimicrobial resistance on outcome in P. aeruginosa bacteremia. A retrospective cohort study including patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia was performed. The risk factors for antimicrobial resistances were evaluated, and the impact of the respective resistances on mortality was assessed. Of 202 P. aeruginosa bacteremia cases, the resistance rates to ceftazidime, piperacillin, imipenem, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside were 36.6%, 22.3%, 22.8%, 23.8%, and 17.8%, respectively. A prior use of fluoroquinolones and an indwelling urinary catheter were common risk factors for all types of antimicrobial resistance. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 25.2% (51/202), and the risk factors for mortality were corticosteroid use, nosocomial acquisition, polymicrobial infection, an increasing Charlson's weighted co-morbidity index, and intensive care unit care (p\u2009<\u20090.05). As compared with the susceptible group, ceftazidime-, piperacillin-, or imipenem-resistant groups had a higher mortality (p\u2009<\u20090.05). A multivariate analysis showed that resistance to ceftazidime or imipenem remained a significant factor associated with mortality (odds ratio, 2.96; 95% confidential interval, 1.20-7.31; and odds ratio, 2.74; 95% confidential interval, 1.02-7.31, respectively). Antimicrobial resistance, especially to ceftazidime or imipenem, adversely affected outcome in patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia.",

        "abstract": "A total of 59 and 74 nonduplicate plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes-carrying Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates were collected. All strains were assayed for fluoroquinolone susceptibility and the prevalence of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) mutation. The association between PMQR determinants and common \u03b2-lactamase genes was also analyzed. Genetic relatedness of the isolates was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The PMQR genes-carrying K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates exhibited high fluoroquinolone resistance rates, indicating that PMQR determinants play an essential role in the development of fluoroquinolone resistance. Remarkably, most qnr-carrying strains had only a single or no QRDR mutation in GyrA or ParC, and most exhibited decreased ciprofloxacin (CIP) susceptibility or low-level CIP resistance. However, 71.4% and 98.4% of qnr-negative K. pneumoniae and E. coli contained double QRDR mutations, and most presented high-level CIP resistance. Additionally, K. pneumoniae presented a lower CIP resistance rate than E. coli (59.3% vs. 91.9%) and low carriage of double QRDR mutations (38.9% vs. 89.9%). Also, most (88.1%) K. pneumoniae examined in this study carried qnr and only 14.9% of E. coli were qnr positive. Thus, the high fluoroquinolone susceptibility of K. pneumoniae isolates is primarily due to fewer QRDR substitutions as a result of high prevalence of qnr alleles in the host. Our findings support the hypothesis that chromosomal resistance mutations could be affected by the presence of Qnr, in other words, Qnr may protect the QRDR domains in the gyrase and topoisomerase IV from mutations under the inhibition of fluoroquinolones. Another remarkable finding was that the PMQR genes-carrying K. pneumoniae exhibited much higher proportions of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs)-positive phenotype than E. coli (73.5% vs. 59.5%). This is due to not only the high prevalence of SHV-type ESBL-conferring enzymes in K. pneumoniae but also the interference of DHA-producing K. pneumoniae as a result of the strong association between qnrB and bla(DHA).",

        "abstract": "To understand the mechanisms and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (AR), the genetic elements responsible must be identified. Due to the myriad of possible genes, a high-density genotyping technique is needed for initial screening. To achieve this, AR genes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database were identified by their annotations and compiled into a nonredundant list of 775 genes. A DNA microarray was constructed of 70mer oligonucelotide probes designed to detect these genes encoding resistances to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicols, glycopeptides, heavy metals, lincosamides, macrolides, metronidazoles, polyketides, quaternary ammonium compounds, streptogramins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprims as well as resistance transfer genes. The microarray was validated with two fully sequenced control strains of Salmonella enterica: Typhimurium LT2 (sensitive) and Typhi CT18 (multidrug resistance [MDR]). All resistance genes encoded on the MDR plasmid, pHCM1, harbored by CT18 were detected in that strain, whereas no resistance genes were detected in LT2. The microarray was also tested with a variety of bacteria, including MDR Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria spp., and Clostridium difficile. The results presented here demonstrate that a microarray can be designed to detect virtually all AR genes found in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, thus reducing the subsequent assays necessary to identify specific resistance gene alleles.",

        "abstract": "Clinical strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are often highly resistant to multiple antibiotics and this resistance is steadily rising. Quinolones are included in the group of antimicrobial agents to which this microorganism is developing resistance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological relationship among 22 clinical isolates of S. maltophilia as well as the molecular mechanisms responsible for the acquisition of quinolone-resistance in these strains. The results of the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed an heterogenicity of 82% among the strains used in the study. On the other hand, no amino acid changes were found in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of either gyrA and parC genes among quinolone-susceptible and -resistant S. maltophilia strains. Besides, the amino acid of the GyrA found in the position equivalent to Ser-83 of E. coli was Gln instead of a Ser or Thr, the amino acids usually encountered in this position among Gram-negative bacteria. The results suggest that there is not a relationship between the presence of this Gln and the resistance to quinolones in S. maltophilia. We can conclude that, contrary to what has been described in other microorganisms, in these S. maltophilia isolates, the development of resistance to quinolones was not related to mutations in the QRDR of gyrA and parC genes. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first report describing this phenomenon.",

Prevalence of resistant bacteria was determined in antibiotic-supplemented agar. Bacterial isolates from the UW (n=91) and SML (n=80), selected in media without antibiotic, were characterized concerning susceptibility against nine antibiotics. The presence of genes bla(TEM), bla(OXA-B), bla(SHV), bla(IMP), tet(A), tet(B), tet(E), tet(M), cat, sul1, sul2, sul3, aadA, IntI1, IntI2, and IntI3 was assessed by PCR. The variable regions of integrons were sequenced. Ampicillin- and streptomycin-resistant bacteria were significantly more prevalent in SML. Resistance levels among the bacterial collections were generally low, preventing detection of significant differences between SML and UW. The tet(E) gene was detected in two Aeromonas isolates and tet(M) was detected in a Pseudomonas isolate. Gene sul1 was amplified from three Aeromonas isolates. Prevalence of intI genes was 2.11%. Cassette arrays contained genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol. A higher prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the SML, although only detectable when bacteria were selected in antibiotic-supplemented agar, suggests that SML conditions select for antibiotic resistance. Results also showed that antibiotic resistance was uncommon among estuarine bacteria and the resistance mechanisms are probably predominantly intrinsic.",

Resistance was detected in at least one strain for seven of the eight antibiotics tested, the exception being amikacin. Resistance to antibiotics predominated in the areas of the lakes likely to be under highest anthropogenic disturbance. Resistance was more frequently observed among isolates recovered from within the proximity to a tourist resort (Lake Shira; 63% of bacteria with multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) in the resort part), or the shore line (Lake Shunet; 100% of bacteria with MAR) than among isolates from the center of each lake; 42.5% of bacteria with MAR from Lake Shira and 25%/75% of bacteria are resistant to three/four antibiotics consequently from Lake Shunet. Plasmid profiles were determined from a sample of 37 multiply resistant bacteria, and between one and four plasmids were isolated from each isolate; the plasmids ranged in size from 2.3 to 23.1\u2009kb. These observations are consistent with anthropogenic disturbance playing one of the key roles in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in the aquatic ecosystems.",

Ten of the erythromycin-resistant isolates were also resistant to tetracycline. By the triple-disk test, all erythromycin-resistant isolates showed the inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin-C phenotype and harbored erm(TR) gene. tet(O) was the most common tetracycline resistance gene. Among erythromycin-tetracycline coresistant isolates, seven harbored the tet(O) gene. emm 4, emm 1, emm 2,114, and emm 89 were the most common emm types. These isolates were more susceptible to erythromycin. There was considerable emm type heterogeneity in macrolide or tetracycline resistant isolates.

Because susceptibility data for ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, the two recommended drugs for treatment, are not available for this part of the world, 64 Campylobacter spp. isolates obtained from human diarrheal stools in Kuwait during 2000--2003 were studied for susceptibility to these antimicrobials by E-test. The utility of a simple mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA) PCR to detect base substitution in the gyrA gene mediating resistance to ciprofloxacin was also explored. Approximately, 53% (34/64) of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC, 4-64 microg/ml) and 5% (3/64) to erythromycin (MIC>256 microg/ml). MAMA PCR showed a Thr-86-to-Ile mutation in gyrA gene of 23/26 ciprofloxacin-resistant C. jejuni, and in all resistant C. coli. Sequencing of PCR product showed that two resistant strains of C. coli studied had Thr-86-to-Ile (ACT--> ATT) gyrA mutation and three resistant strains of C. jejuni studied had Thr-86-to-Ile (ACA--> ATA) gyrA mutation. In addition, all the three C. jejuni strains had silent mutations. Thus, ciprofloxacin is of limited use for treatment in Kuwait and MAMA PCR is a useful assay to study gyrA mutation. Because Kuwait has a large expatriate population of workers, it can be a focus of spread of antimicrobial resistance.",

Analysis of the genomic diversity by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing showed that the Salmonella Typhimurium strains were grouped into four distinct genotypic clusters, indicating genomic diversity among 12 strains examined. The polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that the tet(A) gene was found on the genomic DNA and was located within a truncated version of transposon Tn1721. The comparative analysis of the tet(A) gene sequence in Salmonella Typhimurium strains identified high sequence similarity to the tet determinant of plasmid RP1, which is homologous to the tet gene in Tn1721. The findings show the presence of tet(A) among the tetracycline-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium strains isolated from irrigation water used for growing fresh fruits and vegetables.",

Automated ribotyping was used to study their molecular epidemiology. The mortality rate among those > or = 65 years was higher than those 18 or 19-64 years (p < 0.001). The total incidence of infection was significantly higher during the cooler season than the warmer season (p = 0.017). Among strains isolated from children aged < or = 18 years, 76% were not susceptible to penicillin, a rate that was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that for adults (45%), as was the susceptibility to azithromycin, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (p < 0.005). The most prevalent serogroup encountered in the invasive isolates was 23, followed by 6, 14, 19, and 3. Isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae in cerebrospinal fluid was at high rate in children under 5 years (p = 0.00012). Molecular typing revealed a high degree of polymorphism among the isolates. Among serogroup 23 and 19 isolates, a high proportion had the same ribotypes, the Taiwan23F-15 and Taiwan19F-14 isolates, suggesting the circulation of a Taiwanese epidemic strain. In Taiwan, S. pneumoniae isolates should be tested for their resistance profile for children < or = 18 years old, as these are more likely to harbor high-level resistance. Control of pneumococcal infection with the 7-valent-conjugated vaccine should also be considered because it is estimated that it would cover nearly 90% of the serotypes among pediatric invasive disease.",

The 10-valent vaccine was introduced into the National Vaccination Programme in September 2010.\\n\\nMETHODS: We examined the antimicrobial resistance and serotype distribution of the invasive pneumococci (n=4,194) that had been isolated in Finland during 2007-2011. The penicillin-resistant (PEN R) (\u22654 mg/L) isolates (n=12) were genotyped by MLST.\\n\\nRESULTS: Serotype 14 was consistently the most prominent serotype, covering 18.0-20.1% of all the isolates. The proportion of serotypes 3, 19A, and 22F increased significantly, while that of 6B and the PCV10 vaccine serotypes combined decreased. PEN nonsusceptibility (\u22650.12 mg/L) increased, ranging from 14.4% to 23.2% by year, and was the highest (28.5%) among the 0-2 year olds. The PEN and/or erythromycin (ERY) nonsusceptibility of several vaccine serotypes (4, 6B, 14, and 19F) increased significantly over the study period. The ERY nonsusceptibility was 26.6%. There was limited diversity among the PEN R isolates; all were a part of serotype 19F, 19A, or 14, and two globally disseminated genetic lineages carrying one or both pilus-encoding islets.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: High and/or increasing nonsusceptibility rates underline the importance of monitoring the serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of pneumococci, especially after large-scale vaccination.",

This ciprofloxacin challenge selected variants with ciprofloxacin MIC levels up to 32 mg/L. Repeated experiments under identical conditions resulted in different responses in MIC levels and alterations in the QRDR of gyrA. A characteristic outcome to ciprofloxacin challenges was the appearance of double peaks in the sequencing chromatograms of QRDR. This finding suggested the coexistence of subpopulations possessing Thr86 --> Ile and/or Asp90 --> Asn mutations alongside the unmutated parent population. In some cases, bacterial variants expressing ciprofloxacin-resistant phenotypes possessed no mutations in their QRDR. These variants were prone to regain susceptibility to ciprofloxacin rapidly after the removal of the selection pressure, whereas the QRDR-mutated variants persisted over several subcultivations in a medium without ciprofloxacin. In conclusion, a low ciprofloxacin concentration of 0.125 mg/L selects a variety of QRDR mutations and also a QRDR-independent resistance mechanism, which may coexist with each other in a C. jejuni population. Persistent ciprofloxacin challenge selects Thr86 --> Ile and/or Asp90 --> Asn mutants.",

        "abstract": "A study was designed to characterize three carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from pediatric patients in China. Molecular characterization was done using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing for blaVIM, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaKPC, blaCTX-Ms, blaOXAs, blaTEMs, and blaSHV; plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants; aminoglycoside resistance determinants; multilocus sequencing typing; plasmid replicon typing; addiction; and virulence factors. Kp32 belonged to the newly described sequence type 1137, were positive for aac(6')-Ib-suzhou, qnrA1, qnrB4, qnrS1, aac(6')-Ib, rmtB, armA, blaSHV-12, blaCTX-M-15, blaKPC-2, and blaIMP-4; contained IncA/C plasmids that tested positive for K1 capsular antigens, the ccdAB (coupled cell division locus) addiction system and the wabG, ureA, rmpA, magA, allS, fimH, and the aerobactin virulence factors. However, the others belonged to clone ST11, and were positive for aac(6')-Ib-cr, qnrB4, blaCTX-M-14, blaSHV-11, aac(6')-Ib, rmtB, and blaKPC-2; contained IncFIA plasmids that tested positive for K2 capsular antigens, the vagCD addiction system and the uge, wabG, ureA, kfuBC, rpmA, and fimH virulence factors. ST1137 had more virulence factors than the comparative strains ST11. The blaKPC-2 gene was located on the IncFIA and IncA/C replicon groups of plasmids. An analysis of the genetic environment of blaKPC-2 gene has demonstrated that the blaKPC-2 gene was always associated with one of the Tn4401 isoforms (a or b). Our study suggested that K. pneumoniae carbapenemases being found in virulent K. pneumoniae should be emphasized, as this will eventually become a global health threat.",

We assessed whether the antibiotic resistance varies according to virulence factors of the bacteria as well as to the age and gender of individuals infected in two anatomic sites.\\n\\nMETHODS: H. pylori strains were isolated from an antral and corpus biopsy from 90 patients with gastric ambulatory who had not received any previous therapy. Susceptibility to metronidazole and clarithromycin was assessed by E-test, and vacA and cagA genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction.\\n\\nRESULTS: Dual resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin was 3.3% in antrum and 4.4% in the corpus; heteroresistance was 19% and 5.5% for metronidazole and clarithromycin, respectively. Clarithromycin resistance significantly increased with age. Women showed a twofold increased risk for metronidazole-resistant strains in antrum (odds ratio\u2009=\u20092.85, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 7.42). Virulence factors were not associated with antimicrobial resistance.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Prevalence of resistance to clarithromycin may be increasing in this country. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests from different biopsy sites deserve attention.",

E. coli isolates (n\u2009=\u200935) from seven different animal sources were selected and tested for susceptibility to 15 antimicrobials; pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine genetic relationships among the E. coli isolates. Plasmid types based on their incompatibility (Inc) replicon types were determined, and linkage disequilibrium analysis was performed for antimicrobial resistance profiles, replicon types, and animal source. A high degree of genotypic diversity was observed: 34 different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types among the 35 isolates examined. Twelve different plasmid Inc types were detected, and all isolates carried at least one replicon type. IncF (n\u2009=\u200925; 71.4%) and IncFIB (n\u2009=\u200919; 54.3%) were the most common replicon types identified. Chloramphenicol resistance was significantly linked with four Inc types (A/C, FIIA, F, and Y), and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was linked with three Inc types (B/O, P and Y). Resistance to any other antimicrobial was linked to two or fewer replicon types. The isolate source was linked with resistance to seven antimicrobials and IncI1. We conclude that commensal E. coli from animal sources are highly variable genotypically and are reservoirs of a diverse array of plasmids carrying antimicrobial resistance.",

To explore the rate of contamination mediated by Escherichia coli, 150 fecal samples from the brown-headed gull (Chroicocephalus brunnicephalus) and 8 water samples from the Bay of Bengal area were collected, cultured, and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Special attention was paid to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates, which were further characterized genetically. Antibiotic resistance was found in 42.3% (36/85) of the E. coli isolates and multidrug resistance in 11.8%. Isolates from the area with a higher human activity were more resistant than those from an area with a lower level of activity. Most frequent was resistance to ampicillin (29.4%), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (24.7%) and quinolones (22.4%). Carriage of ESBL-producing E. coli was relatively high (17.3%) in the gulls, whereas no ESBL producers were found in the water. All ESBL-producing E. coli isolates, but one, carried bla(CTX-M-15) or bla(CTX-M-15)-like genes. A bla(CTX-M-14)-like enzyme was found as an exception. Gulls from two different colonies shared E. coli clones and harbored the clinically relevant sequence types ST10, ST48, and ST131. The high frequency of antibiotic resistance and ESBL production among E. coli isolates from gulls indicates that the environmental contamination of antibiotic resistance has already gone far on the coastlines of the Bay of Bengal. Considering the limited control over the antibiotic consumption and waste from human activities in Bangladesh, there is no easy solution in sight.",

Here we show that interference with cell wall recycling in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains results in four- to eight-fold increased susceptibility to the antibiotic fosfomycin, pushing the minimal inhibitory concentration for strains PA14 and PA01 to therapeutically appropriate values of 2-4 and 8-16\u2009mg/L, respectively. A newly discovered metabolic pathway that connects cell wall recycling with peptidoglycan de novo biosynthesis is responsible for the high intrinsic resistance of P. aeruginosa to fosfomycin. The pathway comprises an anomeric cell wall amino sugar kinase (AmgK) and an uridylyl transferase (MurU), which together convert N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) through MurNAc \u03b1-1-phosphate to uridine diphosphate (UDP)-MurNAc, thereby bypassing the fosfomycin-sensitive de novo synthesis of UDP-MurNAc. Thus, inhibition of peptidoglycan recycling can be applied as a new strategy for the combinatory therapy against multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa strains.",

        "abstract": "A panel of 29 multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from seven hospitals as part of a country-wide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Bulgarian hospitals was studied. Molecular typing through multiple-locus variable number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA6) yielded 23 different profiles. Phenotypic and genotypic tests for the detection of acquired carbapenemases yielded negative results in all cases. In contrast, 76% of the isolates produced other acquired \u03b2-lactamases, including extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs). Namely, 6 of the isolates (21%) produced a VEB-1 ESBL; 14 (48%) produced an OXA-10-type enzyme (7 OXA-10 and 7 OXA-10 ESBL variants, including 2 OXA-17 [A218G], 2 OXA-74 [C197T, A218G], and 3 OXA-142 [A218G, G470A]); 8 (28%) an OXA-2-type enzyme (all OXA-2); and 1 (3%) a PSE-1 carbenicillinase. Further analysis through multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that the six VEB-1-producing strains, recovered from four hospitals, belonged to ST111 or ST244 international high-risk clones. Additionally, nearly all of the isolates (97%) lacked OprD production, explaining carbapenem resistance. Overexpression of AmpC was documented in 5 (17%) of the isolates, including most of the MDR isolates not producing any acquired \u03b2-lactamase. Particularly noteworthy was the very high prevalence of MexXY-OprM overexpression, documented in 72% of the isolates, whereas the prevalence of MexAB-OprM overexpression was lower (21%). In summary, while the production of metallo-\u03b2-lactamases is uncommon among P. aeruginosa isolates from Bulgarian hospitals, MDR profiles frequently result from the production of ESBLs combined with the lack of production of the carbapenem porin OprD and the overexpression of the MexXY-OprM efflux pump.",

The study was conducted on 80 E. coli isolates from different types of infections collected between 2009 and 2012. Six (5%) isolates were not susceptible to ciprofloxacin, 16% to ofloxacin, and 6.2% to levofloxacin. Among the 80 isolates, 27.5% carried at least one PMQR determinant (n=22). qnrB was found in 8.8% of isolates (7/80), and qnrS was found in 2.5% (2/80). No isolates carrying qnrA, qnrD, qnrC, qepA, or oqxAB were found. The prevalence of aac(6')-Ib-cr was 27.5%, and 54.5% of the isolates contained aac(6')-Ib-cr and blaCTX-M. qnr-positive strains were more likely to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) than qnr-negative strains, which may suggest an association between qnr and ESBLs (88.9% vs. 17%, p=0.0003). PMQR-positive isolates had significantly higher ciprofloxacin MIC50 values (28.8-fold higher when comparing the MIC50 values) than the PMQR-negative strains (0.23 vs. 0.008 mg/L), regardless of the presence of quinolone resistance-determining region mutations. Five of the nine isolates, for which conjugation was performed successfully, harbored plasmids that contained CTX-M together with qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr. Our data suggest that the number of qnr genes detected in E. coli from newborns may be related to the selection of qnr through antimicrobial exposure. Even if fluoroquinolones are not commonly used in the NICU, E. coli isolates may carry PMQR. The high prevalence of PMQR is of serious concern, as it may be horizontally transferred to other pathogenic bacteria.",

Penicillin resistance, when defined using the old Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint (>/=2 mug/ml), had an initial rise that started in 1996, peaked in 2000, declined until 2003, and rebounded through 2008 (15.6%, 23.2%, 15.4%, and 16.9%, respectively). Using the new Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute criteria and applying a breakpoint of >/=8 mug/ml to blood and bronchial isolates, resistance was unchanged (0.24% in 2003) but rose to 1.52% in 2008. Using the new meningitis criteria (>/=0.12 mug/ml), resistance prevalence was 34.8% in 2008, whereas it was 12.3% using the old criteria (>/=2 mug/ml) for cerebrospinal fluid isolates. The rise, fall, and subsequent rebound of penicillin resistance in the United States, presumably influenced by the introduction of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine, is clearly seen with the old definition, but only the rebound is seen when the new criteria are applied. In the postvaccine period, isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1 and 2 mug/ml decline, whereas those with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.12-0.5 increase, which may signal the loss of resistant vaccine serotypes and the acquisition of resistance by nonvaccine serotypes.",

No VRE isolates were detected in healthy human subjects. CC17 was the main clonal complex in clinical Enterococcus faecium isolates but not in isolates from healthy human subjects. Novel vancomycin-resistance transposons were detected among VRE strains. This is the first report demonstrating insertion of tnpA and fosB genes in the vanRS-vanH intergenic region of Tn1546 leading to coresistance to vancomycin and fosfomycin. The four plasmid replicon types (pRUM, pRE25, pEF418, and pB82) were more common in VRE isolates, suggesting their association with vancomycin resistance and nosocomial transmission. The prevalence rate of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-related Inc18-like plasmid, pIP501, in VRE was 21.3%. The prevalence of the esp gene among VRE isolates was high (76.6%). In several VRE strains, the esp and hyl genes were cotransferred with the vanA gene by conjugation. Although the frequency of VRE is low in Chinese hospitals, its association with virulence determinants, the vancomycin-resistance transposon with other resistance gene insertions or plasmids may lead to multidrug resistance and the evolution of pathogenic VRE.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown a difference in the genotype of resistant bacteria following passage in animals compared to those passaged in vitro. This suggests that organisms rapidly adapt to their environment of growth. We sought to investigate whether this phenomenon occurred in human infection and whether changes could be detected in the fitness (growth velocity) of isolates transmitted between human hosts. Isogenic strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were obtained from a well-documented hospital outbreak. The subjects included those who were HIV seropositive and immunocompromised. The relative fitness of each sample was measured using growth competition in vitro. The results confirmed that our method of measuring fitness was not influenced by the storage conditions of the isolates, and demonstrated that the fitness of genetically similar isolates obtained from different patients in the outbreak differed significantly, as reflected in the growth velocity of the strains. This study provides the first evidence that multiple drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains adapt to the environment of their human host.",

A real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer PCR assay using a melting curve analysis was developed to identify these two point mutations and the wild-type genotype in thermophilic Campylobacter species such as C. coli, C. jejuni, and C. lari. Concerning these species, 141 strains were tested and a result obtained in 140 (99.3%). A single genotype was detected in 133 cases and two genotypes in seven cases. There was an agreement with the phenotypic methods except for one C. coli strain that was not amplified during the PCR assay. The A2075G mutation was mainly found among the 92 resistant strains tested (95.6%) and the A2074C mutation only twice (2.2%). One C. jejuni strain (1.1%) harbored both mutations on the same 23S rDNA copy. When compared to the phenotypic tests, the new real-time PCR assay was able to detect the correct genotype, in all cases except one (1.1%). This assay is more sensitive and more rapid than other PCR assays, the entire procedure taking less than 2 hr.",

A total of 138 E. coli and 86 Salmonella isolates with known beta-lactamase genes were tested for susceptibility toward cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime, cefquinome, ceftazidime, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, and cefuroxime using minimum inhibitory concentration determinations and disc diffusion. The collection consisted of 84 ampicillin-susceptible, 57 ampicillin-resistant but cephalosporin-susceptible, 56 ESBL isolates and 19 isolates with plasmidic AmpC, as well as 10 ampC hyper-producing E. coli. The minimum inhibitory concentration distributions and zone inhibitions varied with the tested compound. Ampicillin-resistant isolates showed reduced susceptibility to the cephalosporins compared to ampicillin-susceptible isolates. Cefoperazone, cefquinome, and cefuroxime were not useful in detecting isolates with ESBL or plasmidic AmpC. The best substances for detection were cefotaxime, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone, whereas ceftazidime and ceftiofur were not as efficient. Ceftriaxone may be the recommended substance for monitoring because of some ability in separating ampC hyper-producing E. coli from ESBL and plasmidic AmpC isolates.",

As such, it is of utmost importance to optimize the sampling strategy for the determination of herd-specific antimicrobial resistance profiles. However, the multitude of prevalences measured at the same time as well as the presence of variation both at the level of the animal and the bacterial population of concern make it impossible to use conventional sample size determination methods. In this article, the use of bootstrapping techniques for sample size determination was explored. In particular, one-stage and two-stage bootstrap samplings were used to determine the optimal number of animals and the optimal number of isolates within one animal. Results show that focus should be on the number of animals sampled rather than on the number of isolates tested within one animal.",

        "abstract": "Resistance to ciprofloxacin in Escherichia coli from urinary tract infections (UTI) in Denmark is increasing parallel to increased use of fluoroquinolones both in Denmark and in other European countries. The objective was to investigate the occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance mechanisms, phenotypic coresistance, and if ciprofloxacin resistance was caused by clonal spread or to individual mutational events in a collection of consecutively obtained E. coli submitted to a clinical microbiology department at a Danish hospital. One hundred four UTI-related E. coli resistant toward nalidixic acid by disc diffusion were typed by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) with XbaI. One isolate representing each PFGE type and only one patient (n = 77) were investigated for point mutations in sequenced PCR amplicons of the four topoisomerase genes; qnr genes by use of PCR; aac(6')-Ib-cr by BtsCI restriction of PCR products; and efflux using efflux pump inhibitors in a broth dilution assay. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for 21 antibacterial agents, including ciprofloxacin. Of the 77 isolates, the majority were resistant to ciprofloxacin (91%) and multiresistant (resistant to \u2265 3 antimicrobial classes, 83%). Ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates showed at least one target mutation. A significant, positive correlation was found regarding MIC of ciprofloxacin and the number of target mutations. Efflux was found as a resistance mechanism in 77% of isolates tested (n = 60). The aac(6')-Ib-cr gene was detected on plasmids from five isolates showing ciprofloxacin MICs >512 mg/L. No overall clonal relationship among isolates was found according to PFGE. Target modification is the dominating fluoroquinolone resistance mechanism often found in combination with efflux and sometimes aac(6')-Ib-cr. In Denmark, increasing ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli is mainly due to mutational events and not to spread of clones.",

Ten antimicrobial agents were tested using broth microdilution and disk diffusion. Similar results were determined for six antimicrobials. Very major errors (false-susceptible by disk diffusion test) were detected for ampicillin (at a rate of 1.8%). Major errors (false-resistant by disk diffusion test) were found for streptomycin (0.9%) and sulfamethoxazole (1.8%). Minor errors (intermediate susceptible by disk diffusion and resistant or susceptible by microdilution) were obtained for ampicillin (2.7%) and sulfamethoxazole (13.6%). All Y. enterocolitica were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. Resistances to three classes of antimicrobial agents were obtained by 3% of the strains included in the study. A slightly higher frequency of multiresistance was obtained by disk diffusion (3%) compared with broth microdilution (1%). Resistance to streptomycin was found frequently (13%); in contrast, resistance to tetracycline was rare (1%). The disk diffusion test produced unacceptably high rates of very major errors for ampicillin and a high frequency of minor errors for sulfamethoxazole. Susceptibility tests should thus be carried out by the more reliable method of microdilution. Most of the antimicrobials that can be used for therapy were very effective when tested against Y. enterocolitica. In order to identify changes in susceptibilities as early as possible, antimicrobial resistance in Y. enterocolitica should be regularly surveyed.",

        "abstract": "The background of quinolone resistance was characterized in ciprofloxacin-resistant commensal Escherichia coli selected out of 3,551 isolates from slaughtered animals in Poland between 2009 and 2012. Plasmid-mediated determinants were suspected in 6.2% of the study group, ranging from 1.1% in cattle to 9.7% in turkeys. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing identified up to four quinolone resistance-determining substitutions in gyrA (Ser83, Asp87) and parC (Ala56, Ser80). Plasmid-mediated mechanisms were identified as qnrS1 (or qnrS3, n=70, including six isolates with chromosomal mutations), qnrB19 (or qnrB10, n=19), and qnrB17 (n=1). All tested isolates were negative for qnrA, qnrC, qnrD, qepA, and aac(6')-Ib-cr. Still, there were several E. coli suspected for both plasmid- and chromosome-mediated resistance with unrevealed genetic background of the phenomenon. Since all tested isolates showed diverse XbaI-PFGE profiles, chromosome-encoded quinolone resistance does not result from the spread of a single resistant clone, however, it is rather due to antimicrobial pressure leading to the selection of random gyr and par mutants. It also favors the selection and spread of plasmids carrying predominant qnr genes, since the same determinants were found in Salmonella, isolated from similar sources. The identification of carrier plasmids and mitigation of their spread might be essential for sustainable quinolone usage in animal husbandry and efficient protection of human health.",

        "abstract": "Pneumococcal macrolide resistance is usually expressed as one of two phenotypes: the M phenotype conferred by the mef gene or the MLSB phenotype caused by modification of ribosomal targets, most commonly mediated by an erm methylase. Target-site modification leading to antibiotic resistance can also occur due to sequence mutations within the 23S rRNA or the L4 and L22 riboproteins. We screened 4,535 invasive isolates resistant to erythromycin and 18 invasive isolates nonsusceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D) to deduce the potential mechanisms involved. Of 4,535 erythromycin-resistant isolates, 66.2% were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive for mef alone, 17.8% for ermB alone, and 15.1% for both mef and ermB. Thirty-seven isolates (0.9%) were PCR negative for both determinants. Of these, 3 were positive for ermA (subclass ermTR) and 25 had chromosomal mutations. No chromosomal mutations (in 23S rRNA, rplD, or rplV) nor any of the macrolides/lincosamides/streptogramin (MLS) resistance genes screened for (ermT, ermA, cfr, lsaC, and vgaA) were found in the remaining nine isolates. Of 18 Q-D nonsusceptible isolates, 14 had chromosomal mutations and one carried both mef and ermB; no chromosomal mutations or other resistance genes were found in 3 isolates. Overall, we found 28 mutations, 13 of which have not been previously described in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The role of these mutations remains to be confirmed by transformation assays.",

In this study, 370 erythromycin-resistant (MIC, > or = 1 microg/mL) Italian isolates of this species obtained in 1997-1998 from throat swabs from symptomatic patients were typed by analyzing SmaI macrorestriction fragment patterns by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Among the typable isolates (n = 341; the genomic DNA of the remaining 29 isolates was not restricted by SmaI), 48 distinct PFGE types were recognized, of which 31 were recorded in only one isolate (one-strain types). Fifty-two percent of typable isolates fell into three type clusters and 75% into six, suggesting that erythromycin-resistant group A streptococci circulating in Italy are polyclonal, but the majority of them probably derives from the spread of a limited number of clones. In parallel experiments, the 370 test strains were characterized for the macrolide resistance phenotype: 80 were assigned to phenotype cMLS, 89 to phenotype iMLS-A, 33 to phenotype iMLS-B, 11 to phenotype iMLS-C, and 157 to phenotype M. There was a close correlation between these phenotypic data and the genotypic results of PFGE analysis, the vast majority of the isolates assigned to individual PFGE classes belonging usually to a single phenotype of macrolide resistance. All of the 29 untypable isolates belonged to the M phenotype. Further correlations were observed with tetracycline resistance.",

Isolates were from U.S. slaughter (n=12), retail (9), and humans (9), and Canadian slaughter (9), retail (9), and humans (8; total n=56). These isolates were assayed by microarray for antimicrobial resistance and MDR plasmid genes. Genes detected encoded resistance to aminoglycosides (alleles of aac, aad, aph, strA/B); beta-lactams (bla(TEM), bla(CMY), bla(PSE-1)); chloramphenicol (cat, flo, cmlA); sulfamethoxazole (sulI); tetracycline (tet(A, B, C, D) and tetR); and trimethoprim (dfrA). Hybridization with IncA/C plasmid gene probes indicated that 27/56 isolates carried one of these plasmids; however, they differed in several variable regions. Cluster analysis based on genes detected separated most of the isolates into two groups, one with IncA/C plasmids and one without IncA/C plasmids. Other plasmid replicons were detected in all but one isolate, and included I1 (25/56), N (23/56), and FIB (10/56). The presence of different mobile elements along with similar resistance genes suggest that these genetic elements may acquire similar resistance cassettes, and serve as multiple sources for MDR in Salmonella from food animals, retail meats, and human infections.",

        "abstract": "The RND-family efflux pump gene bmeB5 was previously shown to be overexpressed in metronidazole-resistant laboratory mutants of Bacteroides fragilis. In the present study, we characterized the bmeABC5 genes and an upstream putative TetR-family regulator gene (bmeR5). bmeR5 (645 bp) was located 51 bp upstream of bmeA5 and encoded a 24.9-kDa protein. Deletant strains lacking bmeB5 or bmeR5 were constructed from a wild-type B. fragilis strain ADB77. Strain antimicrobial susceptibility was determined and gene expression was quantified. bmeR5 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli using a 6x-His tag system; BmeR5-His6 was isolated from inclusion bodies and its binding to bmeABC5 promoter regions was determined. BmeR5-His6 bound specifically to the bmeR5-bmeC5 intergenic region (IT1). Deletion of bmeR5 (ADB77DeltabmeR5) resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in expression of bmeA5, bmeB5, and bmeC5, and > two-fold increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin, cefoxitin, cefoperazone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, metronidazole, ethidium bromide, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). MICs were reduced by the efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP). The MICs of ampicillin, cefoperazone, metronidazole, and SDS were reduced by approximately two-fold in ADB77DeltabmeB5. A multidrug (metronidazole)-resistant, nim-negative B. fragilis clinical isolate overexpressed bmeABC5 genes, had a G-->T point mutation in IT1, and significantly reduced binding to BmeR5-His6. These data demonstrate that BmeR5 is a local repressor of bmeABC5 expression and that mutations in IT1 can lead to a derepression and resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents, including metronidazole.",

        "abstract": "Clonal distribution of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in hospitals may differ according to the geographic location and time period. Knowledge of MRSA clonal epidemiology in hospital settings involves much more than the study of healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) clones. In recent years, investigators have documented the introduction of both community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) and livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) clones, the emergence of clones carrying Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) XI, and the genetic diversity among sporadic MRSA isolates. The allocation of certain antibiotypes to dominant MRSA clones in an institution allows their use as phenotypic markers for a preliminary search for new clones, early detection of clonal shift, and as a guide for better empirical therapy, infection control, and treatment within a particular institution. For these reasons, we identified 938 strains detected in a System of Universal Active Surveillance of MRSA in clinical samples during the period 2009-2010, obtaining the clonal distribution of MRSA at the Hospital Universitario de Canarias (Tenerife, Spain) and the relationship between antimicrobial susceptibility and three major clones present. The antibiotypes that best defined the ST5-MRSA-IV (Pediatric) clone showed resistance to tobramycin and susceptibility to clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and linezolid, whereas the ST22-MRSA-IV clone (EMRSA-15) showed susceptibility to these antibiotics, and finally, the ST36-MRSA-II clone (EMRSA-16) was resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin, and tobramycin and susceptible to the remaining antimicrobials. Similar observations would allow the early detection of changes in clonal epidemiology by analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates within a single institution.",

        "abstract": "The three chromosomally located clustered genes vanC1, vanXYc, and vanT confer intrinsic resistance to vancomycin and are used for species identification of Enterococcus gallinarum. In this study, 28 strains belonging to the E. gallinarum/casseliflavus group isolated from cloacal swabs from laying hens were screened for the presence of vanC1. As confirmed by species-specific multiplex PCR, 11 vanC1-positive strains were identified as E. gallinarum. Surprisingly, one yellow pigmented strain, verified as E. casseliflavus by species-specific multiplex PCR, was also vanC1 positive; vanXYc and vanT were additionally detectable in this strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of vanC1, vanXYc, and vanT in E. casseliflavus. The minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin was 4 mg/L. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed that none of the clustered genes was expressed in this strain. Even if the genes seem not to be active, there is a certain risk that they will be transferred to other bacteria where they might be functionally expressed. Therefore, it may be advisable to expand the search for vanC1, vanXYc, and vanT from E. gallinarum to other (enterococcal) species. This study confirms that enterococci live up to their name as being reservoir bacteria and should therefore always be closely monitored.",

Samples of fresh rook feces were taken by cotton swabs at nine roosting places in eight European countries. Samples were transported to one laboratory and placed in buffered peptone water (BPW). The samples from BPW were enriched and subcultivated onto MacConkey agar (MCA) supplemented with ciprofloxacin (0.06\u2009mg/L) to isolate fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria. DNA was isolated from smears of bacterial colonies growing on MCA and tested by PCR for PMQR genes aac(6')-Ib, qepA, qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, qnrS, and oqxAB. All the PCR products were further analyzed by sequencing. Ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria were isolated from 37% (392 positive/1,073 examined) of samples. Frequencies of samples with ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates ranged significantly from 3% to 92% in different countries. The qnrS1 gene was found in 154 samples and qnrS2 in 2 samples. The gene aac(6')-Ib-cr was found in 16 samples. Thirteen samples were positive for qnrB genes in variants qnrB6 (one sample), qnrB18 (one), qnrB19 (one), qnrB29 (one), and qnrB49 (new variant) (one). Both the qnrD and oqxAB genes were detected in six samples. The genes qnrA, qnrC, and qepA were not found. Wintering omnivorous rooks in Europe were commonly colonized by bacteria supposedly Enterobacteriaceae with PMQR genes. Rooks may disseminate these epidemiologically important bacteria over long distances and pose a risk for environmental contamination.",

The isolates' susceptibility to a quaternary ammonium compound (didecyldimethylammoniumchloride, DDAC) and antibiotics was assessed by microdilution. Four E. faecalis strains were positive for qac-genes: qacA/B was found in one isolate from cattle and one isolate from human blood; smr (qacC+qacD) was detected in one isolate from human stool and in one isolate from cheese (\"Camembert\"). The sequences of the qacA/B-amplicons differed in two basepairs. DDAC had an elevated minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2.45-3.5 mg/L in one qacA/B-positive strain from human blood, whereas the other qac-gene carriers had wild-type MIC-values for DDAC (1.05 mg/L).

        "abstract": "Mediterranean herring gulls (Larus cachinnans) were investigated as a possible reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria and of cassette-borne resistance genes located in class 1 integrons. Two hundred and fourteen isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae were collected from cloacal swabs of 92 chicks captured in a natural reserve in the North East of Italy. They showed high percentages of resistance to ampicillin and streptomycin. High percentages of resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were found in Proteus and Citrobacter and to chloramphenicol in Proteus. Twenty-two (10%) isolates carried the intI1 gene. Molecular characterization of the integron variable regions showed a great diversity, with the presence of 11 different cassette arrays and of one integron without integrated cassettes. The dfrA1-aadA1a and aadB-aadA2 cassette arrays were the most frequently detected. Also the estX cassette, alone or in combination with other cassettes, was detected in many isolates. From this study it is concluded that the enteric flora of Mediterranean herring gulls may act as a reservoir of resistant bacteria and of resistance genes. Due to their feeding habits and their ability to fly over long distances, these free-living birds may facilitate the circulation of resistant strains between waste-handling facilities, crops, waters, and urban areas.",

Three of the five isolates of C. jejuni and the two isolates of C. coli had high-level resistance to nalidixic acid (MICs 128-256 microg/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MICs 32 microg/ml). A gyrA mutation was found in all these isolates leading to the following substitutions: Thr86-Ile in four cases and Asp90-Tyr for one C. coli strain. One isolate had high-level resistance to nalidixic acid (MIC 64 microg/ml) but low-level resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC 2 microg/ml) and also carried a gyrA mutation leading to a Thr86-Ala substitution. The last isolate of C. jejuni studied displayed an atypical resistance phenotype: It was resistant to high levels of ciprofloxacin (MIC 64 microg/ml) but remained fully susceptible to nalidixic acid (MIC 2 microg/ml). This phenotype was not explained by the presence of peculiar mutations in gyrA or gyrB. It carried a gyrA mutation leading to a Thr86-Ile substitution and was devoid of gyrB mutation. Despite numerous attempts with various degenerate oligonucleotide primers deduced from conserved regions of known parC genes, we were unable to amplify a corresponding sequence in C. jejuni or C. coli. First-step and second-step in vitro mutants, derived from reference strain C. coli ATCC 33559 with ciprofloxacin or moxifloxacin as selecting agents, were found to carry one and two mutations in gyrA, respectively.

A total of 142 Enterococcus faecalis, 74 Enterococcus faecium, and 23 Enterococcus spp. with different antibiotic susceptibility patterns were studied. A higher percentage of resistance for moxifloxacin, erythromycin, glycopeptides and high-level resistance (HLR) to gentamicin were observed in the FH group. Ampicillin- or linezolid-resistant isolates were not recovered in any of the groups. The tet(M) gene was found in 96% and in 85% of tetracycline-resistant isolates from HV and FH, respectively. HLR-kanamycin was mediated by aph(3')-IIIa, or aac(6')-aph(2\"), or both genes in all isolates from HV group and in 86% from FH group. The aac(6')-aph(2\") gene was found in all HLR-gentamicin isolates. Ninety-one percent of HV and 71% of FH erythromycin-resistant isolates harbored the erm(B) gene (erythromycin MIC range of 8-128 microg/ml), whereas erm(A), erm(C), or mef(A) genes were not detected. Coexistence of erm(B), aph(3')-IIIa, and tet(M) genes was observed in 17% of the isolates of both groups. The HLR-gentamicin isolates presented unrelated PFGE patterns while 2 out of 3 vanA E. faecium isolates showed an indistinguishable SmaI-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern. This study shows that despite 4 years of official banning of antibiotic growth promoters in animals, enterococci isolated from FH are more resistant than those from HV. This suggests the permanence of resistant clones or transferable resistance elements in farms and a possible exchange between food products and humans, or eventually the long-term permanence of certain clones in the FH intestinal tract.",

Overall, PMQR determinants were detected in 72 (60%) isolates (20 Escherichia coli, 32 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 20 Enterobacter cloacae). PMQR frequencies were as follows: qnr genes (25.8%), oqxAB (21.6%), and aac(6')-Ib-cr variant (19.2%). Four qnr alleles were identified as qnrB1 (83.8%), qnrB4 (6.4%), qnrB2 (3.2%), and qnrS1 (6.4%). qnr genes were mainly detected in E. cloacae (50%), aac(6')-Ib-cr in E. coli (47.5%), and oqxAB in K. pneumoniae (65%). Overall, blaCTX-M-15 (90.3%) was the most prevalent blaESBL type followed by blaSHV-12 (6.4%) and blaSHV-27 (2.7%). Rates of mutations in gyrA and parC genes were 75% for E. coli, 72.8% for K. pneumoniae, and 50% for E. cloacae. Isolates with mutations in their quinolone resistance-determining regions exhibited high fluoroquinolones resistance levels compared to those with wild ones. Genetic study of PMQR-harboring isolates revealed a great genomic diversity among each Enterobacteriaceae species. Our findings indicate the high prevalence of PMQR determinants among ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from our hospital and their diffusion in various unrelated CTX-M-15-producing clones.",

        "abstract": "The present study was conducted to identify risk factors for ciprofloxacin resistance in bloodstream infections due to extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-EK). ESBL production was determined in stored E. coli and K. pneumoniae blood isolates from January, 1998, to December, 2002, by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines and/or double-disk synergy test. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disk diffusion test method. A total of 133 patients with ESBL-EK bacteremia were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 80 (60.2%) patients experienced bacteremia due to strains resistant to ciprofloxacin. There were no significant differences in age, sex, and APACHE II score between the ciprofloxacin-resistant group (CIP-R) and-susceptible group (CIPS). The most common primary site of infection in CIP-R was pancreaticobiliary tract infection (46/80, 57.5%) and that in CIP-S was unknown primary site (23/53, 43.4%). Independent risk factors for ciprofloxacin resistance were: prior use of fluoroquinolones (OR, 5.53; 95% CI, 1.56-25.42, p = 0.032), indwelling urinary catheter (OR, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.27-10.67, p = 0.017), and invasive procedure within 72 hr prior to bacteremia (OR, 4.03; 95% CI, 1.44-11.25, p = 0.008). Our data suggest that strategies designed to reduce the ciprofloxacin resistance rate in ESBL-EK strains should focus on limiting the use of fluoroquinolones and minimizing invasive procedures, including insertion of a urinary catheter.",

Antibiotic resistance profile revealed that most of the strains have become multidrug-resistant strains. All the isolates are resistant to ampicillin and polymyxin B, 97% of the isolates are resistant to nalidixic acid, 90% to co-trimoxazole, 32.3% to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, 29% to doxycycline, 10% to gentamicin, whereas only 3% to chloramphenicol. Molecular characterization of virulence-associated genes by multiplex PCR revealed the presence of ace, ctxA, tcpA, toxR, and ompU as 93.5%, followed by ompW with 33.3%. The presence of zot was restricted to only one isolate and hlyA was not encountered in any of the strains. ERIC PCR produced more than 10 bands for each isolate and the dendrogram generated based on the cluster analysis showed the presence of 29 electrophoretic types among the 31 isolates. Isolates from different area or year of isolation are intermingled in all the clusters. With respect to biofilm formation, 24 isolates were found to be biofilm formers and eight of them produced strong biofilm. This study demonstrates the presence of critical virulence factors and antibiotic resistance in the diarrhea isolates, which signifies the importance of routine monitoring and proper treatment to prevent cholera outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: VEGF-targeted therapy is currently the first line treatment for patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but most patients either display primary (intrinsic) resistance or acquire drug resistance. In recent years multiple mechanisms of resistance to VEGF-targeted therapy emerged from preclinical research, but it is currently unknown to what extent these drug resistance modalities play a role in the clinic. Here we reviewed the current literature on biomarkers that predict treatment outcome in patients with ccRCC to gain insight in clinical drug resistance mechanisms. METHODS: A search syntax was compiled by combining different synonyms of \"biomarker\" AND \"renal\" AND \"cancer\". MEDLINE was accessed through PubMed, where this syntax was entered and used to search titles and abstracts of publications. Articles were selected based on three criteria: (1) description of patients with clear cell RCC, (2) treatment with VEGF targeted therapy and (3) discussion of biomarkers that were studied for potential association with treatment response. RESULTS: The literature search was performed on March 4th 2014 and yielded 1882 articles. After carefully reading the titles and abstracts based on the three previously mentioned criteria, 103 publications were evaluated. Backward citation screening was performed on all eligible studies and revealed another 24 articles. This search revealed that (1) High glucose uptake and low contrast enhancement on PET- and CT-imaging before start of treatment may correlate with poor response to therapy, (2) Low dose intensity due to treatment intolerance is related to shorter progression free survival. (3) Acquired resistance appears to be associated with rebound vascularization based on both longitudinal monitoring of contrast enhancement by CT and blood vessel counts in tumor tissue, and (4) Based on plasma cytokine and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) studies, interleukin-8, VEGFR-3, FGFR2 and HGF/MET emerged as potential clinical markers for chemoresistance. CONCLUSION: Low dose intensity, specific tumor-imaging techniques and potential biological biomarkers may be predictive for response to VEGF-targeted therapy in ccRCC. Some of these plausible biomarkers may also provide more insight into the underlying mechanisms of resistance such as altered glucose metabolism and rapid rebound vascularization.",

One hundred and seventy-two strains of E. coli were isolated. Their resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, and enrofloxacin was studied by plate dilution. In resistant strains the presence of integrons and resistance genes was assessed by PCR. In the variable region, genes aadA1, dfrA1, and qnr were analyzed. Also, presence of tetA, tetB, and sul1 was assessed. Transference of these genes and integrons in vitro was evaluated by conjugation assays, using E. coli J53 Az(r) as recipient strain. Seventy-eight percent and 83% of the poultry and swine strains, respectively, were resistant to at least one of the studied antimicrobials. Of the isolated strains 91 presented integrons. Resistance genes detected within the integrons were aadA1, dfrA1, and sat1. Gene qnr was not detected. Genes tet and sul1 were identified in 105 and 53 strains, respectively. Seven strains transferred their resistance determinants by conjugation. The results verify the high percentage of antibiotic resistance in the E. coli strains isolated, and these represent a reservoir of resistance genes and integrons.",

In this study the presence of the blaCARB-2 (ampicillin), cmlA (chloramphenicol), aadA2 (streptomycin/spectinomycin), sul1 (sulphonamide), and tetG (tetracycline) resistance genes in isolates of one such phage type, U302, have been determined. In addition blaTEM primers have been used for the detection of TEM-type beta-lactamases. Isolates have also been characterized by plasmid profile and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Thirty-three of 39 isolates were positive for blaCARB-2, cmlA, aadA2, sul1 and tetG, four for blaTEM, aadA2 and sul1, one for aadA2 and sul1, and one for blaTEM only. blaTEM-mediated ampicillin resistance was transferred to Escherichia coli K12 from three isolates along with other resistance markers, including resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, spectinomycin, sulphonamides, and tetracyclines. Strains carried up to 6 plasmids and 34 plasmid profiles were identified. Although the majority of strains (33/39) produced a PFGE profile identical to that predominant in MR DT104, six different patterns were generated demonstrating the presence of various clones within MR U302. The results show that the majority of the MR U302 strains studied possessed the same antibiotic resistance genes as MR DT104. However, isolates with distinctive PFGE patterns can have different mechanisms of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamides, and tetracyclines. Such resistance genes may be borne on transmissible plasmids.; ",

        "abstract": "Cross-resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B (MLSB) antibiotics is mainly mediated by the erm (erythromycin ribosome methylation) genes that encode 23S rRNA methylases in enterococi, and various mechanisms are involved in the streptogramin B resistance. Prevalence of MLSB resistance and its genetic mechanisms were analyzed for a total of 159 strains of Enterococcus faecium isolated from clinical specimens in a university hospital in Japan from 1997 to 2006. Resistance to erythromycin (EM) and clindamycin was detected in 88.1% and 89.9% of all the strains examined, respectively, and expression of resistance was totally constitutive. Although none of the strain was resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), 28 strains (17.6%) showed intermediate resistance to Q/D (MIC: 2 \u03bcg/ml). The erm(B) gene was detected in 139 strains (87.4%), and msrC was found in all the strains examined, whereas no other known MLSB resistance genes were identified. The erm(B) regulator region (RR) containing a coding region of the leader peptide was classified into 13 genetic variations (L1-L3, M, S1-S7, D, and R genotypes) in 56 strains. However, no relatedness was identified between the erm(B) RR genotype and EM resistance, or reduced susceptibility to Q/D, although most of Q/D-intermediate strains were assigned to the L1, L2, and S1 genotypes. Q/D-intermediate strains were classified into five multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) types, including four types of clonal complex (CC)-C1, five sequence types (STs), including four STs of CC-17, and several resistance gene/virulence factor profiles. The present study revealed the occurrence of Q/D-intermediate E. faecium, which are composed of heterogeneous strains in Japan, and more genetic diversity in the erm(B) RRs than those reported previously.",

        "abstract": "Plasmid-mediated resistance to tetracycline in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (TRNG) isolates is caused by the acquisition of a 25.2-MDa conjugative, tetM-containing plasmid (TetM plasmid). The presence of the TetM plasmid is the leading cause of gonococcal resistance to tetracycline in most countries. Between 1986 and 1997, 6,306 TRNG isolates were isolated in different Canadian provincial laboratories and subsequently submitted to the national laboratory for further strain characterization. Because nonculture-based identification of N. gonorrhoeae was more widely used after 1995, this snapshot of the molecular epidemiology of TRNG in Canada, which is only possible if bacteria are cultured, represents a comprehensive data baseline that may no longer be achievable. Temporal trends indicate that TRNG isolations peaked in 1994 (18.9% of isolates tested). Antimicrobial susceptibilities (MIC) to tetracycline and penicillin were determined for 4,064 TRNG isolated between 1986 and 1994. The MICs of TRNG isolates ranged from 16 microg/ml to 32 microg/ml of tetracycline, although one isolate had an MIC of 8 microg/ml and the MICs of four isolates were 2 microg/ml. Penicillinase-producing TRNG (i.e., PP/TRNG) comprised 34.1% of all TRNG (n = 1,386) and 52 TRNG isolates exhibited chromosomal resistance to penicillin. Most of the PP/TRNG (94.1%) carried Africa type (3.2 MDa) beta-lactamase-producing plasmids; only 76 (5.5%) PP/TRNG carried Asia type (4.4 MDa) penicillinase-producing plasmids and three isolates carried Toronto type (3.05 MDa) plasmids. TRNG isolates were also retrospectively typed by auxotype (A), serovar (S), and plasmid (P) content analysis. Eleven auxotype/serovar (A/S) groups comprised the majority (93%) of 4,064 typed TRNG isolates with A/S classes NR/IB-2, NR/IB-3, and NR/IB-1 accounting for 75.1% of the strains characterized. Classification of 670 TRNG for tetM type demonstrated that the Dutch (n = 531) type TetM plasmids predominated over the American (n = 139) type TetM plasmids.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The impact of the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine over antimicrobial resistance has not been well established. The present study models the changes in resistance over time for all major classes of antibiotics. METHODS: Susceptibility data on a total of 129,652 isolates from The Surveillance Network surveillance database during the period 1996-2007 were available for analysis, as well as age, specimen source, inpatient or outpatient location, and census region. Cubic splines in a logistic regression mixed model were used to model changes of the resistance rates over time in the United States, taking into account risk factors, so that separate adjusted curves were modeled for each antibiotic. RESULTS: Yearly resistance prevalence to most antibiotics had been increasing in the period 1996-2001. Adjusted prevalence rates in a multivariate model declined in the period 2001-2004 for penicillin, erythromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ceftriaxone, and multidrug. These same antibiotics showed a significant rebound for the period 2004-2007, with the largest overall increase for erythromycin, followed by amoxicillin/clavulanate, tetracycline, multidrug, penicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ceftriaxone. Changes in both decline and rebound were more marked for children <5 years old and for otitis media isolates. CONCLUSION: The indirect effect of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction on yearly resistance prevalence for several antibacterials as well as for multidrug resistance is one of blunting of a prior sustained increase, with a significant but short-lived decrease in resistance rates, and a significant rebound in adjusted rates for the period 2004-2007.",

Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis were the major serotypes, which were found with similar frequencies covering 80% of the bacterial collection. Salmonella Typhimurium isolates frequently shared low susceptibility to antimicrobials of the penta-resistance phenotype (ACSSuT) and/or cephalosporin resistance. The ACSSuT profile was found closely linked to int1-associated gene cassettes, with major elements carrying DNA fragments of 1.0\u2009Kb (aadA2 gene) plus 1.2\u2009Kb (blaPSE-1 gene) or 2.0\u2009Kb (aadA1 and blaOXA-1 genes). Among these, ACSSuT and cephalosporin resistances were associated in Salmonella Typhimurium isolates expressing the blaOXA gene. \u03b2-lactamase activities were also detected from isolates carrying blaTEM, blaCMY, or blaSHV, although only the two last genes expressed extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases. The clonal analysis of S. enterica strains suggests that both horizontal and vertical transfer mechanisms are involved in the wide dissemination of their antimicrobial resistance.",

Among the 1,015 S. aureus isolates derived from clinical specimens of outpatients collected in 2009, methicillin resistance gene mecA was detected in 189 isolates (18.6%). The most frequent staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type in MRSA was II (83.1%), followed by IV (6.9%) and V (3.2%). MRSA with type II-SCCmec showed multiple drug resistance and harbored various toxin and virulence factor genes except for Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) gene. These isolates were mostly classified into sequence type 5 (ST5) (or other STs in CC5) and coagulase genotype II and were thus genetically similar to hospital-acquired MRSA, which have been predominating in Japan (New York/Japan clone). PVL gene was detected in three MRSA strains belonging to ST6 (two strains) and ST59 (one strain), having type IVa- and Vt-SCCmec, respectively, and also in two methicillin-susceptible S. aureus ST121 and ST188. The arcA gene within the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) was detected in the two PVL-negative ST5 MRSA strains, which had type IIa- or V-SCCmec. The PVL gene-positive ST6 and ST59 CA-MRSA strains were susceptible to more antimicrobials and had less virulence factor genes than the PVL-negative ST5 MRSA, including the ACME-arcA-positive strains. In the present study, ST6 was identified as a lineage of PVL-positive CA-MRSA, the ACME-arcA was first detected in ST5 MRSA with type V-SCCmec, and ST59 Taiwanese CA-MRSA strain was isolated in Hokkaido for the first time. These findings suggest a potential spread of these emerging CA-MRSA clones in Japan.",

Among Enteritidis, the number of genes detected was: animal isolates, mean = 4.6; human isolates, mean = 5.3. Resistance to streptomycin, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides was usually encoded by only one resistance gene in animal isolates, but human isolates often carried more than one gene encoding resistance to the same class of antimicrobial. Among Hadar, the number of genes detected was: animal isolates, mean = 2.0; human strains, mean = 2.6.

As with Enteritidis, human Hadar isolates often carried more than one gene encoding resistance to the same class of antimicrobial. Due to the complexity of routes of transmission of Salmonella spp. from food production animals to humans, full phenotypic and genotypic comparison of resistant isolates is critical in ascertaining the sources of resistant isolates.",

The present national surveillance study report analyzes a total of 16,756 strains of S. pneumoniae collected across France in 1999. The overall prevalence of S. pneumoniae with decreased susceptibility to penicillin was 44%, to amoxicillin 26%, and to cefotaxime 17%. The proportion of high-level resistant strains to penicillin (MIC > 1 mg/L), amoxicillin and cefotaxime (MIC > 2 mg/L) remained low: 12.3%, 1.8%, and 0.4% respectively. Prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was high: 53% to erythromycin, 41.7% to cotrimoxazole, 31.8% to tetracycline, and 24.6% to chloramphenicol. Prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae varied according to subject age and specimen source. It was higher in children (52.7%) than in adults (39.8%) and higher in strains isolated from middle ear fluid (63.6%) than from blood cultures (41.8%) in children. S. pneumoniae resistant to other antibiotics were more common in children than in adults, although figures showed geographical variations. Comparison with a previous study realized in 1997 in the same regions confirms a rising trend in the prevalence of resistant bacteria. Therefore, we conclude that prevalence of antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae in 1999 continued to rise in France, although strains with high-level resistance to penicillin remained stable.",

Tn5393e, made up of Tn5393 and a second transposon, Tn6023, was found in an IncHI2 plasmid, pSRC125, recovered from a multiply antibiotic-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolate of bovine origin. Tn6023 is made up of the aphA1b gene flanked by two inversely oriented copies of insertion sequence (IS) IS26 and is flanked by an 8\u2009bp duplication. It is related to several other transposons that carry aphA1b in fragments of differing length, also flanked by copies of IS26. Tn6023 is located in the tnpR gene of Tn5393, which lies upstream of the strA and strB genes, and the combined structure was designated Tn5393e. Although neither strA nor strB contain any mutations that would inactivate them, pSRC125 does not confer resistance to streptomycin, indicating that the strA and strB genes are not expressed. In Tn5393, strA and strB are transcribed from the tnpR promoter, and in Tn5393e neither this transcript nor the transcript from the aphA1b promoter in Tn6023 must reach strAB. Tn5393e was previously found in different locations in Corynebacteria, indicating that it can move and suggesting a wide distribution. The structures of several further variants of Tn5393 found in GenBank were analyzed and assigned variant designations Tn5393f-Tn5393i.",

In 2007, 23 ORPs analyzed the antibiotic susceptibility of 5,302 isolates of S. pneumoniae recovered in France from cerebrospinal fluid, blood, middle ear fluid, and pleural fluid, as well as from adult respiratory samples. The study showed that 38.2% of the strains were nonsusceptible to penicillin, 19.3% nonsusceptible to amoxicillin, and 10.5% nonsusceptible to cefotaxime. The percentage of pneumococcus nonsusceptible to penicillin varied according to both the sample and the age of the patient (child/adult): blood (27.8%/32.5%), cerebrospinal fluid (33.7%/34.6%), middle ear fluid (60.2%/27.5%), and pleural fluid (50.0%/31.0%). Between 2003 and 2007, the frequency of penicillin resistance in invasive pneumococcal disease gradually decreased from 46.4% to 29.0% in children and from 43.8% to 32.7% in adults. This decrease coincided with the introduction of a seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine into immunization programs and with a general reduction in levels of antibiotic consumption in France.",

The isolates were pansensitive (53.5%), resistant to one antimicrobial agent (10.5%), resistant to two antimicrobial agents (22.1%), resistant to three antimicrobial agents (10.8%), and to four antimicrobial agents (2.7%). Resistance to more than four antibiotics was observed in 0.5% of strains. The presence of ESBL was found in only one strain of S. enterica serovar Bovismorbificans. The CTX-M-1 type-producing strain was identified by isoelectric focusing and molecular analysis. Results were consistent with the presence of a pI 8.6 ESBL active on cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and aztreonam. Mating experiments showed that the CTX-M-1 determinant was transferable.

The collection included 59 high-level CIP-resistant isolates (MIC >or= 4) from human (n=51) and pig origin (n=8) and 65 low-level CIP-resistant isolates (MIC >or= 0.125) from human (n=34) and pig origin (n=31). Resistance by target modification was screened by PCR amplification and sequencing of the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE. QRDR mutations occurred in all except two isolates (98%). All high-level CIP-resistant E. coli had one or two mutations in gyrA in combination with mutations in parC or parE. Mutations in parC and parE were only found in combination with gyrA mutations, and no mutations were observed in gyrB. Efflux pump mechanisms were detected in 10 human (11.8%) and 29 porcine (74.4%) isolates by an efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) agar dilution assay. The aac(6')-Ib-cr gene mediating resistance by enzymatic modification was found in 12 high-level CIP-resistant human isolates. The qnrA and qnrS genes conferring quinolone resistance by target protection were detected in two human low-level CIP-resistant isolates that did not display NAL resistance. As expected, target mutation in QRDRs was the most prevalent mechanism of quinolone resistance. This mechanism was complemented by efflux mechanisms in most porcine isolates. Transferable resistance by target protection or enzymatic modification was less common (10%) and restricted to human isolates.",

Resistance or susceptibility was interpreted using a microbiological criterion and breakpoints recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), if available. The isolates were also screened by PCR for erm(B), lnu(A), lnu(B), mef(A/E), vat(D), vat(E), vga(A), vga(B), and vgb(A) genes. Acquired resistance to Q/D, virgM1, ery, tyl, and lin was detected in 34%, 96%, 46%, 46%, and 69% of the porcine strains, respectively.

Strains showing cross-resistance against macrolides and lincosamides almost always carried the erm(B) gene. This gene was present in 64% of the Q/D-resistant isolates. Only in two human and three broiler Q/D- and virgM1-resistant isolates, a combination of the erm(B) and vat(D) or vat(E) genes was found.

Primers and molecular beacon probes were designed for the lytA gene, 3 pbp genes, and the mefA/ermB genes. Targeted sequences of pbp1a, pbp2x, and pbp2b genes in susceptible strain R6 corresponded to those of penicillin G-nonsusceptible strains, including sites within or adjacent to conserved amino acid motifs. If amplification did not occur, the corresponding penicillin-binding protein (PBP) was considered to possess amino acid substitution(s) affecting minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of beta-lactam antibiotics. Real-time PCR required 90 min or less. Strains were assigned to six genotypic classes: Genotypic penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (gPSSP) with 3 normal genes (22.3%); genotypic penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (gPISP) (pbp2x) with an abnormal pbp2x gene (25.3%); gPISP (pbp2b) with an abnormal pbp2b gene (7.3%); gPISP (pbp1a+2x) with abnormal pbp1a+2x genes (11.3%); gPISP (pbp2x+2b) with abnormal pbp2x+2b genes (4.7%); or genotypic penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (gPRSP) with 3 abnormal PBP genes (29.0%). Sensitivity and specificity of real-time PCR compared with those of conventional PCR were high, 73.7-100% and 97.7-100%, respectively. As for relationships between genotype and beta-lactam MICs, 90% of MICs for every resistance class were distributed within three serial dilutions for almost all antibiotics. MICs of each beta-lactam antibiotic were estimated with high probability from genotypic patterns. In conclusion, determination of genotypic classes of S. pneumoniae using rapid real-time PCR is useful in selecting effective therapeutic agents for patients with pneumococcal infection.",

In the present study, we examined fitness parameters of a glycopeptide-susceptible Enterococcus faecium parent strain and its plasmid-mediated, VanA-resistant derivative before and after 1,000 generations in serial transfer broth cultures with or without antibiotic selection. With the exception of the vanA-containing plasmid, the strains were otherwise isogenic. The stability of the plasmid-encoded vanA resistance determinant was also investigated in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Competition experiments revealed that GRE with newly acquired VanA resistance had a 4% reduction in fitness relative to their susceptible parental counterpart. The relative difference in competitive fitness between resistant and susceptible strains was not significantly changed after 1,000 generations. Environmental adaptation was observed in all strains and exceeded the biological cost of resistance. Thus, the evolved VanA-resistant E. faecium populations out-numbered their unevolved ancestral susceptible E. faecium strain in mixed cultures, but remained less competitive than the evolved parent. The glycopeptide resistance determinant was similarly stably maintained during long-term colonization in gnotobiotic mice without antibiotic selection. In vivo vanA plasmid transfer was observed. The results suggest that environmental adaptation, in vivo gene transfer, and plasmid maintenance system(s) favor long-term VanA GRE persistence without antibiotic selection and compensate for the biological costs of possessing the resistance genes.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate, for the first time, the combinations of carbapenem resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a Chinese hospital. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of eight clonal types among the 15 ESBL producers. Multilocus sequence typing of two isolates harboured blaIMP-1 identified the clonal strain as ST325. All these genes were found either alone or simultaneously in the strains in the following five different arrangements:<blaOXA-10>; <blaOXA-10, blaIMP-1>; <blaPER-1, blaOXA-10>; <blaPER-1, blaPSE-1>; <blaOXA-10, blaTEM-1>. Regarding mutation-driven resistance, all, but four of the isolates had a relevant decrease of oprD expression. In addition, 73.3% of the isolates overexpressed mexB, 40% mexD, and 33.3% mexY. A specific combination of overexpressed mexB or mexY and alteration in loop L710 of OprD were significantly associated with meropenem resistance. In conclusion, combination of several mutation-driven mechanisms leading to OprD inactivation and overexpression of efflux systems was the main carbapenem resistance mechanism among the ESBL-producing P. aeruginosa isolates, but acquisition of a transferable resistance determinant such as metallo-\u03b2-lactamase could be problematic in clinical settings in China.",

Among these tests, the diffusion method using the oxacillin and cefoxitin disks on Mueller-Hinton agar with and without NaCl, the incubation at 35 degrees C or 30 degrees C for 24 or 48 hr, respectively, and the determination of oxacillin MICs by E-test were performed. We also examined the presence of the mecA gene by PCR and its product PBP 2a by the Slidex MRSA Detection test after induction by cefoxitin disk. All of the AS-MRSA strains (100%) were detected by the cefoxitin disk in all conditions and by the oxacillin disk on Mueller-Hinton agar with 2% of NaCl at 35 degrees C. Without NaCl, the sensitivity fell to 97.2% by oxacillin disk. The oxacillin MICs for these isolates ranged from 2 to 128 mg/L. The mecA gene determinant and its product PBP 2a were detected in all AS-MRSA strains. All KTR-MSSA strains were phenotypically methicillin-susceptible and oxacillin MICs were below or borderline of breakpoint (< or =2 mg/L). The mecA gene determinant and its product were detected in one strain. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was applied and revealed the presence of two major patterns A (36.9%) and B (46.2%) in AS-MRSA isolates and seven patterns in the KTR-MSSA strains.",

All calves were less than 6 months old. Susceptibilities of the Pasteurella and Mannheimia isolates to eight antimicrobials were determined using an agar dilution method. P. multocida (37.3%) and hemolytic Mannheimia organisms (M. haemolytica sensu lato) (6.3%) were the most frequently detected organisms. The overall prevalence of isolates resistant to at least one antimicrobial from the dairy, beef, and veal calves were 17.6% (6/34), 21.9% (14/64), and 71.9% (64/89), respectively. In isolates obtained on the veal calf herds, acquired resistance to ampicillin, oxytetracycline, potentiated sulfonamides, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and enrofloxacin was frequently present, and 32.6% of these isolates were resistant to more than two of the tested antimicrobials. Resistance to ceftiofur and florfenicol was not detected. A substantial within-herd variability of species diversity and resistance profiles among isolates belonging to the genera Pasteurella and Mannheimia was found among the isolates of the veal calf farms.",

        "abstract": "Here we describe the presence of two very similar but unusual variants of AmpC cephalosporinase in each Cronobacter sakazakii and C. malonaticus isolates conferring resistance exclusively to first generation cephalosporins. During a survey on the antibiotic resistance patterns of C. sakazakii and C. malonaticus strains isolated from a milk powder production facility, originally two different phenotypes regarding the susceptibility/resistance for the two beta-lactam antibiotics ampicillin (amp) and cephalothin (ceph) were observed: (i) isolates being susceptible for both antibiotics (amp(S)/ceph(S)), and (ii) strains exhibiting susceptibility to ampicillin but resistance to cephalothin (amp(S)/ceph(R)). The latter phenotype (amp(S)/ceph(R)) was observed in the majority of the environmental strains from the facility. Analysis of whole genome sequences of C. sakazakii revealed a gene putatively coding for an AmpC beta-lactamase. Consequently, the ampC genes from both species and both phenotypes were subjected to a cloning approach. Surprisingly, when expressed in Escherichia coli, all transformants exhibited the amp(S)/ceph(R) phenotype regardless of (i) the phenotypic backgrounds or (ii) the AmpC amino acid sequences of the original strains from which the clones were derived. The novel AmpC beta-lactamases were designated CSA-1 and CSA-2 (from C. sakazakii) and CMA-1 and CMA-2 (from C. malonaticus). The observed variations in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels for cephalothin (wt compared to transformants) suggest that this feature is a target of a yet unknown regulatory mechanism present in the natural Cronobacter background but absent in the neutral E. coli host.",

Resistance phenotypes (ampicillin, aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone) suggested the presence of an ESBL enzyme, but cefoxitin MICs (>/= 32 mg/L) suggested the presence of an AmpC-like enzyme. Synergism experiments with benzo(b)thiophene-2-boronic acid (BZBTH2B) and isoelectric focusing (IEF) revealed the presence of an AmpC beta-lactamase with a pI >/= 9. amp C multiplex PCR, sequence, and Southern analyses indicated that only the Salmonella isolate had a plasmid-encoded AmpC beta-lactamase CMY-2 on a nonconjugative 60-MDa plasmid. PCR and sequence analysis of the E. coli ampC promoter identified mutations at positions -88(T), -82(G), -42(T), -18(A), -1(T) and +58(T) in all the isolates. In addition one strain had two extra-mutations at positions +23(A) and +49(G), and another strain had one extra-mutation at position +32(A). DNA fingerprinting revealed that all the E. coli isolates were different clones. It also showed that the U.K. Salmonella isolate was indistinguisable from a Canadian Salmonella isolate from turkeys; both had identical resistance phenotypes and produced CMY-2. This is the first report of a CMY-2 Salmonella isolate in the United Kingdom. These data imply that beta-lactam resistance in animal isolates can be generated de novo as evidenced by the E. coli strains, or in the case of the Salmonella strains be the result of intercontinental transmission due to an acquired resistance mechanism.",

In this study we developed an iterative artificial neural network (ANN) model to describe and predict the spread of PRP in space and time as a function of antibiotic consumption and a number of different confounders. Retrospective data from 1997 to 2000 on an international epidemic PRP clone (serotype 9V) and antibiotic consumption data from Southern Sweden were used to train the ANN models and data from 2001 to 2003 for evaluation of the model predictions. Five different ANN models were trained, each with independent topology optimization for alternative sets of input variables to find the most descriptive model. The model containing all variables was the only one performing better than the reference linear models, as assessed by the correlation between predictions and observations. The inability to identify a smaller subset of most predictive parameters may reflect either diffuse causal mechanisms or just the absence of critical experimental indicators from the dataset. The iterative ANN model identified is useful to predict future data. The sensitivity analysis of the model suggests that past incidence has a small effect on the number of PRP cases.",

These samples were obtained during a 3-year period, from January 2007 to December 2009, using the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System at the Research Institute of Public Health and Environment in Seoul Metropolitan, Korea. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of the bacterium were also determined with the agar dilution method. All 121 isolates were identified as Campylobacter jejuni, with all (100%) of them having two virulence genes (ceuE and cadF) and a toxin gene (cdtB). Twenty-three different sequence types (STs), including 9 new STs, were determined by MLST. The most prevalent ST and clonal complex (CC) observed in this study were ST-45 (28.9%) and ST-45 CC (53.7%), respectively. Percentages of antimicrobial-resistant isolates were 1.9% for ampicillin, 0.8% for chloramphenicol, 24% for ciprofloxacin, 46.3% for enrofloxacin, 0.8% for erythromycin, 6.6% for gentamicin, and 46.3% for tetracycline. This study demonstrated that the majority of the Campylobacter isolates obtained from human samples in Korea were C. jejuni with ST-45 CC, which has been detected mainly in broilers worldwide, and all strains with new STs were uniformly resistant to enrofloxacin and tetracycline. This study indicates that broilers may be a breeding ground for bacteria as well as an important potential source of human campylobacteriosis.",

Positivity for the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene was demonstrated in 3 of 76 (3.9%) and 8 of 72 (11%) isolates, respectively; no other PMQR determinant was found. All aac(6')-Ib-cr-positive strains also showed two point mutations in the gyrA and parC genes. Most aac(6')-Ib-cr-positive isolates demonstrated the contemporary presence of bla(CTX-M-15), bla(OXA-1/30), and bla(TEM-1) genes and 4/11 harbored a class 1 integron with a dfrA17-aadA5 gene cassette arrangement.

These findings suggest the circulation of the previously described intercontinentally spreading E. coli O25:H4-ST131 clone in our geographical area since 2004. Hybridization studies of the PFGE profiles showed the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene to be associated with different molecular weight bands (40-350 kb) and interestingly aac(6')-Ib-cr chromosomal integration was demonstrated in one strain by I-Ceu I method.

The impact of this resistance on the outcome of patients hospitalized for CAP, empirically treated with betalactams, has not been evaluated in a randomized study. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial to assess the efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2 g/200 mg/8 hr) and ceftriaxone (1 g/24 hr) in a cohort of patients hospitalized for moderate-to-severe CAP. Three-hundred seventy-eight patients were randomized to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (184 patients) or ceftriaxone (194 patients). Efficacy was assessed on Day 2, after completion of therapy and at long term follow-up. There were no significant differences in outcomes between treatment groups, both in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. Overall mortality was 10.3% for amoxicillin-clavulanate and 8.8% for ceftriaxone (NS). There were 116 evaluable patients with proven pneumococcal pneumonia. Rates of high-level penicillin resistance (MIC of penicillin > or = 2 microg/mL) were similar in the two groups (8.2 and 10.2%). Clinical efficacy at the end of therapy was 90.6% for amoxicillin-clavulanate and 88.9% for ceftriaxone (95% C.I. of the difference: -9.3 to +12.7%). No differences in outcomes were attributable to differences in penicillin susceptibility of pneumococcal strains. Sequential i.v./oral amoxicillin-clavulanate and parenteral ceftriaxone were equally safe and effective for the empirical treatment of acute bacterial pneumonia, including penicillin and cephalosporin-resistant pneumococcal pneumonia. The use of appropriate betalactams in patients with penumococcal pneumonia and in the overall CAP population, is reliable at the current level of resistance.",

Serotypes covered by the heptavalent vaccine accounted for 42.4% of all isolates recovered in 2001 and 46.1% in 2003. Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Sp decreased in 2003 in France.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to gain knowledge of the local epidemiology of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant bacteria in primary care patients in a Swiss community. Fecal swabs were obtained from 291 primary care patients. Phenotyping and genotyping methods were used for further characterization of the isolates. Risk factors associated with carriage of \u00df-lactam-resistant strains were determined. Extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 15 (5.2%) of the primary care patients. Thirteen isolates were CTX-M producers, one produced SHV-12, and three carried CMY-2. The pathogenic pandemic clone Escherichia coli ST131 was detected in 26.6% of the patients. Two patients (13.3%) carried two distinct strains simultaneously. There was a statistically significant risk of carriage of resistant strains for persons with a history of antibiotic therapy 4 months before sampling (p=0.05), markedly for therapy with \u00df-lactam (p=0.01). Age, gender, or history of hospitalization 4 months before sampling was not a risk factor for the acquisition of resistant bacteria in the analyzed patients. The relatively low prevalence of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant strains in the community reflects the nationwide restrictive policy of antibiotic prescription as well as local implementation thereof. Nevertheless, our study shows that a potent antimicrobial resistance reservoir is present in primary care patients.",

The predominant serotypes were 19F, 19A, 23F, 11A, 3, 6A, and 6B, accounting for 67.8% of all isolates. Their serotype coverage by 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine and 7-valent conjugation vaccine was 73.1% and 39.2%, respectively. For the application of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's new breakpoint for penicillin, the resistance rate of penicillin was 27.9% (but the penicillin resistance was 80.4% based on the previous breakpoint for penicillin of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute). Actually, the full resistance rate was only 4.0% (minimum inhibitory concentration >or=8 mg/L). Resistances to erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline were very high (82.9%, 79.4%, and 71.7%, respectively). Especially, 56.1% of all the isolates were MDR, defined as resistant to three or more of the following agents: penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, cefotaxime, tetracycline, and levofloxacin. MDR strains were relatively associated with serotypes 19F, 19A, 23F, and 11A, accounting for 58.0% of the isolates. Their serotype coverage by 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine and 7-valent conjugation vaccine was 79.5% and 45.9%, respectively. Levofloxacin, as a representative fluoroquinolone, was active against 88.2% of all MDR isolates. Of particular concern was the high prevalence of MDR pneumococci in non-PCV7 serotypes with an MDR serotype 19A, 11A, 3, and 6A being mostly responsible. It would be prudent to consider more efficient protective strategies for people at high risk for pneumococcal diseases in regions with a high prevalence of MDR pneumococci.",

        "abstract": "Measuring antibiotic-induced killing relies on time-consuming biological tests. The firefly luciferase gene (luc) was successfully used as a reporter gene to assess antibiotic efficacy rapidly in slow-growing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We tested whether luc expression could also provide a rapid evaluation of bactericidal drugs in Streptococcus gordonii. The suicide vectors pFW5luc and a modified version of pJDC9 carrying a promoterless luc gene were used to construct transcriptional-fusion mutants. One mutant susceptible to penicillin-induced killing (LMI2) and three penicillin-tolerant derivatives (LMI103, LMI104, and LMI105) producing luciferase under independent streptococcal promoters were tested. The correlation between antibiotic-induced killing and luminescence was determined with mechanistically unrelated drugs. Chloramphenicol (20 times the MIC) inhibited bacterial growth. In parallel, luciferase stopped increasing and remained stable, as determined by luminescence and Western blots. Ciprofloxacin (200 times the MIC) rapidly killed 1.5 log10 CFU/ml in 2-4 hr. Luminescence decreased simultaneously by 10-fold. In contrast, penicillin (200 times the MIC) gave discordant results. Although killing was slow (< or = 0.5 log10 CFU/ml in 2 hr), luminescence dropped abruptly by 50-100-times in the same time. Inactivating penicillin with penicillinase restored luminescence, irrespective of viable counts. This was not due to altered luciferase expression or stability, suggesting some kind of post-translational modification. Luciferase shares homology with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and acyl-CoA ligase, which might be regulated by macromolecule synthesis and hence affected in penicillin-inhibited cells. Because of resemblance, luciferase might be down-regulated simultaneously. Luminescence cannot be universally used to predict antibiotic-induced killing. Thus, introducing reporter enzymes sharing mechanistic similarities with normal metabolic reactions might reveal other effects than those expected.",

The presence of the mefA gene was demonstrated in all isolates of S. pyogenes and the mefE gene in all but four S. pneumoniae isolates exhibiting the M phenotype.

M. tuberculosis encodes four glutamine synthetases, of which MetSox targets the type I enzyme encoded by glnA1. Transcriptional profiling revealed that glutamate synthetase (gltB) and a type II glutamine synthetase (glnA3) were induced after exposure to MetSox. In addition, we observed a high rate (10(-5)) of spontaneous resistance to MetSox. All resistant strains had a single-nucleotide deletion in the 5' region of glnA1, and Western analysis revealed that GlnA1 expression was increased in resistant as compared with sensitive strains. These data show that M. tuberculosis can respond to the effect of MetSox inhibition either by up-regulation of GlnA3 or by GlnA1. The high frequency of resistance suggests that MetSox and other compounds specifically targeting GlnA1 are not likely to become successful anti-mycobacterial agents.",

Gentamicin- or etimicin-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli were collected from different areas of China, and the in vitro antibacterial activity of 11 aminoglycoside agents was determined using standard (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) agar dilution methods. Twelve aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme genes were detected by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. A total of 205 E. coli strains were collected from nine hospitals in seven cities. All strains were highly resistant to gentamicin or etimicin, whereas resistance to tobramycin, netilmicin, and kanamycin was slightly lower. However, less than 15% of isolates were resistant to amikacin and isepamicin. Of the gentamicin-resistant strains, 88.2% and 86.7% were sensitive to isepamicin and amikacin, respectively. Five aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme genes were detected in 191 strains, whereas the remaining 14 strains were negative. The most common gene type was aac(3)-II (162 strains), followed by aac(6')-I (50 strains), ant(3\u2033)-I (28 strains), aph(3')-II (20 strains), and ant(2\u2033)-I (20 strains). Ninety-five strains yielded aac(3)-II only, whereas the others contained two or three genes. The three main gene combinations were aac(6')-I/aac(3)-II (28 strains), aac(3)-II/ant(3\u2033)-I (11 strains), and aac(3)-II/aac(6')-I (10 strains). Regional bacterial resistance and enzyme distribution were roughly similar, although minor differences were found in Guangzhou, Jinan, and Dalian, which were the sources of most of the amikacin- or isepamicin-resistant strains. Chinese clinical isolates of E. coli remain highly resistant to gentamicin and etimicin, but are susceptible to amikacin and isepamicin. The dominant type of aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme, AAC(3)-II, might be the main source of the disparity in E. coli resistance to different aminoglycoside agents.",

Then, the prevalence of plasmid-mediated \u03b2-lactamase and 16S rRNA methylase genes was determined by PCRs among the PMQR-positive isolates. One hundred fifty-seven (62.8%) isolates were found to harbor at least one PMQR gene, and qnrS (84) and oqxAB (97) were the most two prevalent PMQR genes. \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL and/or AmpC type) genes were detected in 106 of the 157 PMQR-positive strains.

Twenty-nine were detected to produce more than one type of \u03b2-lactamase.

The antimicrobial susceptibilities of these isolates were determined using a broth microdilution method, and the species were identified using molecular identification. In addition, we performed multilocus sequence typing for Acinetobacter baumannii subgroup A isolates. A. baumannii subgroup A was the most prevalent in patients with both bacteremia (32 isolates, 53.3%) and UTIs (20 isolates, 55.6%), followed by Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU (15.0% and 27.8% in bacteremia and UTIs, respectively). A. baumannii subgroup B and Acinetobacter junii were found exclusively in isolates causing bacteremia (seven and five isolates, respectively). Among 96 Acinetobacter spp. isolates, 19.8% were resistant to imipenem and 25.0% were resistant to meropenem. Most carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates contained PER or oxacillinase-23-like enzymes (65.2% and 78.3%, respectively). In addition, 13.5% were resistant to polymyxin B and 17.7% were resistant to colistin. A. baumannii subgroup A isolates (52 isolates, 54.2%) showed higher resistance rates to most antimicrobial agents than other species, but not to colistin. Among A. baumannii subgroup A isolates, ST22 was the most prevalent genotype (33 isolates, 63.5%) and showed higher resistance rates to all antimicrobial agents than the other genotypes. In addition, four out of five polymyxin-resistant A. baumannii group A isolates belonged to ST22. Thus, dissemination of the main clone of A. baumannii, ST22, may contribute to the high resistance rates of Acinetobacter isolates to antimicrobials, including carbapenems, in Korea.",

        "abstract": "Fluoroquinolones are being increasingly used for acute lower respiratory tract infection where Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most important bacterial pathogen. S. pneumoniae becomes resistant to quinolone antibiotics by mutations in a small section of the parC and gyrA genes. In this study, we investigated the mutation rates and spectrum of resistance when ciprofloxacin and gemifloxacin were the selective agents. When ciprofloxacin was the selective agent, parC mutants arose at a rate of 1.1 x 10(-9) mutations per cell division. There were two double mutants: parC + gyrA and parC + gyrB, and these mutations arose in as few as five generations. When gemifloxacin was the selective agent, all but one of the colonies growing on the x2 MIC plate had no mutations in gyrA or parC. The only mutation identified was in gyrA, and it appeared at a rate of 1.6 x 10(-11). When the gemifloxacin MIC of strains with mutations in parC was determined, there was no change from the susceptible parent. These data indicate that S. pneumoniae becomes resistant to gemifloxacin through mutation in gyrA rather than parC. Because gyrA mutations arise at a lower rate than parC mutations, it is likely that resistance to gemifloxacin will emerge more slowly than is seen with those quinolones that become resistant through an initial mutation in parC. The rate at which second-step mutants emerged was 1.3 x 10(-8) for parC Serine 79 Tyrosine and 7.2 x 10(-9) for gyrA Serine 81 Phenylalanine, 12 and 450 times higher, respectively, than for first-step rates, suggesting that mutation in either gene readies the genome for further mutation.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis is the most relevant infectious disease worldwide according to the estimates of the World Health Organization, and despite being a curable disease, it requires a 6-9-month therapy with multiple antibiotics. Intermittent drug therapy due to noncompliance or poor delivery of therapy promotes the emergence of bacterial strains showing resistance to multiple drugs and the rise of extremely drug-resistant strains. Moreover, increased antibiotic resistance has been observed for several microorganisms, including extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In vitro, cathelicidin induction results in enhanced mycobacterial clearance, and synthetic human neutrophil peptides had a rather modest bactericidal effect in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mice. In vivo therapeutic efficacy of improved molecules that show enhanced bactericidal action in vitro remains to be tested.",

        "abstract": "The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS determinants and their molecular characteristics in ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from urinary tract infections (UTI) in Korea. A total of 202 nonduplicated clinical isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli (n = 143) and K. pneumoniae (n = 59) were collected between July 2005 and August 2006. The qnr determinant screening was carried out by PCR amplification of qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS, and all positive results were confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR products. For qnr-positive strains and their conjugants, antimicrobial susceptibility tests and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were performed. The qnrB gene was detected in 41 of the 202 isolates. Among 33 of 59 (55.9%) K. pneumoniae isolates showing qnrB, 29 isolates contained the qnrB4 gene, 3 isolates had the qnrB2 gene, and 1 isolate had the qnrB6 gene. All 8 (5.6%) of the qnrB-positive isolates among the 143 E. coli strains possessed the qnrB4 gene. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ciprofloxacin for the transconjugants were 0.03-2 mug/ml, representing an increase of 4- to 256-fold relative to the recipient, E. coli J53Az(r). Resistances to various other antimicrobial agents also were transferred with the plasmid. The PFGE analysis revealed indistinguishable or closely related patterns in several strains and highly diverse patterns in general. QnrB variants, especially the qnrB4 subtype, are highly prevalent in ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae from UTI in Korea. The emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance may contribute by several means to the rapid increase in bacterial resistance to these drugs.",

Despite the availability of approved antiviral drugs, treatment of HCMV infections remains difficult. Antiviral therapies are in part limited by the small number of available drugs showing satisfactory clinical results. Other factors, such as low potency, poor oral bioavailability and the emergence of drug resistance, also contribute significantly to the obstacles confronting current therapies for HCMV infection. In search of new drugs for the treatment of HCMV infection, researchers have turned their attention to natural products. Unfortunately, not many natural compounds have proven to be efficacious against HCMV. Those that have shown good results in vitro are reviewed here, and their molecular targets and mechanisms of action are discussed along with those of established antiviral agents.",

In this study, biofilm of a cystic fibrosis strain P. aeruginosa PACI22 was established and confocal laser scanning microscopy was utilized for biofilm visualization. A quantitative time-kill biofilm model was implemented in vitro to assess the biocidal effect of ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, and their combination at concentration levels ranged from 0.5\u00d7 to 64\u00d7 minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBIC) against the biofilm and the mean log bacterial densities (Log CFU/ml) retrieved from the biofilm were monitored by frequent sampling at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24\u2009hr throughout the experiment. The results revealed that none of the tested antibiotics alone could completely eradicate the biofilm-ensconced bacteria at 0.5-64\u00d7 MBIC values after 24\u2009hr of treatment. Conversely, ciprofloxacin-clarithromycin combination at 32-64\u00d7 MBIC entirely exterminated the biofilm. Furthermore, a substantial in vitro synergism between ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin against the biofilm was experimentally verified. This promising synergism affords scientific rationale for further in vivo investigations to evaluate the therapeutic potential of this combination for treatment of chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa biofilms.",

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed and diminished susceptibility to cefotaxime and ceftazidime was identified in 2.5% and 2.8% of the isolates, respectively. Beta-lactamase characterization was carried out in the group of 20 E. coli isolates with both characteristics. The MIC ranges of different beta-lactams showed by these 20 isolates were as follows (in microg/ml): ampicillin (64-->256), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (4-64), ticarcillin (8-->128), cefazolin (32-->256), cefoxitin (4-->128), cefotaxime (1-64), ceftazidime (2-->64), ceftriaxone (0.5-64), imipenem (< or = 0.06-0.25), and aztreonam (2-->32). TEM, SHV, CMY, and FOX beta-lactamase genes were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. The beta-lactamase genes detected were the following ones (number of isolates): bla(TEM-1b) (3), bla(TEM-1a) (1), bla(TEM-30f) (2), bla(TEM-1b) + bla(CMY-2) (2), and bla(SHV-12) (1). Sequences of the promoter and/or attenuator region of the chromosomal ampC gene were studied in all the 20 isolates. Mutations at position -42 or -32 were detected in 16 isolates and these mutations were associated with the presence of a TEM type beta-lactamase in 6 isolates. Besides, a high variety of plasmidic beta-lactamases was detected including TEM-30 and CMY-2. To our knowledge, this is the first time that TEM-30 beta-lactamase has been detected in E. coli isolates of animal origin.",

        "abstract": "The Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate TS-832035 was responsible for an outbreak that occurred in an Italian hospital between 1999 and 2002. It exhibited a high-level resistance to carbapenems due to the contemporary presence of two independent mechanisms: the production of a carbapenemase, coded by a bla(VIM-1) determinant carried by the chromosomal class 1 integron In70.2 (containing also the aacA4, aphA15, and aadA1 genes in its cassette array), and the lack of the OprD porin. We compared TS-832035 with a strictly related isolate, TS-103, whose resistance to carbapenems was due to the lack of the OprD porin only, as it did not carry In70.2. We evaluated their growth kinetics, in both separate cultures and competition assays, under permissive conditions. These experiments highlighted a significant in vitro fitness cost associated with the integron. On the contrary, none of the resistance determinants other than the bla(VIM-1) seemed to confer a real selective advantage to its host. Comparison of these results with the in vivo behavior, showing that the In70.2-carrying isolates largely prevailed over the In70.2-lacking ones, besides the detection of similar integrons in other Italian clinical isolates, evidenced the need to investigate accurately the causes of their large distribution, as possible soft spots could exist in the ability of their hosts to adapt to the hospital settings.",

        "abstract": "Fifteen Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility (defined as a ciprofloxacin MIC of > or = 4 microg/ml), all collected in Italy in 2000-2003, were typed and subjected to extensive molecular characterization to define the contribution of drug target alterations and efflux mechanisms to their resistance. Serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis indicated substantial genetic unrelatedness among the 15 isolates, suggesting that the new resistance traits arise in multiple indigenous strains rather than through clonal dissemination. Sequencing of the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE demonstrated that point mutations producing single amino acid changes were more frequent in topoisomerase IV (parC mutations in 14 isolates and parE mutations in 13) than in DNA gyrase subunits (gyrA mutations in 7 isolates and no gyrB mutations observed). No isolate displayed a quinolone efflux system susceptible to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; conversely, four-fold or greater MIC reductions in the presence of reserpine were observed in all 15 isolates with ethidium bromide, in 13 with ulifloxacin, in 9 with ciprofloxacin, in 5 with norfloxacin, and in none with five other fluoroquinolones. The effect of efflux pump activity on the level and profile of fluoroquinolone resistance in our strains was minor compared with that of target site modifications. DNA mutations and/or efflux systems other than those established so far might contribute to the fluoroquinolone resistance expressed by our strains. Susceptibility profiles to nonquinolone class antibiotics and resistance-associated phenotypic and genotypic characteristics were also determined and correlated with fluoroquinolone resistance. A unique penicillin-binding protein profile was observed in all five penicillin-resistant isolates, whereas the same PBP profile as S. pneumoniae R6 was exhibited by all six penicillin-susceptible isolates. This is the first attempt to molecularly characterize clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones emerging in Italy.",

        "abstract": "To investigate beta-lactam effects on Streptococcus pneumoniae-mixed cultures, a computerized pharmacodynamic model simulating over 24-hr concentrations obtained after several beta-lactam regimens was used. Strain 1 (no penicillin binding protein [PBP] mutations) and strain 2 (mutation in pbp1a) were penicillin/amoxicillin susceptible. Strain 3 (mutations in pbp1a, pbp2x, and pbp2b) and strain 4 (mutations in pbp1a, pbp2x, and pbp2b [10 changes]) were penicillin/amoxicillin resistant. Initial inoculum was approximately 6 x 10(6) CFU (colony forming units)/ml (with a 1:1:1:1 proportion of each strain). Population analysis profile was performed pre- and post-simulations. Strain 1 exhibited the best fitness (growth over 24 hr) in individual cultures, and strain 2 did so in mixed cultures in antibiotic-free simulations. In antibiotic simulations with the mixed inocula, penicillin/amoxicillin-susceptible strains were eradicated with all study drugs (time that concentrations exceed the minimal inhibitory concentration [T>MIC >or= 43%]). Penicillin-resistant strains showed different evolution depending on the antibiotic: (a) cefditoren produced >2 log(10) reduction of initial inocula at 12-24 hr (T>MIC >or=45%), with a remaining population growing in plates with >or=4 mg/L amoxicillin; (b) cefuroxime, cefixime, and cefaclor did not decrease initial inocula at 12-24 hr (T>MIC=0%), with minor subpopulations growing in plates with 4 mg/L amoxicillin; (c) amoxicillin produced 2.6 log(10) decrease of initial inocula at 12 hr (T>MIC=47.5%), but 1.1 log(10) increase of initial inocula at 24 hr, with a significant population growing in plates with 4 mg/L amoxicillin. Antibiotic activity against mixed inocula (susceptible and resistant strains) depends on intrinsic activity (as well as its subsequent pharmacodynamic activity: T>MIC against resistant strains), and on possible selection of intra-strain-resistant subpopulations.",

        "abstract": "The occurrence of drug-resistant Vibrio cholerae is being reported with increasing frequency worldwide. Spread of resistant strains has been attributed, in part, to class I integrons and sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim-constin (SXT-C). Sixty clinical V. cholerae isolates were isolated from four different provinces in Iran, which were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing, polymerase chain reaction amplification of class I integron and SXT-C, and sequencing of the amplified fragments. Ribotyping technique was used to assess the clonality of the isolates. The highest and the least levels of antibiotic resistance were seen to SXT, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol (95%, 95%, and 92%, respectively) and doxycycline, gentamicin, and oxytetracycline (0%, 3%, and 3%, respectively). The results showed that out of the total of 60 isolates, only 1 contained class I integron, which harbored streptomycin resistance gene cassette (aadA2). This isolate showed ribotype pattern similar to the other strains (lacking class I integron) obtained in the same year (2006). On the contrary, the SXT-C was found in 95% of the isolates. These isolates showed three different but related ribotype patterns. Overall, the results of this study showed insignificant contribution of class I integron in antibiotic resistance of our V. cholerae isolates. On the other hand, V. cholerae resistance to SXT, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol could be, in part, due to wide distribution of SXT-C among the isolates. In addition, the ribotype data suggest that the clinical V. cholerae population from 2004 to 2006 were homogeneous.",

Eleven OFX-resistant non-MDR MTB isolates were also included. All strains that were susceptible to OFX were shown to be also susceptible to MOX. For OFX-resistant isolates, regardless of their MDR status, a 4- to 8-fold decrease in MIC was observed for MOX when compared to OFX. On the basis of similarities in mode of action and pharmacokinetic data between MOX and OFX, a breakpoint MIC of 2 mg/L was suggested for MOX in the MGIT system. All but two OFX-resistant isolates possessed MIC of MOX of 2 mg/L or lower and were considered to be susceptible to MOX; however, all OFX-resistant strains studied had mutations involved in resistance to quinolones. DNA sequence analysis for the gyrase A mutation, which was an indicator for OFX resistance, correlated with MOX susceptibility changes. Significant decreases in MOX susceptibility amongst MDR-MTB strains were observed that correlated with OFX susceptibility. The Asp94Gly mutation appeared to be associated with a higher level of MICs to both OFX and MOX. These findings on the stepwise decline of in vitro susceptibility to MOX suggest that clinical usage of MOX should be accompanied by careful monitoring of susceptibility to this important anti-MDR MTB drug.",

        "abstract": "Pneumocystis jirovecii is a major opportunistic pathogen that causes Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Drug treatment failure has been associated epidemiologically with point mutations in the gene for dihydropteroate synthase which is part of a gene that encodes three covalently linked enzymes involved in folic acid synthesis TAS). The evaluation of whether mutations found in P. jirovecii FAS lead to sulfa drug resistance is hampered by the lack of a culture system for P. jirovecii as well as the failure of P. jirovecii FAS to complement in a heterologous system. Therefore, we chose to model the P. jirovecii mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae FAS protein (encoded by FOL1) via its expression in Escherichia coli. An optimized drug diffusion assay was used to evaluate the FAS mutants against 15 sulfa drugs. It was established that the single amino acid substitution, P599S, in the (DHPS) domain of FAS led to sulfa drug resistance, whereas the T(597)A substitution led to increased sensitivity. The presence of both mutations J(597)A and P599S) was cooperative and led to increased sulfa drug resistance. Analysis of a novel double mutant, (T597V P599S) was found to have significantly higher sulfa drug resistance than the T(597)A P599S mutant. These data suggest that further amino acid substitutions may lead to the evolution of higher sulfa drug resistance. Two sulfa drugs (sulfachloropyridazine and sulfathiazole) were identified that had higher inhibitory potential than sulfamethoxazole, which is currently the preferred treatment for PCP.",

The rate of qnr-positive isolates was 21.6% (49/226), 49.5% for aac(6')-Ib-cr (112/226), and 1.7% for qepA1 (4/226). Those isolates carried qnr genes corresponding to types qnrB (71.4%), qnrS1 (24.4%), and qnrA1 (18.3%). The distribution among bacterial species was as follows: 55.8% (19/34) to Enterobacter cloacae, 50% (28/56) to Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1.4% (2/136) to Escherichia coli. The characterization of qnr-positive isolates indicated the ESBL SHV-types as the most prevalent (81.6%), including the ESBLs SHV-12, SHV-5, and SHV-2a, followed by CTX-M-15 (44.9%) and TLA-1 (8.1%). In addition, for qnr-positive isolates, the prevalence of aac(6')-Ib-cr was 55.1%, but qepA was not identified. Alterations at codons Ser-83 and Asp-87 in GyrA and at codons Ser-80 in ParC were observed in 69% and 80% of the qnr-positive isolates, respectively. The analysis of the transconjugants revealed a cotransmission of bla(CTX-M-15) with qepA1 or aac(6')-Ib-cr and/or qnrA1 and bla(SHV-type) with qnrB5 and qnrB6 genes. To conclude, these findings indicate a high prevalence of qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr among ESBL-producing isolates from Mexican hospitals and point to the wide spread of qnr-like determinants associated to ESBLs SHV- and CTX-M-type in Mexican clinical isolates.",

The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, determined by broth microdilution method, of 35 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates ranged between 4 and 16 \u03bcg/mL and a single susceptible isolate was obtained.

Moreover, 4 of 35 (11.4%) ciprofloxacin-resistant and one susceptible isolate had no mutation in Ala-90 and Asp-94. No gyrB mutation was observed in all tested M. massiliense isolates.

Two of these strains were found to contain conjugative plasmids conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins that were indistinguishable from each other by restriction endonuclease digestion. Sequence analysis of the plasmid-encoded ampC showed that they were identical to bla(CMY-2), previously described in multiple-drug-resistant Salmonella and E. coli from animals in other parts of the world. DNA sequence analysis of the chromosomal ampC promoter regions for three cephalosporin-resistant strains lacking CMY-2 was determined. Several mutations were detected in the isolates tested including changes at positions -42 and -32, which are known to increase promoter strength.

Many of these structures have central roles in the biology of B. anthracis, particularly, in virulence. However, little attention has been devoted to structurally study the PG and how it is modified in the presence of these secondary cell wall components. We present here the fine structure of the PG of the encapsulated RPG1 strain harboring both pXO1 and pXO2 virulence plasmids. We show that B. anthracis has a high degree of cross-linking and its GlcNAc residues are highly modified by N-deacetylation. The PG composition is not dependent on the presence of either LPXTG proteins or the capsule. Using NMR analysis of the PG-PDGA complex, we provide evidence for the anchoring of the PDGA to the glucosamine residues. We show that anchoring of the PDGA capsule is impaired in two PG N-deacetylase mutants, Ba1961 and Ba3679. Thus, these multiple N-deactylase activities would constitute excellent drug targets in B. anthracis by simultaneously affecting its resistance to lysozyme and to phagocytosis impairing B. anthracis survival in the host.",

Multidrug resistance was found in 82.7% of all 19A isolates. The most prevalent genotype (63.5%) among serotype 19A pneumococcal strains was the multidrug-resistant clonal complex CC230, which is a capsular switched variant of the Denmark(14)-32 (ST230) global clone. The most frequent sequence type (ST) was ST230 (48.1%) and together with four other closely related STs (15.4%), belonging to ST1611, ST276, ST7466, and ST2013, which were single- and double-locus variants; they were included in the main CC230. The disappearance of highly drug-resistant ST663 clone and emergence of new clones as CC320 and CC199 was also observed among the rest 19A isolates. A comparison of clonal composition between invasive and noninvasive isolates did not show a great genetic diversity among both kinds of isolates. Continuous surveillance of serotype 19A population following the introduction of PCV10 is essential to evaluate the impact of the vaccine on the epidemiology of this serotype.",

        "abstract": "Drug susceptibility testing and PCR assay were used to determine the antibiotic susceptibility patterns and prevalence of genes encoding five different extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBLs) (PER, VEB, SHV, GES, and TEM) among 600 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultured from patients at two hospitals in Tehran. Susceptibility of isolates to 12 different antibiotics was tested using disk diffusion method. The MICs for ceftazidime and imipenem were also determined using microbroth dilution assay. Isolates showing MICs >or=16 for ceftazidime were subjected to PCR targeting bla(SHV), bla(PER), bla(GES), bla(VEB), and bla(TEM) genes that encode ESBL. The rates of resistance were as follows: tetracycline (92%), carbenicillin (62%), cefotaxime (56%), ceftriaxon (53%), piperacilin (46%), gentamicin (31%), piperacilin/tazobactam (28%), ceftazidime (25%), amikacin (23%), ciprofloxacin (19.5%), and imipenem (6%). Thirty-nine percent of isolates (n = 234) showed MICs >or=16 microg/ml for ceftazidime, and 5.45% showed MICs >or=16 microg/ml for imepenem. The imipenem-resistant isolates showed high rate of susceptibility to colistin (89%) and polymixin B (95.5%). The frequency of bla(VEB), bla(SHV), bla(PER), bla(GES), and bla(TEM) among the ESBL isolates (MIC >or=16) were 24%, 22%, 17%, 0%, and 9%, respectively. Isolates containing bla(VEB) were resistant to almost all tested antibiotics except imepenem. This is the first report on the existence of bla(VEB), and bla(PER) in Iran. Colistin and polymixin B are highly potent against the imipenem-resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa.",

        "abstract": "The New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase gene (bla(NDM-1)) has emerged as a worldwide concern among isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. Its epidemiology is been strongly associated with travel and healthcare on the Indian Subcontinent. We report two cases of urinary tract infection with Enterobacteriaceae harboring a bla(NDM-1). Both cases presented as infection in community-dwelling individuals in Australia and were associated with travel to the Indian Subcontinent. One isolate of Escherichia coli harbored the previously undescribed enzyme variant bla(NDM-3), differing from bla(NDM-1) by a single nonsynonymous SNP conferring a putative peptide sequence change at the 95th position (ASP\u2192ASN). The second was an Enterobacter cloacae harboring bla(NDM-1). Further genetic characterization included identification of additional \u03b2-lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes. Legacy antimicrobials were used for treatment. Oral therapy with nitrofurantoin was successful in one case, while combination of colistin and rifampicin was required in the second patient. Such infection, due to extensively drug-resistant pathogens, poses significant challenges in balancing the efficacy and toxicity of potential antimicrobial therapies.",

E. columbae is the most prevalent enterococcal species in the intestines of pigeons. Acquired resistance against the antimicrobials bambermycin, vancomycin, monensin, narasin, virginiamycin (cross-resistant with quinupristin/dalfopristin), avilamycin (cross-resistant with evernimicin), and ampicillin was not seen. Only for the antimicrobials tetracycline and tylosin was a frequent occurrence of resistance found in all three enterococcal species tested. Resistance to the fluoroquinolone antimicrobial enrofloxacin was present in E. columbae. Bacitracin resistance was seen in the species E. faecalis and E. faecium but not in E. columbae. High-level streptomycin resistance was found in E. columbae and in one E. faecium strain, whereas high-level gentamicin resistance was mainly associated with E. faecalis. The differences noted between the different species illustrate the difficulties related to the choice of indicator bacteria for antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal flora.",

        "abstract": "Novel starting points for drug discovery projects are generally found either by screening large collections of compounds or smaller more-focused libraries. Ideally, hundreds or even thousands of actives are initially found, and these need to be reduced to a handful of promising lead series. In several sequential steps, many actives are dropped and only some are followed up. Computational chemistry tools are used in this context to predict properties, cluster hits, design focused libraries and search for close analogues to explore the potential of hit series. At the end of hit-to-lead, the project must commit to one, or preferably a few, lead series that will be refined during lead optimization and hopefully produce a drug candidate. Striving for the best possible decision is crucial because choosing the wrong series is a costly one-way street.",

Two unrelated strains contained the sul2 sulphonamide resistance gene and strAB streptomyicn resistance genes with the dfrA14 trimethoprim resistance gene cassette in the strA gene and conferred resistance to trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole. A 6.8 kb plasmid, pCERC1, that contains these resistance genes was recovered and sequenced. Deletions were constructed, and the pCERC1 replication region was confined to a 1 kb segment carrying genes for RNAs that are closely related to the ColE1 replication initiation RNAs. Polymerase chain reaction assays, developed to detect the sul2-strA-strB gene cluster in this context, identified a streptomycin and sulphonamide resistance plasmid, pCERC2, identical to pCERC1 without the dfrA14 cassette in two further E. coli isolates. Bioinformatic analysis revealed plasmids similar to pCERC1 and two more members of this family. One, the probable progenitor, carries only the sul2 gene adjacent to the small mobile element CR2. The other has a variant resistance gene cluster that has evolved from pCERC2 via acquisition of the tet(A) tetracycline resistance determinant. pCERC1 and pCERC2 have been detected in many countries, indicating a global distribution and appear to have been circulating in Gram-negative bacteria for more than 25 years.",

In plasmid pR148, the closest relative of pRMH760, the antibiotic resistance island is in the same position but the resistance genes differ. pRMH760 also contains a deletion in the rhs gene. Sequenced A/C2 plasmids containing blaCMY or blaCMY and blaNDM have backbones closely related to the pRMH760/pR148 backbone, and they include resistance islands in the same location, indicating that they arose from a plasmid related to pRMH760/pR148. However, the gene content of this resistance island differs in each case, and the island family was designated ARI-A. The blaNDM gene is within ARI-A. The ISEcp1-blaCMY fragment is located elsewhere and is always in the same location, consistent with a single acquisition event. Plasmids containing only blaCMY carry a second resistance island, designated ARI-B, which includes the sul2 gene and a variable set of further resistance genes. Nine A/C2 plasmids that were not of this type (type 1) were found to have a similar backbone that can be simply distinguished by the presence of two exchanged regions and two insertions. Antibiotic resistance islands in type 2 plasmids are in different locations and have different structures.",

        "abstract": "Various resistance mechanisms facilitate the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistance (MDR) phenotypes of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. To elucidate the MDR mechanisms of E. coli and K. pneumoniae in China, we analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibilities of strains isolated from clinical samples in a large tertiary care hospital in Beijing, China, during 2007-2009 and characterized the isolates with a cefotaxime-ciprofloxacin-amikacin (CTX-CIP-AK) resistance pattern. In total, 98 and 52 clinical isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively, with a CTX-CIP-AK resistance pattern were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and screening of common \u03b2-lactamase genes, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes, quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) substitutions, and 16S rRNA methylase genes by polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to determine the genetic relatedness of the isolates. Approximately 6.86% and 8.05% of the clinical E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, respectively, exhibited MDR phenotypes. The MDR K. pneumoniae isolates exhibited significantly higher ceftazidime resistance than the MDR E. coli isolates (90.4% vs. 76.5%, p=0.0339); a similar result was noted for piperacillin-tazobactam resistance (28.8% vs. 2%, p=0.0001). The common resistance determinants among the MDR E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were as follows: CTX-M (88.8% vs. 82.7%), PMQR genes (70.4% vs. 90.4%), gyrA mutations (100% vs. 90.4%), and 16S rRNA methylase genes (93.9% vs. 94.2%). Half (50%) of the MDR E. coli isolates belonged to phylogenetic group D, followed by group A (39.8%). For the E. coli isolates, 94 PFGE patterns and 23 clusters were identified, whereas 51 PFGE patterns and 11 clusters were identified for the K. pneumoniae isolates. Clinical E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates seem to have a low prevalence of MDR phenotypes in China. The great genetic variation indicates a considerable transmission of common resistance determinants, including a high prevalence of QRDR substitutions in E. coli and K. pneumoniae.",

Susceptibility tests were carried out for 805 strains (697 Campylobacter jejuni and 108 Campylobacter coli) against nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, tetracycline, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol using the disk-diffusion method. Quinolone resistance was the most abundant overall (74.9%) and at each stage of production. The second largest resistance was for tetracycline with 48.2%. The resistance against amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol was not found. The percentages of resistance and multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates were always higher in the PBFs than in the GPBFs. However, pan-susceptible populations (total 10.3%) were isolated in our survey. C. coli isolates were more resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin (96.3% and 23.1%, respectively) than for C. jejuni (40.7% and 0%, respectively) and were more MDR (33.3% vs. 11.9%). In conclusion, as other authors have shown, even in the absence of antibiotic pressure, relatively high rates of quinolone resistance are found in Campylobacter. However, a decrease in quinolone resistance has been observed compared to other studies in Spain [i.e., 99%; Saenz et al. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000;44(2):267-271]. MDR, fluoroquinolone-, macrolide-, and tetracycline-resistant Campylobacter populations are issues of concern in public health.",

This clone exhibited resistance to levofloxacin, erythromycin and high-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin. After receiving treatment with several broad spectrum antibiotics for febrile neutropenia, a 9-day course of oral linezolid was administered once the patient developed bacteraemia by the same ARE colonizing clone. Linezolid-resistant ARE was detected 17 days later in the follow-up fecal samples and persisted 41 days after suppression of linezolid therapy. Resistance to linezolid was associated with G2576T transversion in the 23S rRNA and the presence of cfr gene was not detected.

A total of 321 clinical isolates of S. aureus were identified from different patients. The prevalence of methicillin resistance among S. aureus isolates was 8.7% (28 isolates). Resistance rates of MRSA to other antibiotics were as follows: 82.1% resistant to erythromycin, 67.9% to clindamycin, 64.3% to gentamicin, and 32.1% to ciprofloxacin. No co-trimoxazole- and vancomycin-resistant isolates were identified in this study. The proportion of methicillin resistance was highest among S. aureus isolates associated with upper respiratory specimens (42.8%); the proportion of methicillin resistance was 39.3% among skin ulcer isolates, 10.7% among urinary tract infection isolates, and lowest among isolates associated with blood and prostate discharge (3.6% each).",

Korea that displayed a novel phenotype in double-disk diffusion assay. We used polymerase chain reaction to determine presence of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance genes, disc diffusion assays to determine resistance phenotype, and microbroth dilution to determine minimal inhibitory concentration. We detected a novel phenotype in the double-disk diffusion assay for inducible resistance among 46 S. agalactiae strains that were both erythromycin sensitive and clindamycin resistant. Thirty-two strains with the novel phenotype tested positive for erm(B) by DNA-DNA hybridization; sequencing of the erm(B) gene revealed mutations in the ribosomal binding site region in the erm(B) open reading frame, which is consistent with a lack of erythromycin resistance phenotype. Although identified from patients at multiple hospitals, genotyping suggested that the strains are closely related. The new phenotype shows increased sensitivity to clindamycin in the presence of erythromycin.",

Recently, we isolated a plasmid (pOLA52) conferring resistance to olaquindox from swine manure. On this plasmid, the oqxA and oqxB genes encode an RND-family multidrug efflux pump, OqxAB. It facilitates resistance to olaquindox as well as resistance to other antimicrobials like chloramphenicol. In this study, 10 of the 556 (1.8%) previously isolated Escherichia coli strains were shown to have an MIC >or= 64 microg/ml olaquindox. In nine of the ten strains, the oqxA gene was detected. Sequencing of an internal fragment of oqxA from the oqxA-positive strains showed no variation, indicating highly conserved oqxA genes. All of the oqxA-positive strains contain plasmids with replicons similar to that of pOLA52. It was verified by Southern hybridization that the oqxAB operon was situated on plasmids in most, if not all, resistant strains. Furthermore, horizontal transfer of olaquindox resistance from three olaquindox-resistant isolates was achieved using an olaquindox-sensitive E. coli as recipient.",

        "abstract": "Although antimicrobial resistance rates among Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae have increased significantly in most countries in the last years, most studies from Brazil report relatively low resistance rates among these pathogens. In this study, we analyzed the susceptibility patterns of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae from Brazil during a 7-year period. A total of 829 S. pneumoniae and 718 H. influenzae consecutively collected from 1998 to 2004, mainly from respiratory tract and bloodstream infections, were susceptibility tested by broth microdilution methods against >30 drugs and the results were analyzed by year. Overall, 77.8% of S. pneumoniae strains were considered susceptible (MIC, < or =0.06 microg/ml) to penicillin. Resistance to penicillin (MIC, > or =2 microg/ml) and ceftriaxone (MIC, > or =4 microg/ml) were detected in 7.5 and 0.5% of strains, respectively. The fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin (MIC90) 1 microg/ml) and gatifloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 microg/ml), were active against 99.8% of the isolates tested. Among the other non-beta-lactam drugs tested, the rank order of susceptibility rates was chloramphenicol (98.9%) > clindamycin (96.4%) > erythromycin (90.6%) > tetracycline (69.8%) > trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (36.7%). Resistance to penicillin has increased markedly among S. pneumoniae isolates over 7 years (from 2.9 to 11.0%). Additionally, resistance rates against erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline decreased among pneumococcal strains during the same period. S. pneumoniae recovered from pediatric patients (< or =5 years) showed increased penicillin and trimethoprim/sulfametroxazole resistance rates compared to older populations. The rate of ampicillin resistance among H. influenzae was 14.0%, which also corresponds with the beta -lactamase production rate. All H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate (MIC90, 1 microg/ml), ceftriaxone (MIC90, < or =0.008 microg/ml), cefepime (MIC90, 0.12 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (MIC90, < or = 0.12microg/ml), levofloxacin (MIC90, < or =0.5 microg/ml), and gatifloxacin (MIC90, < or =0.03 microg/ml). Resistance to the antimicrobials tested remained very stable among H. influenzae isolates during the 7-year study period. The continued emerging antimicrobial resistances found in these pathogens (mainly S. pneumoniae) highlight the need for alternative agents for the treatment of infections caused by these species.",

Apramycin resistance (minimum inhibitory concentrations \u22651,024\u2009\u03bcg/ml) was observed in 16 (11.6%) of the 138 gentamicin-resistant E. coli (GREC) strains. Among the seven different kinds of aminoglycoside resistance genes tested, only four kinds were detected in the apramycin-resistant GREC strains: aac (3)-II, aac (3)-III, aac (3)-IV, and armA. The aac (3)-IV gene was found in all apramycin-resistant GREC strains, whereas aac(3)-II, aac(3)-III, and armA genes were detected in 8 (50.0%), 6 (37.5%), and 1 (6.3%) GREC strains resistant to apramycin, respectively. Of 16 apramycin-resistant GREC strains, transfer of apramycin resistance was observed in seven (43.8%), and co-transfer of resistance to other antimicrobials along with apramycin resistance was also found in four strains (25.0%) by broth mating.

The study was conducted at the Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Nasal swabs were obtained from children and S. aureus was isolated and identified using conventional culture methods. MRSA was screened and confirmed using the cefoxitin disk and multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. MRSA isolates were further characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiling. Of 285 children included in the study, S. aureus was detected in 114 (40%). Of the 114 isolates, 12 (10.5%) were MRSA. PFGE results showed that these MRSA isolates are epidemiologically unrelated. Resistance of all S. aureus to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin was 65.8%, 23.7%, 27.2%, and 4.4%, respectively. No resistance to vancomycin was found. The prevalence of inducible clindamycin resistance, constitutive clindamycin resistance, MS phenotype (resistance to erythromycin alone), and multidrug resistance was 16.7%, 1.8%, 14.0%, and 16.8%, respectively. None of the risk factors examined was found to be significant. This is the first report of S. aureus and nasal carriage of MRSA and a high rate of S. aureus carriage was found in Tanzanian under-5 children. The study findings support the need for proper health education and effective infection control measures for healthcare workers.",

Plasmid p39R861-4 transferred at high frequency. Although reported to be the A/C1 plasmid RA1, p39R861-4 is a 155794-bp Type 2\u2009A/C2 plasmid, in which a 39-kb segment, derived from RA1 that includes a relative of the RA1 resistance island, replaces 26.5\u2009kb of the Type 2 backbone. p39R861-4 includes a single copy of IS10 and two resistance islands with a CR2-sul2 region in each of them. The 84\u2009kb of backbone between the resistance islands is inverted relative to other known A/C plasmids and this inversion has arisen through recombination between the CR2-sul2 regions that are inversely oriented. The two resistance islands present before this inversion occurred were one related to but longer than that found in RA1, and one that is a form of the ARI-B island and identical to ARI-B in the A/C2 plasmid R55. They contain genes conferring resistance to tetracycline (tetA(D)), sulfonamides (sul2), and florfenicol and chloramphenicol (floR). The tet(D) determinant is flanked by two IS26 in a transposon-like structure named Tntet(D). Both resistance islands contain remnants of the two ends of the integrative element GIsul2, consistent with the sul2 gene being mobilized by GIsul2 rather than by CR2.",

        "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of ertapenem-resistant (ETP-R) Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates at a Taiwanese hospital. The disk-diffusion tests revealed that the rate of ertapenem resistance among all isolates collected in 2008 was 13.5%, and the resistance rate among bloodstream isolates increased from 0% to 13.6% between 2001 and 2008. Eighty-two nonduplicate ETP-R isolates collected in 2008 were examined. Seventy-four (90.2%) isolates of them had extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (CTX-M- and SHV-type), AmpC enzymes (DHA-1 and CMY-2), and IMP-8 metallo-\u03b2-lactamase alone or in combination, and an extremely high prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance (95.1%) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants (90.2%) were also observed. Eighteen ETP-R but imipenem-susceptible isolates were selected and compared with 18 imipenem-nonsusceptible isolates collected before 2008. Sequence analyses revealed genetic disruptions of OmpK36 in 11 imipenem-nonsusceptible and 6 imipenem-susceptible isolates, respectively, and OmpK35 disruptions in 10 isolates for both groups. For the isolates with intact ompK36, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggests decreased expression of OmpK36 in 5 of 7 imipenem-nonsusceptible isolates and 3 of 12 imipenem-susceptible isolates. In conclusion, the increasing prevalence of ertapenem resistance that was predominantly attributed to noncarbapenemase-mediated resistance mechanisms in K. pneumoniae is becoming a serious treat to patients in Taiwan.",

Detection of multidrug resistant and NDM-1 producing isolates from cases of urinary tract infection in these remote islands lends support to the belief that the existence of these highly resistant strains is perhaps more widespread than previously thought and underscores the need for immediate implementation of antibiotic policy integrated with a continuous surveillance system. The study strengthens the need for a continuous surveillance system of antibiotic resistance in these remote Islands.",

        "abstract": "During the last 4 years, Norway has experienced an increase in macrolide resistance among systemic isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The Norwegian reference laboratory for pneumococci received the isolates from over 85% of the Norwegian cases of systemic pneumococcal disease in the period studied. To study the details of the increased macrolide resistance, all macrolide-resistant systemic pneumococcal isolates (410 isolates) collected in the period from 1995 to 2005 were characterized phenotypically, and a representative selection of 68 strains was also studied genotypically. The serogroups most frequently associated with macrolide resistance in the studied period were 14, 6, 23, 19, and 9. The resistance M-type was expressed in 85% of the resistant isolates. Of the 68 isolates analyzed by multilocus sequence typing, 19 different sequence types (STs) were represented, including several of the international resistant clones. All but one of the clones appeared at a low frequency; mainly as isolated cases. The increase in macrolide resistance seen from 2001 to 2005 proved to be caused by ST-9, defined as the England(14)-9 clone by the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network. All ST-9 isolates tested, carried the mef(A) gene and expressed the resistance M-type. This clone first appeared in the Oslo region in 1993, but was by 2005 isolated from all over the country. Children were overrepresented among the cases caused by this clone; however, people aged 20-29, possibly involving the parent generation, were also represented at an increased frequency. The England(14)-9 clone has been able to spread successfully in the Norwegian population despite a relatively low consumption of macrolides.",

        "abstract": "In the recent decades, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens with the ability to develop resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. Multidrug-resistant CNS are currently a common finding in hospital settings and hospitalized patients. Little is known about the occurrence and persistence of multidrug-resistant CNS in animal clinics. A survey of the environmental bacterial flora in a small animal clinic showed a predominance of bacterial species commonly isolated from skin and feces of warm-blooded animals and the environment. At samplings separated by 3 years, multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus was isolated from the floor of four separate animal cages and from a cat's postoperative wound infection. Pulsed-field electrophoresis, multilocus enzyme typing, susceptibility testing, and genotypic characterization suggested that the multidrug-resistant S. haemolyticus isolates belonged to an epidemiological clone. All isolates harbored a chromosomal copy of the mecA gene, a 45-kb plasmid harboring the blaZ and qacA/B determinants, and all except one isolate carried multiple plasmids in the size range 1-22 kb, of which those <5 kb encoded resistance to tetracycline (tetK), macrolides (ermB), and chloramphenicol (cat). One isolate carried a chromosomal copy of the bifunctional gene aacA-aphD conferring resistance to gentamicin. The isolate that was deficient of small plasmids had reverted to a macrolide and chloramphenicol-susceptible phenotype, but had retained its tetracycline resistance due to IS257-mediated integration of the tetK plasmid into the mec region of the chromosome. This finding illustrates bacterial intracellular mobility of resistance genes in natural environments, and highlights the role of insertion sequences in the evolution of multidrug resistance islands on the bacterial chromosome.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies indicate that macrolide resistance in Moraxella catarrhalis isolates is less common in adults than in children. However, few studies have investigated M. catarrhalis macrolide resistance mechanisms in adult patients. In this study, 124 M. catarrhalis isolates were collected from adult patients in a Chinese tertiary hospital, between 2010 and 2013, and investigated for antimicrobial resistance. We found that only seven isolates were macrolide resistant and all exhibited high-level macrolide resistance (minimum inhibitory concentrations >256\u2009\u03bcg/ml). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) suggested that M. catarrhalis has a diverse population; in particular, both pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and MLST revealed that all the seven high-level macrolide-resistant M. catarrhalis belonged to different clones. A 934-bp 23S rRNA gene sequencing showed that only nine isolates (including all the seven macrolide-resistant isolates) had mutations within the studied region, and only the seven macrolide-resistant isolates had mutation of A2330T. No other known macrolide-resistance determinant genes (ermA, ermB, mefA, or mefE) were detected. These findings support previous studies in children on M. catarrhalis macrolide-resistant isolates and suggest that the 23S rRNA gene A2330T mutation is responsible for the high M. catarrhalis macrolide resistance. The findings prompted us to successfully develop a simple allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assay for high-level macrolide-resistant 23S rRNA gene A2330T mutation for future clinical and further surveillance use.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of antibiotic resistance in enterococci isolated from neonates' gut microbiota as well as the presence of genetic determinants encoding for certain antibiotic resistance traits. A total of 263 fecal samples derived from 97 infants were collected on day 4, 30, and 90 after delivery. Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently identified species (54.6%) followed by E. faecium, while E. casseliflavus/E. flavescens and E. gallinarum were also traced. The isolates were examined for their resistance to 12 antibiotics. Rifampicin resistance was the highest observed (53.2%), followed by resistance to tetracycline (42.0%), erythromycin (35.7%), and vancomycin (11.2%). Multiresistant strains were highly prevalent. Only intrinsic vancomycin resistance (vanC1 and vanC2/C3) was traced. The ermB gene was detected in 49 out of 96 erythromycin-resistant isolates, while tet genes were detected in 51 out of 113 tetracycline-resistant strains, with tet(L) being the most frequently observed. In conclusion, antibiotic-resistant enterococci are already established in the fecal microbiota of healthy neonates, from the first days of an infant's life.",

Transposons related to the mercury resistance transposon Tn1696 were identified in both IncHI2 plasmids. These transposons contained an In4-type class 1 integron that carried a dfrA5 trimethoprim resistance gene cassette and the sul1 sulfonamide resistance gene. These integrons were located in the same position as In4 in Tn1696. The integron from one isolate includes a large transposon-like structure containing four IS26 and the strAB, sul2, bla(TEM), and aphA1 genes conferring resistance to streptomycin, sulphonamides, ampicillin, kanamycin, and neomycin, respectively. This structure is flanked by an 8-bp duplication, but it includes both the aphA1-containing transposon Tn4352 and a transposon, Tn6029, carrying genes derived from RSF1010 and from Tn2. However, Tn4352 and Tn6029 overlap, sharing one IS26 copy. This suggests that they do not move by a standard transpositional mechanism. A circular intermediate, carrying only the region containing the resistance gene(s) and one of the IS26 bounding it, is proposed as an intermediate.",

In this study, we amplified and sequenced the entire ERG11 coding sequence of 72 isolates of C. albicans to search for possible mutations. Twenty-seven silent mutations and 14 missense mutations were identified. While the mutations K342R and V437I were found as single-amino-acid changes in Erg11p, other mutations were detected simultaneously in individual isolates. Several different clinical isolates had the same pattern of multiple amino acid alternations: (1) A114S with Y257H was identified in 11 resistant and 3 susceptible dose-dependent isolates without any other silent mutation and may be associated with resistance; (2) Y132H combined with G450E was identified in two fluconazole-resistant isolates and is known to contribute to resistance; and (3) the coexistence of D116E, K128T, Y132H, and G465S was first described in five reduced-susceptibility isolates, but the correlation of this pattern with resistance is still uncertain.

The genetic basis for nisin resistance development is as yet unknown. We analyzed changes in gene expression following nisin resistance development in Listeria monocytogenes 412 by restriction fragment differential display. The mutant had increased expression of a protein with strong homology to the glycosyltransferase domain of high-molecular-weight penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), a histidine protein kinase, a protein of unknown function, and ClpB (putative functions from homology). The three former proteins had increased expression in a total of six out of 10 independent mutants originating from five different wild-type strains, indicating a prevalent nisin resistance mechanism under the employed isolation conditions. Increased expression of the putative PBP may affect the cell wall composition and thereby alter the sensitivity to cell wall-targeting compounds. The mutants had an isolate-specific increase in sensitivity to different beta-lactams and a slight decrease in sensitivity to another lantibiotic, mersacidin. A model incorporating these observations is proposed based on current knowledge of nisin's mode of action.",

The majority of L. monocytogenes isolates were resistant to oxacillin (99%, 89/90) and ceftriaxone (72%, 65/90), while few isolates were resistant to clindamycin (21%, 19/90) and ciprofloxacin (2%, 2/90). When selected sources of L. monocytogenes are compared, resistance to ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and oxacillin ranged from 27% to 86%, 7% to 43%, and 96% to 100%, respectively. Resistance to ciprofloxacin (6%, 2/34), quinupristin/dalfopristin (7%, 1/14), and tetracycline (7%, 1/15) was observed with L. monocytogenes isolated from food, animal, and environmental sources, respectively. All L. welshimeri isolates (6/6) were resistant to streptomycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin, oxacillin, penicillin, and clindamycin, while most isolates (67%, 4/6) were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. All L. innocua isolates (4/4) were resistant to oxacillin and penicillin, whereas 75% (3/4) of isolates were resistant to tetracycline, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin. Resistant isolates were negative for aadA, strA-B, sul I-II, penA, vat(A-E), vga(A-B), and vgb(A-B). However, tetM was detected among tetracycline-resistant isolates. L. welshimeri was resistant to more of the tested antimicrobials than the other two Listeria species tested, but resistance was not attributed to selected resistance genes. These data demonstrate the variability in resistance among Listeria species. However, the human pathogen L. monocytogenes appears to be the least resistant among the tested species.",

The present study used quinolone-susceptible field isolates representing epidemiologically relevant serovars and phage types Salmonella Hadar and Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 and DT204c to select fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants in vitro. Three selection steps were necessary to obtain high-level fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants (MICCip > or = 8 microg/ml). All first-step mutants examined had a single gyrA mutation (affecting either Ser83 or Asp87). Additional topoisomerase mutations affecting gyrA (Asp87), gyrB (Ser464), and parC (Gly78) were detected in second- and third-step mutants. Introducing into the respective mutants the corresponding plasmid-coded quinolone-susceptible allele of either gyrA, gyrB, or parC resulted in reduction of quinolone resistance, indicating a role for these mutations in quinolone resistance. In the presence of an inhibitor of RND-type efflux pumps, the susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol of second- and third-step mutants increased by two to four serial dilution steps, providing evidence that an efflux-mediated resistance mechanism contributes to the development of high-level fluoroquinolone resistance in salmonellae.",

Between July 2006 and July 2007, 18 E. coli were collected from cattle that were found to possess a bla(CTX-M) belonging to group 1. bla(CTX-M-15/28) was the predominant type, and it was associated with plasmids of several different inc/rep types. In addition, bla(CTX-M-1) and bla(CTX-M-3) were also detected. Plasmids encoding the bla(CTX-M) genes belonged to incompatibility groups I1, F, and A/C. Analysis of the non-beta-lactam resistance genes associated with each CTX-M-bearing plasmid demonstrated that F plasmids frequently carried a larger number of resistance genes than IncI1 plasmids, which rarely carried additional resistance genes. All bla(CTX-M) carrying plasmids were positive by polymerase chain reaction for an ISEcp1-like element.",

E. coli were isolated from chicken at the third and fifth week of age and tested for antimicrobial resistance during the course of fattening. Resistance to sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim, which was used in four flocks within the first days of life, decreased significantly in all six flocks between the third and fifth week of broiler chicken's life (mean 65.9% vs. 54.3%). By contrast, resistance to spectinomycin increased significantly in all six flocks within the same period (mean 36.1% vs. 57.0%); doxycycline resistance increased significantly in five of six flocks (mean 19.2% vs. 41.7%), although both substances were not used for treatment. Of the sulfonamide resistance genes sul1, sul2, and sul3, sul2 was most frequently found (up to 60%). The prevalence of sul2 increased significantly between weeks 3 and 5, if the chicken were treated with sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim in the first days of life. If sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim was not used, then the prevalence of sul2 decreased significantly in the same period. The prevalence of sul1+qacE\u03941 (classical class 1 integrons) was significantly higher in E. coli from sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim-treated flocks (9.63%), compared to untreated flocks (2.92%). The detection of phenotypes that potentially indicate plasmid-borne AmpC-\u03b2-lactamases was inversely associated with sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim treatment. ESBL phenotypes were found without selective enrichment in four of six flocks. Of all isolated E. coli, 1.8% (n=8) had an ESBL phenotype. ESBL strains differed in their accompanying resistances and/or enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequences. In conclusion, clonal dissemination seems not to be a major cause of ESBL detection on a chicken farm with all-in all-out production mode.",

The capsular polysaccharides are not only important virulence factors but also the target of vaccine development efforts. Serotypes III (24.6%), V (23.4%), Ia (17.8%), and II (16.3%) were the most prevalent among 252 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates collected during 1999-2002 in the largest hospital of Lisbon, Portugal. The substantial proportion of bacteremic patients (17 neonates and 21 adults) in this period illustrates the present importance of S. agalactiae as a cause of invasive disease. All isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin (MIC(50) = 0.064 microg/ml; MIC(90) = 0.094 microg/ml, range 0.008-0.094), cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, ofloxacin, and vancomycin. Resistance was found to tetracycline (75.4%), erythromycin (10.7%), and clindamycin (9.9%). Of the 27 erythromycin-resistant isolates, 70.4% had the cMLS(B), 22.2% the iMLS(B), and 7.4% the M phenotype. All isolates presenting the M phenotype carried the mef(A) gene, whereas the erm(B) gene was found in a large fraction of MLS(B) isolates (n = 17) and only a small proportion (n = 7) the erm(A) gene [erm(TR) variant]. All isolates carried a single macrolide-resistance determinant. Macrolide resistance was not attributable to a single clone as evidenced by distinct serotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoretic profiles. Careful surveillance of S. agalactiae invasive infections in Portugal is essential, and the treatment or intrapartum prophylaxis of patients who are allergic to penicillin should be guided by contemporary resistance patterns observed in the country.",

        "abstract": "Human Salmonella infections are common; most infections are self-limiting, however severe disease may occur. Antimicrobial agents, while not essential for the treatment of Salmonella gastroenteritis, are essential for the treatment of thousands of patients each year with invasive infections. Fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins are the drugs-of-choice for invasive Salmonella infections in humans; alternative antimicrobial choices are limited by increasing antimicrobial resistance, limited efficacy, and less desirable pharmacodynamic properties. Antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella results from the use of antimicrobial agents in food animals, and these antimicrobial resistant Salmonella are subsequently transmitted to humans, usually through the food supply. The antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates collected from persons with Salmonella infections show more resistance to antimicrobial agents used in agriculture than to antimicrobial agents used for the treatment of Salmonella infections in humans. Because of the adverse health consequences in humans and animals associated with the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella, there is an urgent need to emphasize non-antimicrobial infection control strategies, such as improved sanitation and hygiene, to develop guidelines for the prudent usage of antimicrobial agents, and establishment of adequate public health safeguards to minimize the development and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance and dissemination of Salmonella resistant to these agents.",

Antimicrobial resistance in Haemophilus influenzae has not increased in the last decade. Of the 498 isolates tested, 12.4% produced beta-lactamase and >95% were susceptible to all antimicrobials except ampicillin. In contrast, there was a rapid increase of resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of the 312 isolates tested, 24.7% exhibited decreased susceptibility to penicillin (13.5% showed low-level and 11.2% high-level resistance), 13.8% were resistant to erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin, and 13.6% to cefuroxime and to tetracycline. Of the 38 Moraxella catarrhalis tested, 81.6% produced beta-lactamase. Resistance to penicillin, cefuroxime, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin in S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase production in H. influenzae were significantly higher in pediatric patients than in adults.

In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of VRE in the teaching hospitals of the University of Debrecen. Of 7,271 Enterococcus-containing clinical samples collected between 2004 and 2009, we identified 16 VRE. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to detect Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, and Enterococcus gallinarum. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed to identify the vancomycin resistance genes: vanA, vanB, vanC1/C2, vanD, vanE, and vanG. Restriction digestion with SalI and HindIII was introduced to differentiate the vanC1 and vanC2 genes from each other. Genetic relationships between the strains were investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Overall, we identified the vanC1 resistance gene in 14 E. gallinarum and the vanC2 resistance gene in two E. casseliflavus strains. Except for two samples, the isolates had different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types, suggesting sporadic emergence of the resistant bacteria. In addition, antibiotic resistance profile was determined by E-test. Three E. gallinarum strains proved to be resistant to gentamicin because of the presence of the aacA-aphD gene. Although the prevalence of VRE in Debrecen is rather low, the appearance of multiple resistances is of concern.",

We found that 92.2% (n=353) produced a \u03b2-lactamase. Nonsusceptibility rates to erythromycin and azithromycin, determined using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints, were 40.3% and 22.5%, respectively; nonsusceptibility rates determined using pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics breakpoints, however, were 59% and 60.1%. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90) values were >256 \u03bcg/ml. Nonsusceptibility rates varied by region from 9.7% in Dongguan to 75.9% in Jinan. Further, concomitant resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics was also observed. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of 27/37 high-level macrolide-resistant M. catarrhalis isolates showed that closely related pulsotypes dominated, with a total of 11 different pulsotypes being observed. The closely related pulsotypes were observed in isolates originating from all six Chinese cities investigated, possibly as a consequence of the mobility of the Chinese population. Sixteen patterns of 23S rRNA mutations were found among 97 selected isolates using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, but no known ermA, ermB, mefA, or mefE genes could be detected. Mutations A2982T and A2796T in 23S rRNA were related to high-level macrolide resistance (MICs ranging from 24 to >256 \u03bcg/ml), while an A2983T mutation was associated with low-level macrolide resistance (MICs ranging from 0.19 to 16 \u03bcg/ml).",

All isolates were resistant to almost all antibiotics tested with a high-level resistance to imipenem (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] >32\u2009mg/L) with one strain showing resistance to colistin (MIC=16\u2009mg/L). The results of the modified Hodge test and the modified Carba NP test were positive for all isolates. Besides, the activity of \u03b2-lactamases was inhibited by EDTA in only two isolates. All the 12 isolates contained the naturally occurring blaOXA-51-like gene. Ten of them harbored the OXA \u03b2-lactamases: blaOXA-23 (six isolates) and blaOXA-24 (four isolates) genes, while two isolates were positive for blaNDM-1 gene. The colistin-resistant isolate producing OXA-24 enzyme harbored a single mutation in the pmrB gene. Multilocus sequence typing demonstrated that the 12 isolates belonged to 2 clones: 10 to ST2 and 2 to ST85.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Here, we describe the mechanisms of carbapenem resistance and we report the first colistin and carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii clinical isolate from a patient in Algeria.",

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis excluded clonal isolates, and 29 isolates were subjected to multilocus sequence typing (MLST), detection of the amino acid substitutions in the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of GyrA and ParC, beta-lactamase typing, and identification of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. PCR-based replicon typing was performed, after PMQR gene transfer. Four major sequence types (STs) or clonal complexes (CCs), that is, ST37, CC17 (consisting of ST17 and ST20), ST11, and CC528 (consisting of ST528 and ST1130), were found, and they accounted for 48.2% of the isolates tested. Amino acid substitutions in the QRDRs and the presence of PMQR genes were identified in 20 (68.9%) and 18 (62.0%) isolates, respectively. The replicon type of three PMQR-carrying plasmids was IncN, but others were nontypable. Fifteen (83.3%) of the 18 PMQR-harboring isolates coharbored blaCTX-M and/or blaDHA-1. Ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae clinical isolates demonstrating cephalosporin resistance often belong to the global epidemic lineages and possess PMQR and/or QRDR substitutions.",

All isolates originated from different farms and were collected between 2002 and 2005. None of the isolates displayed acquired resistance to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, and nitrofurantoin. Acquired resistance to streptomycin was detected in 83%, to oxytetracycline in 81%, and to trimethoprim in 71% of the isolates, as indicated by a bimodal distribution of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these antimicrobials. The MICs of enrofloxacin displayed a monomodal distribution with tailing toward the higher MIC values, possibly indicating reduced susceptibility of a minority of isolates (3 out of the 64). For the quinolone antimicrobial agents flumequin and oxolinic acid, acquired resistance was encountered in 8% and 6% of the strains, respectively. All strains were intrinsically resistant to the polypeptide antimicrobial agent colistin. Seventy-three percent of the isolates were shown to have acquired resistance to at least three antimicrobial agents. The results of this study emphasize the strict need to control both the prophylactic and curative use of antimicrobial agents in Vietnamese aquaculture.",

Quinolones have been used as an alternative therapy for Q fever. In this study, quinolone-resistance-determining regions of the genes coding for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV were analyzed by DNA sequencing from an in vitro fluoroquinolone-resistant C. burnetii strain (Q212). Sequencing and aligning of DNA gyrase encoding genes (gyrA and gyrB) and topoisomerase IV genes (parC and parE) revealed one gyrA mutation leading to the amino acid substitution Asp87Gly (Escherichia coli numbering), two gyrB mutations leading to the amino acid substitutions Ser431Pro and Met518Ile, and three parC mutations leading to the amino acid substitutions Asp69Asn, Thr80Ile, and Gly104Ser. The corresponding alignment of the C. burnetii Q212 reference strain, the in vitro developed fluoroquinolone-resistant C. burnetii Q212 strain, and E. coli resulted in the identification of several other naturally occurring mutations within and outside the quinolone-resistance-determining regions of C. burnetii providing indications of possible natural resistance to fluoroquinolones. The present study adds additional potential mutations in the DNA topoisomerases that may be involved in fluoroquinolone resistance in C. burnetii due to their previous characterization in other bacterial species.",

In Ghana, data on antimicrobial resistance and the prevalence of multidrug-resistant pneumococcal clones are scarce; hence, the aim of this study was to determine the antibiogram of S. pneumoniae recovered from Ghanaian children younger than six years of age and to what extent resistances were due to the spread of certain sero- and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) types. The susceptibility of 115 pneumococcal isolates, recovered in a previous study, to six antimicrobials was determined by disk diffusion test. Overall, 90.4% of isolates were intermediate penicillin resistant, 99.1% were trimethoprim resistant, 73.0% were tetracycline resistant, and 33.9% were sulfamethoxazole resistant. Low resistance was recorded for erythromycin (2.6%) and cefotaxime (5.2%). Overall, 72.2% of isolates were resistant to penicillin (I or R) and at least two other antimicrobials. MLST of 20 isolates showing resistance to at least four antimicrobials revealed a high diversity documented by 16 different clones, none of which had previously been associated with multidrug resistance. The resistances found may have emerged due to nonprudent antimicrobial use practices and there is a need to monitor and promote prudent antimicrobial usage in Ghana.",

Antibiotic resistance levels were high; 152 (94.4%) were cotrimoxazole nonsusceptible (134 fully resistant) and 124 (77%) were intermediately penicillin resistant. Isolates nonsusceptible to penicillin and cotrimoxazole (PNCNP) were found among 24 of the 29 serotypes encountered, 15 of which have rarely or never had documented nonsusceptibility to penicillin. These included serotypes 3, 4, 7C, 7F, 10A, 11A, 13, 15A, 15B, 16F, 17F, 19B, 21, 35A, and 35B. Segments of pbp2b genes from 9 PNCNP (serotypes 3, 13, 15A, 16F, 20, and 35A) were typical of resistance-conferring alleles in that they were highly divergent and contained two substitutions thought to be critical for resistance. Similarly, the dhfr genes from 3 PNCNP were divergent and contained a substitution required for cotrimoxazole resistance. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of 48 PNCNP revealed 33 sequence types (STs), none of which were previously recorded at http://www.mlst.net. Comparisons with all known STs revealed that 23 of these STs were unrelated to other known STs, whereas 10 STs were highly related to STs from internationally disseminated strains, including 2 of the 26 antibiotic-resistant clones recognized by the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network. Based upon differing serotypes expressed by strains of identical or closely similar genotypes, there has been an extensive history of capsular switching within seven genetic clusters represented by these 10 STs and related STs described at http://www.mlst.net.",

        "abstract": "Benzalkonium chloride is one of the invaluable biocides that is extensively used in healthcare settings as well as in the food processing industry. After exposing wild-type Salmonella Typhimurium 14028s or its AcrAB inactivation mutant to gradually increasing levels of benzalkonium chloride, resistance mutants S-41, S-150, S-AB-23, S-AB-38, and S-AB-73 were selected and these mutants also showed a 2-64-fold stable minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) increase to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline. In S-41 and S-150, the expression of acrB was increased 2.7- and 7.6-fold, and \u0394tolC or \u0394acrAB mutants of S-41 and S-150 showed the same MICs to all tested antimicrobials as the equivalent Salmonella Typhimurium 14028s mutants. However, in S-AB-23, S-AB-38, and S-AB-73, the expression of acrF was increased 96-, 230-, and 267-fold, respectively, and \u0394tolC or \u0394acrEF mutants of S-AB-23, S-AB-38, and S-AB-73 showed the similar MICs to all tested antimicrobials as the \u0394tolC mutant of Salmonella Typhimurium 14028s. Our data showed that constitutively over-expressed AcrAB working through TolC was the main resistance mechanism in ST14028s benzalkonium chloride resistance mutants. However, after AcrAB had been inactivated, benzalkonium chloride-resistant mutants could still be selected and constitutively over-expressed, AcrEF became the dominant efflux pump working through TolC and being responsible for the increasing antimicrobial resistance. These data indicated that different mechanisms existed for acrB and acrF constitutive over-expression. Since exposure to benzalkonium chloride may lead to Salmonella mutants with a decreased susceptibility to quinolones, which is currently one of the drugs of choice for the treatment of life-threatening salmonelosis, research into the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the benzalkonium chloride resistance mutants will be of increasing importance.",

        "abstract": "We carried out the first study of Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates in Cuba by multilocus sequence typing linking the molecular typing data with the presence of virulence determinants and the antibiotic resistance genes. A total of 23 E. faecalis isolates recovered from several clinic sources and geographic areas of Cuba during a period between 2000 and 2005 were typed by multilocus sequence typing. Thirteen sequence types (STs) including five novel STs were identified, and the ST 64 (clonal complex [CC] 8), ST 6 (CC2), ST 21(CC21), and ST 16 (CC58) were found in more than one strain. Sixty-seven percent of STs corresponded to STs reported previously in Spain, Poland, and The Netherlands, and other STs (ST115, ST64, ST6, and ST40) were genetically close to those detected in the United States. Prevalence of both antimicrobial resistance genes [aac(6')-aph(2''), aph(3'), ant(6), ant(3'')(9), aph(2'')-Id, aph(2'')-Ic, erm(B), erm(A), erm(C), mef(A), tet(M), and tet(L)] and virulence genes (agg, gelE, cylA, esp, ccf, and efaAfs) were examined by polymerase chain reaction. Aminoglycoside resistance genes aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, aph(3'), ant(6), ant(3'')(9) were more frequently detected in ST6, ST16, ST23, ST64, and ST115. The multidrug resistance was distributed to all STs detected, except for ST117 and singleton ST225. The presence of cyl gene was specifically linked to the ST64 and ST16. Presence of the esp, gel, and agg genes was not specific to any particular ST. This research provided the first insight into the population structure of E. faecalis in Cuba, that is, most Cuban strains were related to European strains, whereas others to U.S. strains. The CC2, CC21, and CC8, three of the biggest CCs in the world, were evidently circulating in Cuba, associated with multidrug resistance and virulence traits.",

The dfr1 gene detected on the chromosome of 40 different clinical strains of C. jejuni was studied further regarding structure and genetic organization. Most of the dfr1 genes were found as integron cassettes inserted in the chromosome. In 36% of the examined isolated, the dfr1 gene showed identity to that previously characterized in trimethoprim-resistant Escherichia coli. In 40% of the cases, however, a variant of the dfr1 gene containing a 90-bp direct repeat was detected, and in 5% of the isolates, the repeat-containing dfr1 variant was found to occur in the form of two cassettes in tandem in an integron context.

When used against a penicillin-resistant ciprofloxacin-susceptible strain (Clinafloxacin MIC 0.12 microg/ml), clinafloxacin at a dose of 20 mg/kg per day b.i.d. decreased bacterial concentration by -5.10 log cfu/ml at 24 hr.

In routine clinical laboratory practice, the coagulase production is used as criterion of pathogenicity related to S. aureus, but S. intermedius is frequently misidentified-being mistaken for S. aureus-and consequently its real incidence underestimated. S. intermedius have been found only occasionally in human beings, and methicillin-resistance is very rare for this organism. Even if the genetic element responsible for methicillin-resistance--the mecA gene carried by diverse staphylococcal chromosomal cassettes--has been described in various staphylococcal species, the current literature doesn't report any case of S. intermedius isolate carrying SCCmec-like elements.

The resistance gene responsible was shown to be located on a conjugative 60-kb plasmid designated pCH0905. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for cefotaxime and ceftazidime of the original isolate and the transconjugates were 256 mug/ml. Isoelectric focusing of a protein preparation from the K. pneumoniae strain showed beta-lactamases with the pI values of 7.6 and 6.3. A 1,080-bp fragment amplified with PCR was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. The nucleotide sequence of the complete 1,080 bp was determined. Sequence analysis revealed that the bla(TEM) gene of pCH0905 differed from bla(TEM-1) by two mutations, leading to the following amino acid substitutions: the glutamic acid residue at position 104 by lysine and the glycine residue at position 238 by serine (Ambler numbering). The association of these two mutations was described previously in TEM-15 beta-lactamase, but this is the first detection of this enzyme in Tunisia.",

Sequence comparisons revealed significant homology between C. coli and the cmeABC operon of Campylobacter jejuni. Conservation of functional sequence domains and motifs were noted among C. coli and similar operons in unrelated organisms. A transcriptional regulatory gene cmeR located proximal to cmeABC was also identified. C. coli CIT-382 harbored the Thr-86-Ile amino acid substitution in the gyrA gene. Accumulation studies with ethidium bromide in the presence of known efflux pump inhibitors confirmed the presence of efflux pump activity in C. coli CIT-382. The efflux pump inhibitor PAbetaN had no effect on the MICs to quinolones. Our data suggest that the gyrA gene mutation is the main contributor to the high-level nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistance observed in this Irish C. coli CIT-382 isolate.",

Antimicrobial resistance patterns for 12 antimicrobial agents were generated using broth microdilution. The presence and characterization of the \u03b2-lactamase genes blaA and blaB were studied using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), respectively. The expression of \u03b2-lactamase BlaA and BlaB was detected using double-disc diffusion. Y. enterocolitica strains showed resistance to ampicillin (92%), streptomycin (13%), and sulfamethoxazole (2%). Intermediate susceptibility to tetracycline was shown by two Y. enterocolitica strains. All Y. pseudotuberculosis strains were susceptible to all tested antimicrobial agents. Most (99%) of the Y. enterocolitica strains carried both \u03b2-lactamase genes. One strain of bioserotype 3/O:3 lacked both genes. In contrast, all Y. pseudotuberculosis strains carried neither of the \u03b2-lactamase genes. Homogeneity was detected in all blaA and blaB genes of Y. enterocolitica using PCR-RFLP. The majority (89%) of Y. enterocolitica strains expressed both \u03b2-lactamase enzymes, whereas none of the Y. pseudotuberculosis strains showed expression of either enzyme. Also, it seems that the resistance of Y. enterocolitica has not changed during the last years.",

        "abstract": "We characterized susceptibilities and genotypes in a series of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from five cases of urinary tract infections (UTIs) to evaluate clonal shifts of carbapenem resistance. In one case, a series of isolates showed different susceptibility patterns for carbapenems but an identical genotype. In another case, genotypes varied among 4 P. aeruginosa isolates from recurrent UTIs over 9 months. Although the patient had been treated with no antibiotic immediately before isolation, the susceptibility patterns for carbapenems and ceftazidime varied. Further analysis in these two cases of outer membrane protein profiles showed that loss of OprD production resulted in reduced susceptibilities to carbapenems in all of the carbapenem-resistant isolates. Loss of OprD production was likely due to oprD gene inactivation in both of cases, since the carbapenem-resistant isolates showed no cross resistance to levofloxacin and chloramphenicol compared with the carbapenem-susceptible isolates. There was another case in which all isolates showed similar susceptibility patterns for carbapenems and ceftazidime, and an identical genotype during the intermittent use of antibiotics over 5 months. In two cases, a single course of antibiotic therapy resulted in eradication of P. aeruginosa. Our results suggest that clonal shifts of carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa may result from loss of OprD during antibiotic treatment. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to monitor susceptibilities to antibiotics, especially carbapenems, in P. aeruginosa isolated during therapy.",

MSSP were genetically more diverse than MRSP by multi-locus sequence typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Three different spa types (t06, t02, t05) and two SCCmec types (II-III and V) were detected in the MRSP isolates. All MRSP and two MSSP strains were multidrug-resistant. Several antibiotic resistance genes (mecA, blaZ, tet(M), tet(K), aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia, aph(3')-III, ant(6)-Ia, sat4, erm(B), lnu(A), dfr(G), and catpC221) were identified by microarray and double mutations in the gyrA and grlA genes and a single mutation in the rpoB gene were detected by sequence analysis. No differences were detected between MSSP and MRSP in the chlorhexidine acetate (CHA) minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). However, two MSSP had elevated MIC to triclosan (TCL) and one to benzalkonium chloride and ethidium bromide. One MSSP isolate harboured a qacA gene, while in another a qacB gene was detected. None of the isolates harboured the sh-fabI gene. Three of the biocide products studied had high bactericidal activity (Otodine(\u00ae), Clorexyderm Spot Gel(\u00ae), Dermocanis Piocure-M(\u00ae)), while Skingel(\u00ae) failed to achieve a five log reduction in the bacterial counting. S. pseudintermedius have become a serious therapeutic challenge in particular if methicillin- resistance and/or multidrug-resistance are involved.

        "abstract": "Under field conditions, three commercial antimicrobials were sequentially prescribed to 16,000 broiler chickens during their rearing period, via drinking water using subtherapeutic levels for 3 days. A control group of 16,000 broilers was placed in the same controlled environment poultry house. Feed diet and fecal samples from both groups were collected periodically. One sample of the drinking water along with samples from the broiler house environment was also collected 1 day before bird placement. Samples were plated onto Tergitol BCIG Agar media; a maximum of 26 Escherichia coli were isolated per sample, and their susceptibility was tested to 12 antimicrobials by disk diffusion agar method. We have observed that day-old chicks were rapidly colonized by new antibiotic-resistant patterns shortly after treatment with lincomycin associated with spectinomycin. After medication with the second (sulfadiazine with trimethoprim) and third (tylosin) antimicrobials, a more radical displacement was observed, and, concurrently, antimicrobial resistance phenotypes have become more complex. In contrast, more than 70% of the strains isolated in control group during the experiment displayed exactly the same resistance pattern found in the day-old chicks. This study provides clear evidence that a sequential medication of a broiler flock, with different antimicrobial classes during short periods of time for prophylactic objectives, was accompanied by a dramatic increase in both antimicrobial resistance rates and phenotype diversity of E. coli strains.",

        "abstract": "A total of 70 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from postoperative infections in hospitalized horses were isolated between January 2005 and January 2011. Among them, 12 isolates were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 18 were borderline-oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA), and 40 were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). During the same period, the equine clinic personnel were screened for nasal carriage of BORSA and MRSA. Genotyping revealed that BORSA ST1(MLST)-t2863(spa) isolates were responsible for most equine infections and were the main isolates found in colonized members of the personnel between 2005 and 2007, and that in 2007, MRSA ST398-t011-IVa(SCCmec) emerged in infection sites and personnel, replacing BORSA. Besides decreased susceptibility to oxacillin, all MRSA and BORSA of these two major clonal lineages displayed resistance to gentamicin and kanamycin conferred by the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia gene and to trimethoprim conferred by dfr(K) in MRSA and dfr(A) in BORSA. All MRSA had additional resistance to tetracycline conferred by tet(M), whereas BORSA generally also display resistance to streptomycin conferred by str. The number of hospital-acquired MRSA infections in horses could be limited after the introduction of basic hygiene measures and personnel decolonization. Two MRSA carriers could not be decolonized using mupirocin, and a year after decolonization, additional members were recolonized with MRSA. Hygiene measures should, therefore, be maintained to limit the transmission of S. aureus between personnel and horses.",

After the patient had received several antibiotic therapies, a strain was isolated showing resistance to ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin. Polymerase chain reaction analyses and sequencing revealed the presence of the beta-lactamase gene bla(TEM-1), two mutations (A502T and R517H) in the ftsI gene encoding the transpeptidase region of the penicillin-binding protein 3, and one mutation in the ribosomal protein gene L4 (G65D) conferring resistance to beta-lactams and macrolides, respectively. Additionally, the plasmid-encoded aac(6')-Ib-cr gene mediating slightly reduced susceptibility to quinolones and two mutations in the DNA gyrase gene gyrA and one mutation in the topoisomerase IV gene parC were identified leading to a high-level fluoroquinolone-resistant phenotype. In conclusion, the treatment of H. influenzae infections accompanied by high bacterial loads such as bronchopneumonia can be complicated by the selection of multidrug-resistant strains. Moreover, the emergence of aac(6')-Ib-cr in H. influenzae causing low fluoroquinolone resistance levels might have contributed to the selection of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV mutants.",

The bacterial population isolated from baseline pharyngeal swabs showed an overall prtF1 positivity rate of 33%.

Failed bacterial eradication was demonstrated in 124 patients. The prtF1 positivity rate remained unchanged in strains isolated before and after therapy in patients treated with macrolides (9/54). On the other hand, the positivity rate for the prtF1 gene was significantly higher (p = 0.015) in strains isolated after therapy with beta-lactams (21/70) as compared to baseline isolates (6/70), indicating a differential selection imposed on the organism by these agents.

Nasal and throat swabs were collected and plated onto selective media to isolate methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), followed by antibiotic resistance testing and molecular analysis of the isolates. While no MRSA was detected, overall, 23.7% (31/131) of participants were found to harbor S. aureus in their nose, throat, or both. Fifteen isolates displayed resistance to one or more tested antibiotics, and the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes were present at a high level (29% [9/31] of S. aureus-positive participants). Younger age and tobacco use were associated with increased risk of S. aureus carriage. Our results suggest that carriage of PVL-positive S. aureus is common among rural Iowans, even in the absence of detectable MRSA colonization.",

        "abstract": "A broth microdilution method was used to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of 20 Brachyspira intermedia isolates obtained from different layer flocks in Belgium and The Netherlands between 2008 and 2010. The antimicrobial agents used were tylosin, tilmicosin, tiamulin, valnemulin, doxycycline, and lincomycin. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) distribution patterns of tylosin, tilmicosin, lincomycin, and doxycycline were bimodal, demonstrating acquired resistance against doxycycline in three strains, against the macrolides in two strains, and against lincomycin in one strain. The MICs of tiamulin and valnemulin showed a monomodal distribution, but with tailing toward the higher MIC values, possibly suggesting low-level acquired resistance in six isolates. Sequencing revealed a G1058C mutation in the 16S rRNA gene in all doxycycline-resistant strains. The strain resistant to tylosin, tilmicosin, and lincomycin had an A2058T mutation in the 23S rRNA gene.",

In all protein spot differences, five protein spots that are upregulated in INH-resistant strains were identified as Rv1446c, Rv3028c, Rv0491, Rv2971, and Rv2145 by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of fight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Most of these differential proteins are membrane proteins, which are known to be rich in potential diagnostic and therapeutic protein targets. These results suggest that the differentially expressed proteins from INH-resistant strains might be used as potential immunodiagnosis antigens and candidate novel drug targets against drug-resistant tuberculosis.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug resistance in Bacteroides spp. and related genera is uncommon and has not been described in Latin America until now. We studied phenotypically and genotypically the multidrug resistance of 10 clinical strains of Bacteroides, two of Parabacteroides distasonis, and one of Pseudoflavonifractor capillosus recovered in a national hospital between 2006 and 2010. To this end, we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, imipenem, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and metronidazole using E-tests, evaluated the isolates for \u03b2-lactamases with nitrocefin hydrolysis tests, performed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screening of erm, tet, and nim genes, obtained partial gyrA sequences, and studied the effect of tazobactam and efflux pump inhibitors (EPI) on the MIC of cefotaxime, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin. Three isolates were resistant to four different classes of antibiotics and 10 were resistant to three. \u03b2-lactam resistance was in most cases due to \u03b2-lactamases susceptible of partial inhibition by tazobactam. Ten isolates were cfxA-positive and two isolates had cepA. Twelve isolates were highly resistant to clindamycin and nine were highly resistant to ciprofloxacin. However, these phenotypes were not linked to ermA, ermB, ermF, and ermG or mutations in gyrA. Addition of EPI lowered the MICs of clindamycin and ciprofloxacin of one and four isolates, respectively. Twelve isolates had tetQ and four were positive for tetM. In both cases, genes of the two-component system RteAB accompanied tet genes. Although metronidazole susceptibility was universal, nim genes were not present. To our knowledge, this is the first report of multidrug resistance due to less commonly identified or alternative mechanisms in strains of Bacteroides and related species from a developing country.",

Strains were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility by agar disk diffusion method and E-test for colistin (COL); integrons and gene cassettes content by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing; PMQR genes by PCR and DNA sequencing; clonal relatedness by multilocus sequence typing; and plasmids by PCR-based replicon typing. Class 1 integrons were detected in 69 isolates (47 farm rabbits, 14 wild rabbits, and 8 wild hares). No class 2 integrons were found. Five different gene cassettes arrays were identified (aadA1, dfrA1-aadA1, orf in682-dhfrA5, orf in682-dfrA5-orfD ins21, and dfrA17-aadA5). Fifteen percent (17/113) of isolates carried oqxAB, no other PMQR determinants. All but one oqxAB-positive E. coli strains were recovered from farm rabbits. Seven out of 17 strains were associated with the predominant ST238 and carried from three to six different plasmid types, such as IncF, IncHI1, IncI1, IncN, IncP, IncX1, IncY, and ColE. COL resistance was identified in 6/113 strains (5.3%). This study provides new insights on the resistance phenotypes and the prevalence and dissemination of oqxAB in E. coli from farm and wild lagomorphs, suggesting that these animals may be reservoir of these genetic determinants in Italy and thus a potential source of PMQR E. coli for humans. PMQR mediated by oqxAB has not been detected in farm and wild lagomorphs before.",

During in vitro mating experiments, the erm (B) gene was exchanged between porcine Streptococcus suis and human S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. oralis strains. The presence of different tetracycline resistance genes and the int Tn 1545 gene was determined in animal streptococci carrying the erm (B) gene. Although tet(M) and int Tn 1545 genes were detected in 24% of the porcine and pork carcass streptococcal strains, the tet(O) gene was the predominant tetracycline resistance gene in these strains (81%). The latter gene was co-transferred with the erm (B) gene from porcine S. suis strains to human streptococci in the mating experiments. These results show that, identical erm (B) gene sequences were present in animal and human streptococci and that transfer of the erm (B) gene from porcine S. suis to human streptococci and vice versa is possible, but probably occurs at a low frequency.",

All 65 clinical isolates were resistant (MICs > or = 4 microg/mL) to the following fluoroquinolones: ofloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and trovafloxacin. These isolates were cross-resistant to chloramphenicol (65 isolates, 100%), tetracycline (65 isolates, 100%), cefuroxime (64 isolates, 98.5%), ampicillin (57 isolates, 87.7%), gentamicin (53 isolates, 81.5%), and cephalothin (24 isolates, 36.9%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed a high diversity among the genomes of these isolates and indicated that clonal spread was not responsible for the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance in the hospital. Sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified products of the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA and parC showed that all isolates carrying double mutations in gyrA at codon 83 and 87 and at least one parC mutation at codon 80 and/or 84. The mutation at codon 83 of GyrA from serine to leucine (S83L) was present in all the clinical isolates. The most prevalent pattern was the S83L mutation and the mutation at codon 87 from an aspartate to an asparagine (D87N) of GyrA plus a mutation from a serine to an isoleucine (S80I) at codon 80 of ParC (63.2%). This indicated that the presence of high-level resistance to quinolones in clinical E. coli isolates were associated with mutations at hot spots, codon 83 and 87 in GyrA and followed by subsequent mutation in either codon 80 and/or 84 in ParC.",

Most of E. coli isolates from farm worker and animal were multiresistant and showed a high resistance to aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, amoxicillin, doxycyline, sulfanilamide, and quinolones. Integrons were found in 57.1% of the resistant E. coli isolates from animals and farm workers.

Class 2 integrons were detected only in resistant E. coli isolates from chickens and have one array cassette of dfrA1- sat1- aadA1- orfX. Dfr17- aadA5 was the most prevalent in resistant E. coli isolates from farm workers, swine, and chickens. Conjugative experiments demonstrated horizontal transfer of class 1 and class 2 integrons between isolates of farm worker and animals.

Random transposon-insertion mutants were screened for altered response to thymol. Of four mutants showing more sensitivity, three were found in rfaQ, whose product is involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and the fourth in the quorum-sensing gene qseC. Mutants showing more resistance had mutations in genes whose products are involved in the degradation of short-lived regulatory and abnormal proteins (the lon gene), menaquinone biosynthesis (menA), an unknown function of a putative membrane protein (yagF), synthesis of a small hypothetical protein (an intergene region between the two small genes yiiE and yiiF), and the efflux pump of cadaverine and lysine (cadB). The antibacterial activities of carvacrol, menthol, and cymene, essential oils structurally similar to thymol, were also determined. Although the level of resistance toward thymol was conserved in the respective mutants qseC, menA, and cadB, knockout mutants displayed different levels of tolerance to carvacrol; inconsistencies in resistance levels were also noted in mutants challenged with menthol. Wild-type and mutant E. coli responded to thymol exposure with a massive potassium efflux that generally corresponded to the resistant rate. The verity of the loci accounting for E. coli response suggests a multitarget mode of the antimicrobial activity of thymol and multitolerance mechanisms.",

However, no standardized phenotypic method is available for detecting these enzymes in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Limited data are available concerning the frequency of PMACBLs in Enterobacteriaceae in Brazil. This study was conducted in response to an increased cefoxitin (CFO) resistance rate of 3.7% in Escherichia coli isolates from urine samples from patients with suspected urinary tract infections during 2010. We collected 2,266 E. coli isolates prospectively during January 2012. A total of 109 (4.8%) isolates were nonsusceptible to CFO. These strains were further examined using multiplex PCR for the presence of genes encoding PMACBLs and using inhibitor assays with CFO and ceftazidime (CAZ) disks with and without phenylboronic acid. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to evaluate clonal dissemination. Genes encoding PMACBLs were detected in 1.8% of the isolates from inpatients and 0.46% of isolates from outpatients. The most prevalent gene was blaCMY-2 and blaCMY-4 was also detected. The phenotypic analysis showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for CMY-2 and CMY-4 when CFO-resistant isolates with a minimum zone diameter difference of 5 mm for CAZ or CAZ and CFO were considered positive. Although most of the isolates were nonclonal, one clonal group with two isolates was observed. Thus, the most frequent PMACBL in E. coli from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil is CMY-2, and both clonal and plasmid-mediated dissemination occur.",

None of the children harbored metronidazole-resistant anaerobic bacteria or Gram-positive vancomycin-resistant bacteria. The median percentage of the oral microflora resistant to each of the antibiotics was ampicillin 1% (range 0.1-23), erythromycin 13% (1-45), penicillin 1% (0-14), and tetracycline 2% (0-88). A total of 432 antibiotic-resistant isolates were recovered that comprised 18 genera and 47 species. Ampicillin resistance was widely distributed throughout different genera and species, whereas tetracycline resistance was predominately found in the streptococci. Multiresistant bacteria were frequently isolated with 28% of isolates exhibiting resistance to two or more antibiotics. Veillonella spp., traditionally considered susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin, were found frequently to be resistant to these two antibiotics. This study demonstrates that a diverse collection of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic, opportunistic, and nonpathogenic bacteria can be readily isolated from, and in some subjects dominate, the oral microflora of primary school children in the absence of recently administered antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "Carbapenems have been considered as last line antibiotics for treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii but carbapenem resistant A. baumannii has been increased during the last decade in many parts of the world. OXA-type \u03b2-lactamase enzymes are the most common cause of carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii and presence of ISAba1 in upstream of these genes may increase the expression of these OXA genes. The aim of this study was to determine, for the first time, the antibiotic resistance pattern and prevalence of OXA type \u03b2-lactamases among nosocomial A. baumannii isolates from northwest of Iran. A total of 100 A. baumannii isolates were recovered from hospitalized patients in a university hospital in northwest of Iran. Sixty-two percent of isolates were resistant to imipenem. All isolates carried bla(OXA-51)-like gene. Among imipenem resistant isolates, 88.7% carried bla(OXA-23)-like, 1.6% carried bla(OXA-40)-like, and 3.2% had bla(OXA-58)-like resistance genes. Ninety percent of isolates contained ISAba1 element and in 74.2% of imipenem resistant isolates, ISAba1 was located in upstream of bla(OXA-23)-like. The results of this study demonstrated high prevalence of OXA-type carbapenemase among MDR A. bumanii in the Northwest of Iran.",

        "abstract": "The spread of carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae is among the most important issues in the antimicrobial resistance. The rapid and recent diffusion of class A and B carbapenemases determined the need of specific diagnostic tests able to detect with high sensitivity this type of resistance and to discriminate between the different enzymes. The aim of this study was to test two carbapenemase detection assays, the Rosco Synergic and the Hyplex polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for screening carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The phenotypic and genotypic tests were evaluated among 108 clinical isolates, including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) (n=50) and metallo-\u03b2-lactamase- (MBL) (n=20), and AmpC- (n=10) producing Enterobacteriaceae. The commercial phenotypic assay showed a high sensitivity performance detecting all KPC and MBL producers, including New Delhi MBL 1 (NDM-1) strains. In addition, the Rosco Synergic assay was able to distinguish specifically between the different mechanisms that confer resistance to carbapenems in Enterobacteriaceae. We also demonstrated that the genotypic test was able to detect all the class A and B carbapenemases showing high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (98%) in a fast and reliable time. Based on these results, both the commercial phenotypic and the genotypic assays could be helpful as confirmatory and discriminatory tests for the detection of class A and class B carbapenemases.",

Susceptible strains and resistant mutants demonstrated similar adhesion capacities to epithelial cells. For Campylobacter coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants with Thr86Ile or Asp90Asn substitutions showed a higher rate of invasion of Caco-2 cells than their isogenic parental strain. Fluoroquinolone resistance did not impact C. coli motility. Mutants harboring Asp90Asn had greater cytotoxic activity than the parental strain. Macrolide resistance had no impact on the studied characteristics of C. coli. For Campylobacter jejuni, fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants had slightly different invasiveness levels and significantly lower motility than the isogenic parental strain. C. jejuni macrolide-resistant mutants with A2074G substitution in the 23S rRNA gene had a higher invasiveness level than its parental strain, but mutants with A2074C in 23S rRNA and G221A in rplD showed reduced motility and similar invasion levels to the susceptible strains. Neither fluoroquinolone nor macrolide resistance appears to affect C. jejuni cytotoxicity. In conclusion, mutations that are frequently encountered in Campylobacter-resistant strains can enhance the invasiveness in Caco-2 cells.",

It produces two chromosomal beta-lactamases: a clavulanic acid-sensitive class A (L2) and a tetrameric carbapenemase (L1 or BlaS). We screened 40 S. maltophilia multidrug-resistant clinical isolates recovered between 1995 and 1998 in the Varese Hospital (Italy) for the presence of the metallo-beta-lactamase. The isolates were investigated by phenotypic profiling (enzymatic activity and antibiotic resistance pattern) and molecular methods such as PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to reveal intraspecies diversity. For the tested S. maltophilia strains, we showed that the beta-lactamase production could be induced by the presence of imipenem (50 microg/ml) in the culture media. Addition of 1 mM dipicolinic acid completely inhibited the hydrolysis of imipenem but decreased that nitrocefin in a strain-dependent manner. Full activity of crude extract towards imipenem could be restored by addition of 1 mM ZnCl2. Finally, the gene encoding the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase from S. maltophilia ULA-511 and 39/95, a clinical strain, were isolated and sequenced. These two strains have a different profile of multidrug resistance. The two metallo-beta-lactamases were found to be isologous. The difference of sensitivity of these two strains was associated to the level of production of the metallo-beta-lactamase.",

        "abstract": "Since the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic in clinical practice was introduced about a decade ago, quinolone-resistant E. coli (QREC) strains are being isolated with increasing frequency. From 1996 to 2000, 297 cases of urinary tract infection (UTI) due to QREC were observed in our hospital; 218 episodes (73.5%) were community acquired. The incidence of QREC UTIs increased steadily from 14.4% to 21.3% during 5 years when we compared the clinical characteristics of 60 QREC UTI with those of 80 quinolone-susceptible E. coli UTIs. Significant differences in susceptibility to various antibiotics were observed between the QREC and QSEC strains of E. coli. The multidrug resistance rate of QREC was much higher (38.3%) than those of quinolone susceptible isolates (18.8%). Prior fluoroquinolone use (p = 0.05), old age (p = 0.001), and a vegetative state (p = 0.03) were the independent risk factors for the acquisition of QREC UTI. The outcome of E. coli UTI is dependent on quinolone resistance. Thirty-day mortality was higher in QREC UTI patients, probably due to aggravation of underlying illness, but not quinolone resistance. On the basis of PFGE analysis, although some clustering was found in the hospital, genomic diversity was found among both the community and nosocomial strains. The increased frequency of QREC UTIs is thus not due to transmission of resistant strains but probably results from the selection of resistant strains from the endogenous flora of patients.",

We obtained 303 bacterial isolates from the wastewater of three hospitals in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. For each isolate, we determined the profile of susceptibility to antimicrobials and the presence of the genes bla(OXA-23), bla(OXA-24), bla(OXA-51), bla(OXA-58), bla(SPM-1), bla(IMP), and bla(VIM.) The bla(OXA-51) gene was found in 56% of the isolates, indicating the presence of A. baumannii in this environment. Of these, three multiresistant isolates were positive for the bla(OXA-23) gene, in wastewater from two of the hospitals. The results obtained in this study indicate that isolates of A. baumannii which are multiresistant and carry resistance genes such as bla(OXA-51) and bla(OXA-23) are being released into the environment in the wastewater from the hospitals analyzed. Multiresistant Acinetobacter junii, the newly emerging pathogen, were also found among the multiresistant isolates. Hospital wastewater may be crucial to the development and dispersal of multiresistant bacteria, making waterbodies reservoirs of bacterial resistance.",

Results showed that among 57 new cases of TB only 66.7% were susceptible to all four first-line anti-TB drugs and 64.9% were susceptible to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectables; 10.5% of new and 22.9% of previously treated cases were multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB); and 1.8% of new and 2.9% of previously treated cases were extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). In addition, 14.3% of MDR-TB cases (2 out of 14) were XDR-TB, which is higher than the average numbers in China (about 8%) and in the world (9.6%).

The presence of vanA-enterococci was investigated in 103 fecal samples recovered from mullets fish (Liza ramada). All fecal samples were inoculated in Slanetz-Bartley agar plates supplemented with 4 mg/L of vancomycin for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) recovery and two isolates/sample were characterized. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested for 11 antibiotics by disk diffusion and agar dilution methods. VRE identification was performed by biochemical and molecular methods. Additionally, the mechanisms of resistance to glycopeptides (vanA, vanB, vanC1, vanC2, and vanD) and other antibiotics [erm(A), erm(B), tet(L), tet(M), aph(2'')-aac(6'), aph(3')-IIIa, ant(6'), vat(D), vat(E)] as well as the presence of enterococcal surface protein (esp) and hyl virulence factors were investigated. vanA-Enterococcus faecium isolates were recovered from 4 of 103 tested samples, and they showed glycopeptide and erythromycin resistances. Three of them were also ampicillin resistant, two showed resistance to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and kanamycin, and one showed resistance to gentamicin. The tet(M) and erm(B) genes were found in all tetracycline- and erythromycin-resistant strains, respectively. The aph(3')-III and aph(2'')-aac(6') genes were identified in the kanamycin- and gentamicin-resistant isolates, respectively. The IS1216 element was identified within vanX-vanY region of Tn1546 in two vanA isolates. The hyl and esp virulence genes were found in four and two isolates, respectively. vanA-strains were ascribed to sequence types ST280 (two isolates) and ST273 (two isolates), including both lineages into the clonal complex CC17.

A total of 601 strains were studied, including 253 isolated from different clinical sources and 348 intestinal strains (205 isolated from inpatients and 143 from outpatients) recovered from fecal specimens. Isolates were identified by using conventional physiological tests and evaluated for high-level resistance to aminoglycosides (HLR-A) and resistance to vancomycin and ampicillin by the agar screening technique. Susceptibility to several antimicrobial agents was evaluated by the disk diffusion method. The genetic diversity of Enterococcus faecalis strains presenting HLR-A was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA after SmaI digestion. E. faecalis was the most frequent species among clinical isolates (90.1%) and intestinal strains from inpatients (53.6%). E. casseliflavus was the prevalent species among intestinal isolates from outpatients (35.0%). Clinical isolates were shown to be resistant to erythromycin (53.0%), tetracycline (52.2%), ciprofloxacin (36.4%), gentamicin (36.4%), streptomycin (30.4%), chloramphenicol (34.4%), norfloxacin (32.0%), imipenem (3.2%), and ampicillin (2.8%). Vancomycin resistance was only detected in intrinsic vancomycin-resistant enterococcal species. The overall prevalence of HLR-A was 52.2% among clinical isolates and 40.5% among intestinal strains. However, HLR-A was significantly more frequent among intestinal strains obtained from inpatients (56.6%) than among strains from outpatients (17.5%). Three major clonal groups were found among E. faecalis strains exhibiting HLR-GE or HLR-GE/ST (clonal groups GE-A and GE-B), and strains exhibiting HLR-ST (clonal group ST-A). HLR-A, particularly HLR-GE, was most frequently associated with enterococcal strains of nosocomial origin. Isolates included in the major clonal groups were recovered from clinical and intestinal sources from patients in both hospitals, indicating both intrahospital and interhospital spread of strains.",

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were determined by the Etest method. Screening for metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (M\u03b2L) was performed using Etest M\u03b2L strips, and a PCR was conducted to detect carbapenemase-encoding genes. The amplification of the oprD gene followed by a sequencing reaction was performed for all strains resistant to imipenem. The clonality of 53 P. aeruginosa strains was demonstrated using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Among the 89 isolates, 35 (39.33%) were found to be resistant to IMP (MICs \u226516 \u03bcg/ml). The blaVIM-2 gene was detected in two strains. The remaining imipenem-resistant isolates showed the presence of oprD mutations. The MLST analysis differentiated strains into various clones and the strains from the same clone had an identical sequence of the oprD gene. We report the second detection in 2010 of blaVIM-2 in Algerian P. aeruginosa strains. We also found that oprD mutations were the major determinant of high-level imipenem resistance. We demonstrate that these oprD mutations can be used as a tool to study the clonality in P. aeruginosa isolates.",

Newport were treated with antimicrobial agents and 66 (33%) were hospitalized. Over two-thirds of cases at low-risk for serious complications received antimicrobial therapy, most commonly with fluoroquinolones, to which this strain was susceptible. There were no significant differences in symptoms, hospitalization, duration of illness, or other outcomes between the persons infected with MDR-AmpC and pansusceptible S. Newport. Although currently prevalent MDR-AmpC S. Newport strains remains susceptible to the antimicrobial most commonly prescribed for it, continued efforts to reduce unnecessary use of antimicrobial agents in food animals and humans are critical to prevent further development of resistance to quinolones and cephalosporins, which is likely to lead to substantial adverse outcomes.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the distribution of resistance genes and the clonal relationships among carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from the intensive care unit wards of two hospitals in Guangzhou, China. From 2012 to 2013, 57 A. baumannii isolates were obtained from blood cultures from two hospitals in Guangzhou. The antibiotic resistance profiles were determined by using the Vitek2 system and Etest strips. PCR was used to detect the genes encoding OXA-type carbapenemases and metallo-\u03b2-lactamases and the presence of ISAba1 upstream of the blaOXA-51-like gene and the blaOXA-23-like gene. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and sequence-based typing of blaOXA-51-like genes (SBT-blaOXA-51-like genes) were performed to analyze the genetic relationship of the isolates. Among the 57 isolates, 46 were carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) isolates. The blaOXA-51-like gene was identified in all 57 isolates, while the blaOXA-23-like gene was present in all 46 CRAB isolates. The MLST analysis grouped the A. baumannii isolates into five existing sequence types (STs) and five new STs. Fifty-two isolates belonged to the worldwide spread of clonal complex 92 (CC92), among which ST195 and ST365 were the most common STs. The MLST data and SBT-blaOXA-51-like genes showed that all isolates harboring the major blaOXA-51-like alleles, such as blaOXA-66, belonged to CC92.",

Most of the antibiotic/biocide combinations yielded synergistic interactions, reducing the inhibitory concentrations of biocides and antibiotics by 4- to 16-fold. Among enterococci, synergism with biocides was detected for amoxicillin (AM), cefuroxime (CX), erythromycin (EM), ciprofloxacin (CP), and trimethoprim/sulphametoxazol (T/S). Among staphylococci, interactions were synergistic (AM) and either synergistic or indifferent (CX and EM, depending on biocide). Among the three methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains included in the study, the combinations of methicillin and triclosan or hexachlorophene acted synergistically in all strains, but interactions were either synergistic or indifferent for the other biocides, depending on the strain. All combinations tested were synergistic for Lactobacillus (AM, CX, EM, and CP) and Micrococcus (AM, EM). In Salmonella, interactions were indifferent (AM, CX, EM, and CP) or synergistic (T/S). Synergism with biocides was also detected in Klebsiella isolates (AM, CX, and T/S), Enterobacter sp. (AM, CX, EM, and T/S), Pantoea (AM, CX, EM, CP, and T/S), and Chryseobacterium sp. (EM).

        "abstract": "Resistance to erythromycin is common among Streptococcus agalactiae in Taiwan, however the genetic relatedness of erythromycin-resistant isolates has not yet been reported. From 1991 to 2001, 629 clinical isolates of S. agalactiae were collected in a medical center at Tainan in southern Taiwan, of which 189 (30.0%) were resistant to erythromycin. The isolation rate of erythromycin-resistant group B streptococcus (GBS) was stable, irrespective of the clinical sources or study period. Among them, 145 (76.7%) isolates showed the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS)-resistant phenotype, and 44 (23.3%) had the macrolide (M)- resistant phenotype. Of the isolates with MLS phenotype, 141 (97.2%) isolates harbored the ermB gene alone and only three (2.1%) the ermTR gene, whereas 41 (93.2%) of 44 isolates with M phenotype harbored the mefA/E gene. Of 177 typeable isolates, there were 26 unrelated pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. PFGE type 1 accounted for 17.8% (24/135) of MLS phenotype isolates with the ermB gene and 48.7% (18/37) of M phenotype isolates with the mefA/E gene. During the study period, the proportion of PFGE type 6 decreased significantly, whereas that of type 8 increased. Our results suggest that erythromycin resistance is not uncommon among clinical isolates of S. agalactiae and is, at least, partially related to polyclonal spread in southern Taiwan.",

        "abstract": "To analyze Clostridium difficile susceptibility results and genotypes in relation to antibiotic exposures that precipitated C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), we examined 83 nosocomial C. difficile isolates recovered at a tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts. MICs were determined by E-test methodology using modified Brucella agar. Isolates were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme analysis. Antibiotic susceptibilities were: ciprofloxacin (0%), clindamycin (59%), trovafloxacin (63%), ceftriaxone (73%), piperacillin/tazobactam (100%), metronidazole (100%), and vancomycin (100%). The two most common strain groups, isolated from a total of 33 patients, were much more likely to be resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin, and trovafloxacin than other strain groups [79% (26 of 33) versus 2% (1 of 50), respectively]. Clindamycin exposure was strongly associated with CDAD caused by isolates that exhibited multiple resistance to clindamycin, erythromycin, and trovafloxacin (prevalence odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-16.8), whereas other antimicrobials did not yield significant associations. Resistance of specific C. difficile strains to clindamycin and other antimicrobial agents may contribute to their hospital dissemination and explain, in part, the propensity of clindamycin to trigger nosocomial outbreaks.",

This requires better knowledge about the stability and distribution of existing clones. In this study we characterized and compared penicillin nonsusceptible (PNSP) and susceptible pneumococci (PSP) from southern Sweden. A total of 166 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, recovered in Malmohus County between 1982 and 1997, were analyzed with molecular and microbiological techniques; 107 PNSP isolates of serogroup 15, collected between 1992 and 1995, and 15 PNSP isolates of serogroup 9, isolated in 1996 and 1997, were studied. In addition, PSP of serogroups 9 and 15, isolated approximately 10 years apart, were studied; 23 of serogroup 9 and 21 of serogroup 15, isolated in 1982-1983 and 1992-1993. As expected, a high degree of homogeneity was found in the PNSP isolates, where all the isolates of serogroup 9 belonged to the same clone, Spain(9V)-3, and the majority of the serogroup 15 isolates belonged to the Sweden(15A)-25 clone. The remaining PNSP isolates of serogroup 15 belonged to a clone found in The Netherlands and Greece. An unexpectedly high degree of clonality and stability of the PSP isolates was observed. Isolates representing clones that remained stable for over 10 years were found among both serogroups. These results indicate that factors, other than antimicrobial resistance, play an important part in establishing successful clones of S. pneumoniae, and these factors may be instrumental in determining the success or failure of clones after they acquire resistance.",

It has been reported that INH resistance is most frequently associated with katG 315 and inhA-15 mutations. The relative significance of these mutations in INH-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and their association with the different genotypes of M. tuberculosis in Xi'an, China, was investigated. Eighty-nine INH-resistant isolates were subjected to molecular characterization of hotspot mutations within katG 315 and inhA-15 by Multiplex allele-specific PCR, and results from 10 isolates were confirmed by direct sequencing. Mutations in katG 315 and inhA-15 were detected in 58 and 7 isolates, respectively. These isolates were genotyped by mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeats and Spoligotyping. Spoligotyping showed that 79 isolates (89%) belonged to Beijing family. Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeats typing revealed significant differences in clustering level between Beijing and non-Beijing family (56% vs. 9%, p\u2009=\u20090.002), which indicated the active transmission of Beijing family in INH-resistant isolates. Our results suggested that the katG 315 mutants were predominant in INH-resistant isolates in Xi'an and the hotspot mutations within katG 315 and inhA-15 can be used as genetic markers for detection of INH resistance.",

Although not included in the national immunization program, vaccination coverage is high (over 60%). We studied for the first time the rates of nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of pneumococci, antibiotic resistance patterns and serotypes among children attending day-care centers (DCCs) in Coimbra, a city in the Central Region of Portugal. Between January and February 2007, a cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged 6 months to 6 years attending eight DCCs. NP swabs were obtained from 507 children: 76.7% had received at least one dose of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 64.3% were age-appropriately vaccinated. The global pneumococcal carriage rate was 61.3%. Colonization proportions varied with age and number of children attending each DCC. Serotyping revealed that 20.7% of the pneumococci were vaccine types (VTs), 70.8% were non-VTs, and 8.5% were nontypeable. Serotype 19F was the second most frequent serotype being detected in 10.5% of the samples. While global NP carriage was not associated with vaccination status, non-VTs were predominant among vaccinated children, who had significantly lower prevalence of VT. Of all isolates, 15.7% had penicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations that ranged between 0.12 and 2 microg/ml. The proportion of resistant strains was significantly higher among VT and unvaccinated children. In conclusion, the rates of vaccination and prevalence of pneumococcal NP were high. Rates of antimicrobial resistance were similar to those found in studies conducted in Oeiras and Lisbon. This study is a platform for future surveillance activities.",

CTX-M-encoding genes, considered rare in the United States, were detected in 38.8% (28/70; three species) of the extended spectrum beta-lactamase-positive isolates and were observed in 80.0% of the participating hospitals. CTX-M-14 and -15 were found in multiple institutions (eight and nine medical centers, respectively), and CTX-M-3 was detected in only one isolate. The OXA-2 and -10 were identified in nine Enterobacteriaceae strains, and plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes CMY-2 and FOX-5 were identified in six and four isolates, respectively, displaying negative clavulanate inhibition. Genes encoding OXA-23 and -24 were detected in 30.0% (15/50) of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. strains. Retrospective sampling showed that these OXA enzymes were present since 2004 in the MYSTIC Program isolates. The KPC serine carbapenemases were observed in the majority of the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (usually Klebsiella pneumoniae), confirming an epidemic problem in the New York City area. The association of beta-lactamase production and transferable quinolone resistance genes (qnr; 6.7%) in Enterobacteriaceae strains was higher than previously reported. This study illustrates the emergence and rapid dissemination of some beta-lactamases, such as CTX-M, broad-spectrum oxacillinases, and serine carbapenemases, that compromised the treatment of gram-negative infections in numerous U.S. hospitals participating in the MYSTIC Program in 2007.",

All MRSA isolates, with one exception, belonged to a single clonal type II::NH::D. This clone, which was previously described among MRSA isolates recovered in the early 1990s in European and New York and South American hospitals, showed resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics only and appeared to be associated almost exclusively with pediatric infections (\"Pediatric clone\" of MRSA). While sharing identical molecular typing properties with the Pediatric clone, the Colombian isolates differed by extensive multidrug resistance and were recovered from patients of all ages. It is also noteworthy that the Brazilian clone of MRSA (XI::B::B), another multidrug-resistant international clone currently widely spread in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and also in several European countries, was completely absent from this set of isolates from Colombia.",

        "abstract": "An increased incidence of enrofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli associated with septicemic colibacillosis in calves was observed recently in northern Italy. The aim of this study was to investigate this phenomenon. A total of 47 consecutive E. coli isolates exhibiting reduced susceptibility to enrofloxacin (intermediately resistant or resistant) causing septicemic colibacillosis in calves from 45 large-scale farms during 2006-2008, were studied. Phylogenetic group, antimicrobial agents susceptibility, and O serogroup were determined with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing, providing additional discrimination. All of the microorganisms carried resistance to two or more additional drugs, with the pattern fluoroquinolone-ampicillin-co-trimoxazole-tetracycline-gentamicin-thiamphenicol being the most represented (18/47; 38.3%). Plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum and AmpC \u03b2-lactamases and plasmid-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance genetic determinants were not detected. Third-generation cephalosporins emerged as the most active antimicrobial agents tested (97.9% of susceptible strains). Overall, 37 different RAPD profiles and 18 different O serogroups could be distinguished among the typeable strains, indicating a substantial heterogeneity and suggesting the occurrence of several independent selection events. However, approximately one-fourth (11/47) of the strains belonged to serogroup O78, and PFGE revealed that the great majority (7/11) of these were clonally related, indicating the selection of a O78 clonal group. This is the first report investigating the molecular epidemiology of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli in calves and describing the emergence of a fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli clonal group in these animals.",

        "abstract": "Novel mdfA gene variants were identified simultaneously from 3 of 13 positive isolates of PCR amplification in Escherichia coli from patients. These 13 positive isolates showed resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and erythromycin. The 3 mdfA gene variants were of the same genotype and all the 13 positive isolates were investigated by conjugation experiment, EcoRI restriction, and gene mapping. Conjugation experiments demonstrated that the novel mdfA variant and mdfA genes were located on plasmids that were restricted by EcoRI for approximately 8.2 kb-length, which was also validated by gene mapping. Further study indicated three types of genetic structures (A, B, and C) in the recombinant plasmids harboring mdfA and surrounding genes, and structure B was first reported in the article. Structure A comprises two partial-length and six full-length genes, including the mdfA gene variant in the recombinant plasmid; structure B comprises four full-length genes, the mdfA, ybjG, dacC, and ybjI; structure C comprises two full-length genes, the mdfA and dacC. These results suggested that the mdfA gene can function as transporter responsible for multidrug resistance and also mediated the synergistic function with its surrounding genes in conjugative plasmids.",

In this study, we report the first identification of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-2 and New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (NDM)-1 in Enterobacter hormaechei subps. oharae from Brazil. The detection of carbapenemases was done by phenotypic assays, PCR, and DNA sequencing, whereas the identification was performed by conventional techniques, sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene, and hsp60-genotyping. Molecular typing was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and antimicrobial susceptibility was surrogated by the Etest methodology. Using the whole genome sequencing approach, we searched for resistance genes, plasmid incompatibility group genes, and the genetic environment of blaNDM and blaKPC. The plasmid identification was done by restriction digests with the S1 nuclease followed by hybridization using digoxigenin labeled specific probes. The isolate was considered multiresistant, being susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B. We observed the following resistance genes: blaCTX-M-15, blaACT-7, blaTEM-1, blaOXA-1, aadA1, aadA2, strA, strB, aac(3)-II, qnrB1, and aac(6')-Ib-cr and incompatibility group plasmid genes IncA/C, IncHI2, and IncN. The blaKPC gene was found associated to the transposon Tn4401 isoform b in plasmid with 50 kb (IncN) and blaNDM-1 was flanked by a truncated ISAba125 and bleMBL in plasmid with 160 kb (IncA/C). This study showed the coproduction of two important carbapenemases (KPC-2 and NDM-1) associated with mobile genetic elements of worldwide epidemiological importance (Tn4401 and ISAba125, respectively), reinforcing the idea that urgent measures are necessary to reduce and prevent the spreading of these carbapenemases primarily in the hospital settings.",

Isolate susceptibility clustered at 8 mg/L, but three isolates displayed higher MICs (>64\u2009 mg/L) to azithromycin. All three isolates contained a plasmid-encoded mphA gene, known to encode a macrolide-2'-phosphotransferase enzyme. Transformation of the mphA gene into Escherichia coli DH10B allowed the transfer of decreased susceptibility to azithromycin. Although these isolates might traditionally be defined as resistant, there are no established breakpoints for resistance to confirm that treatment of these isolates with azithromycin would fail, which complicates susceptibility screening.",

The mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance in clinical isolates of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A is not very well documented. The present study was carried out with the objective of molecular characterization of reduced quinolone susceptibility amongst the strains of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A isolated from the patients with enteric fever during January, 2000, to April, 2003, in a North Indian hospital. A total of 422 culture-positive cases of enteric fever were reported to the hospital during the period of study, of which S. Typhi was isolated from 350 cases and S. Paratyphi A from 72 cases. The antimicrobial susceptibility of these strains was determined by disk diffusion and agar dilution method according to NCCLS guidelines, and E-test method. A total of 140 randomly selected strains, isolated during the years 1993-1999, that were available from the laboratory stocks were also studied to compare with the present strains. To study the quinolone susceptibility, the strains were divided into nalidixic acid sensitive (NAS), nalidixic acid intermediate resistant, (NAI) and nalidixic acid resistant (NAR) on the basis of susceptibility to nalidixic acid. Clinical history was available from 174 patients, of which 93 needed hospitalization due to severe disease. Of these, 82 patients were infected with NAR strains and 22 patients had a documented evidence of clinical failure to ciprofloxacin therapy. The patients infected with NAR strains were younger and had a significantly longer duration of fever (p value < 0.05) than those infected with NAS strains. It was observed that the proportion of NAR strains increased gradually over the years. These strains had a significantly higher range of MIC of ciprofloxacin (0.023-1.0 microg/ml) as compared to the NAS strains (0.002-0.125 microg/ml) (p value < 0.05). The sequencing of quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene showed the presence of mutation at either Ser 83 or at Asp 87 in all the NAR and NAI strains. None of the NAS strains had a mutation, suggesting that the gyrA gene mutation is sufficient to confer resistance to nalidixic acid and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. This mutation, although phenotypically expressed as decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, goes undetected by the disk diffusion method using the present NCCLS guidelines. Hence, it can increase morbidity and mortality due to delay in appropriate antibiotic treatment.",

Two hundred and two clinically relevant isolates collected between September 2011 and October 2012 at Al-Qassimi hospital, Sharjah, were investigated for meropenem resistance. Strains with decreased susceptibility were further tested with the modified Hodge test, by EDTA and phenylboronic acid synergy and by E-test. The genes of New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (NDM), IMP, VIM, OXA-48, and KPC beta-lactamases were targeted by polymerase chain reaction and the genes were located on plasmids by Southern blotting. Clusters of the isolates were revealed by macrorestriction analysis. Seven percent of the isolates were originally found to be meropenem resistant, one isolate have lost its resistance during storage. All of the 13 resistant isolates were positive for the NDM-1 gene located on plasmids of 125 to >170\u2009kb, while three isolates also carried the blaOXA-48-like genes.

From 2009 to 2012, 180 K. pneumoniae strains were collected from Tehran hospitals. Of the isolates, 42 isolates (23.3%) were resistant to meropenem, 29 isolates (16.1%) were resistant to ertapenem, and 14 isolates (7.7%) were resistant to imipenem. All of carbapenem-resistant isolates were also resistant to the third generation of cephalosporins. modified Hodge test was positive in 25 (59.5%) of carbapenem-resistant isolates showing carbapenemase production. bla(NDM) and bla(VIM) genes were identified in three and five carbapenem-resistant isolates, respectively. One isolate showed presence of bla(KPC) gene. Class 1 integrons were detected in 14 carbapenem-resistant isolates. The most important finding about class 1 integrons was identification of an integron containing metallo-beta-lactamase gene VIM-1 that also harbored dfrA27 and arr3 genes. It is important to note that K. pneumoniae carbapenemase and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-positive isolates identified in this study showed resistance to the majority of routine antimicrobial agents, including all beta-lactams and other classes of antibiotics. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of bla(KPC) and bla(VIM-1) genes among isolates of K. pneumoniae in Iran.",

        "abstract": "Most studies reporting Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) infections select either specific populations/diseases, or refer to a single or a low number of institutions. A nationwide point-prevalence study including 147 hospitals from which we collected all the isolates of Sp reported in a single week (February 16-22, 2004). Workload and clinical data were studied, and susceptibility testing and serotyping of all isolates were performed. The participating institutions had an estimated catchment population of 37,534,750 inhabitants. During the study week, microbiology laboratories received 224,956 samples of which 34,647 were positive and 360 had S. pneumoniae. Overall, 69% of the isolates were from adults (> or = 15 years). Most of the isolates (89%) were considered clinically significant. Infection was community-acquired in 88% of infections and monomicrobial in 79%. We calculated that S. pneumoniae was isolated 38 times per 100,000 inhabitants/year and it was present in 1% of all samples with one or more bacterial isolates. We also calculated that pneumococcal disease (invasive and noninvasive) was present in 34 patients per 100,000 inhabitants/year. Penicillin resistance (I+R) was 42%, and erythromycin resistance was 35%. The most frequent serotypes were 3, 19F, and 19A. Considering only invasive isolates, the estimated coverage of the 7-valent vaccine was 61% in children and 41% in adults, and the estimated coverage of the 23-valent vaccine in adults was 79%. A nationwide point-prevalence study is an efficient tool for surveying pneumococcal infection in a large population.",

        "abstract": "Detection of bla(KPC)-harboring Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) in the clinical laboratory remains a difficult task. Decreased ertapenem (ERT) susceptibility has been considered one of the most sensitive phenotypic indicators of K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) production, but has been found to be nonspecific. Susceptibility testing using imipenem or meropenem lacks the sensitivity for detection of KPCs, and there is limited experience using doripenem (DOR). Fifty-five individual ERT-nonsusceptible KP isolates and 19 isolates that were ERT-susceptible, extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-positive KP were collected from the clinical laboratory and tested for DOR susceptibility by Etest methodology. PCR screening for bla(KPC) was performed on all specimens. All but three isolates with ERT resistance were KPC positive by PCR. Compared to PCR, ERT detection of KPC had a sensitivity of 98% and a false-positive rate of 6%. Overall, there was a 97% agreement between ERT and DOR susceptibility results. However, there was one KPC-positive isolate that was discrepant (ERT susceptible, DOR nonsusceptible by Etest). Selected isolates of KP from both groups underwent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis to determine the degree of genetic relatedness of KPC-positive and KPC-negative isolates. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of selected KPC-positive and KPC-negative KP identified a common pattern between both groups. The resistance to DOR and/or ERT is sensitive and a specific indicator for detection of bla(KPC) in KP.",

        "abstract": "According to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System project results, Bulgaria has become one of the European countries with dramatically increasing rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. The aim of this work was to investigate the epidemiology of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli clinical isolates in Bulgaria, collected from seven clinical centers in three towns, during two study periods: 2002-2003 and 2006-2009. For 193 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses, phylogenetic typing, and screening for O25b-ST131 isolates were carried out. Antimicrobial susceptibility, ESBL-type and transferability of resistance determinants were analyzed. Four different ESBL-types, namely TEM-139, SHV-12, CTX-M-3, and CTX-M-15 were found. CTX-M-15 dominated, being found in 88% of the isolates. RAPD-typing revealed 35 types, among which type A dominated, comprising 65% of the isolates. Sixty-eight percent of the 193 isolates belonged to the O25b-ST131 clone, to the phylogenetic group B2, mostly showed RAPD-type A (92%) and were found in all participating hospitals. O25b-ST131 isolates predominantly produced CTX-M-15 (96%), and less SHV-12 (n=3) or TEM-139 (n=2). In conclusion, this study demonstrated for the first time the country-wide dissemination of a highly resistant B2 O25b-ST131 CTX-M-15 producing E. coli clone in Bulgaria.",

A high-throughput liquid-phase fluorescent antibiogram method capable of providing results within 6-8 hours has been developed. The AB method has been optimally designed for ease of operation, growth, and dye stability. This new method was more reliable than DDM in differentiating AB sensitivity as susceptible, intermediate, and resistant within 6-8 hours and providing evidence for efflux mechanism in the MDR phenotype. The superiority of this method even over the standard liquid turbidity method was evidenced by more accurate determination of intermediary resistance in a set of 23 clinical Escherichia coli strains against five common antibiotics. In view of the demand for the right choice of an antibiotic in short time, the newly developed AB method is clinically applicable and useful in the rational use of antibiotic and minimizing of MDR emergence.",

Penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 1b and 2a genes were amplified by PCR, and the purified DNA was digested with HinfI, StyI, and MseI + DdeI restriction enzymes. The fragments were radioactively end-labeled and separated on polyacrylamide gels, and the DNA fingerprints were visualized following autoradiography. A collection of isolates was further selected for sequence analysis of pbp1b and 2a. DNA fingerprint analysis revealed a uniform profile amongst all isolates for both genes. All isolates revealed a maximum of only seven nucleotide substitutions in their pbp1b genes, resulting in a maximum of three amino acid substitutions in PBP 1B. In the case of the pbp2a gene, up to 13 nucleotide substitutions were observed randomly distributed amongst penicillin-susceptible and resistant isolates, revealing a maximum of five amino acid substitutions in PBP 2A. No amino acid substitutions were found to be common amongst all penicillin-resistant isolates. Transformation experiments with pbp1b and 2a genes isolated from two resistant strains (MICs, 4 and 16 microg/mL) failed to transform pneumococcal strains to increased levels of penicillin resistance. These results show that the pbp1b and 2a genes examined here do not display the typical mosaic gene patterns observed in the pbp2x, 2b, and 1a genes of penicillin-resistant pneumococci. In addition, the transformation studies suggest that PBPs 1B and 2A may not play a role in the development of penicillin resistance in some pneumococci.",

We now investigated the effect of two point mutations found in two independently obtained laboratory mutants that are located at the surface of the TP domain with their side chains facing outside (G422D respectively R426C). They have no significant effect on resistance to cefotaxime in vivo or on binding to Bocillin\u2122FL to the active site in vitro using purified PBP2x derivatives, thus apparently do not affect the active site directly. In contrast, in silico modeling revealed that they affect van der Waal's interactions with the PASTA1 (PBP and serine/threonine kinase associated) domain of the C-terminal extension and a noncovalent cefuroxime molecule found in the X-ray structure of an acylated PBP2x, suggesting some effect of the mutations on the interaction of the TP domain with PASTA1 and/or with the antibiotic associated with PASTA1. The effect of the PASTA domains on covalent binding of PBP2x to Bocillin FL was then investigated using a series of soluble truncated PBP2x derivatives. Deletion of 127 C-terminal residues, that is, of both PASTA domains, decreased binding dramatically by \u223c90%. Surprisingly, deletion of only 40 amino acids resulted in the same phenotype, whereas the absence of 30 amino acids affected binding marginally by 10%, documenting a crucial role of the C-terminal domain for beta-lactam binding.",

To aid in the understanding and eventual control of the spread of such resistance genes, we sought to determine the diversity of CTX-M ESBLs not among clinical isolates, but in the environment, where weaker and more diverse selective pressures may allow greater enzyme diversification. This was done by examining the CTX-M diversity in municipal wastewater and urban coastal wetlands in southern California, United States, by Sanger sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplicons. Of the five known CTX-M phylogroups (1, 2, 8, 9, and 25), only genes from groups 1 and 2 were detected in both wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and group 1 genes were also detected in one of the two wetlands after a winter rain. The highest relative abundance of blaCTX-M group 1 genes was in the sludge of one WWTP (2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-4) blaCTX-M copies/16S rRNA gene copy). Gene libraries revealed surprisingly high nucleotide sequence diversity, with 157 new variants not found in GenBank, representing 99 novel amino acid sequences. Our results indicate that the resistomes of WWTPs and urban wetlands contain diverse blaCTX-M ESBLs, which may constitute a mobile reservoir of clinically relevant resistance genes.",

        "abstract": "Aims: This study evaluated guideline concordance and time to administration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a private Australian emergency department (ED). Two key components in the management of CAP are timely administration and appropriate choice of antibiotic therapy. The use of antibiotics outside of guidelines can potentially increase rates of antibiotic resistance. Previous studies that evaluate guideline concordance have largely been conducted in Australian public hospitals; however, private hospitals comprise a significant portion of Australian health care. Methods: One hundred and thirty patients admitted to a private Brisbane hospital between 01/01/2011 and 28/03/2012 with an admission diagnosis of CAP were included. Data were collected on administration time and choice of antibiotic therapy in the ED. This was compared with local and national CAP guidelines. Results: Concordance with antibiotic guidelines was low (6.9%). Antibiotics with broader spectrum of action than that recommended in guidelines were frequently prescribed. Eighty-one percent of patients received their first antibiotic within 4 hours of arriving in the ED. Mortality was low at 0.9% in a cohort where 31% of patients were aged under 65. Conclusions: We found low rates of concordance with CAP antibiotic guidelines and high use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. This has the potential to lead to increased rates of antibiotic resistance. A subtle alteration to the restrictions within the pharmaceutical benefit scheme formulary could potentially decrease the high usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the low mortality rate, nontoxic nature of these antibiotics, and the ease of their administration pose a challenge to convincing clinicians to alter their practice.",

Resistance profiling of these strains revealed that the vast majority was still susceptible to methicillin (98.6% MSSA). Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) performed for these strains identified 45 different genotypes, nine of which were identified in four or more different hospitals. The major PFGE type (genotype 2) comprised 23% of all isolates. In addition, several other strains were shown to be endemic in individual hospitals. Three out of four multi-resistant MRSA strains that were detected were sequence type 8 (ST8) as determined by array-based multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). PCRs for cataloguing the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) type were negative for two of these, suggesting the existence of a new methicillin-resistance gene complex in the ST8 genetic background. In conclusion, major clones of MSSA circulate in Nigeria, and the MRSA incidence is still low. However, the occurrence of old and new versions of SCCmec in some of the ecologically abundant MSSA strains should be taken as a serious warning since clonal expansion of this type of strains is not unprecedented.",

        "abstract": "Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have frequently been isolated from Norwegian poultry production following the prohibition of the glycopeptide growth promoter avoparcin since 1995. In the present study, a close genetic linkage between the vanA and erm(B) determinants in an Enterococcus hirae isolate of poultry origin is demonstrated, a result that indicates a mechanism for co-selection and maintenance of vancomycin resistance in absence of selective pressure from avoparcin. A total of 36 vanA-positive enterococci of poultry origin, also phenotypically resistant to erythromycin and/or tetracycline, were analyzed by PCR for identification of erm and tet resistance determinants. An E. hirae isolate harbored erm(B) and tet(K), and in this isolate vanA and erm(B) were located on a BamHI fragment of an approximately 50-kb plasmid. Approximately 3 kb of this fragment was amplified by PCR with vanA and erm(B) primers. Sequence analysis of the region between erm(B) and vanZ of Tn1546 showed a truncated IS1216V inserted downstream of the erm(B) stop codon, aligned with a conserved copy of the 3'-inverted terminal repeat of Tn1546. Mating experiments with the E. hirae isolate as donor and E. faecalis JH2-2 as recipient did not result in any transconjugants, indicating that the vanA/erm(B)-carrying plasmid was nonconjugative under the given experimental conditions.",

The in vitro growth, the survival on food matrix, and the in vivo colonization of C. jejuni and C. coli susceptible isolates and their isogenic resistant mutants were studied. In vitro experiments demonstrated that macrolide resistance imposed a fitness cost when the susceptible strains and their isogenic resistant mutants were cultured in competition. When inoculated in food matrix, the resistant C. jejuni mutant was no longer detectable after 3 to 5 days but the susceptible strain remained detectable for over 18 days. No difference in survival in food matrix was observed between susceptible and resistant C. coli. When inoculated in vivo in chickens, the macrolide susceptible and resistant C. coli displayed similar levels of colonization, both in separated inoculations and during competitive assays. Strikingly, when mono-inoculated or co-inoculated into chickens, macrolide susceptible C. jejuni outcompeted the macrolide resistant population. However, a spontaneous mutant that evolved in vivo showed a colonization capacity similar to the susceptible strain. Our findings demonstrate the effect of macrolide resistance on the fitness of Campylobacter but suggest that evolved mutants may be as fit as susceptible strains.",

But the joint effects of these mechanisms have not been thoroughly characterized in homologous Salmonella Typhimurium strains. In this study, isogenic topoisomerase mutants were constructed using phage \u03bb Red recombinase system and phage transduction. And the joint effects of topoisomerase mutations (gyrA [S83F], gyrA [S83F, D87N] and parC [S80I]) and PMQR determinants (including qnrB4, qnrS1, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qepA) were studied in homologous genetic constitutions. Our data showed that mutations in gyrA played a dominant role in fluoroquinolone resistance in Salmonella Typhimurium and have a synergistic effect with other resistant mechanisms. The mutation (S80I) in parC would have no effect in quinolone resistance without gyrA mutations. The joint effect of aac(6')-Ib-cr and topoisomerase mutations were only observed for ciprofloxacin among tested quinolones. Different joint effects between topoisomerase mutations and qepA, qnrB4, or qnrS1 were observed for tested quinolones. Importantly, the acquirement of the PMQR determinants could improve 0- to 32-fold of the host mutant prevention concentration to ciprofloxacin. Our data showed that the acquirement of PMQR determinants could not only improve the host minimal inhibitory concentrations to quinolones but also accelerate the generation of high-level fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants.",

        "abstract": "Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a global problem. The widespread use of antibiotics continues to exacerbate the problem giving rise to antibiotic-resistant bacteria both in and outside a clinical context. The general hospital environment is an obvious important focus for the selection and spread of multiresistant bacteria and a potential direct source of HAIs. Despite this, there are few detailed studies that have investigated the relationship between strains mediating HAIs and strains coresident in the hospital. Here we isolated bacteria from patients with HAIs exhibiting resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics over a 1-month period in 2011. Three of these isolates were examined in detail by molecular analysis and their multiresistance regions were compared to \u03b2-lactam resistant bacteria isolated from the immediate hospital environment over the same period. All sampled patients were in a 14-bed burns unit and the environmental sample sites included shower drains, sinks, trolleys, and door handles. It was found that identical strains carrying the same resistance regions were present in both patients and the hospital environment suggesting HAIs can arise from bacteria resident in the immediate surrounds. The three patient infections were not derived from a single source, since strains could be distinguished by the genotype and spatial location. While it seems unlikely that eradication of multiresistant bacteria from the hospital can be achieved, more effective hospital cleaning and a better hospital design may be able to reduce transmission.",

Quantification of mRNA was performed with real-time RT- PCR. Levels of mRNA in clinical isolates were compared to ATCC 27853 and average transcription levels of four carbapenem-susceptible clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. Sequencing of oprD, pbp 2, and pbp 3 was performed in selected isolates. An efflux inhibition assay was performed with Phe-Arg-b-naphtylamide. Most carbapenem- resistant isolates had decreased levels of oprD mRNA. Among six isolates with normal amount of oprD mRNA, half of them had significant OprD sequence alterations. Increased transcription of mexB was observed in 16 of 23 meropenem-resistant isolates, and one isolate showed mexD hyperproduction. Decreased amount of pbp 2 and pbp 3 was found in two and three isolates, respectively. Sequencing of pbp 2 and 3 revealed no amino acid changes potentially leading to conformational changes. In conclusion, OprD changes were the predominant mechanism of high-level carbapenem resistance, and increased transcription of mexB was often present in meropenem-resistant isolates. Reduced transcription of pbp 2 and 3 may contribute to the carbapenem resistance.",

Twenty-seven different serotypes were identified. The most prevalent serotypes in the carriage isolates were 6A, 19F, 23F, and 15 and were found in 66.8% of cases. Serotype data indicate that 51.8% of carrier strains would be included in the 11-valent conjugate vaccine formulation, while inclusion of vaccine-related serotypes, increased the potential vaccine coverage to 79.4%. Serotypes 7, 6B, 23F, 19F, 15, and 3 accounted for 62% of clinical strains, with 70% vaccine-related serotypes. DNA fingerprinting of 47 penicillin resistant and 71 penicillin-susceptible/macrolide-resistant strains by BOX polymerase chain reaction (PCR), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and penicillin binding protein (PBP)-fingerprinting identified two novel clones: one a serotype 23F multiresistant clone resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, and variably resistant to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole; and the second a multiresistant penicillin-susceptible, macrolide-resistant serotype 6A clone, highly resistant also to tetracycline, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. The macrolide resistance determinant in 89% of erythromycin-resistant strains tested (penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant) was the erm gene, both the erm and mef genes were simultaneously found in 6%, and mef alone in 3.4%. The data demonstrates that macrolide resistant strains in China include clonal strains and strains with dual mef and erm resistance determinants.",

This study documents the occurrence and characteristics of an epidemic SPM-1-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain in a teaching hospital located in Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil. The bla (SPM-1) gene and a class 1 integron were detected in 13 isolates, representing 20% of the 65 imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from January, 2000, to August, 2001. DNA sequencing revealed that this integron carries three gene cassettes that confer resistance to antimicrobials, aacA4, bla (OXA-56), and aadA7, and an orf1 encoding a putative transposase. All 13 SPM-producing P. aeruginosa isolates had closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles, designated as clonal group A, suggesting nosocomial spread of the strain. This clonal group was the same as that observed in other SPM-1-producing P. aeruginosa isolates from distinct Brazilian states. The dissemination of this clone throughout Brazil could not be explained by transfer of infected patients and/or sharing of common health-care staff. It is likely that the spread of these strains occurred indirectly via the community.",

        "abstract": "The increased resistance of pathogenic microorganisms is frequently attributed to the extreme and inadequate use of antibiotics and transmission of resistance within and between individuals. To counter the emergence of resistant microorganisms, considerable resources have been invested in the search for new antimicrobials. Plants synthesize a diverse array of secondary metabolites (phytochemicals) known to be involved in defense mechanisms, and in the last few years it is recognized that some of these molecules have health beneficial effects, including antimicrobial properties. In this study, the mechanism of action of gallic (GA) and ferulic (FA) acids, a hydroxybenzoic acid and a hydroxycinnamic acid, was assessed on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. The targets of antimicrobial action were studied using different bacterial physiological indices: minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), membrane permeabilization, intracellular potassium release, physicochemical surface properties, and surface charge. It was found that FA and GA had antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested with MIC of 500 \u03bcg/mL for P. aeruginosa, 1500 \u03bcg/mL for E. coli, 1750 \u03bcg/mL for S. aureus, and 2000 \u03bcg/mL for L. monocytogenes with GA; 100 \u03bcg/mL for E. coli and P. aeruginosa, 1100 \u03bcg/mL and 1250 \u03bcg/mL for S. aureus and L. monocytogenes, respectively, with FA. The MBC for E. coli was 2500 \u03bcg/mL (FA) and 5000 (GA), for S. aureus was 5000 \u03bcg/mL (FA) and 5250 \u03bcg/mL (GA), for L. monocytogenes was 5300 \u03bcg/mL (FA) and 5500 \u03bcg/mL (GA), and 500 \u03bcg/mL for P. aeruginosa, with both phytochemicals. GA and FA led to irreversible changes in membrane properties (charge, intra and extracellular permeability, and physicochemical properties) through hydrophobicity changes, decrease of negative surface charge, and occurrence of local rupture or pore formation in the cell membranes with consequent leakage of essential intracellular constituents. The overall study emphasizes the potential of plant-derived molecules as a green and sustainable source of new broad spectrum antimicrobial products.",

For 160 K. pneumoniae collected in 2013, ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by agar dilution method. The genotypes of ciprofloxacin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates were determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and wzi gene typing. The presence of plasmid-mediated resistance determinants [qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, aac(6')-Ib-cr, blaCTX-M, and blaSHV] was investigated. The gyrA and parC genes were sequenced. Fifty-seven isolates showed ciprofloxacin resistance. By MLST, four major sequence types (STs) or clonal complexes (CCs), that is, ST307, CC11, CC147, and ST15, were found and the two most prevalent STs were ST307 (14/57, 24.6%) and ST11 (12/57, 21.1%). By wzi gene sequencing, 46 of the 57 isolates could be differentiated. All the ST307 isolates had an identical wzi sequence and harbored qnrB. The majority of them harbored aac(6')-Ib-cr (85.7%) and CTX-M-15 (92.9%). In contrast, 12 ST11 isolates were divided into five sublineages by wzi sequence and qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6')-Ib-cr were carried by nine, seven, and three isolates, respectively. They harbored SHV-type extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase more frequently than CTX-M-15 (nine and four isolates, respectively). The prevalence of CTX-M-15, qnrB1, and aac(6')-Ib-cr was significantly higher in ST307 than in ST11 (p=0.003, p=0.000, and p=0.002, respectively). Both clones had identical amino acid substitution in gyrA (S83I) and parC (S80I). K. pneumoniae ST307 and ST11 were the two most common clones, and the ST307 isolates were highly homogeneous, suggesting their recent emergence.",

        "abstract": "To determine dissemination and genotype of AmpC beta-lactamases and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase among clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, we performed antibiotic susceptibility testing, pI determination, induction test, plasmid profiles, transconjugation test, enterobacterial repetitive consensus (ERIC)-PCR, and DNA sequencing. Among the 51 clinical isolates collected from a university hospital in Korea, six isolates were resistant to cephamycins. All six isolates produced a plasmid-encoded AmpC-type beta-lactamase, CMY-10. Five strains also produced one or more other beta-lactamases: SHV-12, an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (five isolates); TEM-1, a class A beta-lactamase (two isolates); and a chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase (one isolate, a strain of Enterobacter aerogenes, which produced all four of the beta-lactamases that were identified). One of six isolates produced only CMY-10. ERIC-PCR analysis revealed that dissemination of CMY-10 and SHV-12 was due to a clonal outbreak of a resistant strain and to the interspecies spread of resistance to cephamycins and broad-spectrum beta-lactams in Korea. CMY-10 beta-lactamase genes that are responsible for the resistance to cephamycins (cefoxitin and cefotetan), amoxicillin, cephalothin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were cloned and characterized from six clinical isolates. A sequence identical to the common regions in In6, In7, and a novel integron from pSAL-1 was found upstream from blaCMY-10 gene at nucleotides 1-71. A total of 15 nucleotides (I-15) or 18 nucleotides (I-18) between position 71 and 72 were inserted into the blaCMY-10 gene. The blaCMY-10 gene might be inserted into a sul1-type complex integron by I-15 or I-18.",

        "abstract": "The development and transmission of HIV drug-resistant viruses is of serious concern and has been shown to significantly diminish the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. In addition, cross-resistance between drugs of the same class can seriously limit therapeutic options and may potentially be most problematic in resource-poor settings where new drugs are not widely available. Strategies based on avoidance of virological failure are therefore essential for the long-term success of therapy. In this regard, regionally adapted programs to facilitate proper adherence with therapy need to be urgently implemented, concomitant with expanded access to new antiretroviral drugs. The value of genotypic resistance testing as a prognostic tool to help guide therapeutic decisions has been established. However, the relatively high cost of this novel technology does not warrant its routine utilization at this time in resource-poor countries. Lastly, the genetic barrier of the antiretroviral agents that are prescribed is also an important consideration that needs to be integrated with knowledge of HIV-1 subtypes, drug pharmacology, and medical management of concurrent illnesses. The selection of appropriate first-line antiretroviral combination regimens may be an even more important consideration in developing than developed countries, given that options in the aftermath of treatment failure may be more limited in such settings.",

We present our clinical experience with the use of daptomycin in combination with rifampin in four patients with SPE in the absence of infective endocarditis. Three of the patients had a history of injection drug use; two of these patients also had soft-tissue infections. All patients had clinical resolution of their infections.

The ampicillin and gentamicin resistance profiles were stable in the isolates that clustered within the groups I-III. Comparison with the allelic profiles of 139 E. faecium from different geographical regions and origins found in the international database http://www.mlst.net revealed that the Brazilian outbreak clone did not cluster in the previously named complex-17.

In this study, we determined the susceptibility to cephalosporins by broth microdilution among 5,041 non-Typhi Salmonella enterica isolated from food animals, retail meats, and humans. In the United States, 109 (4.6%) of isolates collected from humans, 77 (15.7%) from retail meat, and 140 (10.6%) from food animals displayed decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins (DSC). Among the Canadian retail meat and food animal isolates, 52 (13.0%) and 42 (9.4%) displayed DSC. All isolates displaying DSC were screened for \u03b2-lactamase genes (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CMY), bla(CTX-M), and bla(OXA-1)) by polymerase chain reaction. At least one \u03b2-lactamase gene was detected in 74/109 (67.9%) isolates collected from humans, and the bla(CMY) genes were most prevalent (69/109; 63.3%). Similarly, the bla(CMY) genes predominated among the \u03b2-lactamase-producing isolates collected from retail meats and food animals. Three isolates from humans harbored a bla(CTX-M-15) gene. No animal or retail meat isolates harbored a bla(CTX-M) or bla(OXA-1) gene. A bla(TEM) gene was found in 5 human, 9 retail meat, and 17 animal isolates.

Two out of the five strains, K. pneumoniae E530 and E. coli E558, were cultured from bile and abdominal drainage, respectively, of a single patient. The strains were resistant to beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and susceptible to tigecycline and colistin. All the strains harboured blaKPC-3, blaTEM-1, and blaOXA-9, and the three K. pneumoniae additionally carried blaSHV-11 and aac(6')Ib. The blaKPC-3 was inserted in transposon Tn4401a. All the strains hosted an FIIk-type plasmid, and the three K. pneumoniae coharboured an colE-type plasmid. Transconjugants, besides blaKPC-3, harboured blaTEM-1 and blaOXA-9 genes on FIIk-type plasmid. K. pneumoniae E301 was ST258, while strain E530 and C525 belonged to the ST512, and E. coli E558 was ST43. To our best knowledge, this is the first report that strongly supports the transmission of blaKPC-3 from ST512 K. pneumoniae to E. coli ST43 in a single patient, a phenomenon of both clinical and microbiological importance.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the role of the dissemination of self-transferrable plasmids harboring bla genes in the outbreaks experienced by the ward. The 49 previously identified clinical isolates of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were examined for relationships between their enzymes and plasmids. Analysis of crude extracts by isoelectric focusing showed four beta-lactamase-activities at pI 8.2, 7.6, 6, and 5.4. Clinical isolates contained large plasmids that could be transferred by conjugation and transformation conferring resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. DNA amplification and sequencing were performed to confirm the identities of transferred beta-lactamases. Nucleotide sequence analysis of SHV-specific PCR products from six isolates identified two bla(SHV) genes corresponding to SHV derived ESBLs, SHV-12 and SHV-2a. PstI digestion of plasmid DNA from transformants revealed six restriction patterns. The occurrence of the prevalent plasmid pattern in both epidemic strains and unrelated isolates indicated that diffusion and endemic persistence of the bla(SHV-ESBL) genes in the ward were due to concomitant spread of epidemic strains and plasmid dissemination among unrelated strains.",

        "abstract": "Increasing antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens has drawn the attention to the potential use of bacteriophage endolysins as alternative antibacterial agents. Here we have identified, characterized, and studied the lytic potential of two endolysins, Lys168 and Lys170, from phages infecting Enterococcus faecalis. Lys168 and Lys170 belong to the cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases (CHAP) and amidase-2 protein families, respectively. Lys168 is quite a unique enterococcal phage endolysin. It shares 95% amino acidic identity with the endolysin of Staphylococcus aureus phage SAP6, which in turn is distantly related to all known CHAP endolysins of S. aureus phages. Lys170 seems to be a natural chimera assembling catalytic and cell-wall-binding domains of different origin. Both endolysins showed a clear preference to act against E. faecalis and they were able to lyse a high proportion of clinical isolates of this species. Specifically, Lys168 and Lys170 lysed more than 70% and 90% of the tested isolates, respectively, which included a panel of diverse and typed strains representative of highly prevalent clonal complexes. Lys170 was active against all tested E. faecalis VRE strains. The quasi specificity toward E. faecalis is discussed considering the nature of the enzymes' functional domains and the structure of the cell wall peptidoglycan.",

Only two ESC-resistant isolates were detected, giving a low percentage of strains resistant to ESC (0.2%). One multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate of the Virchow serotype produced a CTXM-3 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). The bla(CTX-M-3) gene was located downstream from an ISEcp1 element, on an 80-kb conjugative plasmid. The Virchow isolate possessed a class 1 integron with a 2.2-kb gene cassette (dhfrXII-orfF-aadA2). The second ESC-resistant isolate belonged to serotype Newport, was also MDR and produced a CMY-2 cephamycinase. This CMY-2-producing isolate (also called Newport MDR-AmpC) possessed a class 1 integron with a 1-kb gene cassette including a new variant of the aadA gene, aadA24. A large plasmid (>125 kb) was involved in transfer of the bla(CMY-2) gene. The ESC-resistant S. enterica isolates detected in this study were different from those (S. enterica serotype Typhimurium DT193 producing CTXM-4 or CTX-M-5 ESBLs) involved in several nosocomial outbreaks between 1994 and 2003 in Russia. This is the first description of both CTX-M-3 ESBL-producing S. enterica and Newport MDR-AmpC in Russia.",

TEM, SHV, and CTX-M are the most common ESBL genotypes among Enterobacter spp. The main aims of this study were to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and to detect ESBL-encoding genes as well as intI1 genes. One hundred twenty isolates of E. cloacae were collected from hospitals of Tehran and Qazvin, Iran. The isolates were identified by standard laboratory methods and API 20E strips. ESBL screening was performed by the combined disk method. PCR and sequencing were conducted for detection of ESBL-encoding genes as well as intI1 genes. Clonal relatedness of ESBL-producing isolates was assessed by the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR method. Of 120 isolates, 57 (47.5%) were characterized as multidrug resistant among those 48 (84.2%) isolates carried class 1 integron. Fifty-three (44.2%) isolates were found to be ESBL producers, in which blaCTX-M-15 (60.4%) was the most common gene followed by blaTEM-1 (32.1%), blaTEM-169 (13.2%), and blaSHV-12 (7.5%) either alone or in combination. Forty-four of the 53 (83.01%) ESBL-producing isolates were genetically unrelated.

Serogroup 6 ranks fourth among different capsular types within invasive isolates from Argentinean patients <6 years of age. To evaluate whether the increase in PEN resistance in serotype 6B pneumococci was due to the dissemination of one or more clones, the genetic diversity of 93 S. pneumoniae serotype 6B isolates was analyzed. Five BOX-polymerase chain reaction types were obtained (65.5% isolates) and a group of 15 isolates, representing 41.6% of those having a decreased susceptibility to PEN, were further characterized. The antibiotype of these isolates showed their multiresistance, with 100% of the isolates being resistant to erythromycin, 80% to tetracycline, and 73.3% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Of the 15 isolates, 13 belonged to the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type and galU cluster and were members of the same clone. The identity of the clone was confirmed in four isolates by multilocus sequence typing. The sequence type found (ST315) corresponds to the Poland(6B)-20 clone. In summary, BOX-polymerase chain reaction, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and galU polymorphism were useful tools to detect the presence of a clone whose identity was confirmed by multilocus sequence typing. The isolates belonging to Poland(6B)-20 found in this work are described for the first time in Latin America.",

        "abstract": "Six multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were recovered from injured Libyan combatants. Production of carbapenemase was screened by using commercial combination tablets from Rosco combined with a temocillin disk. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were used to detect several carbapenemase genes and to characterize their genetic environment. Genetic support was studied by mating-out assays. Plasmid size was identified by the KADO method. PCR and sequencing allowed characterization of plasmid scaffold. Genotyping was performed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing. PCR was used to check for the presence of nine genes linked to virulence in K. pneumoniae. No carbapenemase was identified by Rosco disks, but all isolates showed high-level temocillin resistance. All of them harbored blaOXA-48 in the transposon Tn1999.2, on a self-conjugative plasmid of about 60\u2009kb, similar to pOXA-48. PFGE revealed three clusters in which isolates were genetically related: The first comprised FM9 and FM10, and the second comprised FM1, FM4, and FM5. FM2 formed a third distinct clone. Sequence types ST101, ST11, and ST147 were identified in keeping with PFGE results. The entB, ycfM, ybtS, and mrkD genes were detected in all isolates, and kfu gene was present in the three ST101 strains. This work confirms the current and successful spread of blaOXA-48 by horizontal dissemination of a single IncL/M plasmid through different genetic backbones with strong epidemic potential. It also highlights the need for rapid and reliable phenotypic detection methods. Attempts to link virulence factors and the production of this carbapenemase deserve further studies.",

The most frequent source of isolates of S. pneumoniae was from patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (25.3%). Reduced susceptibility to penicillin or erythromycin resistance was common among S. pneumoniae isolates (30.9-44.5% and 77.2-81.9%, respectively). The macrolide MIC(50) for S. pneumoniae was >or=128 microg/ml (azithromycin and erythromycin) and >or=64 microg/ml (clarithromycin). The erm(B) genotype accounted for the most erythromycin-resistant isolates in each study year. H. influenzae isolates were most commonly derived from patients with CAP (26.2%). The proportion of H. influenzae isolates that were beta-lactamase positive ranged between 4.3% and 9.7%. The prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates increased from 0.4% to 2.6% between years 1 and 4 then to 19.7% in year 5. S. pyogenes isolates were highly susceptible to most antimicrobial agents except macrolides and tetracycline. Telithromycin was highly active against all three pathogens examined throughout the study.",

In total, 49 strains (24 P. aeruginosa and 25 A. baumannii) were isolated, including 21 P. aeruginosa and 22 A. baumannii isolates (87.75%) resistant to imipenem (minimum inhibitory concentrations \u226516\u2009\u03bcg/ml). The blaVIM-2 gene was detected in 19 P. aeruginosa isolates. All imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates showed the presence of OprD mutations. Acquired OXA-carbapenemase-encoding genes were present in all A. baumannii isolates: blaOXA-23 (n=19) and blaOXA-24 (n=3). Finally, a total of 13 and 17 different sequence types were assigned to the 21 P. aeruginosa and the 22 A. baumannii carbapenem-resistant isolates, respectively. This study is the first report describing imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolated from patients in Libya. We report the first case of co-occurrence of blaVIM-2 with oprD porin loss in identical isolates of P. aeruginosa in Libya and demonstrate that these oprD mutations can be used as a tool to study the clonality in P. aeruginosa isolates. We also report the first identification of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolates harboring blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-24-like, and blaOXA-48-like genes in Libya.",

A total of 2,092 strains of S. enterica were identified in stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis. Five isolates showed an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype: four isolates of S. enterica serotype Virchow harbored the ESBL-encoding bla(CTX-M-9) gene and an isolate of serotype Enteritidis carried a bla(CTX-M-1) gene, which, to the best of our knowledge, is described here for the first time in this serotype of S. enterica. The five ESC-resistant isolates were also resistant to spectinomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, sulfonamides, tetracycline, and trimethoprim as well as to nalidixic acid. The ESBL isolate of serotype Enteritidis, however, remained susceptible to kanamycin and nalidixic acid. A class 1 integron of 1.5\u2009kb was detected for the four serotype Virchow isolates with the gene cassette dfrA16-aadA2. The bla(CTX-M-9) gene was carried by an \u223c300-kb IncHI2 conjugative plasmid in the case of the S. enterica serotype Virchow isolates. The bla(CTX-M-1) gene was carried by an \u223c100-kb IncI1-N conjugative plasmid for the serotype Enteritidis ESC-resistant isolate. All the four ESC-resistant strains of S. enterica serotype Virchow clustered together in a XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which also revealed a strong similarity between them and some pulsotypes of S. enterica serotype Virchow from France.",

However, large-scale production and purification of endolysins is frequently impaired due to their low solubility. In addition, a large number of endolysins appear to exhibit reduced lytic efficacy when compared with their action during phage infection. Here, we took advantage of the high solubility of two recently characterized enterococcal endolysins to construct chimeras targeting Staphylococcus aureus. The putative cell wall binding domain of these endolysins was substituted by that of a staphylococcal endolysin that showed poor solubility. Under appropriate conditions the resulting chimeras presented the high solubility of the parental enterococcal endolysins. In addition, they proved to be broadly active against a collection of the most relevant methicillin-resistant S. aureus epidemic clones and against other Gram-positive pathogens. Thus, fusion of endolysin domains of heterologous origin seems to be a suitable approach to design new potent endolysins with changed and/or extended lytic spectrum that are amenable to large-scale production.",

Genotyping is an important tool for interpreting bacterial nosocomial outbreaks and implementing adequate control strategies. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether an outbreak of MDR P. aeruginosa occurring in different hospitals was due to a unique clone or independent isolates. From 2000 to 2003, 108 P. aeruginosa were recovered from colonized/infected inpatients in hospitals of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o, Brazil. The susceptibility test was performed with antipseudomonal drugs, and the presence of MBL genes were verified by PCR. Isolates were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The majority of strains was multiresistant including a great number presenting the colistin-only-sensitive (COS) profile. PFGE analysis revealed 54 genotypes, with predominance of three major COS clones (A, C, and E) coexisting at different moments and hospitals. Clone A harbored the bla(SPM) gene. Eight unique genotypes also had the COS profile. Other eight MDR genotypes presented isolates with differences in resistance profiles. Here we detected, for the first time, the coexistence of COS P.aeruginosa genotypes disseminated in several hospitals during long periods, attacking patients under various clinical conditions.",

        "abstract": "Lactobacilli play a crucial role as probiotics and as starter cultures in the production of fermented foods. Although lactobacilli are a technologically useful and beneficial group of bacteria, a few members of them have been rarely correlated with bacterial infections. Correspondingly, clinicians are interested in the antimicrobial susceptibility of lactobacilli. In addition, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is also relevant for commercially applied lactobacilli as bacterial strains harboring transferable antibiotic resistance genes should not be used in fermented and probiotic foods. Therefore, two methods were developed by different organizations, which were compared within this study. For this purpose, 22 Lactobacillus-type strains were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility to 16 antibiotics following the procedures of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the International Organization of Standardization (ISO)/International Dairy Federation (IDF). Crucial discrepancies between both procedures were detected mainly due to the different AST media. Hence, half of the strains tested did not consistently grow in the CLSI medium, whereas all showed evaluable growth in the ISO/IDF medium. However, some antibiotics were influenced by the latter medium. In particular, low levels of essential agreement between both methods were obtained with seven antibiotics. Accordingly, different interpretative criteria are needed for both procedures to distinguish resistant from susceptible strains.",

However, it was responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli when it was cloned under the control of the Plac promoter. Quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR showed that growth of C. difficile clinical strain 253 in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of ethidium bromide significantly increased the transcription of cdeA, but this was not observed with ciprofloxacin. The deduced protein was homologous to the protein sequences of known efflux pumps from the third cluster (the so-called DinF branch) of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family. CdeA caused ethidium bromide energy-dependent efflux in whole cells of E. coli. Efflux activity was stimulated by addition of Na+ ions, suggesting that CdeA, like other pumps of the MATE family, is a Na+-coupled efflux pump. CdeA is the first multidrug efflux transporter identified in C. difficile.",

Repetitive Extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction showed a high degree of genotypic diversity among E. coli strains and two major clonal populations of K. pneumoniae (CKp1 n=11 and CKp5 n=25) which were further identified as members of the multilocus sequence typing types (ST931) and (ST15), respectively. The ST15 isolates harbored more resistance genes and virulence factors than the ST931 isolates. The characterization of the spacer region between ISEcp1 and bla(CTX-M) for CTX-M-15 producers individualized two populations. One that derived from the CTX-M-3 under Algerian clinical context and one that is universally found.

TEM-1 was characterized in all strains and SHV-2a in only two strains. The genetic organization of bla(ACC-1) was determined by PCR mapping and sequencing. The plasmid-borne bla(ACC-1) gene mapped immediately downstream from ISEcp1. This ISEcp1 insertion sequence was itself disrupted by IS26 insertion sequences.

Here, we collected 1,320 clinical isolates from three hospitals in Shanghai. We developed a novel oligonucleotide microarray to detect mutations in the bla(SHV) gene, and validated the array data by direct sequencing. Sixty-two of the 1,320 isolates carried the bla(SHV) gene. The genotypes of these 62 isolates were successfully called by the microarray and were consistent with the genotypes identified by bidirectional sequencing. Sixteen different bla(SHV) alleles were identified. The SHV-1 variant was the most frequent (32.26%), followed by SHV-11 (27.42%) and SHV-12 (25.81%).

In the last decade, rates of H. pylori resistance to antibiotics were increasing drastically, requiring alternative therapeutic strategies to deal with eradication failures. Therefore, we evaluated the potential of bulgecin A, a glycosidic inhibitor of the lytic transglycosylase (LTG) Slt70 of Escherichia coli, as a new therapeutic approach against the H. pylori infection. In this study, we show that bulgecin A is able to specifically inactivate the H. pylori LTG Slt, but not its ortholog MltD. Moreover, bulgecin A synergized with amoxicillin, an inhibitor of penicillin binding proteins, inducing strong morphological alterations, cellular damages, and cell death. Similarly, the simultaneous inactivation of the peptidoglycan (PG) peptidase HdpA and Slt led to inhibition of H. pylori growth, highlighting the strong potential of targeting the PG biosynthetic pathway at different biochemical steps to enhance our therapeutic approaches against bacteria. Hence, we propose that bulgecin A constitutes an attractive compound for the development of new therapeutic strategies against H. pylori combined with other inhibitors of PG biosynthetic enzymes.",

To investigate if a similar pattern of spread occurs in Brazil, we characterized UPEC from women with community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI) in Rio de Janeiro. E. coli isolates from women with UTI in one public outpatient clinic were evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility, E. coli phylogenetic grouping, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) 2 PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis fingerprinting, and multilocus sequence typing. From March 2005 to November 2006, 344 patients were studied. Of these, 186 (54%) had confirmed UTI, 118 (63.4%) of which were caused by E. coli. More than 50% of these isolates were resistant to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Of these, 96 (81%) belonged to 19 ERIC2 clonal groups. The largest group included 15 isolates, all belonging to multilocus sequence typing group ST69 and phylogenetic group D; they had pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns sharing at least 89% similarity compared with the CgA reference strain ATCC BAA-457. CgA strains have been found to be widespread in the United States in the early 2000s. Clonal group E. coli strains accounted for a large proportion (52%) of all UTIs and 82% of the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant E. coli UTIs. Thus, as in North America and Europe, UPECs that cause UTI in Rio de Janeiro also show clonal distribution, and a substantial proportion of drug-resistant UTI is caused by a small set of genetically related E. coli strains.",

Subsequently, a 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV-13) has been introduced. This study assessed the incidence of S. pneumoniae serotypes in all age groups prior to the introduction of PCV-13 in Canada (2007-2009). Eight hundred S. pneumoniae isolates from respiratory specimens and blood cultures were collected as part of a Canadian surveillance study (CANWARD) from patients in 15 tertiary-care centers. Serotyping was performed by the Quellung method and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. The most common serotypes were 19A (8.6%), 3 (7.3%), 22F (6.0%), 4 (4.6%), 5 (4.4%), and 11A (4.4%); and the first serotype 6D isolate in Canada was identified. Serotypes 5, 7F, and 19A were significantly (p<0.001) more frequently isolated from bloodstream infections. Considerable serotype variability was noted for different age groups: 15B (p<0.01) and 19A (p<0.001) were more frequently isolated from children \u22642 years old. Overall, 46.4% of currently circulating S. pneumoniae serotypes in Canada are included in PCV-13. Notably, 87.5% of MDR-S. pneumoniae were covered by PCV-13. Accordingly, PCV-13 will provide coverage against a significant proportion of circulating S. pneumoniae strains in Canada, including the critical antimicrobial-resistant strains.",

        "abstract": "The epidemiology of patients associated with ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (ARE) was investigated by combining both clinical approach and molecular analysis in a kidney transplant patient's ward. A case-control study was performed to identify risk factors for ARE by matching each patient with ARE with two control patients without any isolated E. faecium strain. ARE isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. From June 2004 to May 2006, 18 cases with clinical ARE samples were detected and compared with 35 control patients. By univariate analysis, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) (odds ratio [OR], 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-25.6), mean number of hospitalization days in the last year (p < 0.003), pyelonephritis or UTI (OR, 9.6; 95% CI, 2.2-46.1), oral third-generation cephalosporin use (OR, 12.42; 95% CI, 2.04-109.1), and fluoroquinolone use (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.1-18.2) were significantly associated with ARE urinary tract colonization. By conditional logistic regression, hospitalization >21 days within 1 year (adjusted OR [aOR], 6.9; 95% CI, 1.0-46.5), recent medical history of pyelonephritis or UTI (aOR, 8.6; 95% CI, 1.5-49.1), and prior oral third-generation cephalosporin use (aOR, 13.1; 95% CI, 1.2-142.6) were identified as independent factors associated with ARE urinary tract colonization. Genotyping revealed a heterogeneous epidemiological situation with two major clones in patients hospitalized in successive rooms and 10 different single pulsotypes. Emergence of highly resistant enterococcal strains is a collateral damage from antibiotic prescription and represents a potential source of patient-to-patient transmission. Combining epidemiological approach and molecular analysis is a powerful tool to delineate mechanisms of emerging resistance. Improving our knowledge on ARE emergence in high antibiotic pressure hospital wards is a key factor to better control these colonizations/infections and to prevent the emergence of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium.",

All strains isolated from patients and from nasal swabs obtained from four members of the CS-ICU personnel, belonged to the same identified clone. The characteristics of this clone were: (1) resistance to ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, rifampin, spectinomycin, and tetracycline; (2) vancomycin and teicoplanin MICs respectively of 2 and 4 mg/L; (3) heteroresistant subpopulations in the presence of 4 and 6 mg/L of vancomycin (10(-3) and 10(-5), respectively); (4) clonal type I::J::C determined following an established protocol (mec A::Tn 554 ::PFGE); (5) sequence type ST247 (3-3-1-12-4-4-16), obtained by multilocus sequence typing (MLST); and (6) the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCC) IA, obtained by multiplex PCR method. This new strain had different characteristics from the epidemic clone circulating in the same hospital from 1997 and designed \"Rome clone,\" which was susceptible to erythromycin, clindamycin, and spectinomycin and belonged to the II::NH::C genetic background. A high genetic similarity between this Rome clone and the previously classified Archaic and Iberian clones was found, because they shared the same allelic profile (ST247), probably originating from the same S. aureus ancestor of the Iberian MRSA strains. Therefore, the strains responsible for the outbreak, with vancomycin MICs 2-4 mg/L, are variant clones, showing the genotype of the \"Rome clone,\" the ST247 in association with SCC mec type IA (ST247-MRSA-IA), and are characterized by a uniform susceptibility to fosfomycin.",

        "abstract": "In Sweden the use of antimicrobial growth promoters (AMGP) was banned in 1986. The experiences gained from that ban are presented. In production of slaughter pigs, specialized beef, and turkeys, no negative clinical effects were reported as a consequence of the ban. In broiler chicken production, expected problems with necrotic enteritis were prevented by a continuous use of antibiotics, largely to the same extent during the first 2 years after the ban. Following the implementation of results from experimental activities during that period, the general usage of antimicrobials could be stopped and expected problems with outbreaks of necrotic enteritis was prevented. In piglet production, significant clinical problems emerged that created a demand for antibiotic-medicated feed at therapeutic dosages. During the subsequent 4-year period, the use of antibiotics increased, involving up to 75% of the pigs. Thereafter, the use of antibiotics decreased because of improved management, and could be halved in 1993 followed by a gradual further decrease supported by the addition of zinc oxide to the feed. In 1998, compared to 1994, the total use of zinc decreased by 90%. In 1998/1999, only 5% of weaning piglet producing herds used antibiotic medicated feed and 17% used zinc. The AMGP ban has shown that under good production conditions it is possible to reach good and competitive production results for the rearing of poultry, calves, and pigs without the continuous use of AMGP. As a result of the ban and a focus on disease prevention and correct use of antimicrobials, the total use of antibacterial drugs to animals in Sweden decreased by approximately 55% during the last 13-year period, and a relatively low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance has been maintained.",

The aim of this work was to characterize the Escherichia coli population from Franklin's gull feces, focusing on the extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains. In the summer of 2011, 124 fecal swabs from seagulls (1 of each) migrating from the United States and Canada to the coast of Antofagasta, north of Chile, were collected. Samples were seeded on MacConkey agar supplemented with 2\u2009\u03bcg/ml of cefotaxime and a single colony from each plate was tested for ESBL production by the double-disk ESBL synergy test. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the disk diffusion method and blaESBL genes were amplified and sequenced. The genetic diversity of isolates was explored by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)-XbaI and multilocus sequence typing. A total of 91 E. coli isolates with high rates of antibiotic resistance were identified. Carbapenemase production was not detected, whereas 67 of the 91 (54%) isolates exhibited an ESBL phenotype due to the presence of CTX-M-15 (61.3%), CTX-M-2 (19.3%), CTX-M-22 (16.1%), and CTX-M-3 (1.6%) coding genes. High genetic diversity was observed, with 30 PFGE patterns and 23 sequence types (STs), including ST131 (18%), ST44 (15%), ST617 (9%), and ST10 (9%). Results presented here are complementary to those previously reported by Hern\u00e1ndez et al. in the same gull species, but located in the Central Region of Chile. Differences observed between gulls from both areas lead us to hypothesize that gulls from the northern location retain, as gut carriers, those resistant bacteria acquired in the United States and/or Canada.",

A total of 608 non-duplicated Enterobacteriaceae isolates were obtained prior antibiotic treatment from diseased dogs (n=464) and cats (n=144). Among the 608 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 22 presented a minimal inhibitory concentration against cefotaxime above EUCAST breakpoints of susceptibility. All the 22 isolates remained susceptible to carbapenems. Ten isolates were confirmed as extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers by PCR-sequencing of bla coding genes including 9 blaCTX-M (CTX-M-1, 14, 15, 32,\u2026) and 1 blaTEM-52 and 12 were AmpC-producing isolates (10 plasmidic CMY-2 group and 2 isolates overexpressing their chromosomal AmpC). ESBLs and plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC)-producing isolates were mainly recovered from dogs (n=17) suffering from urinary tract infections (n=13) and originated from eight different countries. ESBL-bearing plasmids were mostly associated with IncFII incompatibility groups while CMY-2 was predominantly associated with plasmid of the IncI1 group. ESBL/pAmpC-producing Escherichia coli belonged to phylogroup A (n=5), B2 (n=4), and D (n=5). Multilocus sequence typing analysis revealed that among three CTX-M-15-producing E. coli, two belong to sequence type (ST) 131 and one to ST405. The presence of CTX-M-15 including on IncFII plasmids in E. coli ST131-B2 has also been described in isolates of human origin.

        "abstract": "Two class 1 integrons, In-t1 and In-t2, were previously identified in IncFI plasmids of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. Molecular analysis revealed a close physical link between the two integrons. In-t1 is preceded by the transposase genes of Tn21, whereas In-t2 is located downstream the 3'-conserved segment (3'-CS) of In-t1, in a head-to-tail configuration. In-t1 shows a peculiar sequence downstream the 3'-CS, containing an extended version of the open reading frame known as ORF341 (referred to as ORF341E) and a novel trimethoprim resistance gene, designated dfrA18. Retrospective analysis provided evidence for In-t1 insertion within Tn1935, a Tn21-related transposon identified in IncFI plasmids circulating among epidemic clones of multidrug-resistant S. enterica during the 1970s. Structural comparison between Tn21 derivatives from recent and ancestor IncFI plasmids showed that In-t2 has been conserved by these replicons. In-t1 belongs to a novel family of class 1 integrons containing the ORF341E sequence, and appears to have been acquired by IncFI plasmids after the assembly of Tn1935. In-t1 insertion occurred within the 5'-conserved segment (5'-CS) proximal region of the resident In-t2.",

Fifty-six MDR-TB cases and 304 controls were enrolled of which 40 MDR-TB cases and 222 controls were from Ouagadougou. The majority of cases were male, with 39 among MDR-TB cases and 205 in controls. The MDR-TB cases were aged from 14 to 75 years versus 11 to 75 years in the controls. The total risk assessment battery score was 11. Living outside of Burkina Faso (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.017; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.001-0.325), known TB contact (OR = 0.045; 95% CI: 0.004-0.543), and patients with previous history of TB treatment (OR = 0.004; 95% CI: 0.000-0.0.052) were significantly associated with MDR-TB. TB contact and mainly previous treatment were the strongest determinants of MDR-TB. Also, living outside Burkina was a risk factor.",

        "abstract": "The spreading of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and genes from food-producing animals to humans has been a subject of increasing concern. To clarify the role of flies in spreading the extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) gene from food-producing animals to humans, we isolated and characterized a third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli strain from flies and cattle feces from a cattle barn. Cephalosporin-resistant strains were isolated from 14.3% (13/91) of houseflies, 10.3% (7/68) of false stable flies, and 7.5% (7/93) of cattle feces. Twenty-seven cephalosporin-resistant strains were tested for the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes. Of the 27 samples, 22 isolates from 11 houseflies, 5 false stable flies, and 6 cattle feces samples harbored the blaCTX-M-15 gene. All blaCTX-M-15-harboring isolates belonged to phylogenetic group D and the ST38 clonal group. Analysis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that these isolates were divided into two clusters, indicating that flies carried several of the same clones that were detected in cattle feces. All blaCTX-M-15 gene-harboring plasmids were transferable and were members of incompatibility group FIB. These results suggest that transferable plasmids encoding ESBL were prevalent among flies and cattle. As vectors, flies may play an important role in spreading ESBL-producing bacteria from food-producing animals to humans.",

Between October 2010 and March 2011, E. coli (n=460) and K. pneumoniae (n=78) isolates were collected at a tertiary care hospital in Guadalajara, Mexico. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each isolate was determined using a broth microdilution method, and ESBL production was assayed. The presence of \u03b2-lactamase genes, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, and blaTLA-1, was detected by PCR and confirmed with sequencing. Only ESBL-producing isolates were further subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and plasmid profiling. All of the ESBL isolates were multidrug resistant and 75/460 (16.3%) E. coli isolates and 21/78 (26.9%) K. pneumoniae isolates were found to produce ESBL. For the E. coli isolates, >95% susceptibility to amikacin, meropenem, fosfomycin, imipenem, and nitrofurantoin was observed. For K. pneumoniae, similar results were obtained, with discrepancies observed for gentamicin and nitrofurantoin. PFGE further identified eleven pulsotypes for E. coli and three clusters of K. pneumoniae. CTX-M-15 was detected in 85% of ESBL-producing E. coli and in 76% of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. In contrast, SHV-5 ESBL was identified in 17% of E. coli isolates and in 86% of K. pneumoniae isolates. The bla-TLA-1 gene was not detected in any of the 96 isolates analyzed. Overall, CTX-M-15 and SHV-5 were found to have a high rate of spread throughout the hospital and were associated with strong multidrug resistance.",

With PFGE, these strains were divided into three common (C) but closely related types (i.e., C1, C1a, and C1b) and eight single (S) types (S1-S8). C1 contained 40 isolates, while C1a and C1b contained 5 and 2 isolates, respectively. All isolates from Royal Brisbane and Women Hospital (RBWH) were resistant to 12 or more antibiotics. Four common pattern of antibiotic resistance (PAR) was observed among the isolates. The dominant PAR contained 39 strains from RBWH, isolated during 2000 (n = 6), 2001 (n = 16), and 2002 (n = 17) and were resistant to 14 antibiotics. Of these, 36 strains (92%) had identical PAR/PFGE types. Class 1 integrase genes were detected in all of the 53 isolates with 5 isolates also having class 2 integrase gene. No class 3 integrase gene was detected among the isolates. Our data suggest the presence of a dominant and persistent clone of multiresistant A. baumannii strain carrying class 1 integron in this hospital setting.",

Most isolates were distributed among three pulsed-field gel electrophoresis clusters and were characterized by low variability relative to antibiotic resistance patterns, in E. coli phylogroups and by the prevalence of virulence and bacteriocin determinants. Despite this, 14 groups of identical isolates (comprising a total of 41 isolates) were identified when all tested parameters of E. coli were combined.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Since the occurrence of E. coli B2-O25b-ST131 CTX-M-27 was only recently described in Asia, the frequent isolation of this lineage among patients in South Moravia suggests an efficient transfer of this clone from Asian countries. The limited variability of detected parameters of ESBL-producing UPEC strains is consistent with a common origin of the analyzed isolates, in which there is an ongoing process of genetic diversification.",

The impact of PCV7 on invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) in children is unknown. There are 340 medical institutions that actively participated in our surveillance project throughout Japan. We collected 252 strains from patients with IPD in 2006 (pre-PCV7), 280 strains in 2010 (under 10% immunization achieved), and 128 strains in 2011 (50% to 60% immunization). Serotypes and penicillin-resistance genotypes (g) were compared between these years. Multilocus sequence typing was also carried out on these strains. Due to the official promotion, IPD significantly decreased in 2011 (p<0.001). In particular, meningitis and sepsis caused by vaccine type (VT) strains declined (p=0.033, p<0.001). In less than 2 years, among nonvaccine types (NVT), 15A and 22F increased in 2011 (p=0.015, p=0.015). Coverage by PCV7 decreased from 71.8% in 2006 to 51.6% in 2011. Sequence-type diversities accompanied by evolution to gPRSP occurred in both VT and NVT strains. Reduction of IPD caused by VT strains was accomplished, but a rapid increase of NVT raises concern about a future decrease in the efficacy of PCV7.",

The mec region harbors in addition a highly polymorphic element, the dru (direct repeat unit) segment, which in an early S. aureus strain, BB270, was found to contain 10 imperfect 40 base-pair repeats. We have explored the utility of direct sequencing of dru segments for discriminating among strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS). We sequenced dru segments of 24 clinical isolates of MRSA, and 15 of MRCNS, and reexamined strain BB270. Six S. aureus and 2 S. epidermidis isolates were found to have deletions which removed all drus. The other strains were found to have multiple contiguous dru repeats of precisely 40 bp. Analysis of these strains plus dru segment sequence from 4 recent reports yielded 18 unique dru segment sequences (designated \"dru types\") differing in numbers of repeats and/or sequences of particular repeats. Dru typing was more discriminating than sequencing of non-mec region genes, including a repeat-containing segment (spa Xr) of the S. aureus protein A gene. Yet dru type was sufficiently stable to register epidemiological clusters. Dru sequencing is a useful tool for tracking methicillin-resistant lineages of S. aureus and CNS.",

Bacteriophage therapy is a possible alternative treatment for multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. In this study, we have successfully isolated bacteriophage active against clinical strains of A. baumannii by enrichment from hospital sewage sludge using representatives of those strains. The bacteriophage isolated against A. baumannii formed plaques against beta-lactamases producing strains of A. baumannii. The utility of bacteriophage specific for A. baumannii to resolve wound infection in uncontrolled diabetic rats was evaluated. Five groups of uncontrolled diabetic rats were used. Group I was noninfected (Control), Group II was infected with MDR A. baumannii and challenged with bacteriophage, Group III was infected with MDR A. baumannii, Group IV was infected with MDR A. baumannii and challenged with antibiotic colistin, and Group V consisted of noninfected rats and sprayed with phage (Phage control). A significant decrease in infection, period of epithelization, and wound contraction was observed in the phage-challenged group when compared with antibiotic-treated uncontrolled diabetic rats and the control group. To conclude the study, new insights are provided into the biology of the broad host range of A. baumannii phage, demonstrating that A. baumannii phage has prospects for the treatment of infections caused by the MDR A. baumannii.",

Methods: A retrospective, 1:2 matched cohort study was performed to evaluate the impact of ESBL on APN treated with empirical ceftriaxone. Each patient in ESBL group was matched with two patients in the non-ESBL group, using a 16-point scoring system, which included age, sex, bacteremia, simplified acute physiology score 2, Charlson comorbidity index and APN severity score. Results: From 2009 to 2011, among 1,322 community-onset cases of the E. coli bacteriuria with 212 (16%) ESBL producers, 261 patients with APN were treated empirically with ceftriaxone in a secondary care hospital. Among these 261 cases, twenty-six patients in the ESBL group and 52 matched patients in the non-ESBL group (1:2) were included. Mean time to defervescence was 4.6\u00b12.2 days in the ESBL group and 2.6\u00b11.3 days in the non-ESBL group (p<0.01). Rate of microbiological resolution within 5 days after antibiotic treatment was 77% (17/22) in the ESBL group and 100% (45/45) in the non-ESBL group (p=0.01). The duration of hospitalization was 13.3\u00b18.2 days in the ESBL group and 7.3\u00b13.5 days in the non-ESBL group (p<0.01). No patient died in either group. Conclusion: Empirical ceftriaxone therapy for APN caused by ESBL-producing E. coli is inappropriate, and consequently can delay recovery and result in longer hospitalization.",

Eleven OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were recovered from patients treated in nine different hospitals in Kuwait. Susceptibility testing to eighteen antibiotics was done using the E-test. PCR assays were performed for the detection of genes encoding extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs) (blaCTX-M, blaSHV, and blaTEM) and carbapenemases (blaOXA-48, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaGIM, and blaKPC). STs were determined by Multilocus Sequence Typing. Seven Klebsiella pneumoniae, two Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter cloacae, and one Morganella morganii harbored the blaOXA-48 gene. The K. pneumoniae and E. coli belonged to seven and two different STs, respectively, which were not related to those reported from this region. The majority of the isolates carried either blaCTX-M or blaSHV genes and showed a multidrug-resistant phenotype, including resistance to tigecycline.

        "abstract": "Serogroup 6 of Streptococcus pneumoniae contains four established serotypes (6A-6D). Recently, putative serotype 6E (genotype 6E) was proposed as a novel type, which is cross-reactive with 6B-specific antiserum, but its capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) locus is genetically distinct from those of serotypes 6A and 6B. In the present study, prevalence of genotype 6E was analyzed by a newly designed multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for noninvasive or colonizing S. pneumoniae isolates in northern Japan assigned to serogroup 6 in our previous study by the sequential multiplex PCR developed by Pai et al. Among the isolates previously assigned to 6A and 6B, 2.2% (1/45) and 77.3% (140/181) of isolates, respectively, were revealed to have cps genes of genotype 6E. Eight 6E isolates selected for further analysis were found to have identical or highly similar sequences of cps genes (wzg, wzh, wze, wciN, wciP, and wzy) to those of strains previously reported as putative serotype 6E, and all the isolates were classified into sequence type 90 (ST90). Reanalysis of genetic traits on penicillin and macrolide resistance clarified significantly higher rates of three pbp mutations (gPRSP) and ermB in genotype 6E than in serotypes 6A and 6B. These findings suggested a need for detection of genotype 6E in the surveillance of S. pneumoniae serotypes.",

Vancomycin resistance mechanisms were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. vanA-containing enterococci were detected in 3 of 66 samples (4.5%) and 5 of 22 samples (22.7%) of the pig and pet samples, respectively. Seven unrelated pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns were detected among the 8 vanA isolates (7 Enterococcus faecium, 1 E. faecalis). The tet(M) gene was present in all eight vanA enterococcal isolates, while the erm(B) and aac(6')-Ie-aph(2\")-Ia genes were detected in 6 and 3 isolates, respectively. Colonization by vanC-1-containing enterococci (E. gallinarum) was demonstrated in 3% and 4.5% of the pig and pet samples. The aac(6')-Ie-aph(2\")-Ia, ant(6)-Ia, aph(3')-IIIa, erm(B) and tet(M) genes were identified in one of the E. gallinarum isolates from a pig fecal sample. One vanB2-containing E. hirae strain was detected in the fecal sample of a healthy pig. In this isolate, the vanB2 gene cluster was integrated into the Tn5382-like element, as demonstrated by specific PCRs and sequencing. The tet(M) and erm(B) genes were also detected in this isolate. This is the first report in which a vanB2-containing enterococci is detected in animals and in E. hirae.",

The majority of strains showed a high level of resistance to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Double-disk synergy test and E-test strips were used to confirm production of ESBLs. The molecular analysis revealed that the majority of strains (91%) carried genes encoding CTX-M-15. SHV-12 and SHV-2a were produced, respectively, by 9% and 3% of the strains. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates revealed four different clonal groups and three for Escherichia coli, showing the absence of spread of any epidemic clone. The CTX-M-15 ESBL-producing E. coli of the major clonal group belong to the B2 phylogenetic group, to the sequence type 131, and has a high virulence potential. In conclusion, CTX-M-15 ESBLs accounted for the overwhelming majority of ESBL types among Enterobacteriaceae from our hospital. This study confirms the high rate of ESBLs in Tunisia and further demonstrates the worldwide spread of genes coding for CTX-M-15 enzymes in clinical isolates.",

Francisco Xavier Hospital, Lisbon, to evaluate risk factors for nasopharyngeal carriage of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae and to characterize their phenotype and antimicrobial susceptibility. The attending pediatrician completed written questionnaires about the children's demographic and clinical histories. Over half the children (52.8%) carried H. influenzae and/or S. pneumoniae. Forty-one percent of these children had H. influenzae, 22.8% had S. pneumoniae and 36.2% had both. Risk factors identified for carriage of respiratory pathogens were: age below 3 years (p < 0.05), black race (p < 0.01), attending a daycare center (p < 0.05), and having a lower respiratory infection (p < 0.05). Asthmatic children were less likely to be carriers (p = 0.004). About two-thirds of H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics tested, 7.9% were beta-lactamase producers, 16.4% were nonsusceptible to trimethoprim, and 6.9% were intermediately resistant to clarithromycin. Over half (57.1%) of S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics tested, 21.1% were multiresistant, 23.3% were nonsusceptible to penicillin, and about 20% were resistant to macrolides. Low-level resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was detected in 2.3%. The data reflect the controversy surrounding risk factors of nasopharyngeal colonization. These may have significant implications on clinical practice and on antimicrobial strategies to prevent the appearance of further resistant strains. Our findings highlight the importance to investigate the relationship between asthma and carriage.",

        "abstract": "The relative effects of risk factors on the prevalence of resistant pneumococcal clones are hard to determine. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of risk factors on the prevalence of resistant pneumococci in Iceland in 2003 and compare these data with results of identical studies performed in 1993 and 1998. A randomized sample of 1,107 children was chosen from all 2,532 children 1 to 6 years old living in four communities. Pneumococci were carried by 64% of the 824 children enrolled and 9.5% were penicillin nonsusceptible (PNSP), as opposed to 8.1% (1998) and 8.5% (1993), and multiresistant strains of serotype 6B were 2.5% compared to 7.5% and 7.7% (p < 0.001). Antimicrobial use had declined in 10 years from 1.5 to 1.0 courses/child per year. The only significant risk factor for carriage of PNSP and erythromycin-resistant pneumococci was antimicrobial consumption. The multiresistant type 6B strains disappeared from the areas with the lowest antimicrobial use but maintained unchanged prevalence in the area with the highest use. The number of erythromycin- resistant, penicillin-susceptible strains of all pneumococci (37/475, 7.8%) increased significantly from the previous studies (7/353, 2.0%, 1998, and 2/390, 0.5%, 1993). This observation is associated with increased use of macrolides, especially azithromycin, in one of the study areas. Spread of novel resistant clones appears to be the main reason for rapid and significant changes in pneumococcal resistance rates. The choice of antimicrobial class appears to influence the selective environment favoring particular resistant clones.",

Three blaNDM-1-carrying Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.16%, 3/1,870), isolated from a teaching hospital in Xi'an, exhibited high levels of resistance to all \u03b2-lactams, but remained susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, and polymyxin B.

The IncX3 plasmid, pNDM-SX04 (KC876051) showed 99% identity with plasmid pNDM-HN380 (JX104760). Comparative analysis of the genetic environment of blaNDM-1 with previously published plasmids revealed the same 7,830-bp basic mobile element, which may have been derived from Acinetobacter spp. Partial ISAba125, ISAba125 promoter, blaNDM-1, and bleMBL could serve as the minimal mobile vehicle facilitating horizontal transfer of the blaNDM-1 gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an outbreak of blaNDM-1-carrying ST147 K. pneumoniae. Although the prevalence spread by the blaNDM-1 gene prevalence is at a low frequency in mainland China, a dynamic national surveillance of this gene is needed due to its potential transferability.",

A gene cluster aadE-sat4-aphA-3, which was first described in staphylococci, has been recently identified also in E. faecium. In staphylococci, this gene cluster was mostly integrated into the transposable element, Tn5405. We identified five different cluster types of Tn5405-like elements that were linked to erm(B) in 47 of 67 aadE-sat4-aphA-3 and erm(B) positive isolates (70.1%). Clusters differed by insertion of additional DNA between the IS1182 transposase gene and the left inverted repeat of IS1182, an integration of IS1216 between erm(B) and ORF X deleting IS1182 and the 5' end of ORF X, or a loss of the left end of Tn5405 including IS1182, ORF X, and the 5' end of ORF Y. Twenty isolates (29.8%) possessed neither a link between erm(B) and aadE-sat4-aphA-3 nor an arrangement of aadE-sat4-aphA-3 in a Tn5405-like element. A 17-kb composite cluster was identified in a single hospital isolate linking determinants for glycopeptide (vanA), macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B [erm(B)], and aminoglycoside-streptothricin (aadE-sat4-aphA-3) resistances.",

Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of three classes of antibiotics were determined using the E. test. Standard polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing were performed using primers targeting ESBL, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methyltransferases, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs), and quinolone encoding genes. Clonal relationships among the clinical isolates were performed using multilocus sequence typing. From our clinical isolates, we found high rates of antimicrobial resistance that were linked to the presence of different ESBL encoding genes and AMEs, including 23 strains that harbored several ESBL encoding genes along with the 16S rRNA methyltransferase armA. Among these isolates, we identified a cluster of eight isolates of the ST39 clone between February and June 2010 in a pediatric ward, suggesting that an outbreak had occurred during this period. In conclusion, the emergence of multidrug-resistant clones, which were likely responsible for a nosocomial outbreak, is worrying because there are already limited options in those critical situations. Finally, we believe that surveillance should be implemented to monitor the risk of emergence and spread of carbapenemases in Algeria.",

Clonal relationships between the CTX-M-producing E. coli isolates causing urinary tract infections were also studied. A total of 90 hospital- and 45 community-acquired cephalosporin-resistant E. coli isolates were obtained. Tetracycline, enrofloxacine, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethaxozole resistance rates were significantly different between the community-onset and hospital-acquired isolates. A high diversity of different ESBLs was observed among the hospital-acquired E. coli isolates, whereas CTX-M-15 was dominating among the community-acquired E. coli isolates (n = 28). Thirteen different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles were observed in the community-acquired CTX-M-15-producing E. coli, indicating that multiple clones have acquired the bla(CTX-M-15) gene. All community-acquired CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates of phylogroups B2 and D were assigned to the sequence type ST131. The hospital-acquired CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates of phylogroups B2, B1, A, and D corresponded to ST131, ST617, ST48, and ST405, respectively. In conclusion, CTX-M-type ESBLs have emerged as the predominant class of ESBLs produced by E. coli isolates in the hospital and community in Belgium.

Pairs of penicillin-intermediate pneumococci of the same serogroup or serotype present in both patient populations were characterized further by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Seven such pairs of isolates were found and included serogroups 7, 11, 15B/C, and 16 as well as serotypes 13, 21, and 35B. PFGE of these seven pairs showed no clonality between serogroups or serotypes, and clonality only within serogroup 11 and serotype 13. MLST of the 14 individual isolates revealed 13 different sequence types (STs), 11 of which had not previously been recorded. Comparisons with all known STs revealed that most of these strains were related only to strains of the same serotype in other countries, with these related strains frequently also being penicillin intermediate. These findings suggest that penicillin nonsusceptibility in Uganda is likely due to the introduction of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal clones into Uganda rather than development of resistance within the country.",

After identification tests, the susceptibility to the antibiotics was done by Kirby-Bauer method and broth microdilution. Carbapenem-resistant isolates were tested for carbapenemase production using the modified Hodge test (MHT). Carbapenem-resistant strains screened for bla(KPC) gene and genes encoding MBLs. Twenty-three isolates (6.3%) were resistant to meropenem, eleven isolates (3%) were resistant to ertapenem, and four isolates (1.1%) were resistant to imipenem. MHT was positive in 11 (47.8%) of the carbapenem-resistant isolates.

MIC and disk diffusion diameters were compared for 587 bovine mastitis bacterial isolates collected in Israel and 3,186 drug-organism combinations. Results were analyzed by ROC curves, Bayesian statistics, and standard descriptive methods. Low correlation was observed between results of disk diffusion and MIC for S. dysgalactiae and all antimicrobial agents, S. aureus and erythromycin and neomycin, and E. coli and gentamicin, neomycin, and polymyxin B. On a few occasions in which correlation was satisfactory, accepted susceptibility breakpoints to some of the antimicrobial agents resulted in high discrepancies with MIC results and new breakpoints were suggested-e.g., 21 mm for S. aureus susceptibility to penicillin G instead of 29 mm recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) and <21 mm, resistant, 21-25 mm, intermediate, and >25 mm, susceptible for susceptibility of E. coli to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Thus, this approach enabled determination of the most accurate breakpoints that best fitted the specific prevalence of susceptibility in Israel. Thus, we suggest its adoption by microbiology diagnostic laboratories for the provision of accurate antimicrobial susceptibility results when using the disk diffusion test.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria represent a major threat to human and animal health. We compared equine fecal samples (n=264) from 138 horses from hospital and nonhospital (livery stable and riding school) premises in North West England to determine the prevalence of Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter and rates of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli strains. Campylobacter jejuni was detected only in hospitalized horses (1.1%), and no Salmonella was identified. Data analysis of the horses' management and veterinary treatments (Tx) identified risk factors associated with shedding of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli. The hospital was the major source of resistant and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) E. coli. Moreover, shedding of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli was associated significantly with hospitalization for a gastrointestinal problem (odds ratio [OR]:+/-95% confidence intervals=8.50:1.79-40.32), receipt of oral antimicrobial Tx (OR=3.52:1.11-11.10), multiple antimicrobial Tx in hospital (OR/Tx=1.05:1.01-1.09), or geldings (OR=4.62:1.23-17.46). Interestingly, intravenous antimicrobial Tx was negatively associated with shedding of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli (OR=0.18:0.04-0.76). MDR E. coli was associated with hospitalization, antimicrobial Tx in hospital (OR/Tx=3.65:1.54-8.68), and increased age (OR/year=1.11:1.03-1.19). Thus, equine hospitals in this geographic location appear to be an important source of antimicrobial-resistant and MDR E. coli strains, but unlikely reservoirs of Salmonella or Campylobacter. Thus, it is important to moderate antimicrobial Tx given to hospitalized horses to lessen exposure and fecal shedding of resistant pathogens.",

To understand the current status of resistance to available antifungal agents among Candida species causing invasive infections, the in vitro susceptibilities of 222 isolates (collected from July, 1999-June, 2001) were determined. Among all of the Candida species tested, 6% and 7% were resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. The MIC90 values of voriconazole and amphotericin B were 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, although some isolates of C. krusei (amphotericin B and voriconazole MIC, >64 microg/ml) and C. tropicalis and C. glabrata (voriconazole MICs, >64 microg/ml) were less susceptible to voriconazole or amphotericin B. About one-half of the C. glabrata isolates belonged to susceptible dose-dependent (SDD, 36%) or resistant (12%) categories for fluconazole and 96% belonged to SDD (56%) or resistant (40%) category for itraconazole. When compared with fluconazole susceptibility data of blood Candida isolates recovered from patients treated at the same hospital (NTUH) from two different time periods (January, 1994, to June, 1995, and January, 1997, to June, 1999 described in previous reports), the incidence of increased susceptibility of non-krusei Candida isolates to fluconazole was evident. This trend of increasing susceptibility for fluconazole did not correlate to the increasing use of this agent in the hospital. None of the random amplified polymorphic DNA patterns generated by arbitrarily primed PCR using four random oligonucleotide primers for 14 isolates, which exhibited fluconazole MICs of > or = 16 microg/ml, were identical, indicating an absence of clonal dissemination among these isolates in the hospital.",

Among 4,538 patients admitted to the ICUs, 363 (8.0%) patients were found to have positive culture of VRE at the day of admission to the ICUs and 453 (10.0%) of patients were negative to the first day of admission but became colonized with VRE during the stay in ICU. Among 816 patients, 9 (1.1%) with VRE isolated from sterile sites were selected for further analysis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed a total of four PFGE banding patterns in the colonized and infected Enterococcus faecium isolates. Six of nine 9 were found to have an identical PFGE type Ia, suggesting the circulation of an endemic strain. All of these type Ia isolates also contained two potential virulence genes, the esp and hly genes and were first identified in Asia. After the further typing of 540 isolates that were randomly selected from each month, the endemic strain was not identified before the first patient was colonized and infected with this strain in November, 1998, but was isolated from other ICU patients during each month thereafter throughout the remainder of the study period. Although colonization of VRE is the first step toward infection, a low infection rate was observed, except in patients with prolonged hospitalization and severe illness. Use of the isolation room and reminders regarding hand hygiene failed to prevent the circulation of endemic strain. Thus, the SHEA guideline (Muto et al., Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2003;24:362-386) for preventing nosocomial transmission of VRE should be enforced.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence, distribution, and antimicrobial susceptibility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Belgian pig farms has been investigated. To that end, nasal samples were collected from 1,500 pigs on 50 farms randomly selected over Belgium. Both closed (breeding or farrow-to-finish) and open (fattening) farms were included. Within closed farms different age groups were investigated. A total number of 663 (44%) pigs belonging to 34 (68%) farms carried MRSA. According to their management practice, MRSA was detected on 94% of the open farms and 56% of the closed farms. Focusing on the in-herd prevalence among fattening pigs for both management systems, a significantly higher rate was found in open farms (72%) compared to closed farms (26%). Within the closed farms, piglets (41%) showed a higher MRSA prevalence than sows (26%) and fattening pigs (26%). All strains tested were ST398 and showed mainly spa-type t011, as commonly found on pig herds in Europe. Less dominating spa-types were t034, t567, and t2970. The MRSA strains carried two SCCmec-types, type IVa or V. All 643 MRSA strains were resistant to tetracycline and additional resistances to trimethoprim (97%), lincosamides (73%), macrolides (56%), aminoglycosides (48%), and fluoroquinolones (32%) were found. Multiresistance (defined as resistance to four or more non-\u03b2-lactam antimicrobial classes) was found in 63% of the tested strains. In conclusion, a high prevalence of MRSA was found in Belgian pig farms, with the highest prevalence in open farms. In accordance with other European countries, age-related and management-related differences in MRSA prevalence were observed that should be considered when control strategies are outlined.",

Therefore, this study was devoted to determine the prevalence and characterize ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in Al-Qassim area, Saudi Arabia. A total of 430 isolates of K. pneumoniae isolated from clinical samples were collected over 6 months from January to June 2008. These isolates were screened for the presence of ESBLs by double-disk synergy test and re-evaluated by E-test ESBL method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 15 antibiotics against ESBL-positive strains were determined by E-test strips. The \u03b2-lactamases involved were characterized by polymerase chain reaction assays and DNA sequencing. Conjugation experiments were done and ISEcp1 elements were tested among CTX-M positive isolates. The prevalence of ESBL was 25.6% (110/430) and all ESBL-positive isolates were sensitive to imipenem and tigecycline; however, the resistance rate to gentamicin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin was 87.3%, 10%, and 9.1%, respectively. Of these, 89.1% produced SHV, 70.9% produced TEM, and 36.4% were CTX-M-producing strains. The prevalence of ESBL SHV SHV-12 and SHV-5 was of 60% and 18.2%, respectively, and various non-ESBL SHV, including SHV-1 (5.5%), -11 (3.6%), and -85 (1.8%), was detected. However, the prevalence of CTX-M-15 and CTX-M-14 was 34.5% and 1.8%, respectively. ISEcp1 element was detected in 60% of bla(CTX-M-15) genes. All bla(CTX-M) genes were transferable; however, most of bla(SHV-12) and bla(SHV-5) were not transferable. TEM-type ESBLs were not detected in any of the isolates. This is the first description of CTX-M-14, SHV-5, SHV-11, and SHV-85 in Saudi Arabia.

Few reports, however, have addressed the molecular characteristics of S. aureus in Romania. In this study, we utilized spa typing, multilocus sequence typing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, dru typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and detection of virulence factors to characterize 146 S. aureus strains isolated from 2004 to 2005 at the Clinic County Hospital in Bra\u015fov. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns for all MRSA isolates and patient demographic data were also obtained. Fifty-six strains (38.4%) were determined to be MRSA by susceptibility testing and SCCmec typing. All MRSA strains were resistant to beta-lactams and tetracycline, but susceptible to nitrofurans, vancomycin, and clindamycin, with inducible clindamycin resistance in 23/28 clindamycin-sensitive/erythromycin-resistant isolates. Molecular typing identified 15 clonal backgrounds (CC 1, 5, 8, 8/239, 9, 15, 20, 22, 25, 30, 45, 80, 97, 101, and 121), only 4 of which were associated with MRSA (CC 1, 8/239, 30, and 80). Spa types 35 (t127, CC 1) and 351 (t030, CC 8/239) accounted for 27.4% and 21.9% of all S. aureus strains, respectively, and 19.6% and 57.1% of all MRSA strains. Both hospital-associated (SCCmec type III) and community-associated (SCCmec type IV) elements were identified within MRSA strains, whereas Panton-Valentine leukocidin was detected in 10 MRSA and 12 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains. These results demonstrate the presence of various endemic S. aureus clones within the Clinic County Hospital in Bra\u015fov, suggestive of ongoing nosocomial and community transmission.",

        "abstract": "The extensive use of antimicrobials is leaving medicine with few effective therapeutic options to treat many infections due to the fact that many organisms developed resistance to commonly used drugs. It is therefore pertinent to search not only for new antimicrobials but also for compounds able to restore or potentiate the activity of existing antibiotics. We have screened a library consisting of 40 (thio)xanthone derivatives for antibacterial activity and possible synergistic effects when used in combination with antibiotics. Nine out of the 40 compounds exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Two xanthone derivatives, 1-formyl-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy (7), 2-formyl-3-hydroxy-4-methoxyxanthone (8) and the thioxanthone derivative 1-((2-(diethylamino)ethyl)amino)-4-propoxythioxanthone (10) and its hydrochloride form 13, showed activity against a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolate with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values lower than 256 \u03bcg/ml. Thioxanthone 10 demonstrated antibacterial activity and also synergy when combined with ampicillin and oxacillin against MRSA. Additionally, thioxanthone 1-(piperidin-1-yl)-4-propoxythioxanthone (9), despite not having antibacterial activity presented remarkable synergy with oxacillin against MRSA; the MIC of tioxanthone 9 and oxacillin when both were in combination were 128 and 8 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Thioxanthones 9 and 10 were also found to be synergistic when both were combined. Subsequently, docking simulations between thioxanthones 9 and 10 and the allosteric domain of penicillin-binding protein 2A (PBP2A) were undertaken in AutoDock Vina. Both compounds had the ability to bind with an allosteric domain of PBP2A, which may explain their synergy with oxacillin. These two thioxanthone derivatives with different profiles may be promising tools for restoring the activity of oxacillin against MRSA.",

        "abstract": "Methicillin resistance in staphylococci is conferred by the acquisition in its chromosome of the mecA gene, which is located on a mobile genetic element called staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). Genetic type of SCCmec is defined by combination of mec gene complex class and cassette chromosome recombinase gene (ccr) allotype. In this study, we analyzed genetic diversity of the SCCmec in 11 Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains and a Staphylococcus sciuri strain, which were recently isolated from clinical specimens in Bangladesh. Among these strains, only two S. haemolyticus strains were proved to have the known types of SCCmec, that is, SCCmec V (class C2 mec-ccrC) and VII (class C1 mec-ccrC). Five S. haemolyticus strains were assigned two unique mec-ccr gene complexes combination; that is, class C1 mec-ccrA4B4 (four isolates) and class A mec-ccrC (one isolate). In the remaining four S. haemolyticus strains with class C1 mec, no known ccr allotypes could be detected. A single S. sciuri strain with class A mec complex carried a ccrA gene belonging to a novel allotype designated ccrA7, together with ccrB3. The ccrA7 gene in the S. sciuri strain showed 61.7%-82.7% sequence identity to the ccrA gene sequences published so far, and 75.3% identity to ccrA3, which is a component of the type 3 ccr complex (ccrA3-ccrB3) in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The results of the present study indicated that mec gene complex and ccr genes in coagulase-negative staphylococci are highly divergent, and distinct from those of common methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Identification of the novel ccrA7 allotype combined with ccrB3 suggested an occurrence of recombination between different ccr complexes in nature.",

Samples from meat-packing plants (MPPs) processing 70% of the slaughtered animals in Switzerland were purchased at different intervals between April and June 2013 and analyzed. Sixty-nine 3GC-R-Ec isolates were obtained and characterized by microarray, PCR/DNA sequencing, Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), and plasmid replicon typing. Plasmids of selected strains were transformed by electroporation into E. coli TOP10 cells and analyzed by plasmid MLST. The prevalence of 3GC-R-Ec was 73.3% in chicken and 2% in beef meat. No 3GC-R-Ec were found in pork and veal. Overall, the bla(CTX-M-1) (79.4%), bla(CMY-2) (17.6%), bla(CMY-4) (1.5%), and bla(SHV-12) (1.5%) \u03b2-lactamase genes were detected, as well as other genes conferring resistance to chloramphenicol (cmlA1-like), sulfonamides (sul), tetracycline (tet), and trimethoprim (dfrA). The 3GC-R-Ec from chicken meat often harbored virulence genes associated with avian pathogens. Plasmid incompatibility (Inc) groups IncI1, IncFIB, IncFII, and IncB/O were the most frequent. A high rate of clonality (e.g., ST1304, ST38, and ST93) among isolates from the same MPPs suggests that strains persist at the plant and spread to meat at the carcass-processing stage. Additionally, the presence of the blaCTX-M-1 gene on an IncI1 plasmid sequence type 3 (IncI1/pST3) in genetically diverse strains indicates interstrain spread of an epidemic plasmid. The bla(CMY-2) and bla(CMY-4) genes were located on IncB/O plasmids. This study represents the first comprehensive assessment of 3GC-R-Ec in meat in Switzerland. It demonstrates the need for monitoring contaminants and for the adaptation of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point concept to avoid the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria through the food chain.",

Infection in humans with Salmonella possessing RSC may compromise the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin therapy. Nineteen among 4,357 Salmonella strains isolated from food animals in Canada from 1998 to 1999 showed RSC; 17 were from turkeys and 2 from chickens. All were resistant to nalidixic acid and sulfisoxazole and possessed RSC at a level of 0.125-0.5 microg/ml. PCR-RFLP of the gyrA quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) with Hinfl revealed that S. Bredeney and S. Heidelberg isolates possessed a mutation in this region. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis showed that S. Schwarzengrund and S. Senftenberg isolates also possessed a point mutation in the QRDR. DNA sequencing confirmed the findings and showed that all isolates possessed a base substitution in the gyrA QRDR. Sequencing revealed no mutations in the gyrB and silent wobble mutations in the parC QRDR. Reserpine, a known efflux pump inhibitor, did not effect the MICs for ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline. The mar operon could be induced in all isolates at 37 degrees C and in 18 of 19 at 30 degrees C; induction resulted in a two- to four-fold increase in the MIC of ciprofloxacin. In 14 of the 19 isolates, the mutation rate was two-fold or higher than in a ciprofloxacin sensitive S. Bredeney and S. Typhimurium LT2 control strain. Examination of clonal relatedness using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and plasmid profiles indicated that some degree of clonal dispersion may have occurred, but the majority of isolates may have arisen from de novo mutations.",

In the present study, the prevalence of these virulence factors was analyzed for 23 S. aureus strains isolated from wound infections in hospitals, nasal swabs, or vomit from patients and cooks in a food poisoning case and from healthy adults in Yangon, Myanmar. Among these strains, five were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) derived from pus (four strains, SCCmec III, ST239) and a healthy adult (one strain, SCCmec-IVa, ST5). The Panton-Valentine leukocidine (PVL) gene was detected in five methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) clinical strains belonging to ST121 (CC121). The MRSA clinical strains had only a few or no staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) genes, whereas PVL-positive MSSA and an MRSA strain from a healthy adult possessed an enterotoxin gene cluster (seg, sei, sem, sen, seo, and selu). Strains from the food poisoning case had either SE genes or only etd and edin-B. Adhesin genes, which are associated with binding to fibronectin, fibrinogen, and elastin, were detected in all the MRSA and most of the MSSA strains examined. However, the bone sialoprotein-binding protein gene (bbp) and the variant form of the elastin-binding protein gene (ebpS-v) with an internal 180\u2009bp deletion were identified only in the MSSA strains harboring the PVL gene. These findings suggest that those genetic traits are characteristic of PVL-positive ST121 S. aureus strains in Myanmar.",

        "abstract": "A total of 950 gram-negative bacterial isolates from patients with bacteremia and urinary tract infections were collected from tertiary-care hospitals in Korea. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using broth microdilution test according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute protocol. In general, carbapenems such as doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem were very active against Enterobacteriaceae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter sp. isolates. Doripenem was more potent than imipenem against most Enterobacteriaceae species except Proteus spp. based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(50) and MIC(90). In addition, doripenem displayed similar activity to meropenem but was superior to imipenem against ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates. For P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. isolates, MIC(50)s of doripenem were 1 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively, which were the same with those of meropenem but two- to fourfold lower than those of imipenem (both 2 mg/L). On the basis of the in vitro data, we conclude that doripenem has equivalent or more activity than other carbapenems such as imipenem and meropenem against most gram-negative pathogens from Korea. Thus, doripenem may be a promising new antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative pathogens in Korea.",

It was performed on a group of 40 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates that were randomly selected from all putative ESBL producers of this species recovered in a large hospital in Celje in 1997-2001. At least three different ESBLs, SHV-2, -5, and -12, were produced by the isolates and these enzymes seem to be common in nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae populations in countries of the region (e.g., Italy, Hungary, Croatia). The analysis revealed a complex epidemiology of the organisms, illustrated mostly by their high clonal variety but also by the diversity of their beta-lactamase and plasmid content, mating capability, and antimicrobial susceptibility. Although some cases of a 'fresh' dissemination of strains or plasmids could be identified, the overall situation should be described rather as endemic, and its complexity may be in part attributed to the late introduction of the ESBL detection procedure to the hospital.",

The substrates that provide nutritional support for VRE in the colon are not known. We tested the hypothesis that enzymatic breakdown of complex polysaccharides and glycoconjugates by other members of the indigenous microbiota could provide a source of nutrients for VRE. Nine vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains were unable to ferment complex plant polysaccharides or hog gastric or bovine submaxillary mucin; however, each of the strains was able to ferment monosaccharides that are components of mucins and plant polysaccharides. Preincubation of hog gastric mucin with partially purified enzyme mixtures obtained from supernatants of Ruminococcus torques or a human stool specimen resulted in release of monosaccharides that supported growth of VRE. These results suggest that enzymatic breakdown of complex polysaccharides such as mucin by members of the indigenous microbiota may provide a source of nutritional support for VRE.",

Antibiotic interactions were evaluated using the chequerboard method and the time-kill assay.\\n\\nRESULTS: Considering all antimicrobials in combination with DOR, chequerboard analysis showed synergy in 13 A. baumannii strains (54.2%). Seven strains (29.2%) showed \u22652 synergistic interactions. DOR showed synergy in combination with tigecycline (TIG) (eight strains), colistin (COL) (eight strains), amikacin (AMK) (four strains), ampicillin/sulbactam (two strains), and rifampicin (one strain). Remarkably, synergistic effects were detected only in DOR nonsusceptible strains. Time-kill assays confirmed synergy in eight isolates (giving 10 synergistic interactions) for DOR in combination with TIG (n=4), COL (n=5), and AMK (n=1). No antagonistic interactions were observed with both methods.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the in vitro synergistic activity of DOR in combination with TIG, COL, and AMK against DOR-resistant A. baumannii strains, opening the way to in vivo assessment of novel combination therapies for treatment of infections caused by MDR A. baumannii.",

The epidemiological relationship was evaluated by random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis (RAPD). Transferability of ESBL genes was determined by conjugation experiments. Plasmid analysis was done by replicon typing and PstI fingerprinting. The overall rate of ESBL production was 20%. The most widespread enzyme was CTX-M-3, found in 64%. It was dominant in E. aerogenes (100%) and S. marcescens (83%). SHV-12, CTX-M-3, and CTX-M-15 were found among E. cloacae isolates in 50%, 35%, and 45%, respectively. Three main CTX-M-3-producing epidemic clones of E. aerogenes and S. marcescens have been detected. Among E. cloacae isolates, six different RAPD profiles were discerned. The plasmids harboring blaCTX-M-3 belonged to IncL/M type and demonstrated similar PstI fingerprinting profiles. IncFII plasmids were detected in two CTX-M-15-producing E. cloacae isolates.

The present study was performed on 253 MRSA isolates (146 archival and 107 new isolates) recovered in 26 hospitals between 1990 and 2001. Whereas all isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and the analysis of the ClaI::mecA and ClaI::Tn554 RFLP polymorphism, selected isolates were also subjected to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) comparisons. Based on the PFGE data, 15 MRSA clones were discerned, seven of which were observed in multiple hospitals. Five of these were related to the pandemic Hungarian (MLST clonal complex, CC8), Iberian (CC8), Pediatric (CC5), Mexican (CC30), and Brazilian clones (CC8). MLST confirmed the earlier reports on the similarity of the Hungarian and Brazilian clones, and it revealed that one of the two remaining epidemic clones was related to the Hungarian/Brazilian, and the other--to the Berlin clones. A local strain from the Northeastern part of the country was found to be similar to a minor Greek clone. The MRSA clonal structure and the increasing complexity of the relationships between the genetic and phenotypic traits of this micro-organism in Poland has now been firmly established.",

The presence of acquired \u03b2-lactamases was assessed with combination tablet-diffusion methodology and polymerase chain reaction. In addition, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, an efflux pump inhibitor assay, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were performed. Isolates producing acquired \u03b2-lactamases were further investigated by serotyping and multi locus sequence typing. Eight isolates produced the metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (MBL) VIM-2, and one isolate produced OXA-10 and VEB-1-like extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Phenotypic indications of derepressed AmpC and efflux pump were seen in 56 and 43 isolates, respectively. Overall, the results indicate that mutational factors related to permeability-often combined with derepressed, chromosomal AmpC-is the main factor behind carbapenem nonsusceptibility in Danish P. aeruginosa isolates. The ESBL producer and all the VIM producers belonged to international clones. PFGE revealed that most of the isolates were unrelated, but clonal spread was seen; the 116 isolates distributed in 97 PFGE types, with the largest cluster consisting of 4 isolates (including three isolates from the same hospital with 100% similarity). Thirty-two isolates were pair-wise related, while the remaining isolates were clonally unrelated, as were all nine ESBL/MBL producers.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of 87 third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli (3GC-R Ec) from bloodstream infections in Denmark from 2009. Sixty-eight of the 87 isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, whereas 17 isolates featured AmpC mutations only (without a coexpressed ESBL enzyme) and 2 isolates were producing CMY-22. The majority (82%) of the ESBL-producing isolates in our study were CTX-M-15 producers and primarily belonged to phylogroup B2 (54.4%) or D (23.5%). Further, one of the two CMY-22-producing isolates belonged to B2, whereas only few of the other AmpCs isolates belonged to B2 and D. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that both clonal and nonclonal spread of 3GC-R Ec occurred. ST131 was detected in 50% of ESBL-producing isolates. The remaining ESBL-producing isolates belonged to 17 other sequence types (STs), including several other internationally spreading STs (e.g., ST10, ST69, and ST405). The majority (93%) of the ESBL-producing isolates and one of the CMY-22-producing isolates were multiresistant. In conclusion, 3GC-R in bacteriaemic E. coli in Denmark was mostly due to ESBL production, overexpression of AmpC, and to a lesser extent to plasmid-mediated AmpC. The worldwide disseminated CTX-M-15-ST131 was strongly represented in this collection of Danish, bacteriaemic E. coli isolates.",

Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 95 children (32.1%). Of the isolates, 18 were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (18.9%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for all S. aureus cultured and the molecular characteristics were investigated. Forty-nine spa types were identified among the S. aureus isolates, and were classified into 13 spa groups (A-L). The most prevalent clone (34 isolates, 35.8%) belonged to the spa group B (spa repeat motif, WG/FKAOMQ), which corresponded to sequence type 30 (ST30) and its variants. Sixteen different spa types, within the spa group B, suggested that this group has evolved over a long period of time. In addition, all S. aureus isolates belonging to the spa group B were methicillin-susceptible, indicating that this group might represent successful adaptation of this clone in the community setting with low antibiotic pressure. The most frequently found clone in the MRSA group was spa group C (spa repeat motif, DMGGM) and SCCmec type IVA, which represented half of the MRSA isolates and corresponded to ST72.

In Portuguese hospitals, the incidence of MRSA among disease causing isolates is extremely high (48-50%). To determine the prevalence of MRSA in the Portuguese community, nasal samples were obtained from 823 draftees, 484 nonmedical university students, and 107 high-school students. In addition, throat samples were obtained from the 823 draftees and S. aureus isolates were also recovered from 283 (13%) nasopharyngeal samples obtained from 2,111 children attending day-care centers. The rate of nasal colonization of S. aureus was 34%, 25%, and 46% for draftees, nonmedical university students, and high-school students, respectively. The rate of pharyngeal colonization of the draftees was 33%. Of the 1,001 S. aureus isolates obtained, seven were MRSA and eight were borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA). By molecular typing techniques, five of the seven MRSA were identified as belonging to one of three highly epidemic clones, the Brazilian, Iberian, and Pediatric clones of MRSA, which were identified as endemic in Portuguese hospitals. The eight BORSA were all members of clones previously identified in international samples. In spite of the extremely high prevalence of MRSA in Portuguese hospitals, the carriage rate of MRSA in healthy and young individuals remains low.",

Two ventriculoperitoneal shunts were inserted just after birth and on the second month. On the sixth month, both shunts were removed because of dysfunction, and external drainage was inserted. The child developed fever, and lumbar puncture revealed a high leukocyte count and protein concentration after external drainage. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures yielded E. faecium, which was resistant to ampicillin, erythromycin, gentamicin, penicillin G, vancomycin, and teicoplanin and was susceptible to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, levofloxacin, and rifampin, as determined by the disk diffusion method. As a result of the antimicrobial susceptibility tests, multidrug antibiotic therapy was changed from vancomycin and ceftazidime to chloramphenicol, rifampin, and meropenem. In addition, a rifampin-clindamycin-impregnated shunt (The Codman Hakim Bactiseal, Raynham, MA) was inserted. The patient became afebrile, and CSF cultures were sterile after 15 days of yielding E. faecium. Implantation of the rifampin-clindamycin-impregnated shunt and timely use of appropriate antibiotics for 10 days according to antimicrobial susceptibility testing seem to be important in the resolution of vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections, especially in countries where linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin are not in use yet.",

We also genotyped 202 susceptible strains to compare the genotyping results, as well as the clinical and demographic data. Spacer oligotyping (spoligotyping) analysis was performed for isolates presenting low IS6110 copy number. Patients with identical DNA pattern strains were considered clustered. From 262 isolates, 94 (36%) belonged to 20 distinct RFLP clusters, and after spoligotyping analysis, 89 of the isolates (34%) remained in cluster. MDR isolates did not differ statistically in clustering proportion from susceptible strains. A significant association between the occurrence of MDR and previous tuberculosis (TB) treatment was observed (p < 0.001), as well as failure on TB treatment (p < 0.001). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients were associated with susceptible tuberculosis (p = 0.024). We also identified that unmarried patients were more likely to develop TB due to recent transmission than married patients (p < 0.005). The introduction of directly observed therapy short-course (DOTS) strategy will be important in decreasing default and failure rates and avoiding the development of new MDR strains.",

The aims of this study were to reveal clonal changes in bla(SIM-1)-harboring Acinetobacter isolates collected from 2003 to 2008 in the same Korean hospital, where they were first discovered to gain further insight into the relation between bla(SIM-1)-harboring plasmids and Acinetobacter spp. Among 1,761 nonduplicated imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. isolates, 29 isolates were identified as bla(SIM-1) carriers. They were categorized into nine types according to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis findings. While most bla(SIM-1)-carrying isolates from 2003 to 2005 belonged to A. pittii, those from 2006 to 2007 were mostly isolates of A. nosocomialis. Most of the bla(SIM-1) genes were carried on ca. 280-kb plasmids and were only discovered in non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp. Integrons carrying the bla(SIM-1) gene were identical in structure in all species. These findings suggest that the plasmids were transferable, but not promiscuous. Further surveillance should be continued to detect and control further spread of the bla(SIM-1) gene, as the appearance of the bla(SIM-1) gene in different Acinetobacter spp. in different countries has already begun.",

In Tunisia, recent data showed a high prevalence of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolates in healthy animals, mostly in chickens. In this study, we report the first data on ESBL in diseased Tunisian animals (chickens and cattle), highlighting a major difference in ESBL prevalence in the infectious versus noninfectious E. coli flora. Interestingly, the only ESBL producer was an ST10 E. coli from a cattle, and not from chicken. Moreover, this E. coli isolate harbored the blaCTX-M-15 gene on an F2:A-:B- plasmid, a combination frequently found in humans. This plasmid was also highly similar to a blaCTX-M-15 F2:A-:B- plasmid recently reported in cattle in France. Altogether, this study is also the first report of the blaCTX-M-15 gene in food animals in Tunisia, and, to our best knowledge, the first report of an ESBL producer in cattle in Africa. Since this plasmid was recognized in cattle in France and worldwide in humans, the question of its origin in Tunisian cattle is open. The detection of ESBL producers in milk in Tunisia may also constitute a risk of ESBL transmission from animals to humans through food consumption.",

Thirty-one isolates of A. baumannii recovered from December 21, 2006, to February 18, 2007, were studied. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA genotyping methods were used to define clusters of clonally related isolates. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the results and to check the maintenance of the epidemic strain over the following year. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by microdilution and E-test. The isolates were screened by PCR analysis with primers specific for carbapenemase genes. With the exception of colistin (0%) there were no antibiotics with good activity against these isolates. The epidemiology study revealed that the same strain was responsible for all the infections. This strain appeared to carry the bla(OXA-66) gene. ISAba1 was present upstream the oxacillinase gene. The clone responsible for the outbreak is still present in hospital.",

We assessed the frequency and diversity of CTX-M enzymes among 97 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates as well as to establish the genetic relationship among CTX-M producers collected from six hospitals in Caracas. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays identified the bla(CTX-M) genes in 42 isolates (43.3%). The bla(CTX-M-1) group was the most common in Escherichia coli (91 %) and the bla(CTX-M-2) in Klebsiella pneumoniae (56.6%). Presence of bla(CTX-M-1), bla(CTX-M-2), bla(CTX-M-15), and bla(CTX-M-14) was revealed by sequencing analysis. The CTX-M producers were mainly isolated from urine samples (46%). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that a high proportion of CTX-M-producing isolates was resistant to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Analysis of enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR and repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR profiles revealed several genetic clusters between isolates carrying the bla(CTX-M-1) group, while complete genotypic diversity among isolates carrying the bla(CTX-M-2) group was observed. This study documented that CTX-M has achieved a citywide distribution, with the CTX-M-1 group as the most frequent (66.7%). The CTX-M clusters detected suggest that patient-patient transmission may have played an important role in the widespread and high prevalence of the CTX-M-1 group.

Between January 2007 and December 2009, 15 E. coli isolates were collected at the laboratory of microbiology of Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis. Microbial identification was done with conventional methods. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method and ESBL detection was done with double-disk synergy test. ESBL typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Phylogenetic groups, virulence factors, and sequence type (ST)131 were determined by PCR. Genetic relatedness between strains was examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after restriction with XbaI. The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli in CA-UTI was 0.046%. The majority of isolates were multidrug resistant. ESBL types were CTX-M-15 (n=13) and SHV-12 (n=2). The most common phylogenetic group was B2 (n=11) and virulence score was greater than or equal to 9 in nine strains. PFGE revealed 12 clusters. The majority of isolates (n=14) belonged to ST131 clone and 11 of them were CTX-M producers. In conclusion, this is the first detailed documentation of CA-ESBLs producing E. coli in Tunisia. Of particular concern is the emergence in our community of the highly diffusing CTX-M-15-B2-ST131 E. coli clone, which requires strengthening surveillance measures to countervail this emergent public health problem.",

All carbapenem-resistant strains collected from December 2011 to December 2012 were analyzed. Presence of carbapenemases was assessed with combined disc test and Carba NP test followed by polymerase chain reaction for carbapenemase genes. Altogether, 30 strains were detected, of which 7 were positive for VIM (23.3%), 6 for NDM-1 (20%), 5 for IMP (16.7%), and KPC was present in one isolate (3.3%). Four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were found to produce more than one carbapenemase. We also present the case report of a patient with Acinetobacter baumannii ventilator-associated pneumonia, followed by sepsis due to Enterococcus faecalis and pan-resistant NDM-1-producing P. aeruginosa.

Surfaces were sampled, and each collected sample was re-suspended in phosphate buffer, spread plated, and incubated at 35\u00b0C for 24 hrs; resulting colonies were enumerated. Samples were collected immediately on drying, and at 3\u2009hrs, 24\u2009hrs, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, and 5 days. Results demonstrated that MRSA survived the longest on plastic and vinyl and for the least amount of time on wood (p\u2009<\u20090.001). BSA enabled MRSA to survive for significantly longer duration (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The number of CFU/ml was significantly lesser on surfaces stored in 45%-55% RH versus 16% RH.

Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from 150 (24.5%) patients, and MRSA was isolated from 9 (1.5%). Cancer and previous hospitalization were associated with a significantly higher frequency of nasal S. aureus carriage among the patients admitted to the general hospital and the nephrology department, respectively. MRSA isolates were heterogeneous with respect to their staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element (SCCmec) type, sequence type (ST), and toxin genes (pvl and tst1) content. Four isolates were attributed with the ST80-MRSA-IV clone, which is known to be predominant in Algeria.\\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first assessment of S. aureus and MRSA nasal carriage and associated variables in Algeria. Our findings provide also a picture of the MRSA strains circulating in the community in this geographic area. They can be useful as a guide for implementing screening and control procedures against S. aureus/MRSA in the Algerian healthcare facilities.",

Among 14 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, most had the same pulsotype, virulence profile (agg(+)elrA(+)gelE(+)), and were sequence type (ST)103, indicating dissemination of a clone. The 47 Enterococcus faecium were separated into four pulsotypes, the predominant virulence profile being esp(+)acm(+). All of them harbored the hospital marker IS16, and three randomly chosen isolates were ST412, belonging to the Clonal Complex 17. E. faecalis were all susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin, while all E. faecium were resistant to them. All isolates were susceptible to daptomycin and tigecycline. There were no rep-family genes common to all VRE. The VanA element of all E. faecium lost its left-side inverted repeat (IRL) region and had a specific IS insertion. On the other hand, all E. faecalis presented intact Tn1546. The size of plasmids containing the vanA gene as well as its rep-families varied between and within species. The lack of a vanA plasmid common to all VRE, together with the differences among VanA elements, despite the fact that some patients were colonized by both species during their hospitalization, leads us to suggest at least two different Tn1546 origins.",

        "abstract": "The glycopeptide growth promoter avoparcin was banned from animal production in the EU in 1997 due to concern for the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) from food animals to humans. In recent Norwegian and Danish studies, extensive occurrence of VRE on broiler farms and in broiler flocks after the avoparcin ban has been reported. The present study was undertaken to investigate the epidemiology of VRE on broiler farms in the absence of the selective pressure exerted by avoparcin. Environmental samples were obtained from five broiler houses after depopulation, cleaning, and disinfection of the houses between rotations, and two consecutive broiler flocks from each house were sampled by taking cloacal swabs from the broilers at the time of slaughter. A total of 69 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates obtained from broiler flocks and broiler houses were subjected to molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Forty-one PFGE-profiles were observed. VRE with indistinguishable or highly similar PFGE profiles were isolated from consecutive broiler flocks and from environmental samples from the houses in which the flocks were reared, whereas VRE-isolates from different broiler houses and from flocks reared in different houses appeared to be genetically unrelated. These findings indicated that VRE was transmitted between consecutive broiler flocks by clones of resistant bacteria surviving in the broiler houses despite cleaning and disinfection between rotations. Thus, the extensive occurrence of VRE in broiler flocks after the avoparcin ban may be explained by persistence of VRE in the broiler house environment.",

Of the 668 isolates, the 80 strains were presumptively defined as ESBL producers according to the result of disk method using ESBL marker antibiotics (aztreonam, ceftazidime, and cefoxitin). These 80 strains were retested with the double-disk synergy test (DDST), the E-test ESBL strip, a 5-microg ceftazidime disk, and agar dilution MICs of ceftazidime with and without clavulonic acid. Isoelectric focusing was performed to confirm ESBL production and type the beta-lactamases. By evaluation of the results of all tests used for ESBL detection together with isoelectric focusing, 33 (4.9%) of the 668 isolates were described as ESBL producer. The positive results of the agar dilution test, DDST, the E-test strip, and 5-microg ceftazidime disk were 32, 26, 27, and 26 of the 33 strains, respectively. ESBL positivity was 48.8% in Klebsiella species, 15.4% in Citrobacter species, 4.9% in Enterobacter species and 1.1% in Escherichia coli strains. The ESBL enzymes frequently determined were SHV-2/6-like (pI 7.6), SHV-5-like (pI 8.2), SHV-4-like (pI 7.8), and SHV-3-like (pI 7). SHV-derived enzymes were commonly observed in Klebsiella spp whereas TEM-related enzymes were seen in E. coli strains. The results of this study indicated that SHV-2/6-derived (pI 7.6) ESBL expression among the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae is an important problem in our medical center.",

The sulfa drugs condense with 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8 dihydropteridine pyrophosphate (DHPPP) forming sulfa-dihydropteroate (sulfa-DHP). Here evidence is presented using yeast that such dihydropteroate (DHP) analogs are inhibitory through competition with DHF. Two folate synthesis mutants, with respective dihydrofolate synthase (DHFS) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) deletions and requiring DHF for growth were exposed to sulfa drugs. The DHFS knockout mutant was inhibited, but the DHPS knockout mutant that was incapable of forming sulfa-DHP was insensitive. Such sulfa-DHP compounds were chemically synthesized and shown to be inhibitory in vivo by competing with DHF, but in vitro assays with double the concentration of the sulfa-DHP to DHF showed no inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Sequence analysis of resistant mutants obtained in the presence of sulfa drugs showed no changes in DHFR, or DHPS, unlike previously found antifolate-resistant mutants. The diamino derivatives, which are precursors of the sulfa-DHP, were found to be DHFR inhibitors. These results suggest that a new class of drugs, based on DHP analogs, could be investigated.",

MRSA strains were genotyped by inter-IS256 spacer length polymorphism PCR and SmaI macrorestriction analysis. MICs of 18 antimicrobials were determined by the agar dilution method. MRSA strains from the 1997-1998 survey were further tested by vancomycin screen agar, E-test, broth microdilution methods, and population analysis. Between 1995 and 1997-1998, epidemic group A strains decreased in proportion from 73% to 44%, whereas MRSA Group B and C strains increased from 17% to 38% and from 5% to 8%. The proportion of strains susceptible to gentamicin increased between the surveys from 22% to 48%. This was associated with a higher proportion of group B and C strains in the last survey. Heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hetero-VISA) strains were found in 2% isolates from 1997 to 1998. These hetero-VISA isolates were genotypically related to the MRSA group A strains and were resistant to gentamicin. In conclusion, two emerging epidemic MRSA genotypes, susceptible to gentamicin, have spread among Belgian hospitals during the 1990s. Hetero-VISA were present at low frequency among MRSA strains belonging to a widespread endemic genotype.",

Strains were selected from a previous study based on the presence of streptogramin susceptibility and/or vanA, vanB, vatD, vatE, agg, cpd, and gelE genes. Transconjugants were isolated on brain heart infusion agar containing vancomycin and selective antibiotics. Thirty-nine matings using a 1:10 donor-recipient ratio for filter and broth methods resulted in transfer of vanA between an agg(+)cpd(+)gelE(+) Enterococcus faecalis donor and an agg(-)cpd(-)gelE(-) streptogramin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium salad recipient at a frequency of 10(-8) per recipient by filter method. Secondary mating of the transconjugant with SR/VSE strains resulted in a two- to four-log-fold greater frequency of transfer. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed vanA RNA products in the transconjugant cultivated in nutrient broth and salad at 37\u00b0C in the presence and absence of recipient filtrate. This study demonstrated that native salad VSE disseminated vanA to SRE carrying agg, cpd, and/or gelE. An increase in transfer efficiency resulted from secondary conjugation using the native vancomycin- and streptogramin-susceptible salad strain as the donor.",

Isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. We investigated the structure of the vanA gene cluster and the distribution of the virulence markers esp, hyl, gelE, asa1, and cylA by polymerase chain reaction. Our results indicate that multilocus sequence typing revealed five novel sequence types and one new allele. VRE faecium (VREfm) isolates were heterogeneous in their vanA cluster types and in the presence of virulence genes. We also observed inconsistency between genotype and phenotype in VREfm isolates. The outbreak with VREfm in our hospital appears polyclonal, whereas VRE faecalis characterization indicated dissemination of a particular clone. After 2007, VRE faecalis was completely replaced by VREfm, which has since been the predominant species in our hospital. VRE appears to be in an evolutionary flux in our hospital.",

The aim of the current study was to detect and characterize the genes encoding the ESBLs including blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX-M groups by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis was used to determine the genetic relatedness between isolates. All strains were susceptible to carbapenems. They were resistant to fluoroquinolones, gentamicin, tobramycin, and trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole but variably resistant to netilmicin, amikacin, and tetracyclines. Sequence analysis of the polymerase chain reaction products revealed the presence of blaCTX-M-15 (39 strains), blaSHV-12 (6 strains), and blaSHV-27 (1 strain). The coexistence of two ESBLs was observed in two isolates harboring, respectively, SHV-12+CTX-M-15 and SHV-27+CTX-M-15. PFGE revealed 36 unrelated profiles. Diffusion of E. cloacae producing CTX-M-15 ESBL in our hospital is the consequence of dissemination of identical or related plasmids harboring the CTX-M-15 gene.",

The conserved segment-PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism-PCR analysis, and DNA sequencing were used to determine the presence and cassette content of integrons. The genetic relatedness among the isolates was examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The rate of integron carriage for MDR Salmonella isolates was 91.4% and integron-positive isolates belonged to six distinct serovars. Out of 64 integron-positive isolates, only four Salmonella Paratyphi C isolates could transfer integrons to Escherichia coli K12 by conjugation. Thirty-three PFGE types were detected in 52 integron-positive isolates, including 22, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 1 patterns among Salmonella serovars Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Paratyphi C, Paratyphi B, Paratyphi A, and Havana, respectively. The human and poultry Salmonella Enteritidis isolates from different regions with identical integrons had closely related PFGE patterns. Of the four integron-positive Salmonella Typhimurium isolates, the two poultry isolates with identical integron had very closely related PFGE patterns whereas the two human isolates with different integrons showed unrelated PFGE patterns. PFGE showed undistinguishable patterns in Salmonella Paratyphi C isolates with identical cassettes but revealed relatively unrelated patterns in those with different cassettes. Relatively unrelated and identical PFGE patterns were found in two Salmonella Paratyphi B and three Salmonella Paratyphi A isolates with the same integrons, respectively. In conclusion, PFGE patterns demonstrated more genetic relatedness among each Salmonella serovar with identical class 1 integrons than the same serovar with different class 1 integrons.",

During 4 months in 2004, a total of 650 Enterobacteriaceae strains from UTIs was collected by five clinical microbiology laboratories located in southern Italy and the beta-lactamase production was investigated. A total of 50 of the 650 isolates were double-disk positive and suspected of producing an ESbetaL; Escherichia coli (36.0%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (32.0%) were the most common species among all ESbetaL producers. Characterization of ESbetaL determinants was carried out by the colony blot hybridization method, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing in order to identify the presence of bla (TEM), bla (SHV), bla (PER), and bla (CTX-M) determinants. The ESbetaL variants found in this study were the following: TEM-15, TEM-24, TEM-52, TEM-134, SHV-12, CTX-M-1, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-15, and PER-1. As expected, the majority of the isolates were found to be susceptible to imipenem (94%), cefepime (54%) and piperacillin-tazobactam (54%). The results of this survey show the prevalence of ESbetaL enzymes among enterobacterial pathogens causing UTIs in southern Italy.",

Enterobacteriaceae isolates from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2000-2004) demonstrating decreased susceptibility to imipenem and meropenem (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], > or =2 mg/L) were evaluated for the production of metallo-beta-lactamases and serine carbapenemases using disk approximation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Carbapenemase-producing strains were epidemiologically typed by automated riboprinting and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to establish clonality. Among 37,557 Enterobacteriaceae (5 genus groups) evaluated, 119 (0.32%) had increased carbapenem MIC values, and a carbapenemase was identified in 51 (42.9%) of these strains. KPC-2 and KPC-3 were the most frequently occurring carbapenemases (24 isolates, 20.2%) in the United States and were detected in Klebsiella spp, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., and Serratia marcescens strains isolated in New York, Arkansas, and Virginia. SME-2-producing S. marcescens were isolated in the New York City area, Texas, and Ohio, while NMC-A was found in one E. cloacae strain from New York. In contrast, metallo-beta-lactamases were prevalent in Europe. IMP-1-producing E. cloacae (11 isolates) were detected in Turkey, while VIM-1-producing strains were found in Italy (Enterobacter spp.) and Greece (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Clonal dissemination of carbapenemase-producing strains was observed in several medical centers on both continents. The occurrence of carbapenemases in various Enterobacteriaceae remains rare but appears to be spreading geographically (not in Latin America), mainly with metallo-beta-lactamases being found in Mediterranean Europe and KPC enzymes in the New York City area.",

Six oligonucleotides, including outer, inner, and loop primers, were designed for eight distinct regions in each target gene. Two qualitative criteria were used to evaluate LAMP reactions: visual inspection of color change and real-time detection of fluorescence change. The lower detection limit was 10 colony forming units (CFU) per reaction for real-time detection and 100 CFU per reaction for visual inspection for each gene. Two hundred twenty-two carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates (including 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 100 Acinetobacter sp., and 22 Enterobacteriaceae) were tested by LAMP assay. At the same time, these isolates were confirmed by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis. In these clinical isolates, the results of 11 strains with blaNDM, 11 strains with blaKPC, 11 strains with blaVIM, and 2 strains with blaIMP obtained using LAMP assays were concordant with conventional PCR.

        "abstract": "Otitis, pneumonia, and meningitis are tissue-based pneumococcal infections that can be associated with biofilms. The emergence of phenotypic rough variants, also known as acapsular small-colony variants, is essential for pneumococcal biofilm formation. These rough variants can increase nearly 100-fold in biofilms over time and can arise through single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), deletions, or tandem duplications in the first gene of the capsular operon, cps3D. We detected a 100-fold increase in rifampin-resistant (Rif(r)) mutants in biofilms compared to planktonic cultures using a nonvaccine serotype 3 strain, which is causing an increasing number of cases of otitis in the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era. Since both rough variants and Rif(r) strains can arise through SNPs, they could emerge due to alteration of the mismatch repair (MMR) system. The Hex system, a pneumococcal MMR system, repairs mismatches during replication and transformation. In this study, no mutations were detected in the hexAB gene sequences among several rough variants with unique mutations in the cps3D gene. Within a hexA null mutant grown in broth, we detected only a 17.5-fold increase in rough variants compared to the wild-type parental strain. Taken together, these data suggest that mutations in the hex genes and modulation of hexA activity are unlikely to account for the generation of biofilm-derived rough variants.",

Risk factors were assessed by conducting a case-double control study in which cases were compared with (1) control patients with community-onset bacteremia due to non-ESBLEC, and (2) those with community-onset bacteremia not caused by E. coli. Clinical outcome was assessed among patients with community-onset E. coli bacteremia. Community-onset bacteremia due to ESBLEC accounted for 6.7% of all community-onset E. coli bacteremia. In addition, an increasing proportion of ESBLEC among patients without any healthcare risk factors was observed. Comparison with both control groups revealed that the recent use of antibiotics (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-12.3) was an independent risk factor for ESBL acquisition. Factors influencing the 30-day mortality were a high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0) and severe sepsis or septic shock (OR, 26.6; 95% CI, 1.5-470.7) and malignancy (OR, 11.9; 95% CI, 1.1-134.8). Increased mortality was not statistically associated either with ESBL production or with inappropriate empirical therapy. ESBLEC has emerged as a significant cause of community-onset bacteremia in this hospital, suggesting that ESBLEC are widely disseminated in the South Korean community.",

Despite appropriate therapy with antichlamydial antibiotics, chronic exacerbated diseases often occur and lead to serious sequelae. The use of the macrolide clarithromycin and the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin has improved the treatment of chlamydial infection, but therapy failure is still a major problem. In this work, we studied the pretreatment with natural polyphenols and subsequent treatment with clarithromycin or ofloxacin. The phenolic compounds resveratrol and quercetin improved the antichlamydial effect of clarithromycin and ofloxacin. In particular, resveratrol at 40\u2009\u03bcM and quercetin at 20\u2009\u03bcM exhibited significant growth inhibition on C. pneumoniae in presence of clarithromycin or ofloxacin compared to controls. In addition, we demonstrated that both resveratrol and quercetin decreased IL-17 and IL-23 production in a time-dependent manner in C. pneumoniae-infected cells. The results showed a particularly strong inhibition of the IL-23 levels released with combined treatment of resveratrol or quercetin and ofloxacin or clarithromycin, suggesting that the combined treatment may afford a synergistic effect in controlling Chlamydia infections.",

Members of the LytR-Cps2A-Psr (LCP) protein family have recently been implicated in the attachment of anionic polymers to peptidoglycan in Gram-positive bacteria, based on genetic evidence from Bacillus subtilis mutant strains and on the crystal structure of S. pneumoniae Cps2A containing a tightly bound polyprenol (pyro)phosphate lipid. Here, we provide evidence that Cps2A and its two pneumococcal homologs, LytR and Psr, contribute to the maintenance of normal capsule levels and to the retention of the capsular polysaccharide at the cell wall in the capsular type 2 S. pneumoniae strain D39. GFP fusions of all three LCP proteins showed enhanced localization at mid-cell, indicating a role in cell wall growth. Single cps2A or psr mutants produced a reduced amount of capsule. A cps2A lytR double mutant showed greatly impaired growth and cell morphology and lost approximately half of the total capsule material into the culture supernatant. We also present the crystal structure of the B. subtilis LCP protein YwtF and provide crystallographic evidence for the phosphotransferase activity of Cps2A, supporting an enzymatic function in the attachment of capsular polysaccharides to cell wall peptidoglycan.",

        "abstract": "Infections caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa are difficult to treat. Antibiotic development is dwindling in recent years. In order to develop new alternate therapies antimicrobial activity of different antibiotic combinations are being studied in vitro and in vivo. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of colistin were tested in combination with ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin by the checkerboard method against 25 MDR strains of P. aeruginosa. Synergy was observed for ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin antibiotic combinations with colistin among 73.3% of MDR3 (R(AMK, GEN, TOB) R(CAZ) R(CIP)) strains and 100% of MDR4 (R(AMK, GEN, TOB) R(CAZ) R(CIP) R(TZP)) strains. 6.6% strains of MDR3 and 14.3% strains of MDR5 (R(AMK, GEN, TOB) R(CAZ) R(CIP) R(TZP) R(IPM)) phenotypes were inhibited by colistin and ceftazidime alone and 6.6% strains of MDR3 phenotypes were inhibited by colistin and ciprofloxacin alone. For the remaining strains, though synergy was not observed, significant reduction in minimum inhibitory concentration was evident. The results of this study are significant as sub-inhibitory concentrations of colistin have an advantage of reducing in vivo toxicity. These findings need further evaluation for clinical use.",

The typing scheme (Homan et al., 2002, J. Clin. Microb., 40:1963-1971) based on seven housekeeping genes--adk (adenylate kinase), atpA (ATP synthase, alpha subunit), ddl (D-alanine-D-alanine ligase), gyd (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), gdh (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), purK (phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase ATPase subunit), and pstS (phosphate ATP-binding cassette transporter)--was used. In the 14 VREF analyzed, the number of unique alleles ranged from 1 (gyd) to 8 (atpA). Isolates from hospitalized patients were defined by the unique allele purK 1. Nine sequence types (STs) were identified. All of the epidemic strains isolated over the period 2000-2001 showed identical or closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns and clustered in the same ST78. These strains shared six of the seven alleles with the strain CA20 representative of the 1993-1999 outbreaks, which PFGE indicated as being unrelated to those of the recent outbreaks. MLST confirmed the unrelatedness of human and nonhuman strains already detected by PFGE. All isolates clustered in three main genetic lineages: group A comprised two of the three isolates from meat; group C the human strains of all outbreaks and one poultry strain; and group B four of the five poultry strains and one meat strain. All human strains carried the esp gene and clustered in the C1 sublineage that has been described as having emerged recently worldwide.",

BORSA was isolated in 37 samples from 11 patients. The isolates were typed by antibiogram, phage type, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and spa genotyping that confirmed that they were indistinguishable from one another. In May, 2000, an intervention was initiated focusing on infection control. In-patients with BORSA were discharged and antibiotic treatment was stopped, if possible. Emphasis was put on disinfection of shared utensils and individualization of previously shared creams and lotions. After the intervention, BORSA was isolated from another 3 patients before the outbreak was terminated. A case-control study was undertaken to identify possible risk factors for being a BORSA patient. Compared to the controls, the patients with BORSA had more severe skin disease, were more often hospitalized, and had more bed days.",

Sixty-five ESBL producing K. pneumoniae isolates, collected between 2005 and 2007, were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Identification of bla genes was achieved by sequencing. Genotyping of ESBL producing K. pneumoniae was performed by the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR with cluster analysis by the Dice coefficient. The presence of genes encoding ESBLs was confirmed in 59/65 (90.8%) isolates, comprising 20 bla(CTX-M-2), 14 bla(CTX-M-59), 12 bla(CTX-M-15), 9 bla(SHV-12), 1 bla(SHV-2), 1 bla(SHV-2a), 1 bla(SHV-5), and 1 bla(SHV-31) genes. The ESBL genes bla(SHV-12), bla(SHV-31), and bla(CTX-M-15), and the chromosome-encoded SHV-type beta-lactamase capable of hydrolyzing imipenem were detected in Brazil for the first time. The analysis of the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR band patterns revealed a high rate of multiclonal bla(CTX-M) carrying K. pneumoniae isolates (70.8%), suggesting that dissemination of encoding plasmids is likely to be the major cause of the high prevalence of these genes among the K. pneumoniae isolates considered in this study.",

Patients consecutively admitted to the ICU from April 2007 to April 2008 were screened for colonization and infection. Species were identified by rpoB sequencing. The presence of acquired and intrinsic carbapenemase genes was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Strains were typed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) using the schemes hosted at the University of Oxford (UO) and Institut Pasteur (IP). Of 234 patients, 98 (42%) had at least one specimen positive for the Acinetobacter isolate, and 24 (10%) had infection. A total of 22 (92%) infections were caused by Acinetobacter baumannii and one each (4%) by Acinetobacter nosocomialis and Acinetobacter berezinae. A. baumannii isolates from 60 patients belonged to RAPD types that corresponded to MLST clonal complexes (CCs) 109/1 (UO/IP scheme, known as International Clone I), CC 110/110 (UO/IP), CC 113/79 (UO/IP), and CC 104/15 (UO/IP). Most CCs were carbapenem resistant and carried the blaOXA-23-like gene. Strains were introduced by patients transferred from other wards of the same hospital (11 patients, 18%) or acquired from cross-transmission within the ICU (49 patients, 82%). A. nosocomialis lineage sequence type 260 colonized 10% of the whole study population. A. baumannii have become established in this hospital as a part of a global epidemic of successful clones. Once introduced into the hospital, such clones have become entrenched among patients in the ICU.",

Forty-one blood isolates of K. pneumoniae with MIC to IMP ranging from < or =0.5 to > or =16 microg/ml were examined. The MICs were determined by VITEK-2 (bioMerieux Vitek two, France). Disks of 10 microg IMP with and without the addition of 0.5 M EDTA were used for the IMP/IMP+EDTA disk method. The E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) for MBL detection was also used. All isolates were examined for the bla (VIM-1) gene by PCR and for clonality of VIM-1-producing isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). All isolates with MIC values of IMP < or =0.5 microg/ml exhibited no differences in inhibition zone diameters (IZD) produced by IMP and IMP+EDTA disks, whereas the isolates with MICs > or =1 microg/ml showed an increase in IZD, ranging from 8 to 26 mm. All isolates with MIC values of > or =1 microg/ml were found positive for the bla (VIM-1) gene by PCR and for MBL production by the E-test, whereas none of isolates with MICs <0.5 microg/ml was found positive by any of the tests. DNA restriction fragments generated by PFGE of VIM-1-producing isolates were classified in four main types. The IMP/IMP+EDTA disk method is simple to perform, sensitive, and specific for detection of MBL-producing K. pneumoniae clinical isolates.

The biochemistry of this macromolecule has been well characterized throughout the years but recent discoveries have unveiled its chemical plasticity under environmental stresses. Non-canonical D-amino acids (NCDAA) are produced and released to the extracellular media by diverse bacteria. Such molecules govern cell wall adaptation to challenging environments through their incorporation into the polymer, a widespread capability among bacteria that reveals the inherent catalytic plasticity of the enzymes involved in the cell wall metabolism. Here, we analyze the recent structural and biochemical characterization of Bsr, a new family of broad spectrum racemases able to generate a wide range of NCDAA. We also discuss the necessity of a coordinated action of PG multispecific enzymes to generate adequate levels of modification in the murein sacculus. Finally, we also highlight how this catalytic plasticity of NCDAA-incorporating enzymes has allowed the development of new revolutionary methodologies for the study of PG modes of growth and in vivo dynamics.",

Our results indicate that in Saudi Arabia, OXA-48 and NDM-1 are the dominant carbapenemases among Enterobacteriaceae with low prevalence of VIM. The latter is the most prevalent metallo-beta-lactamase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas oxacillinases, OXA-23 in particular, are the dominant carbapenemases in Acinetobacter baumannii.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Higher prevalence of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli fecal carriage has been reported in the nosocomial setting than in the community. We tried to determine the fecal carriage of ESBL-producing E. coli among healthy volunteers in a relatively isolated community.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 115 healthy adult volunteers from whom one fecal sample was collected and was plated on selective media. Each morphotypes were identified, characterized, and ESBL phenotype was confirmed by double-disk potentiation method. Molecular characterization of ESBL gene was done using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was done to identify their clonal relation.\\n\\nRESULTS: ESBL-producing E. coli had a prevalence of 19% (22/115) among the healthy volunteers in the community. CTX-M was the predominant type, showed a presence 95.5% (21/22), TEM 63%, SHV 9%, and both TEM and CTX-M were present in 63.6% (14/22), all three present in 4.5% (1/22). The lineage using PFGE showed a single clone in 17 isolates. Seven isolates were type A (all TEM & CTX-M), six were type A1 (all TEM & CTX-M except 2), four were type A2 (all CTX-M), and three belonged to types B, C, and D respectively Conclusion: High prevalence rate of 19% in the community indicated by this study implies the possibility of sustained ESBL carriage even among isolated population, which could serve as a reservoir for enriching the ESBL pool in the hospital. Clonal relations also indicate a possible epidemiological source that needs to be evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are conserved from insects to mammals and function in antibacterial immunity. We have revealed a novel mechanism of bacterial killing by innate immune system, in which mammalian PGRPs bind to bacterial cell wall or outer membrane and exploit bacterial stress defense response to kill bacteria. PGRPs enter Gram-positive cell wall at the site of daughter cell separation during cell division. In Bacillus subtilis PGRPs activate the CssR-CssS two-component system that detects and disposes of misfolded proteins exported out of bacterial cells. This activation results in membrane depolarization, production of hydroxyl radicals, and cessation of intracellular peptidoglycan, protein, RNA, and DNA synthesis, which are responsible for bacterial death. PGRPs also bind to the outer membrane in Escherichia coli and activate functionally homologous CpxA-CpxR two-component system, which also results in bacterial death. We excluded other potential bactericidal mechanisms, such as inhibition of extracellular peptidoglycan synthesis, hydrolysis of peptidoglycan, and membrane permeabilization. In vivo, mammalian PGRPs are expressed in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, skin, salivary glands, oral cavity, intestinal tract, eyes, and liver. They control acquisition and maintenance of beneficial normal gut microflora, which protects the host from enhanced inflammation, tissue damage, and colitis.",

PBP2x localizes to the division site, a process that depends on its Penicillin-Binding Protein And Serine-Threonine-kinase Associated (PASTA) domains, which was previously demonstrated via GFP-PBP2x in living cells. During this study a mutant strain was isolated in which the GFP-PBP2x fusion protein did not localize at division sites and it contained reduced amounts of the full-length GFP-PBP2x. We now show that this defect is due to a point mutation within the C-terminal PASTA2 domain of PBP2x. The mutant protein was analyzed in detail in terms of beta-lactam binding, functionality, and localization in live cells. We demonstrate that the mutation affects the GFP-tagged PBP2x variant severely and renders it susceptible to the protease/chaperone HtrA.",

Clinical characteristics, prognosis, and antibiotic susceptibilities were reviewed and compared between febrile neutropenic children with bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing and non-ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae. A total of 61 episodes of E. coli and K. pneumoniae bacteremia, including 21 episodes (34.4%) due to ESBL-producing strains, were diagnosed. There was no significant factor associated with bacteremia by ESBL-producing strains. Empirical antibiotics were appropriate in 85.7% of the ESBL group and 95.0% of the non-ESBL group. In the entire study population, seven deaths (11.5%), including three deaths (4.9%) due to E. coli and K. pneumoniae bacteremia, occurred. The complication and mortality rates were not significantly different between the two groups. Antibiotic susceptibility rates were significantly lower in the ESBL group than in the non-ESBL group in most antibiotics. Although 52.4% and 66.7% of the ESBL-producing isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam and cefepime, respectively, 96.7% of all the isolates and 90.5% of the ESBL-producing isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam or cefepime in combination with aminoglycoside. In conclusion, the ESBL group did not show a significantly unfavorable outcome, and empirical therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam or cefepime in combination with aminoglycoside might be more useful for febrile neutropenic children, instead of \u03b2-lactam monotherapy in institutions with high prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae.",

        "abstract": "We used multilocus sequencing typing (MLST) to determine the genetic backgrounds  of 185 recent penicillin susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates with serotypes that most frequently cause invasive disease in preschool age children in five Latin American countries-Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay. Most of the isolates were associated with pneumonia (90/185), meningitis (74/185), and bacteremia (17/185). The collection of strains included seven serotypes-14, 6B, 5, 1, 23 F-which represent the serotypes of S. pneumoniae most frequently associated with sterile site infections in children. Also included were strains expressing serotypes 7F and 3. Comparison of serotype and multilocus sequence type allowed division of the isolates into two groups: strains expressing serotypes 1, 5, 3, and 7 were represented by a relatively few sequence types while strains expressing serotypes 6B, 14, and 23 F showed great genetic diversity. The genetic diversity of serotypes 14, 6B, and 23 F may be related to the capacity of these serotypes to colonize the nasopharynx of healthy carriers during which opportunities for diversification through genetic exchanges can occur. The findings present an interesting contrast with the results of an earlier study in which over 80% of invasive penicillin- resistant serotype 14 and 23 isolates from the same countries were found to belong to as few as two pandemic clones of S. pneumoniae.",

The percentage of resistant strains for ERFX, DNFX, NFLX, and OFLX were 24.4%, 23.6%, 22.8%, and 23.6%, respectively. Scattergrams of the MICs of ERFX compared to DNFX, NFLX, and OFLX for 127 strains demonstrate a clear correlation between the MIC of ERFX and that of other fluoroquinolones. The differences in amino acid substitution in GyrA may play a role in the variation of MIC values for fluoroquinolones. The ratios of peak serum concentration to MIC (C(max):MIC) and ratios of area under the curve to MIC (AUC:MIC) were relatively high in ERFX and OFLX compared to other fluoroquinolones. These results indicate that although the in vitro activities of these fluoroquinolones against APEC isolates are slightly different, the PK/PD values vary with PK parameters. Therefore, we need to consider the PK/PD parameters in the choice of fluoroquinolones during treatment of avian colibacillosis.",

Our objective was to investigate the prevalence, phenotypic and molecular features of hVISA strains isolated from bacteremic patients and to determine the clinical significance of the hVISA phenotype in patients with bacteremia. A total of 104 S. aureus blood isolates were collected from a teaching hospital of Argentina between August 2009 and November 2010. No VISA isolate was recovered, and 3 out of 92 patients (3.3%) were infected with hVISA, 2 of them methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (4.5% of MRSA). Macro Etest and prediffusion method detected 3/3 and 2/3 hVISA respectively. Considering the type of bacteremia, the three cases were distributed as follows: two patients had suffered multiple episodes of bacteremia (both hVISA strains recovered in the second episode), while only one patient had suffered a single episode of bacteremia with hVISA infection. MRSA bloodstream isolates exhibiting the hVISA phenotype were related to HA-MRSA Cordobes clone (ST5-SCCmec I-spa t149) and MRSA Argentinean pediatric clone (ST100-SCCmec IVNV-spa t002), but not to CA-MRSA-ST30-SCCmec IV-spa t019 clone that was one of the most frequent in our country. Although still relatively infrequent in our hospital, hVISA strains were significantly associated with multiple episodes of bacteremia (p=0.037) and genetically unrelated.",

        "abstract": "After noting a rise in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections, we initiated a program to decrease inappropriate vancomycin use that focused on improvement of house staff prescribing practices. The initial intervention in June, 1995, encouraging house staff to follow hospital guidelines for vancomycin use and eliciting support from service chiefs in this effort, had little impact. A more intensive educational intervention, beginning in January, 1996, involved concurrent review of all vancomycin orders and one-on-one discussion with the house staff regarding the rationale for the order by an infectious diseases clinical pharmacist. When usage was deemed inappropriate, the pharmacist asked that vancomycin be discontinued, but no automatic stop orders were issued. During the next two and one-half years, this second intervention proved effective at decreasing inappropriate use from 39% to 16.8% +/- 2.4% (p = 0.005). This change was primarily due to a decrease in appropriate vancomycin prophylaxis by cardiothoracic surgery. VRE infections decreased from 0.29/100 patients discharged prior to initiating the program to 0.13/100 patients discharged after the second intervention (p = 0.01). This educational program, although labor-intensive, preserved house staff decision-making skills related to antibiotic prescribing at the same time that it decreased inappropriate vancomycin use.",

Consumption of glycopeptides for systemic use (defined daily doses per 1,000 patient-days: DDD/1,000 PD and per 100 admissions), number of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (percentage and incidence per 1,000 patient-days), and number of venous central lines and hospital characteristics (size, length of stay, number of beds: total and for each hospital inpatient areas and antibiotic policies) were recorded from January, 2002, through December, 2002. Multiple linear regression was performed to check for hospital characteristics. The median rate of total consumption of glycopeptides was 4.11(range 0.21-27.22) DDD per 1,000 PD with higher consumption in large public hospitals and in intensive care areas (median 46.51; range 7.19-134) than in surgery areas (median 4.5; range 0.17-24.76). The consumption of glycopeptides correlated with MRSA incidence, but not with the proportion of MRSA. In the multivariate analysis, the incidence of MRSA and the number of beds in surgery areas were independent predictors of total glycopeptides use in the hospital, expressed in DDD per 1,000 PD (R2 adjusted, 0.39). The incidence of MRSA, the number of venous central lines, and the number of beds in the medicine areas were significant determinants associated with higher consumption of glycopeptides expressed in DDD per 100 admissions (R2 adjusted, 0.73). To reduce glycopeptides use in hospitals, the first effort required is that hospitals focus increased attention on the prevention of cross transmission for MRSA between patients but also on the use of the venous central line. Furthermore, hospitals have to compare their data with others to identify overuse of glycopeptides and to plan control interventions.",

Recently, however, a few clinical strains of E. cloacae with decreased susceptibility to tigecycline were isolated. In this study, two tigecycline-susceptible mutants of E. cloacae, GC7696 and GC7697, were obtained by transposon mutagenesis of a tigecycline-resistant clinical isolate G946. Transposon insertions were mapped to either the acrA or acrB genes. Restoration of the original resistant phenotype occurred when GC7696 and GC7697 were transcomplemented with a plasmid harboring the intact acrAB region amplified from G946. Northern blot analysis of G946 and several other E. cloacae clinical strains that exhibited decreased susceptibility to tigecycline, revealed increased levels of the acrAB transcript. In addition, overexpression of acrAB correlated with increased expression of the ramA gene, whereas the expression of another transcriptional activator, marA, was not changed. These results suggest that decreased susceptibility to tigecycline in E. cloacae is the result of RamA-mediated overexpression of the AcrAB efflux pump.",

        "abstract": "The presence of bacterial biofilm, particularly formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been considered an important factor responsible for wound chronicity. The objective of this study was to investigate the antibiofilm activity of water and ethanol extracts obtained from three traditional herbal recipes (THR-SK004, THR-SK010, and THR-SK011) on biofilm formation and on mature biofilm of a reference strain of P. aeruginosa. The effects of the extracts on the biofilm mass were evaluated by using crystal violet (CV) assay. The respiratory activity of preformed biofilm of P. aeruginosa after treatment with the extract was determined by MTT reduction assay. Scanning electron microscopy was used to furnish images of biofilm reduction after the recipe treatment. Tested ethanol extracts displayed antibiofilm activity, but the water extracts exhibited low biofilm inhibition activity at the tested concentrations. Remarkable reduction in biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa was found after treatment with the THR-SK010 ethanol extract (THR-SK010E). Treatments with this extract resulted in prevention of biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa on both polystyrene and glass surfaces. Almost 50% reduction in the bacterial metabolic activity in the preformed biofilm was seen after exposure to the extract-supplemented buffer for 12\u2009hr. After a 24-hr treatment with THR-SK010E at 62.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml, 97.3% of the preformed biofilms were destroyed. Promising antibiofilm activity was displayed by the THR-SK010 ethanol extract, suggesting further investigation to explore the possible utilization of the herbal recipe as an antibiofilm agent, especially for wound treatment.",

METHODS: Patients were screened for carriage of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and PMBL-E were characterized (extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase [ESBL], plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase [pAmpC], and carbapenemases) by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: The prevalence of ESBL and pAmpC carriers was 5.06% and 0.59%, respectively. Overall, CTX-M-like enzymes were the ESBL dominate enzymes (96.15%). The group CTX-M-9 was the most prevalent (81, 54%) [CTX-M-14 (74, 91.35%), CTX-M-9 (5, 6.17%), CTX-M-24 (1, 1.23%), and CTX-M-27 (1, 1.23%)] followed by the group CTX-M-1 (64, 42.67%) [CTX-M-15 (42, 65.63%), CTX-M-1 (13, 20.31%), CTX-M-32 (8, 12.5%), and CTX-M-3 (1, 1.56%)]. One CTX-M-10, one CTX-M-59, and three CTX-M-8 were also found. A very small representation of SHV or TEM ESBL enzymes was found (3.2% and 0.64%, respectively). pAmpC characterization revealed a predominance of CMY-2 (81.25%), followed by DHA-1 (18.75%). We did not detect the presence of carbapenemase producers. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ESBL-producers from fecal carriers is stable in our area, but colonization by pAmpC producers has emerged recently as we have confirmed. Periodic active surveillance is useful to identify these human reservoirs and control the evolution of PMBL carriage in a community over time.",

Three point-prevalence surveys per year were carried out. A case-control approach was used to identify potential risk factors associated with MRSA carriage among patients. Incidence rates and risk factors of MRSA carriage among HCWs who were negative at the baseline observation were estimated. Prevalence of MRSA carriage among 276 patients screened was 5.1%. Admission to HGSA or attendance to the Diabetic Foot Outpatient Unit (DFOU) of HGSA within the past 12 months, and previous MRSA isolation were significant risk factors for MRSA carriage. Among HCWs (n = 126), the prevalence of MRSA carriage was 4.8% and the incidence rate was 61/1000 person-years. Nurses and nurse aids were the HCW categories with the highest risk of becoming colonized with MRSA over time (p = 0.01). One HCW chronically colonized was detected. Molecular typing revealed a clonal identity for isolates recovered from patients and HCWs of the same wards, with 88.6% of isolates belonging to the EMRSA-15 (ST22-MRSA-IV) clone.",

        "abstract": "The objective was to determine the location of bla(CTX-M-1) and bla(CMY-2) genes  in 33 Escherichia coli isolates previously obtained from healthy humans, pets, and food-producing animals in Tunisia, and to characterize the genetic lineages of isolates. Molecular typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)-XbaI and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Plasmids were analyzed by S1-PFGE, polymerase chain reaction-based replicon typing, and plasmid MLST. Conjugation experiments were performed. The bla(CTX-M-1) and bla(CMY-2) genes were studied by I-Ceu1-PFGE and S1-PFGE, and subsequent hybridization with specific probes. Eighteen different sequence types (STs) were identified among the 30 CTX-M-1-producing isolates, 5 of them being detected in 17 isolates (ST/phylogroup): ST57/D, ST155/B1, ST58/B1, ST10/A, and ST398/A. Most of the bla(CTX-M-1)-positive isolates had different PFGE profiles, with the exception of four human and pet isolates of lineage ST57 with related PFGE profiles (>80% identity). Three CMY-2-producing isolates were typed as ST58/B1, ST117/D, and ST3632/B2. The IncI1 replicon was detected in all the 33 E. coli studied isolates, in many cases in combination with other replicons: IncF, IncX, IncK, IncR, IncY, colE, or IncN. The bla(CTX-M-1) gene was transferred by conjugation in 22 of the 30 positive strains and was located into IncI1 plasmids (ST3-CC3); the bla(CMY-2) gene was located into a conjugative IncI1 plasmid (ST12) of 97 kb in one strain. One bla(CTX-M-1)-positive strain carried the qnrB19 gene in a 33 kb IncX plasmid. Diverse genetic lineages are detected in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing E. coli from different origins. The bla(CTX-M-1) and bla(CMY-2) genes were associated with conjugative IncI1 (ST3 and ST12, respectively) plasmids in E. coli strains from human and animal origin.",

All of these isolates were inhibited at 0.5 mg/L of tigecycline. For S. pneumoniae isolates, 72% were not susceptible to penicillin (69% intermediate and 3% resistant) and 96% were not susceptible to azithromycin. Among the 178 isolates resistant to azithromycin, 53 isolates (30%) had the M phenotype and 70% had the cMLSB phenotype. The rate of nonsusceptibility to ertapenem, telithromycin, moxifloxacin, and quinupristindalfopristin in S. pneumoniae was 3%, 2%, 1%, and 57%, respectively. For H. influenzae, 36 (60%) were not susceptible to ampicillin, among which 31 possessed beta-lactamase. A high rate (8.3%) of H. influenzae isolates with beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant phenotype was found. All H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to azithromycin, but 40% of them were not susceptible to clarithromycin. Ninety-eight percent (44 isolates) of M. catarrhalis possessed beta-lactamase. All three fluoroquinolones tested were highly active (MIC90 < or =0.12 mg/L) against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria are an emerging threat. This study reports the microbiologic, clinical, and epidemiologic features and the therapeutic outcomes of the infections caused by carbapenem- and pandrug-resistant Klebsiella emerged in our hospital. Fingerprinting analyses by automated repetitive extragenic palindromic-polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry are also compared.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella spp. affecting 13 patients were investigated using automated rep-PCR (DiversiLab System) and MALDI-TOF. Species identification was performed by Vitek 2 System and MALDI-TOF. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was made using Vitek 2 System and Etest. Screening for extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase production was made by double disk synergy and Hodge tests, respectively. Synergy studies were performed using Etest. DNA array was used for detection of KPC and ESBLs. bla(VIM-1) gene was amplified by PCR and sequencing. Use of carbapenems in the hospital was studied.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 13 patients were found to be colonized/infected with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella. All patients were previously submitted to surgery and/or presented with severe underlying disease. After carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella isolation, the majority of the patients were treated with amikacin plus carbapenem, tigecycline, or fosfomycin. All Klebsiella isolates (n = 14), except two, had the bla(VIM-1) gene and all Klebsiella pneumoniae also had bla(SHV) gene associated with ESBL production. DiversiLab system showed higher discriminatory power than MALDI-TOF for strain typing.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The risk of a rapid dissemination and the persistence of these multidrug-resistant strains through the time determine the need to implement routine procedures for metallo-beta-lactamase detection and measures for prevention of the spread of these microorganisms. The combined use of MALDI-TOF for species identification and DiversiLab System for clonal strain typing may be a useful tool for fast and accurate management of nosocomial outbreaks. The potential clinical utility of fosfomycin in this matter should be considered in future studies.",

TEM, SHV, CTX-M, CMY, or FOX beta-lactamase genes were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. The clonal study was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using XbaI. All but one of the 12 K. pneumoniae strains harbored the bla (SHV-5) gene, and the bla TEM-1a gene was also detected in one of them. These 11 strains belonged to two different clonal types: A (9 strains) and B (2 strains) and were grouped in the subtypes A(1) (6 strains), A(2), A(3), A(4), B(1), and B(2) (1 strain each). The clonal type A strains were isolated from 9 patients (in five cases from blood) during a 6-month period. The remaining K. pneumoniae strain harbored both the bla (SHV-11) + bla (CTX-M-14) genes and showed the clonal type C. A nosocomial outbreak by a SHV-5-producing multiresistant K. pneumoniae is reported in Spain in a neonatal-pediatric ICU ward. This is the first description of a K. pneumoniae harboring both the bla (SHV-11) and bla (CTX-M-14) genes in Spain.",

The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence and molecular characteristics of MRSA bloodstream isolates in hospitals. Clinical data from patients with MRSA bacteremia between 2003 and 2005 were collected. Isolates were classified as hospital-acquired (HA-MRSA), health care-associated (HCA-MRSA), or CA-MRSA according to the time of isolation and the risk factors for colonization. Available strains were tested for the presence of mecA, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), and by multilocus sequence test. Among 129 cases, 78 nonduplicated isolates were analyzed. The proportion of CA-MRSA, HCA-MRSA, and HA-MRSA was 2.6% (2), 23.1% (18), and 74.4% (58), respectively. According to multilocus sequence test and SCCmec, there were seven genotypes with sequence types (STs) and SCCmec types. The predominant genotype, ST5-MRSA-II, was found in 57.7% (45). All type IVA isolates was ST72 (9), and ST72-MRSA-IVA was identified in CA-MRSA (2, 100%), HCA-MRSA (1, 5.6%), and HA-MRSA (6, 10.3%), respectively.

Systematic mutagenesis determined that two LTs are involved in producing the 1,6-anhydro PG monomers that cause the death of ciliated cells in Fallopian tubes.

        "abstract": "A search to identify proteins with high affinity for choline-containing pneumococcal cell walls (choline-binding proteins) has permitted the localization, cloning, sequencing, and overexpression of a gene (pce), coding for a protein (Pce) that liberates phosphorylcholine from purified cell walls of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The pce gene of the pneumococcal strain R6 encodes a protein of 627 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 72,104. Pce can remove a maximum of 20% phosphorylcholine residues from the cell wall teichoic acid. In silico analysis of Pce shows a modular organization of the enzyme where the choline-binding domain, involved in cell wall substrate recognition, and the catalytic domain are located at the carboxy- and amino-terminal moieties of the protein, respectively. Remarkably, a long tail of 85 amino acids follows the carboxy-terminal domain, a structural feature that had not been described for the published choline-binding proteins. The carboxy-terminal moiety of Pce is assembled by 10 repeated motifs, and the protein has also a cleavable signal peptide of 25 amino acids that renders after its cleavage a mature protein of 69,426 Da (602 amino acids). The pce gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli, and Pce was active when assayed on pneumococcal walls. We have also found that the signal peptide of Pce was functional in E. coli. Biochemical analysis suggested that Pce is the teichoic acid phosphorylcholine esterase of S. pneumoniae that had been biochemically characterized previously. Construction of two pce pneumococcal mutants (R6D and M31D) by insertion-duplication mutagenesis revealed that these mutants grew at a doubling-time similar to those of the parental strains of the wild-type R6 and the lytA-mutant M31, respectively. R6D and M31D were morphologically indistinguishable from the parental strains when whole-mounted cells were observed under the electron microscope and exhibited levels of competence for genetic transformation slightly lower than those reported for R6 and M31.",

        "abstract": "Haemophilus influenzae frequently colonizes the nasopharynx of children and adults, which can lead to a variety of infections. We investigated H. influenzae carriage in the nasopharynx of 360 children, in terms of (1) the prevalence of strains with decreased susceptibility, and (2) the presence of amino acid substitutions in PBP3. One hundred twenty-three strains were isolated (34.2%, 123/360), 122 of which were classified as nontypable H. influenzae (NTHi). Of these, \u03b2-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-susceptible strains accounted for 26.2%, \u03b2-lactamase-producing-ampicillin-resistant strains for 9.0%, \u03b2-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains for 40.2%, and \u03b2-lactamase-producing amoxicillin-/clavulanic acid-resistant (BLPACR) for 24.6%, respectively. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns were so diverse that they were clustered into 41 groups. The amino acid substitutions in the transpeptidase domain (292 amino acids) of ftsI in BLNAR isolates showed that group IIb accounted for 30.6%, IIc for 8.2%, IId for 16.3%, III for 32.7%, and the others for 12.2%. Moreover, groups IIb (56.7%; 17/30) and III (23.3%; 7/30) were prevalent among BLPACR strains. They were subclassified into more diverse sequence subtypes by analysis of the entire PBP3 (610 amino acids). Groups IIb, IIc, IId, and III exhibited 13, four, six, and four sequence subtypes, respectively. Such a genetic diversity is likely indicative of significant potential for decreased antimicrobial susceptibility in nasopharyngeal-colonizing NTHi strains.",

The identification of strains to the species level by conventional biochemical and phenotypic tests and by multiplex PCR assay had 100% agreement. Both E. faecalis and E. faecium were isolated from patients during this outbreak. The vanA genotype was confirmed by PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that E. faecium isolates are generally less susceptible to antibiotics than E. faecalis. By PCR, 24 of 26 VRE strains tested carried the Tn1546 element. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified five distinct patterns for E. faecalis (A, B, C, D, E) and three for E. faecium (M, N, and O). A single PFGE pattern was identified in the majority of strains of each species and does not discriminate between case and carrier isolates.",

Eighteen hospitals from five regions provided a total of 228 K. pneumoniae isolates (164 from admitted patients, four from hospital environmental sources, and 60 isolates from community patients). The genetic relationship was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method, and bla(ESBL) genes were sequenced. Fifty four K. pneumoniae isolates were extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBL)-producers (23.6%), mostly due to the CTX-M-15 enzyme (79.6%). ESBL isolates were grouped in 27 different sequence types (STs), being the most prevalent ST15 (15%), ST152 (13%), and both ST48 and ST147 (11%, respectively). Community-acquired criteria could be demonstrated in 60 patients (26%) corresponding to urological (33%), wound (27%), respiratory (27%), and otic (13%) infections. Population structure analysis showed that our isolates corresponded to a highly polyclonal population with 10 nonpreviously described STs, demonstrating the importance of local epidemiological studies. We report the first data of the population structure of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates obtained in a national multicenter surveillance Cuban program. Results showed that a highly polyclonal ESBL-producer K. pneumoniae population was mainly due to CTX-M-15 carriage, whereas carbapenemases production was not present.",

In China, the risk factors for MDR-TB have not been systematically evaluated.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with MDR-TB among previously treated patients in China.\\n\\nDESIGN: A case-control study was carried out. Cases were selected from previously treated MDR-TB patients who were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin, and controls were selected from previously treated TB patients who were sensitive to isoniazid and rifampin (non-MDR-TB). Information was collected from the registration database and a structured questionnaire.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 61 cases and 50 controls were recruited. A multivariate analysis showed that the family annual per-capita income \u22647,000 Yuan (odds ratio [OR]=3.238; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.270-8.252), no history of fixed dose combinations (FDCs) in anti-TB treatment (OR=4.027; 95% CI: 1.457-11.129), and adverse reactions in the course of TB treatment (OR=3.568; 95% CI: 1.402-9.085) were independent predictors of MDR-TB. Moreover, among the TB patients who had adverse reactions, quitting the treatment was shown as a risk factor for MDR-TB (p=0.009).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: In the control of MDR-TB among previously treated patients, lower socioeconomic groups, the expanding use of FDCs, and improving adherence to treatment by implementing Directly Observed Therapy Short Course-Plus (DOTS-Plus), strictly should become a priority that requires strong commitment and collaboration among health organizations.",

Five hundred twenty Enterobacteriaceae were prospectively collected (May 2007-August 2008) at the Theodor Bilharz Research Institute (Cairo). Among the collected Enterobacteriaceae, 56% (n=291) were E. coli and 32% (n=165) Klebsiella pneumoniae. A total of 16% (n=3) of all isolates were ESBL, 19% (n=55) of the E. coli and 14% (n=23) of the K. pneumoniae. The proportion of E. coli ESBL producers did not differ significantly between in and outpatients (20% vs. 17%) but was significantly different for non-E. coli ESBL producers (18.5% vs. 1.2%: p=0.0001). The majority of E. coli ESBL producers (75%) was isolated from urine. All the ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae available for molecular study (n=74) produced CTX-M-15. Among the CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates; 40% belonged to phylogenetic group A, 32% to D, and 26% to B2. ERIC-2 PCR profiles were obtained for all these E. coli isolates and multilocus sequence typing for those belonging to group B2. Genotyping analyses showed strain diversity; however, some clusters had profiles indistinguishable from that of previously published clones. Multilocus sequence typing showed that 75% of E. coli group B2 belonged to clone ST131. This indicates that a new country in Africa is adversely affected by clones of E. coli-producing CTX-M-15.",

Polyphenols are abundantly present in the human diet and have an antimicrobial effect inducing selective changes in the microbiota composition, with potential beneficial effects for the human health. Our aim was to determine the human gut microbiota susceptibility toward wine polyphenols. Susceptibility to two commercial wine phenolic extracts (Vitaflavan(\u00ae) and Provinols\u2122) was determined in isolates from fecal samples from 36 gastrointestinal healthy volunteers. To select the polyphenol-resistant isolates, feces were seeded in plates containing 1 mg/ml of phenolic extract. The minimal inhibitory concentration to polyphenols in the collected isolates was assessed by the agar dilution method. Overall results showed that Gram-negative isolates are most tolerant to the presence of both grape seed and red wine extracts. Furthermore, we purified to homogeneity the phenolic fractions by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine their antimicrobial effect and their influence on bacterial growth in four selected ATCC strains using the BioScreen apparatus. Results showed that the antimicrobial activity of the wine polyphenols is the result of the interaction of both the flavan-3-ol type and the bacteria. Bacterial Intraspecies differences in the phenolic susceptibility suggest the existence of polyphenol-resistant mechanisms that are uncharacterized as yet.",

Laboratory identification and serotyping of this pathogens is desirable to monitor vaccine impact and coverage; however, especially in pediatric patients, the yield of traditional microbiological diagnostic procedures can be very low. The aim of this study was to develop real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays to be performed directly on blood samples to identify the most common capsular serotypes causing pneumonia in Italian children (\u22645 years of ages) after the introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine. Our real-time PCR-based assays showed high sensitivity (at least 35 fg of pneumococcal DNA), and they were validated with 49 well-characterized pneumococcal isolates, 8 nonpneumococcal isolates, 13 simulated blood clinical samples loaded with S. pneumoniae of known serotypes, and 46 blood clinical samples. All the strains tested and the simulated blood clinical samples were correctly typed by the technique. Real-time PCR allowed serotyping in 37/46 children \u22645 years of age (80.4%) in whom pneumonia was diagnosed in four Italian hospitals. Non-PCV7 serotypes accounted for at least 47.8% (22/46) of cases, serotype 19A being the most common (34.7%, 16/46). Although, it is not known at present whether the incidence of 19A serotype is attributable to the use of PCV7 only, expanding pneumococcal serotype coverage has clearly the potential to prevent a larger number of pneumonias in Italian children less than \u22645 years of age. Molecular methods are of increasing importance in the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia and in monitoring serotype distribution and replacement.",

Type A or C \u03b2-lactamase-producing MSSA frequently shows the cefazolin inoculum effect (CIE). However, the clinical implication of the CIE for MSSA bacteremia is obscure. Methods: MSSA bacteremic patients treated with cefazolin were included in a retrospective cohort study. The blaZ gene of the isolates was sequenced to identify the type of \u03b2-lactamase. The patients whose isolates showed a \u22654-fold increase in cefazolin, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) at the high inoculum (\u223c5\u00d710(7) CFU/ml), were assigned to the CIE-positive group and the remainder to the CIE-negative group. Treatment failure was assessed at 12 weeks after cefazolin was initiated. Results: A total of 113 MSSA bacteremic patients were included. Among the 113 isolates, 57.5% showed the CIE and 77.9% carried the blaZ gene; type A \u03b2-lactamase was 15.0% and type C was 40.7%. Persistent bacteremia was more common in the CIE-positive group (9% vs. 0%, p=0.04). Treatment failure rates were higher in the CIE-positive group with high bacterial burden infection, but the difference was not significant (48% vs. 25%, p=0.13). There was no significant difference of failure between groups with high-inoculum MIC \u226516 and \u22641\u2009\u03bcg/ml (13% vs. 5%, p=0.31). In the multivariable analysis, underlying cardiovascular diseases, pneumonia, osteoarticular infections, and endocarditis were significant risk factors for treatment failure and the CIE was not significantly associated with treatment failure. Conclusion: The CIE might be associated with persistent bacteremia if cefazolin is used for MSSA bacteremia with a high burden of infections. However, the sites of infections are more important factors for the clinical outcome than the CIE.",

Furthermore, MRSA is increasingly resistant to many conventional antimicrobials, so there is a real need to develop alternative approaches for MRSA decolonization and treatment. Previously, we have demonstrated that MRSA can be killed with an immunoglobulin G (IgG)-SnCe6 conjugate and red light, but effectiveness was dependent on the particular strain and the growth phase. In this investigation, we used an antibody raised against MRSA to make an Ab-SnCe6 conjugate capable of targeting many MRSA strains in all growth phases. To suspensions of important epidemic MRSA, each grown to stationary, lag, or exponential phase, the Ab-SnCe6 conjugate was added and samples exposed to red light. Survivors were then enumerated. This treatment was very effective at killing all the different MRSA strains tested, in all growth phases. The Ab-SnCe6 conjugate was able to kill EMRSA-16 selectively in a mixed suspension of EMRSA-16 and Escherichia coli, and was much better at killing EMRSA-16 than a coagulase-negative staphylococcus, S. epidermidis. These results demonstrate that photodynamic therapy of MRSA is very effective when the photosensitizer is targeted to the pathogen using a suitable antibody and may be a good candidate for a novel treatment of MRSA infections.",

In this study, we investigated the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in broiler flocks in the absence of the selective pressure exerted by the use of avoparcin. One hundred sixty-two broiler flocks from rearing systems with different histories of avoparcin exposure were investigated for the presence of VRE. Using a direct selective plating procedure, VRE were isolated from 104 of 140 (74.3%) broiler flocks reared in broiler houses previously exposed to avoparcin on conventional and extensive indoor broiler farms. In contrast, only 2 of 22 (9.1%) organic broiler flocks reared on free-range farms with no history of previous exposure to avoparcin were VRE-positive. Furthermore, the occurrence of VRE over time in flocks reared in broiler houses previously exposed to avoparcin was investigated. Results obtained by direct selective plating showed no significant decrease in the proportion of VRE-positive flocks during the study period (1998-2001). This study demonstrated the extensive occurrence of VRE in broiler flocks more than 5 years after the avoparcin ban in Denmark, and indicates that VRE may persist in the absence of the selective pressure exerted by avoparcin. The results differ markedly from previously published Danish surveillance data on VRE in broilers. This may reflect differences in isolation procedures.",

        "abstract": "In Gram-negative bacteria, the bacterial cell wall biosynthetic mechanism requires the coordinated action of enzymes and structural proteins located in the cytoplasm, within the membrane, and in the periplasm of the cell. Its main component, peptidoglycan (PG), is essential for cell division and wall elongation. Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) catalyze the last steps of PG biosynthesis, namely the polymerization of glycan chains and the cross-linking of stem peptides, and can be either monofunctional or bifunctional. Their action is coordinated with that of other enzymes essential for cell-wall biosynthesis, such as lytic transglycosylases (LT). Here, we have studied SltB1, an LT from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and identified that it forms a complex with PBP2, a monofunctional enzyme, which requires the presence of Ca(2+). In addition, we have solved the structure of SltB1 to a high resolution, and identified that it harbors an EF-hand like motif containing a Ca(2+) ion displaying bipyramidal coordination. These studies provide initial structural details that shed light on the interactions between the PG biosynthesis enzymes in P. aeruginosa.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial meningitis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children. In this paper, we present the results of the first two years (1997-98) of activity of the National Reference Centre for Bacterial Meningitis (NRCBM) on the etiologic agents of bacterial meningitis in Poland. Of the 220 isolates sent to the NRCBM, the most frequently identified was Neisseria meningitidis (n = 90, 40.9%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (n = 58, 26.4%), and Streptoccus pneumoniae (n = 46, 20.9%). Of the meningococcal isolates, 88.9% belonged to serogroup B and 10.0% to serogroup C, and the most prevalent serotype was 22 (43.3%). Most meningococci were highly sensitive to penicillin; however, 10% of them had decreased susceptibility to penicillin. More than 90% of H. influenzae belonged to serotype b, and all were susceptible to third generation cephalosporins and chloramphenicol. A broad distribution of serotypes was found among pneumococcal isolates, of which the most common were serotypes 3 and 8. Penicillin nonsusceptible isolates constituted 13% of all pneumococcal isolates. Three of the resistant pnemococci belonged to serotype 23F. Data presented in this paper demonstrate the current epidemiological situation of bacterial meningitis in Poland.",

        "abstract": "Persisters are a small proportion of a bacterial population that exists in a physiological state permitting survival despite the lethal activity of antibiotics. To explain this phenomenon, it has been suggested that persisters are bacteria repairing spontaneous errors of DNA synthesis. To verify this assumption, Escherichia coli AB1157 and its lexA3 derivative were exposed to a dose 6x MIC of various antibiotics representative of different molecular mechanisms of action (ampicillin, ceftriaxone, meropenem, amikacin, ciprofloxacin). Bacterial cell counts, after 24 hr of exposure to the antimicrobials, revealed a reduction of about 90% of viable organisms in the lexA3 strains in comparison to the lexA+. In several cases, the number of colony-forming units decreased below the limit of assay. This behavior was noted with all antibiotics used, alone or in combination (amikacin plus ceftriaxone and amikacin plus ciprofloxacin). The same experiments were repeated using E. coli AB1157 cultured in the presence of mitomycin C (0.25x MIC), and the number of survivors exceeded by about 90% the values found in the nonexposed control. In contrast, in the sulA background, mitomycin C reacted synergically with all the antibiotics tested causing a strong reduction of the survivors in comparison with the control. The addition of chloramphenicol (0.125x MIC), on the contrary, caused a reduction of the number of survivors of about 90%. These findings indicate that, when DNA repair is active (a mechanism known to block cell division), the number of survivors is greater than that observed with lexA3. Thus, in addition to other possible explanations, persisters might be a fraction of bacteria that during antibiotic treatment are not growing because they are repairing spontaneous errors of DNA synthesis.",

The incidence of colonization and/or infection was 4.8%. Eighty-nine percent of the ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates were acquired in the ICU, and only 8.3% of the patients were infected. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of the isolates showed that 32 isolates were clonally related and contained a 160-kb plasmid carrying the bla(CTX-M-15), bla(OXA-1), bla(TEM-1), and aac6'-Ib-cr genes. CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli isolates collected in the ward during the same period of time contained distinct plasmids and were not clonally related.

In Europe, there are increasing reports of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP), and in Sweden, MRSP has also been more frequently isolated during recent years. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the epidemiology and genetic relationship among the Swedish isolates. This study therefore investigated the genetic relationship of MRSP isolated from companion animals in Sweden. In the study, MRSP isolates taken in the period January 2008-June 2010 from a total of 226 dogs and cats were characterized by spa typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In addition, the geographical distribution of the isolates based on year of isolation and genetic typing was determined using a geographical information system. One multiresistant clonal lineage dominated among Swedish MRSP isolates, corresponding to the European winning lineage ST71-J-t02-SCCmec II-III. Furthermore, the geographical dissemination of MRSP corresponded to areas with high dog densities, centered on the three major cities in Sweden where the largest animal hospitals are situated.",

However, no study analyzing potential risk factors for the acquisition of CRKP has been published as of now. We therefore performed a case-control study to determine the risk factors for the acquisition of CRKP. CRKP was nosocomially isolated from 30 patients between January 1997 and August 2003. Control patients were randomly selected at a ratio of 4:1 from the same medical or surgical services from which patients were receiving care when isolation of CRKP occurred. Risk factors for CRKP were previous use of carbapenem (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 28.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.08-90.55) and cephalosporin (AOR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.35-12.43). In contrast, previous use of fluoroquinolone was negatively associated with isolation of CRKP (AOR, 0.26; 95% CI 0.07-0.97); however, the possibility of selection bias cannot be ruled out. Our results suggest that the nosocomial isolation of CRKP is strongly favored by the selection pressure of carbapenem.",

A total of 53 nonduplicate CRAB were collected from inpatients of intensive care units in three hospitals in China from February 2009 to August 2011. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by the broth microdilution method. The checkerboard method was used to determine whether combinations of the two agents act synergistically. Among the 53 A. baumannii, 64.2% of the isolates were susceptible to amikacin and 69.8% were susceptible to cefoperazone-sulbactam. More than 80% of isolates were resistant to the other agents and no isolates were found resistant to polymyxin B and minocycline. The combination of minocycline and cefoperazone-sulbactam demonstrated synergism in 39 isolates, partial synergism in 11 isolates, and indifference in 3 isolates. No antagonistic interactions were observed. Our study demonstrated that minocycline has good activity against CRAB and the combination of minocycline with cefoperazone-sulbactam had significant synergistic activity against these strains in vitro. The combination of minocycline and cefoperazone-sulbactam may be an alternative option for the treatment of infections caused by CRAB.",

        "abstract": "The role of two chaperone proteins, DnaK and the cooperating factor DnaJ, in Escherichia coli antibiotic susceptibility to three antibiotics (a beta-lactam, chloramphenicol, tetracycline) has been studied. It was found that null dnaJ and dnaKdnaJ mutants are impaired in the functions leading to antibiotic susceptibility. The secretion of beta-lactamase to the periplasmic space is diminished in both mutants, and the additive effect of the two mutations was observed. The activity of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase is also impaired in an additive manner in both mutant strains. Tetracycline uptake is changed only in the double deletion mutant. These defects were observed only during incubation at high temperature (42 degrees C). Efficient complementation of some of these defects by the wild-type alleles introduced on low-copy number plasmid was achieved. Minimal inhibitory concentrations and the titer of the wild-type strains, delta dnaJ and delta dnaKdnaJ mutants treated with ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline were also determined. Higher susceptibility of both mutants to chloramphenicol and tetracycline, as compared to their wild-type parent, was observed only after 1 h preincubation of cultures at 42 degrees C. On the contrary, both mutants were less susceptible to ampicillin than their parent strain.",

Those were mainly isolated from horses at animal hospitals and further from environmental sites at a stud farm. In contrast, all isolates, except one, from healthy foals had low MICs of erythromycin, spiramycin, virginiamycin, and oxytetracycline. The isolates from soil in public parks had also low MICs of these antimicrobial agents. Broth microdilution appeared both reliable and reproducible for susceptibility testing of C. difficile.

For all isolates, the double-disk diffusion test revealed synergy between clavulanate and cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime, suggesting the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Polymerase chain reaction experiments, performed on plasmid DNA, and sequencing revealed the presence of bla(TEM-1B) (26 isolates, 81%), bla(TEM-34(IRT-6)) (3 isolates, 9%), bla(SHV-12) (2 isolates, 6%), and bla(CTX-M-15) (31 isolates, 97%). Further, the insertion sequence ISEcp1 was found upstream from the bla(CTX-M-15) gene in 11 isolates. The bla genes were found alone or in various combinations in a single isolate. bla(TEM-1B) and bla(CTX-M-15) genes were detected in 26 out of the 32 isolates. Three isolates harbored both bla(TEM-34(IRT-6)) and bla(CTX-M-15). bla(SHV-12) was identified either alone or with bla(CTX-M-15) in a single isolate. Our investigation showed the dominance of CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, with CTX-M-15 particularly common, and to our best knowledge, this is the first report of the coexistence of CTX-M-15 and IRT-6 in E. coli isolates from children in Tunisia.",

        "abstract": "Use of antibiotics in food animals may contribute to development and spread of resistant organisms, particularly so in some countries. The aim of this study was two-fold; first, to establish the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli in chicken production in a region within Romania. Second, to study the relatedness of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates recovered from broilers, abattoir workers where the chickens were slaughtered and from the human clinical specimens from two regional hospitals. The results indicated a very high (69%) rate of carriage of ESBL and AmpC-producing E. coli in chickens with 36% CTX-M producers. Sequencing showed that chickens in Romania have the highest worldwide prevalence (53%) of blaCTX-M-15 reported in poultry E. coli isolates. The majority (53%) of the extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli carried plasmid-mediated blaampC genes, mostly blaCMY-2 type, one of the highest prevalences reported in Europe. The predominant CTX-M type found in the human clinical E. coli isolates was blaCTX-M-15 and most isolates coharbored blaOXA-1, blaTEM, and aac(6')-ib-cr. The majority (60%) of the human clinical isolates belonged to the pandemic virulent clone B2-ST131. The clonal relationship between broiler and the human CTX-M-producing E. coli isolates was assessed by macrorestriction pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which indicated strain diversity with no common STs found between human and poultry isolates. Moreover, IncI1 was the most prevalent replicon found in broiler ESBL-producing E. coli isolates and also in transconjugants, indicating that plasmids and not clonal spread may play a role in the transfer of blaCTX-M genes. This study identifies a high prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli from broiler chickens in Romania with a high occurrence incidence of blaCTX-M-15, which reflects the main ESBL type found in human E. coli infections in this country.",

In addition, the 25 Enterococcus strains were identified to species level. A total of 22,598 (97.2%) out of 23,259 test results were in accordance when the data were categorized as susceptible or resistant. When the reported results were categorized according to the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards breakpoints, the percentage of concordant results increased to 98.4% and the performance between laboratories varied between 94.2 and 99.4% concordant results. For E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella, all laboratories except one had more than 97% concordant results, whereas for Enterococcus spp., two laboratories had less than 90% concordant results. Susceptibility testing of Salmonella to fluoroquinolones gave rise to almost 0.5% nonconcordant results and susceptibility testing of S. aureus to vancomycin resulted in that 1.8% of the strains were incorrectly reported as vancomycin resistant. Ten laboratories identified the Enterococcus spp. to species level. All five Enterococcus faecium and 10 Enterococcus faecalis selected from the strain collection at the Danish Veterinary Institute were correctly identified by all laboratories, whereas some problems were observed identifying other enterococcal species. This study showed a good performance and agreement in antimicrobial susceptibility testing at the 12 participating laboratories and that surveillance data covering susceptibility test results of E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella from animals in the Nordic countries are comparable. But it also showed that some aspects can be improved. In addition, the study showed that the different laboratories are capable of identifying E. faecalis and E. faecium.",

This work evaluated the susceptibility of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica biofilms to four disinfectants, and analyzed how those chemical agents influenced stress-response and virulence genes expression by surviving cells. Three strains of each bacterial species mentioned were used, and their biofilms were treated with sodium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, and triclosan using the Calgary Biofilm Device. Expression of L. monocytogenes and S. enterica stress-response genes cplC and ropS, and virulence genes prfA and avrA, respectively, was analyzed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results showed sodium hypochlorite to have the lowest minimum biofilm eradication concentration values (3.125\u2009\u03bcg/ml), whereas triclosan had the worst performance since no S. enterica biofilm eradication was achieved even at the maximum concentration used (4,000\u2009\u03bcg/ml). L. monocytogenes stress-response gene and S. enterica virulence gene were significantly upregulated in surviving cells compared with controls. In general, this work points out sodium hypochlorite as the most effective disinfectant against biofilms of both species used, and L. monocytogenes biofilms to be more susceptible to disinfection than S. enterica biofilms. Moreover, it was found that disinfection surviving biofilm cells seem to develop a stress response and/or become more virulent, which may compromise food safety and potentiate public health risk.",

The successful distribution of CTX-M enzymes mainly involves Escherichia coli causing systemic as well as urinary tract infections in patients worldwide. CTX-M expression is often associated with coresistance that critically reduces treatments options. The mobilization of bla(CTX-M) genes from their original chromosomal position in various Kluyvera species has been facilitated by mobile genetic elements such as ISEcp1 or ISCR1. Molecular epidemiological studies have revealed a thriving linkage of bla(CTX-M) genes to conjugative plasmids and successful bacterial clones. Multireplicon FII plasmids are shown to carry the most widely distributed bla(CTX-M-15) across continents, paving the way for bla(CTX-M-15) into different genetic lineages of E. coli. Dissemination of virulent clones ST131-O25:H4-B2 and ST405-O102:H6-D is now being described worldwide. Importantly, CTX-M-producing strains are uncovering their ability of long-term gastrointestinal colonization often associated with travel to high-prevalent areas. Thus, we are witnessing a global epidemic of bla(CTX-M)-encoding E. coli strains and plasmids, which require serious attention and efficient infection control measures.",

We studied the efficacy of vancomycin and teicoplanin, as well as cloxacillin and cefotaxime, against the infection caused by four S. aureus strains with different glycopeptide and beta-lactam susceptibilities (strains A, B, C, and D; MICs for vancomycin of 1, 2, 4, and 8 microg/ml respectively), using a modified model of mouse peritonitis. This optimized model appeared to be straightforward and reproducible, and was able to detect low differences in bacterial killing between antibiotics and also between different S. aureus strains. Bactericidal activities in peritoneal fluid for vancomycin, teicoplanin, cloxacillin, and cefotaxime decreased from -2.98, -2.36, -3.22, and -3.57 log(10) cfu/ml, respectively, in infection by strain A (MICs for vancomycin and cloxacillin of 1 and 0.38 microg/ml, respectively) to -1.22, -0.65, -1.04, and +0.24 in peritonitis due to strain D (MICs for vancomycin and cloxacillin of 8 and 1,024 microg/ml). Our data confirm the superiority of beta-lactams against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and show that bactericidal activity of glycopeptides decreases significantly with slight increases in MICs; this finding suggests a reduced efficacy of glycopeptides in the treatment of serious glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus infections.",

This essential process requires a dedicated lipid, undecaprenyl-phosphate that is used as a glycan lipid carrier. The sugar is linked to the lipid carrier at the inner face of the membrane and is translocated toward the periplasm, where the glycan moiety is transferred to the growing polymer. Undecaprenyl-phosphate originates from the dephosphorylation of its precursor undecaprenyl-diphosphate, with itself generated by de novo synthesis or by recycling after the final glycan transfer. Undecaprenyl-diphosphate is de novo synthesized by the cytosolic cis-prenyltransferase undecaprenyl-diphosphate synthase, which has been structurally and mechanistically characterized in great detail highlighting the condensation process. In contrast, the next step toward the formation of the lipid carrier, the dephosphorylation step, which has been overlooked for many years, has only started revealing surprising features. In contrast to the previous step, two unrelated families of integral membrane proteins exhibit undecaprenyl-diphosphate phosphatase activity: BacA and members of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 super-family, raising the question of the significance of this multiplicity. Moreover, these enzymes establish an unexpected link between the synthesis of bacterial cell-wall polymers and other biological processes. In the present review, the current knowledge in the field of the bacterial lipid carrier, its mechanism of action, biogenesis, recycling, regulation, and future perspective works are presented.",

Treatment with TM4 phage alone or M. smegmatis without TM4 did not show a significant decrease in number of intracellular bacteria in the spleen compared with untreated control. In contrast, administration of M. smegmatis-TM4 resulted in a significant decrease in the number of M. avium in the spleen. However, 23% of bacteria recovered from treated mice were resistant to TM4.

        "abstract": "Almost 30 years ago it was proposed that the selection for antiviral drug resistance should be used as an indicator of antiviral drug activity. In addition to discriminating between cellular toxicity and specific activity directed against a viral target, drug resistant mutants have been used to confirm the mechanism of action of antiviral drugs, to discover the functions of several viral proteins and to provide insights into viral evolution and fitness. Drug resistance has also become a standard component of both the preclinical and clinical drug development process. For HIV and increasingly for other viruses drug resistance testing has become standard-of-care in clinical practice. A few selected examples are provided to illustrate each of these points.",

        "abstract": "Chemotherapy is the preferred treatment for malignancies. However, a successful long-term use of chemotherapy is often prevented by the development of drug resistance. Many mechanisms such as gene mutation, DNA methylation and histone modification have important roles in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Climent suggested miR-125b was involved in the development of drug resistance by microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. miRNAs are endogenously expressed small non-coding RNAs, which are evolutionarily conserved and function as regulators of gene expression. Much effort has been exerted in analyzing the role of miRNAs in the development of drug resistance in a variety of malignancies. Several research groups have shown that the expressions of miRNAs in chemoresistant cancer cells and their parental chemosensitive ones are different. The molecular targets and mechanisms of chemosensitivity and chemoresistance are also elucidated. This article reviews the functions of miRNAs in the development of drug resistance.",

        "abstract": "While the F200Y SNP in the beta-tubulin gene is most commonly associated with benzimidazole resistance in trichostrongylid nematodes, other SNPs as well as drug efflux pathways have been implicated in the resistance. The relative contributions of all these mechanisms are not understood sufficiently to allow expected drug efficacy to be inferred from molecular data. As a component of developing better means to interpret molecular resistance tests, the present study utilised a drug resistant Haemonchus contortus isolate which possesses two of the principal benzimidazole resistance SNPs (E198A and F200Y) in order to assess the relative degree of resistance conferred by the two SNPs. We exposed larvae to a range of thiabendazole concentrations in in vitro development assays, and collected the surviving L3 larvae at each drug concentration to establish sub-populations showing increasing levels of resistance. We then sequenced the isotype 1 beta-tubulin gene in pooled larval samples, and measured allele frequencies at the two SNP positions. The frequency of the resistance allele at the 198 position increased as the thiabendazole concentration increased, while the frequency of the resistance allele at the 200 position decreased. Genotyping of individual larvae showed that the highest drug concentration was associated with the removal of all genotypes except for homozygous resistance at the 198 position alongside homozygous susceptible at the 200 position. This indicates that, at least for larval life stages, the E198A SNP is able to confer higher levels of resistance to benzimidazole drugs than the F200Y SNP, and that the homozygosity at 198 in the highly resistant individuals is mutually exclusive with heterozygosity or resistant homozygosity at the 200 position. This study illustrates the need to understand the relative contributions of different resistance mechanisms in order to maximise the degree to which molecular tests are able to inform on drug resistance phenotype. ?? 2012 Australian Society for Parasitology.",

Several of the molecular mechanisms responsible for this clinical outcome, such as DNA interstrand crosslink repair, apoptosis evasion, cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein, were discussed. There was a special focus on leukaemia, breast and ovarian cancer, and the potential use of positron-emission tomography to study anticancer-drug resistance. The progress made in translating these findings to the clinic, like Gefitinib, P-glycoprotein phenotyping, or genome-wide analysis technology, was also discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although there are numerous definitions of drug resistance in epilepsy it is generally accepted that drug resistance occurs when seizures persist in the presence of an optimal antiepileptic treatment. In spite of many newer antiepileptic drugs introduced into treatment, the relative number of drug-resistant patients remains approximately the same and reaches 30%. Consequently, there are a great deal of experimental and clinical studies aimed at finding mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. Characterization of these mechanisms could result in new, more efficient treatment strategies. THE AIM OF STUDY: To review experimental and clinical data on possible mechanisms of drug resistance in epilepsy. RESULTS: An increased expression of protein drug transporters (for example, P-gp or MRP) within the blood-brain barrier or in the epileptic focus itself seems an important mechanism of drug resistance. This leads to the enhanced removal of antiepileptic drugs from the brain and subsequently, their reduced concentrations in the target tissue. Also, mutations of genes encoding GABAA receptors or ion channels may be reasons for the diminished protection of antiepileptic drugs. Some role may be ascribed to the genetic polymorphism of liver microsomal enzymes. Last but not least, use of other drugs unrelated to epilepsy (i.e. theophylline) or ingestion of stimulatory substances (f.e. caffeine) are likely to reduce the protective potential of antiepileptic drugs. CONCLUSION: In animal models of epilepsy, inhibitors of drug transporters (verapamil, probenecid) efficiently inhibit drug resistance--may be, this potential method of treatment will be positively verified in clinical trials. Initial clinical data on this issue are encouraging. Probably, the drug resistance due to methylxanthines could be stopped quite easy by replacement of this drug group with other drugs sharing other mechanisms of action and exerting similar clinical effects. The most challenging for an efficient treatment seems drug resistance due to genetic reasons.",

        "abstract": "Regional differences of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in the fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and enterococci were determined in different cities in the south, west, and north of The Netherlands. In 1999, differences in antibiotic consumption were observed between the different regions: 11.19, 10.84, and 7.16 DDD (defined daily dosage) per 1,000 inhabitants per day, respectively. No significant regional differences were found in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance for both E. coli and enterococci. However, the differences in antibiotic consumption observed might lead to changes in antibiotic resistance in the near future. Surveillance of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance is strongly recommended to control the development of antibiotic resistance because it provides epidemiological data to set up and control antibiotic guidelines.",
