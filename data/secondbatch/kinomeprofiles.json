        "abstract": "The precursor metaplastic mucosal lesion that predisposes for esophageal adenocarcinoma is Barrett's esophagus. Because the signal transduction events that occur in Barrett's esophagus are poorly understood, this study aimed at generating a comprehensive description of cellular kinase activity in Barrett's esophagus, normal squamous esophagus, and gastric cardia to gain more insight into the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus. Peptide arrays, exhibiting 1,176 specific consensus sequences for protein kinases, were used to produce a global analysis of cellular kinase activity in biopsies of Barrett's esophagus, and results were compared with the neighboring cardia and squamous epithelia. Several differences in kinase activity using immunoblot analysis and enzyme activity assays were validated in biopsies of 27 Barrett's esophagus patients. Three unique kinome profiles are described and compared. We identified cascades of activated kinases showing that mitogen-activated protein kinase and epidermal growth factor receptor activity are both significantly altered in Barrett's esophagus compared with squamous and gastric cardia epithelia. Another novel finding is that the glycolysis pathway is significantly up-regulated in Barrett's esophagus, which is illustrated by an up-regulated pyruvate kinase activity. Here, the unique kinome profile of Barrett's esophagus is made available as a comprehensive database. Several signaling pathways are revealed as specifically expressed in Barrett's esophagus when compared with the adjacent normal epithelia. These unique findings provide novel insight in the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus that will ultimately help to resolve the increasing problem of Barrett's esophagus and prevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma.",

        "abstract": "The use of arrays in genomics has led to a fast and reliable way to screen the transcriptome of an organism. It can be automated and analysis tools have become available and hence the technique has become widely used within the past few years. Signal-transduction routes rely mainly on the phosphorylation status of already available proteins; therefore kinases are central players in signal-transduction routes. The array technology can now also be used for the analysis of the kinome. To enable array analysis, consensus peptides for kinases are spot on a solid support. After incubation with cell lysates and in the presence of radioactive ATP, radioactive peptides can be visualized and the kinases that are active in the cells can be determined. The present paper reviews comprehensively the different kinome array platforms available and results obtained hitherto using such platforms. It will appear that this technology does not disappoint its high expectations and is especially powerful because of its species independence. Nevertheless, improvements are still possible and I shall also sketch future possible directions.",

The goals of the program include the generation of a very large multidimensional data matrix and informatics and computational tools to integrate, analyze, and make the data readily accessible. LINCS data include genome-wide transcriptional signatures, biochemical protein binding profiles, cellular phenotypic response profiles and various other datasets for a wide range of cell model systems and molecular and genetic perturbations. Here we present a partial survey of this data facilitated by data standards and in particular a robust compound standardization workflow; we integrated several types of LINCS signatures and analyzed the results with a focus on mechanism of action (MoA) and chemical compounds. We illustrate how kinase targets can be related to disease models and relevant drugs. We identified some fundamental trends that appear to link Kinome binding profiles and transcriptional signatures to chemical information and biochemical binding profiles to transcriptional responses independent of chemical similarity. To fill gaps in the datasets we developed and applied predictive models. The results can be interpreted at the systems level as demonstrated based on a large number of signaling pathways. We can identify clear global relationships, suggesting robustness of cellular responses to chemical perturbation. Overall, the results suggest that chemical similarity is a useful measure at the systems level, which would support phenotypic drug optimization efforts. With this study we demonstrate the potential of such integrated analysis approaches and suggest prioritizing further experiments to fill the gaps in the current data.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hundreds of millions of people are infected with cryptosporidiosis annually, with immunocompromised individuals suffering debilitating symptoms and children in socioeconomically challenged regions at risk of repeated infections. There is currently no effective drug available. In order to facilitate the pursuit of anti-cryptosporidiosis targets and compounds, our study spans the classification of the Cryptosporidium parvum kinome and the structural and biochemical characterization of representatives from the CDPK family and a MAP kinase.\\n\\nRESULTS: The C. parvum kinome comprises over 70 members, some of which may be promising drug targets. These C. parvum protein kinases include members in the AGC, Atypical, CaMK, CK1, CMGC, and TKL groups; however, almost 35% could only be classified as OPK (other protein kinases). In addition, about 25% of the kinases identified did not have any known orthologues outside of Cryptosporidium spp. Comparison of specific kinases with their Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii orthologues revealed some distinct characteristics within the C. parvum kinome, including potential targets and opportunities for drug design. Structural and biochemical analysis of 4 representatives of the CaMK group and a MAP kinase confirms features that may be exploited in inhibitor design. Indeed, screening CpCDPK1 against a library of kinase inhibitors yielded a set of the pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives (PP1-derivatives) with IC\u2085\u2080 values of < 10 nM. The binding of a PP1-derivative is further described by an inhibitor-bound crystal structure of CpCDPK1. In addition, structural analysis of CpCDPK4 identified an unprecedented Zn-finger within the CDPK kinase domain that may have implications for its regulation.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Identification and comparison of the C. parvum protein kinases against other parasitic kinases shows how orthologue- and family-based research can be used to facilitate characterization of promising drug targets and the search for new drugs.",

For example, two commonly used techniques for monitoring phosphorylation events are phosphorylation-specific antibodies and peptide arrays. The majority of phosphorylation-specific antibodies are for human or mouse targets, and the construction of peptide arrays relies on information from phosphorylation databases, which are similarly biased toward human and mouse data. This is a substantial obstacle because many species other than mouse represent important biological models. On the basis of the observation that phosphorylation events are often conserved across species with respect to their relative positioning within proteins and their biological function, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the sequence contexts of phosphorylation events in other species for the production of peptide arrays for kinome analysis. Through this approach, genomic information can be rapidly used to create inexpensive, customizable, species-specific peptide arrays for high-throughput kinome analysis. We anticipate that these arrays will be valuable for investigating the conservation of biological responses across species, validating animal models of disease, and translating research to clinical applications.",

The results show that the sea urchin kinome, consisting of 353 protein kinases, is closer to the Drosophila kinome (239) than the human kinome (518) with respect to total kinase number. However, the diversity of sea urchin kinases is surprisingly similar to humans, since the urchin kinome is missing only 4 of 186 human subfamilies, while Drosophila lacks 24. Thus, the sea urchin kinome combines the simplicity of a non-duplicated genome with the diversity of function and signaling previously considered to be vertebrate-specific. More than half of the sea urchin kinases are involved with signal transduction, and approximately 88% of the signaling kinases are expressed in the developing embryo.

Peptide-based chemosensors that rely on fluorescence changes upon phosphorylation are highly desirable, because these systems allow a continuous readout offering an excellent spatial and temporal resolution to observe in real time the kinase activity.

Thus, only about half of the human kinome is currently covered with active small molecules. In addition, the distribution of inhibitors across the kinome is uneven. Most available kinase inhibitors are likely to be type I inhibitors. By contrast, type II inhibitors are currently rare. However, likely type II inhibitors usually have high potency. Kinase inhibitors generally display high scaffold diversity. The formation of activity cliffs with an at least 100-fold difference in potency is only observed for inhibitors of 106 kinases, which is in part due to the availability of only small numbers of compounds for many kinases, in addition to structural diversity. Moreover, kinases are much less promiscuous than often thought. Although activity data for kinase inhibitors are dominated by IC50 measurements, more than 70% of available inhibitors are only annotated with a single kinase activity and only ~1% of the inhibitors are active against five or more kinases.",

The human protein kinome contains 518 members. Most studies that focus on the human kinome require, at some point, the visualization of large amounts of data. The visualization of such data within the framework of a phylogenetic tree may help identify key relationships between different protein kinases in view of their evolutionary distance and the information used to annotate the kinome tree. For example, studies that focus on the promiscuity of kinase inhibitors can benefit from the annotations to depict binding affinities across kinase groups. Images involving the mapping of information into the kinome tree are common. However, producing such figures manually can be a long arduous process prone to errors. To circumvent this issue, we have developed a web-based tool called Kinome Render (KR) that produces customized annotations on the human kinome tree.

He also indicates that the number of inhibitors, multiplied by their salience, influences the perceived costs of delinquency. These claims have not been widely tested. Using a large, school-based sample of adolescents, the authors test Hirschi's reconceptualization and find that certain inhibitors (e.g., parental monitoring) are more important than others (e.g., maternal attachment). There are also unique types of costs (e.g., parental costs, peer costs) with differential impacts. Salience exerts a main effect, but there was little evidence to suggest it interacts with costs. Finally, PBSC has the strongest effect. These findings not only offer support for some of Hirschi's claims but also provide directions to better formulate a more comprehensive and empirically supported control theory.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: For well over a decade, significant effort has been devoted to the search for inhibitors of the human protein kinase family. This is increasingly translating into success in the clinic, with five new kinase inhibitor drugs approved since 2011. However, despite encouraging signs in other areas, success has been largely restricted to oncology.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This article reviews the prospects for kinase inhibitor drug discovery in oncology and other therapeutic areas. Major topics include the application of kinome profiling and lessons learned from kinase system-based research. With these fields nearing maturity, the validation of kinases as targets or their classification as liabilities is becoming increasingly pertinent. Other topics include a discussion of the properties required of good small molecule kinase probes.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The tractability of protein kinases to small molecule discovery through system-based research is excellent, and adequate selectivity can often be achieved. With advances in screening methodology now enabling compound profiling across most of the kinome, researchers involved in drug discovery must decide what inhibition profiles are desirable. However, this assessment must be made on the basis of incomplete understanding of the disease biology of most kinases, and as a result there is a significant risk that drugs entering clinical trials will lack efficacy. Because of this, as well as greater effort to determine which kinases are therapeutically relevant for particular diseases, opportunities for quality pre-candidate compounds developed for specific indications to find alternative uses should be maximised by early screening through panels of phenotypic assays.",

        "abstract": "Malaria, an infectious disease caused by eukaryotic parasites of the genus Plasmodium, afflicts hundreds of millions of people every year. Both the parasite and its host utilize protein kinases to regulate essential cellular processes. Bioinformatic analyses of parasite genomes predict at least 65 protein kinases, but their biological functions and therapeutic potential are largely unknown. We profiled 1358 small-molecule kinase inhibitors to evaluate the role of both the human and the malaria kinomes in Plasmodium infection of liver cells, the parasites' obligatory but transient developmental stage that precedes the symptomatic blood stage. The screen identified several small molecules that inhibit parasite load in liver cells, some with nanomolar efficacy, and each compound was subsequently assessed for activity against blood-stage malaria. Most of the screening hits inhibited both liver- and blood-stage malaria parasites, which have dissimilar gene expression profiles and infect different host cells. Evaluation of existing kinase activity profiling data for the library members suggests that several kinases are essential to malaria parasites, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), glycogen synthase kinases, and phosphoinositide-3-kinases. CDK inhibitors were found to bind to Plasmodium protein kinase 5, but it is likely that these compounds target multiple parasite kinases. The dual-stage inhibition of the identified kinase inhibitors makes them useful chemical probes and promising starting points for antimalarial development.",

Phosphorylation can regulate almost every property of a protein and is involved in all fundamental cellular processes. Cataloging and understanding protein phosphorylation is no easy task: many kinases may be expressed in a cell, and one-third of all intracellular proteins may be phosphorylated, representing as many as 20,000 distinct phosphoprotein states. Defining the kinase complement of the human genome, the kinome, has provided an excellent starting point for understanding the scale of the problem. The kinome consists of 518 kinases, and every active protein kinase phosphorylates a distinct set of substrates in a regulated manner. Deciphering the complex network of phosphorylation-based signaling is necessary for a thorough and therapeutically applicable understanding of the functioning of a cell in physiological and pathological states. We review contemporary techniques for identifying physiological substrates of the protein kinases and studying phosphorylation in living cells.",

        "abstract": "Members of the human protein kinase superfamily are the major regulatory enzymes involved in the activity control of eukaryotic signal transduction pathways. As protein kinases reside at the nodes of phosphorylation-based signal transmission, comprehensive analysis of their cellular expression and site-specific phosphorylation can provide important insights into the architecture and functionality of signaling networks. However, in global proteome studies, low cellular abundance of protein kinases often results in rather minor peptide species that are occluded by a vast excess of peptides from other cellular proteins. These analytical limitations create a rationale for kinome-wide enrichment of protein kinases prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Here, we employed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to compare the binding characteristics of three kinase-selective affinity resins by quantitative mass spectrometry. The evaluated pre-fractionation tools possessed pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based kinase inhibitors as immobilized capture ligands and retained considerable subsets of the human kinome. Based on these results, an affinity resin displaying the broadly selective kinase ligand VI16832 was employed to quantify the relative expression of more than 170 protein kinases across three different, SILAC-encoded cancer cell lines. These experiments demonstrated the feasibility of comparative kinome profiling in a compact experimental format. Interestingly, we found high levels of cytoplasmic and low levels of receptor tyrosine kinases in MV4-11 leukemia cells compared with the adherent cancer lines HCT116 and MDA-MB-435S. The VI16832 resin was further exploited to pre-fractionate kinases for targeted phosphoproteomics analysis, which revealed about 1200 distinct phosphorylation sites on more than 200 protein kinases. This hitherto largest survey of site-specific phosphorylation across the kinome significantly expands the basis for functional follow-up studies on protein kinase regulation. In conclusion, the straightforward experimental procedures described here enable different implementations of kinase-selective proteomics with considerable potential for future signal transduction and kinase drug target analysis.",

Therefore, modern drug discovery is routinely supported by computational techniques, which can identify alternate molecular targets with a significant potential for cross-reactivity. In particular, the development of highly selective kinase inhibitors is complicated by the strong conservation of the ATP-binding site across the kinase family. In this paper, we describe X-React(KIN), a new machine learning approach that extends the modeling and virtual screening of individual protein kinases to a system level in order to construct a cross-reactivity virtual profile for the human kinome. To maximize the coverage of the kinome, X-React(KIN) relies solely on the predicted target structures and employs state-of-the-art modeling techniques. Benchmark tests carried out against available selectivity data from high-throughput kinase profiling experiments demonstrate that, for almost 70% of the inhibitors, their alternate molecular targets can be effectively identified in the human kinome with a high (>0.5) sensitivity at the expense of a relatively low false positive rate (<0.5). Furthermore, in a case study, we demonstrate how X-React(KIN) can support the development of selective inhibitors by optimizing the selection of kinase targets for small-scale counter-screen experiments. The constructed cross-reactivity profiles for the human kinome are freely available to the academic community at http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/kinomelhm/ .",

Most protein kinases share a highly conserved domain, the eukaryotic protein kinase (ePK) domain, which contains the ATP and substrate-binding sites. Many inhibitors in clinical use bind to the highly conserved ATP binding site. For this reason, many kinase inhibitors are not exclusively selective for their intended targets.

Members in the family of protein kinases make up a substantial fraction of eukaryotic proteome. Analysis of the protein kinase repertoire (kinome) would help in the better understanding of the regulatory processes. In this article, we report the identification and analysis of the repertoire of protein kinases in the intracellular parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Using a combination of various sensitive sequence search methods and manual analysis, we have identified a set of 307 protein kinases in E. histolytica genome. We have classified these protein kinases into different subfamilies originally defined by Hanks and Hunter and studied these kinases further in the context of noncatalytic domains that are tethered to catalytic kinase domain. Compared to other eukaryotic organisms, protein kinases from E. histolytica vary in terms of their domain organization and displays features that may have a bearing in the unusual biology of this organism. Some of the parasitic kinases show high sequence similarity in the catalytic domain region with calmodulin/calcium dependent protein kinase subfamily. However, they are unlikely to act like typical calcium/calmodulin dependent kinases as they lack noncatalytic domains characteristic of such kinases in other organisms. Such kinases form the largest subfamily of kinases in E. histolytica. Interestingly, a PKA/PKG-like subfamily member is tethered to pleckstrin homology domain. Although potential cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases could be identified in the genome the likely absence of other cell cycle proteins suggests unusual nature of cell cycle in E. histolytica. Some of the unusual features recognized in our analysis include the absence of MEK as a part of the Mitogen Activated Kinase signaling pathway and identification of transmembrane region containing Src kinase-like kinases. Sequences which could not be classified into known subfamilies of protein kinases have unusual domain architectures. Many such unclassified protein kinases are tethered to domains which are Cysteine-rich and to domains known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Our kinome analysis of E. histolytica suggests that the organism possesses a complex protein phosphorylation network that involves many unusual kinases.",

We have developed a method for kinome analysis, which is implemented as a software pipeline in the R environment. Components and parameters were chosen to address the technical and biological characteristics of kinome microarrays. We performed comparative analysis of kinome data sets that corresponded to stimulation of immune cells with ligands of well-defined signaling pathways: bovine monocytes treated with interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), CpG-containing nucleotides, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The data sets for each of the treatments were analyzed with our methodology as well as with three other commonly used approaches. The methods were evaluated on the basis of statistical confidence of calculated values with respect to technical and biological variability, and the statistical confidence (P values) by which the known signaling pathways could be independently identified by the pathway analysis of InnateDB (a Web-based resource for innate immunity interactions and pathways). By considering the particular attributes of kinome data, we found that our approach identified more of the peptides involved in the pathways than did the other compared methods and that it did so at a much higher degree of statistical confidence.",

Protein kinases have been implicated in the regulation of virtually all biological processes but how they regulate filamentous fungal specific processes is not understood. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans has long been utilized as a powerful molecular genetic system and recent technical advances have made systematic approaches to study large gene sets possible. To enhance A. nidulans functional genomics we have created gene deletion constructs for 9851 genes representing 93.3% of the encoding genome. To illustrate the utility of these constructs, and advance the understanding of fungal kinases, we have systematically generated deletion strains for 128 A. nidulans kinases including expanded groups of 15 histidine kinases, 7 SRPK (serine-arginine protein kinases) kinases and an interesting group of 11 filamentous fungal specific kinases. We defined the terminal phenotype of 23 of the 25 essential kinases by heterokaryon rescue and identified phenotypes for 43 of the 103 non-essential kinases. Uncovered phenotypes ranged from almost no growth for a small number of essential kinases implicated in processes such as ribosomal biosynthesis, to conditional defects in response to cellular stresses. The data provide experimental evidence that previously uncharacterized kinases function in the septation initiation network, the cell wall integrity and the morphogenesis Orb6 kinase signaling pathways, as well as in pathways regulating vesicular trafficking, sexual development and secondary metabolism. Finally, we identify ChkC as a third effector kinase functioning in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. The identification of many previously unknown functions for kinases through the functional analysis of the A. nidulans kinome illustrates the utility of the A. nidulans gene deletion constructs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kinome profiling aims at the parallel analysis of kinase activities in a cell. Novel developed arrays containing consensus substrates for kinases are used to assess those kinase activities. The arrays described in this paper were already used to determine kinase activities in mammalian systems, but since substrates from many organisms are present we decided to test these arrays for the determination of kinase activities in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. RESULTS: Kinome profiling using Arabidopsis cell extracts resulted in the labelling of many consensus peptides by kinases from the plant, indicating the usefulness of this kinome profiling tool for plants. Method development showed that fresh and frozen plant material could be used to make cell lysates containing active kinases. Dilution of the plant extract increased the signal to noise ratio and non-radioactive ATP enhances full development of spot intensities. Upon infection of Arabidopsis with an avirulent strain of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, we could detect differential kinase activities by measuring phosphorylation of consensus peptides. CONCLUSION: We show that kinome profiling on arrays with consensus substrates can be used to monitor kinase activities in plants. In a case study we show that upon infection with avirulent P. syringae differential kinase activities can be found. The PepChip can for example be used to purify (unknown) kinases that play a role in P. syringae infection. This paper shows that kinome profiling using arrays of consensus peptides is a valuable new tool to study signal-transduction in plants. It complements the available methods for genomics and proteomics research.",

Here, we introduce kinome profiling using flow-through peptide microarrays as a new concept for target discovery. Comprehensive tyrosine kinase activity profiles were identified in 29 pediatric brain tumors using the PamChip kinome profiling system. Previously reported activity of epidermal growth factor receptor, c-Met, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor in pediatric brain tumors could be appreciated in our array results. Peptides corresponding with phosphorylation consensus sequences for Src family kinases showed remarkably high levels of phosphorylation compared with normal tissue types. Src activity was confirmed applying Phos-Tag SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, the Src family kinase inhibitors PP1 and dasatinib induced substantial tumor cell death in nine pediatric brain tumor cell lines but not in control cell lines. Thus, this study describes a new high-throughput technique to generate clinically relevant tyrosine kinase activity profiles as has been shown here for pediatric brain tumors. In the era of a rapidly increasing number of small-molecule inhibitors, this approach will enable us to rapidly identify new potential targets in a broad range of human malignancies.",

This work introduces a computational screening approach which provides a tool for extensive screening that uses experimentally obtained small-scale profiles as input data and makes predictions for a larger kinase set. These predictions result from a propagation of the reduced profile, exploiting a structural comparison of kinases based on a feature-similarity matrix. The comparison focuses on a molecular marker for specificity and promiscuity of kinase inhibitors.

Treating this disease by targeted or mass administration with a single chemical, praziquantel, carries the risk that drug resistance will develop in this pathogen. Therefore, there is an imperative to search for new drug targets in S. haematobium and other schistosomes. In this regard, protein kinases have potential, given their essential roles in biological processes and as targets for drugs already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in humans. In this context, we defined here the kinome of S. haematobium using a refined bioinformatic pipeline. We classified, curated and annotated predicted kinases, and assessed the developmental transcription profiles of kinase genes. Then, we prioritised a panel of kinases as potential drug targets and inferred chemicals that bind to them using an integrated bioinformatic pipeline. Most kinases of S. haematobium are very similar to those of its congener, S. mansoni, offering the prospect of designing chemicals that kill both species. Overall, this study provides a global insight into the kinome of S. haematobium and should assist the repurposing or discovery of drugs against schistosomiasis.",

While a large number of genes have been predicted to encode PKs in soybean, a comprehensive functional classification and global analysis of expression patterns of this large gene family is lacking. In this study, we identified the entire soybean PK repertoire or kinome, which comprised 2166 putative PK genes, representing 4.67% of all soybean protein-coding genes. The soybean kinome was classified into 19 groups, 81 families, and 122 subfamilies. The receptor-like kinase (RLK) group was remarkably large, containing 1418 genes. Collinearity analysis indicated that whole-genome segmental duplication events may have played a key role in the expansion of the soybean kinome, whereas tandem duplications might have contributed to the expansion of specific subfamilies. Gene structure, subcellular localization prediction, and gene expression patterns indicated extensive functional divergence of PK subfamilies. Global gene expression analysis of soybean PK subfamilies revealed tissue- and stress-specific expression patterns, implying regulatory functions over a wide range of developmental and physiological processes. In addition, tissue and stress co-expression network analysis uncovered specific subfamilies with narrow or wide interconnected relationships, indicative of their association with particular or broad signalling pathways, respectively. Taken together, our analyses provide a foundation for further functional studies to reveal the biological and molecular functions of PKs in soybean.",

Here we report on the development of a chicken-specific peptide array and its application to characterizing kinome responses within the breast (pectoralis major) and thigh (iliotibialis) muscles of poultry subject to temperature stress to mimic conditions experienced by birds during commercial transport. Breast and thigh muscles exhibited unique kinome profiles, highlighting the distinct nature of these tissues. Against these distinct backgrounds, tissue- and temperature-specific kinome responses were observed. In breast, both cold and hot stresses activated calcium-dependent metabolic adaptations. Also within breast, but specific to cold stress, was the activation of ErbB signaling as well as dynamic patterns of phosphorylation of AMPK, a key regulatory enzyme of metabolism. In thigh, cold stress induced responses suggestive of the occurrence of tissue damage, including activation of innate immune signaling pathways and tissue repair pathways (TGF-beta). In contrast, heat stress in thigh activated pathways associated with protein and fat metabolism through adipocytokine and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Defining the responses of these tissues to these stresses through conventional markers of pH, glycolytic potential, and meat quality offered a similar conclusion of the tissue- and stressor-specific responses, validating the kinome results. Collectively, the results of this study highlight the unique cellular responses of breast and thigh tissues to heat and cold stresses and may offer insight into the unique susceptibilities, as well as functional consequences, of these tissues to thermal stress.",

Identification of good- versus poor-prognosis patients is difficult or impossible using the standard histoclinical features and the recently defined prognostic gene expression signatures (GES). Kinases are often activated or overexpressed in cancers, and constitute targets for successful therapies. We sought to define a prognostic model of basal BCs based on kinome expression profiling.\\n\\nMETHODS: DNA microarray-based gene expression and histoclinical data of 2515 early BCs from thirteen datasets were collected. We searched for a kinome-based GES associated with disease-free survival (DFS) in basal BCs of the learning set using a metagene-based approach. The signature was then tested in basal tumors of the independent validation set.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 591 samples were basal. We identified a 28-kinase metagene associated with DFS in the learning set (N = 73). This metagene was associated with immune response and particularly cytotoxic T-cell response. On multivariate analysis, a metagene-based predictor outperformed the classical prognostic factors, both in the learning and the validation (N = 518) sets, independently of the lymphocyte infiltrate. In the validation set, patients whose tumors overexpressed the metagene had a 78% 5-year DFS versus 54% for other patients (p = 1.62E-4, log-rank test).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on kinome expression, we identified a predictor that separated basal BCs into two subgroups of different prognosis. Tumors associated with higher activation of cytotoxic tumor-infiltrative lymphocytes harbored a better prognosis. Such classification should help tailor the treatment and develop new therapies based on immune response manipulation.",

The ability to form toxic amyloids appears to be a property of most polypeptides. Accordingly, it has been proposed that reducing aggregation and its effect in cell fitness is a driving force in the evolution of proteins sequences. This control of protein solubility should be especially important for regulatory hubs in biological networks, like protein kinases. These enzymes are implicated in practically all processes in normal and abnormal cell physiology, and phosphorylation is one of the most frequent protein modifications used to control protein activity. Here, we use the AGGRESCAN algorithm to study the aggregation propensity of kinase sequences. We compared them with the rest of globular proteins to decipher whether they display differential aggregation properties. In addition, we compared the human kinase complement with the kinomes of other organisms to see if we can identify any evolutionary trend in the aggregational properties of this protein superfamily. Our analysis indicates that kinase domains display significant aggregation propensity, a property that decreases with increasing organism complexity.",

Breakdowns in this high-fidelity capability are a driving force in cancer and other diseases. Thus, our limited understanding of which amino acids in the kinase domain encode substrate specificity, the so-called determinants of specificity (DoS), constitutes a major obstacle in cancer signaling. Here, we systematically discover several DoS and experimentally validate three of them, named the ??C1, ??C3, and APE-7 residues. We demonstrate that DoS form sparse networks of non-conserved residues spanning distant regions. Our results reveal a likely role for inter-residue allostery in specificity and an evolutionary decoupling of kinase activity and specificity, which appear loaded on independent groups of residues. Finally, we uncover similar properties driving SH2 domain specificity and demonstrate how the identification of DoS can be utilized to elucidate a greater understanding of the role of signaling networks in cancer (Creixell et al., 2015 [this issue of Cell]).",

By contrast, most bacterial signaling is thought to occur through structurally unrelated histidine kinases, though some ePK-like kinases (ELKs) and small molecule kinases are known in bacteria. Our analysis of the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) dataset reveals that ELKs are as prevalent as histidine kinases and may play an equally important role in prokaryotic behavior. By combining GOS and public databases, we show that the ePK is just one subset of a diverse superfamily of enzymes built on a common protein kinase-like (PKL) fold. We explored this huge phylogenetic and functional space to cast light on the ancient evolution of this superfamily, its mechanistic core, and the structural basis for its observed diversity. We cataloged 27,677 ePKs and 18,699 ELKs, and classified them into 20 highly distinct families whose known members suggest regulatory functions. GOS data more than tripled the count of ELK sequences and enabled the discovery of novel families and classification and analysis of all ELKs. Comparison between and within families revealed ten key residues that are highly conserved across families. However, all but one of the ten residues has been eliminated in one family or another, indicating great functional plasticity. We show that loss of a catalytic lysine in two families is compensated by distinct mechanisms both involving other key motifs. This diverse superfamily serves as a model for further structural and functional analysis of enzyme evolution.",

Therefore, protein kinases have been an important class of targets for anticancer drugs. Health-related disparities such as differential drug response have been observed between human populations. A survey of the human kinases and their ligand genes for those containing population-specific genetic variants could provide new insights into the mechanisms of these health disparities and suggest novel targets for ethnicity-specific personalized medicine. Using the International HapMap Project genotypic data on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the protein kinase complement of the human genome (kinome) and some experimentally verified ligand genes were scanned for the existence of population-specific SNPs (eSNPs). In general, protein kinases were found to contain a much higher proportion of eSNPs than the whole genome background, indicating a stronger pressure for adaptation in individual populations. In contrast, the proportion of ligand genes containing eSNPs was not different from that of the whole genome background. Although with some important limitations, our results suggest that human kinases are more likely to be under recent positive selection than ligands. Our findings suggest that the health-related disparities associated with kinase signaling pathways are more likely to be driven by the genetic variation in the kinase genes than their cognate ligands. Illustrating the role of molecular evolution in the genetic variation of the human kinome could provide a promising route to understand the ethnic differences in cancer and facilitate the realization of ethnicity-based individualized medicine.",

By contrast, most bacterial signaling is thought to occur through structurally unrelated histidine kinases, though some ePK-like kinases (ELKs) and small molecule kinases are known in bacteria. Our analysis of the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) dataset reveals that ELKs are as prevalent as histidine kinases and may play an equally important role in prokaryotic behavior. By combining GOS and public databases, we show that the ePK is just one subset of a diverse superfamily of enzymes built on a common protein kinase\u2013like (PKL) fold. We explored this huge phylogenetic and functional space to cast light on the ancient evolution of this superfamily, its mechanistic core, and the structural basis for its observed diversity. We cataloged 27,677 ePKs and 18,699 ELKs, and classified them into 20 highly distinct families whose known members suggest regulatory functions. GOS data more than tripled the count of ELK sequences and enabled the discovery of novel families and classification and analysis of all ELKs. Comparison between and within families revealed ten key residues that are highly conserved across families. However, all but one of the ten residues has been eliminated in one family or another, indicating great functional plasticity. We show that loss of a catalytic lysine in two families is compensated by distinct mechanisms both involving other key motifs. This diverse superfamily serves as a model for further structural and functional analysis of enzyme evolution.",

Two hundred thirty kinase genes and 42 kinase proteins showed differential expression patterns (fold change\u2009\u2265\u20091.5) in at least one tissue pair-wise comparison (AD vs. NC, AC vs. NC, and/or AC vs. AD).

We developed a computational platform (ReKINect) to identify NAMs and systematically interpreted the exomes and quantitative (phospho-)proteomes of five ovarian cancer cell lines and the global cancer genome repository. We identified and experimentally validated several NAMs, including PKC?? M501I and PKD1 D665N, which encode specificity switches analogous to the appearance of kinases de novo within the kinome. We discover mutant molecular logic gates, a drift toward phospho-threonine signaling, weakening of phosphorylation motifs, and kinase-inactivating hotspots in cancer.

The regulatory loops induced by the MAPK pathway are dependent on TSC2 but demonstrate a lesser dependence on p70S6K than the previously identified FRAP1 feedback loop. The siRNA screen also revealed novel bi-directionality in the AKT and GSK3 interaction, whereby genetic ablation of GSK3 significantly blocks AKT phosphorylation, an unexpected observation as GSK3 has only been predicted to be downstream of AKT.

Of 572 kinases individually silenced in combination with Ara-C, silencing of 10 (1.7%) and 8 (1.4%) kinases strongly increased Ara-C activity in TF-1 and THP-1 cells, respectively. The strongest molecular concepts emerged around kinases involved in cell-cycle checkpoints and DNA-damage repair. In confirmatory siRNA assays, inhibition of WEE1 resulted in more potent and universal sensitization across myeloid cell lines than siRNA inhibition of PKMYT1, CHEK1, or ATR. Treatment of 8 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines with commercial and the first-in-class clinical WEE1 kinase inhibitor MK1775 confirmed sensitization to Ara-C up to 97-fold. Ex vivo, adding MK1775 substantially reduced viability in 13 of 14 AML, CML, and myelodysplastic syndrome patient samples compared with Ara-C alone. Maximum sensitization occurred at lower to moderate concentrations of both drugs. Induction of apoptosis was increased using a combination of Ara-C and MK1775 compared with using either drug alone.

Specialized sugar kinases that are indispensable for most of these pathways can be utilized as signature enzymes for the reconstruction of carbohydrate utilization machinery from microbial genomic and metagenomic data. Sugar kinases occur in several structurally distinct families with various partially overlapping as well as yet unknown substrate specificities that often cannot be accurately assigned by homology-based techniques. A subsystems-based metabolic reconstruction combined with the analysis of genome context and followed by experimental testing of predicted gene functions is a powerful approach of functional gene annotation. Here we applied this integrated approach for functional mapping of all sugar kinases constituting an extensive and diverse sugar kinome in the thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima. Substrate preferences of 14 kinases mainly from the FGGY and PfkB families were inferred by bioinformatics analysis and biochemically characterized by screening with a panel of 45 different carbohydrates. Most of the analyzed enzymes displayed narrow substrate preferences corresponding to their predicted physiological roles in their respective catabolic pathways. The observed consistency supports the choice of kinases as signature enzymes for genomics-based identification and reconstruction of sugar utilization pathways. Use of the integrated genomic and experimental approach greatly speeds up the identification of the biochemical function of unknown proteins and improves the quality of reconstructed pathways.",

At the same time Arabidopsis is a model plant with high frequencies of gene duplications. Here, we have conducted a systematic analysis of the Arabidopsis kinase complement, the kinome, with particular focus on gene duplication events. We matched Arabidopsis proteins to a Hidden-Markov Model of eukaryotic kinases and computed a phylogeny of 942 Arabidopsis protein kinase domains and mapped their origin by gene duplication. RESULTS The phylogeny showed two major clades of receptor kinases and soluble kinases, each of which was divided into functional subclades. Based on this phylogeny, association of yet uncharacterized kinases to families was possible which extended functional annotation of unknowns. Classification of gene duplications within these protein kinases revealed that representatives of cytosolic subfamilies showed a tendency to maintain segmentally duplicated genes, while some subfamilies of the receptor kinases were enriched for tandem duplicates. Although functional diversification is observed throughout most subfamilies, some instances of functional conservation among genes transposed from the same ancestor were observed. In general, a significant enrichment of essential genes was found among genes encoding for protein kinases. CONCLUSIONS The inferred phylogeny allowed classification and annotation of yet uncharacterized kinases. The prediction and analysis of syntenic blocks and duplication events within gene families of interest can be used to link functional biology to insights from an evolutionary viewpoint. The approach undertaken here can be applied to any gene family in any organism with an annotated genome.",

This screening platform has captured multiple novel contributions of diverse protein kinases to modulation of EGFR signal generation, signal amplitude and signal duration. As examples, the prometastatic SNF1/AMPK related kinase HUNK was found to support EGFR activation in response to ligand binding, while the enigmatic kinase MGC16169 selectively supports coupling of active EGFR to ERK1/2 regulation.

Large data sets on inhibitor potency and selectivity for more than 400 human kinases became available recently, offering the opportunity to design rationally novel kinase-based anti-cancer therapies. However, the expression levels and activities of kinases are highly heterogeneous among different types of cancer and even among different stages of the same cancer. The lack of effective strategy for profiling the global kinome hampers the development of kinase-targeted cancer chemotherapy. Here, we introduced a novel global kinome profiling method, based on our recently developed isotope-coded ATP-affinity probe and a targeted proteomic method using multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM), for assessing simultaneously the expression of more than 300 kinases in human cells and tissues. This MRM-based assay displayed much better sensitivity, reproducibility and accuracy than the discovery-based shotgun proteomic method. Approximately 250 kinases could be routinely detected in the lysate of a single cell line. Additionally, the incorporation of iRT into MRM kinome library rendered our MRM kinome assay easily transferrable across different instrument platforms and laboratories. We further employed this approach for profiling kinase expression in two melanoma cell lines, which revealed substantial kinome reprogramming during cancer progression and demonstrated an excellent correlation between the anti-proliferative effects of kinase inhibitors and the expression levels of their target kinases. Therefore, this facile and accurate kinome profiling assay, together with the kinome-inhibitor interaction map, could provide invaluable knowledge to predict the effectiveness of kinase inhibitor drugs and offer the opportunity for individualized cancer chemotherapy.",

Although the genomes of many plant pathogenic fungi have been sequenced, systematic characterization of their kinomes has not been reported. The wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum has 116 protein kinases (PK) genes. Although twenty of them appeared to be essential, we generated deletion mutants for the other 96 PK genes, including 12 orthologs of essential genes in yeast. All of the PK mutants were assayed for changes in 17 phenotypes, including growth, conidiation, pathogenesis, stress responses, and sexual reproduction. Overall, deletion of 64 PK genes resulted in at least one of the phenotypes examined, including three mutants blocked in conidiation and five mutants with increased tolerance to hyperosmotic stress. In total, 42 PK mutants were significantly reduced in virulence or non-pathogenic, including mutants deleted of key components of the cAMP signaling and three MAPK pathways. A number of these PK genes, including Fg03146 and Fg04770 that are unique to filamentous fungi, are dispensable for hyphal growth and likely encode novel fungal virulence factors. Ascospores play a critical role in the initiation of wheat scab. Twenty-six PK mutants were blocked in perithecia formation or aborted in ascosporogenesis. Additional 19 mutants were defective in ascospore release or morphology. Interestingly, F. graminearum contains two aurora kinase genes with distinct functions, which has not been reported in fungi. In addition, we used the interlog approach to predict the PK-PK and PK-protein interaction networks of F. graminearum. Several predicted interactions were verified with yeast two-hybrid or co-immunoprecipitation assays. To our knowledge, this is the first functional characterization of the kinome in plant pathogenic fungi.

The heterogeneity of induced kinases prevents their targeting by a single kinase inhibitor, underscoring the challenge of predicting effective kinase inhibitor combination therapies. We hypothesized that, to make the tumor response to single kinase inhibitors durable, the adaptive kinome response itself must be inhibited. Genetic and chemical inhibition of BET bromodomain chromatin readers suppresses transcription ofmany lapatinib-induced kinases involved in resistance, including ERBB3, IGF1R, DDR1, MET, and FGFRs, preventing downstream SRC/FAK signaling and AKT reactivation.

        "abstract": "Kinome microarrays are comprised of peptides that act as phosphorylation targets for protein kinases. This platform is growing in popularity due to its ability to measure phosphorylation-mediated cellular signaling in a high-throughput manner. While software for analyzing data from DNA microarrays has also been used for kinome arrays, differences between the two technologies and associated biologies previously led us to develop Platform for Intelligent, Integrated Kinome Analysis (PIIKA), a software tool customized for the analysis of data from kinome arrays. Here, we report the development of PIIKA 2, a significantly improved version with new features and improvements in the areas of clustering, statistical analysis, and data visualization. Among other additions to the original PIIKA, PIIKA 2 now allows the user to: evaluate statistically how well groups of samples cluster together; identify sets of peptides that have consistent phosphorylation patterns among groups of samples; perform hierarchical clustering analysis with bootstrapping; view false negative probabilities and positive and negative predictive values for t-tests between pairs of samples; easily assess experimental reproducibility; and visualize the data using volcano plots, scatterplots, and interactive three-dimensional principal component analyses. Also new in PIIKA 2 is a web-based interface, which allows users unfamiliar with command-line tools to easily provide input and download the results. Collectively, the additions and improvements described here enhance both the breadth and depth of analyses available, simplify the user interface, and make the software an even more valuable tool for the analysis of kinome microarray data. Both the web-based and stand-alone versions of PIIKA 2 can be accessed via http://saphire.usask.ca.",

Our approach considers both receptor-based similarity constraints in cocomplexes and ligand-based filtering/refinement methods to generate novel, drug-like matter. After building a comprehensive database of the structural kinome and identifying ATP-competitive ligands, we leverage local site similarities and site alignments to shuffle ligand fragments across the kinome. After extensive curation and standardization, our automated protocol starting from 936 cocrystal ATP-competitive binding sites generated about 150,000 new ligand structures among them over 26,000 lead-/drug-like compounds; the majority of those are novel based on structural similarity and scaffolds. In a retrospective analysis we demonstrate that our protocol produced known potent kinase inhibitors and we show how docking can be applied to prioritize the most likely efficacious compounds. Our workflow emulates a common strategy in medicinal chemistry to identify and swap corresponding moieties from known inhibitors to generate novel and potent leads.

Here, we report a kinome-wide RNAi-based analysis to identify kinases that regulate somatic cell reprogramming to iPSCs. We prepared 3,686 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviruses targeting 734 kinase genes covering the entire mouse kinome and individually examined their effects on iPSC generation. We identified 59 kinases as barriers to iPSC generation and characterized seven of them further. We found that shRNA-mediated knockdown of the serine/threonine kinases TESK1 or LIMK2 promoted mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, decreased COFILIN phosphorylation, and disrupted Actin filament structures during reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Similarly, knockdown of TESK1 in human fibroblasts also promoted reprogramming to iPSCs.

Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we assessed kinome activity in response to MEK inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and genetically engineered mice (GEMMs). MEK inhibition caused acute ERK activity loss, resulting in rapid c-Myc degradation that induced expression and activation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). RNAi knockdown of ERK or c-Myc mimicked RTK induction by MEK inhibitors, and prevention of proteasomal c-Myc degradation blocked kinome reprogramming. MEK inhibitor-induced RTK stimulation overcame MEK2 inhibition, but not MEK1 inhibition, reactivating ERK and producing drug resistance. The C3Tag GEMM for TNBC similarly induced RTKs in response to MEK inhibition. The inhibitor-induced RTK profile suggested a kinase inhibitor combination therapy that produced GEMM tumor apoptosis and regression where single agents were ineffective. This approach defines mechanisms of drug resistance, allowing rational design of combination therapies for cancer. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

However, functional information for roughly half the human kinome is lacking. We conducted three kinome wide, >90%, RNAi screens and epistasis testing of some identified kinases against known intramuscular signalling systems to increase the functional annotation of the C. elegans kinome and expand our understanding of kinome influence upon muscle protein degradation.\\n\\nRESULTS: 96 kinases were identified as required for normal protein homeostasis, 74 for normal mitochondrial networks and 50 for normal sarcomere structure. Knockdown of kinases required only for normal protein homeostasis and/or mitochondrial structure was significantly less likely to produce a developmental or behavioural phenotype than knockdown of kinases required for normal sarcomere structure and/or other sub-cellular processes. Lastly, assessment of kinases for which knockdown produced muscle protein degradation against the known regulatory pathways in C. elegans muscle revealed that close to half of kinase knockdowns activated autophagy in a MAPK dependent fashion.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Roughly 40% of kinases studied, 159 of 397, are important in establishing or maintaining muscle cell health, with most required for both. For kinases where decreased expression triggers protein degradation, autophagy is most commonly activated. These results increase the annotation of the C. elegans kinome to roughly 75% and enable future kinome research. As 33% of kinases identified have orthologues expressed in human muscle, our results also enable testing of whether identified kinases function similarly in maintaining human muscle homeostasis.",

        "abstract": "Cancer cells are dependent on protein kinase signalling networks to drive proliferation and to promote survival, and, accordingly, kinases continue to represent a major target class for development of anti-cancer therapeutics. Kinase inhibitors nevertheless have yielded only limited success with many different malignancies due to the inability of single agents to sustain a durable clinical response. Cancer cell kinomes are highly resilient and able to bypass targeted kinase inhibition, leading to tumour resistance. A novel platform has been developed to analyse the activity of the expressed kinome using MIBs (multiplexed inhibitor beads), which consist of Sepharose beads with covalently immobilized inhibitors that preferentially bind activated kinases. Coupling MIB capture with MS (MIB-MS) allows simultaneous determination of the activity of over 75% of the expressed kinome, facilitating high-throughput assessment of adaptive kinase responses resulting from deregulated feedback and feedforward regulatory mechanisms. The adaptive response frequently involves transcriptional up-regulation of specific kinases that allow bypass of the targeted kinase. Understanding how the kinome reprogrammes to targeted kinase inhibition will allow novel therapeutic strategies to be developed for durable clinical responses.",

Here, we desired to increase the throughput for kinome-wide profiling. A new workflow coupling ActivX ATP probe (AAP) affinity reagents with isotopic labeling to quantify the relative levels and modification states of kinases in cell lysates is described. We compared the new workflow to a classical proteomics approach in which fractionation was used to identify low-abundance kinases. We find that AAPs enriched approximately 90 kinases in a single analysis involving six cell lines or states in a single run, an 8-fold improvement in throughput relative to the classical approach. In general, AAPs cross-linked to both the active and inactive states of kinases but performing phosphopeptide enrichment made it possible to measure the phospho sites of regulatory residues lying in the kinase activation loops, providing information on activation state. When we compared the kinome across the six cell lines, representative of different breast cancer clinical subtypes, we observed that many kinases, particularly receptor tyrosine kinases, varied widely in abundance, perhaps explaining the differential sensitivities to kinase inhibitor drugs. The improved kinome profiling methods described here represent an effective means to perform systematic analysis of kinases involved in cell signaling and oncogenic transformation and for analyzing the effect of different inhibitory drugs.",

Comparison with published kinomes and those of the excavates Trichomonas vaginalis and Leishmania major shows that Giardia's 80 core kinases constitute the smallest known core kinome of any eukaryote that can be grown in pure culture, reflecting both its early origin and secondary gene loss. Kinase losses in DNA repair, mitochondrial function, transcription, splicing, and stress response reflect this reduced genome, while the presence of other kinases helps define the kinome of the last common eukaryotic ancestor. Immunofluorescence analysis shows abundant phospho-staining in trophozoites, with phosphotyrosine abundant in the nuclei and phosphothreonine and phosphoserine in distinct cytoskeletal organelles. The Nek kinase family has been massively expanded, accounting for 198 of the 278 protein kinases in Giardia. Most Neks are catalytically inactive, have very divergent sequences and undergo extensive duplication and loss between strains. Many Neks are highly induced during development. We localized four catalytically active Neks to distinct parts of the cytoskeleton and one inactive Nek to the cytoplasm.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The reduced kinome of Giardia sheds new light on early kinase evolution, and its highly divergent sequences add to the definition of individual kinase families as well as offering specific drug targets. Giardia's massive Nek expansion may reflect its distinctive lifestyle, biphasic life cycle and complex cytoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "Signaling by tyrosine kinases play a major role in mammalian signal transduction and is a major component of nearly every major disease type. However, a systematic understanding of signaling pathways has remained elusive. While a number of techniques have been developed to map signaling pathways, used alone they only provide insight into one facet of signaling. We will use an integrative approach to chart the networks which control tyrosine kinase signaling at multiple levels through the use of complementary physical and genetic interaction mapping approaches. These maps will lead to network models which reflect proteins that can functionally modulate signaling and are physically associated with kinases including substrates, adaptors and regulatory subunits. To achieve this, the proposal integrates the complementary expertise of investigators at the University of California-San Francisco in high-throughput physical and genetic interaction mapping (Krogan), chemical-genetic approaches for tracing signaling pathways (Shokat) and network analysis and data integration (Bandyopadhyay). We aim to identify proteins that associate with tyrosine kinases through affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and kinase substrates through covalent capture-and-release in Aim 1. These data will be further characterized using a newly developed platform for quantitative genetic interaction mapping in mammalian cells, which will establish the functional relevance of these interactions by systematically identifying epistatic genetic relationships between kinases and associated proteins in Aim 2. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will unify data collected in the first two aims using network modeling to uncover detailed, mechanistic biological insights relating to mammalian tyrosine kinases. All data (raw, processed and integrated) will be made immediately available in an interactive and searchable methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

However, our analysis of 626 prokaryotic genomes reveals that eukaryotic-like protein kinases (ELKs) are found in nearly two-thirds of the sequenced strains. We have identified 2697 ELKs, most of which are encoded by multicellular strains of the phyla Proteobacteria (Myxococcales), Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Chloroflexi, and 2 Acidobacteria and 1 Planctomycetes. Astonishingly, 7 myxobacterial strains together encode 892 ELKs, with 4 of the strains exhibiting a genomic ELK density similar to that observed in eukaryotes. Most myxobacterial ELKs show a modular organization in which the kinase domain is located at the N terminus. The C-terminal portion of the ELKs is highly diverse and often contains sequences with similarity to characterized domains, most of them involved in signaling mechanisms or in protein-protein interactions. However, many of these architectures are unique to the myxobacteria, an observation that suggests that this group exploits sophisticated and novel signal transduction systems. Phylogenetic reconstruction using the kinase domains revealed many orthologous sequence pairs and a huge number of gene duplications that probably occurred after speciation. Furthermore, studies of the microsynteny in the ELK-encoding regions reveal only low levels of synteny among Myxococcus xanthus, Plesiocystis pacifica, and Sorangium cellulosum. However, extensive similarities between M. xanthus, Stigmatella aurantiaca, and 3 Anaeromyxobacter strains were observed, indicating that they share regulatory pathways involving various ELKs.",

Furthermore, recent studies showed that altered regulation of protein kinases is important for Treg function. These data indicate that signaling pathways in Tregs are distinctly organized and alterations at the level of protein kinases contribute to the unique Treg phenotype. However, kinase-based signaling networks in Tregs are poorly understood and necessitate further systematic characterization. In this study, we analyzed the differential expression of kinases in Tregs and Teffs by using a kinase-selective proteome strategy. In total, we revealed quantitative information on 185 kinases expressed in the human CD4(+) T cell subsets. The majority of kinases was equally abundant in both T cell subsets, but 11 kinases were differentially expressed in Tregs. Most strikingly, Tregs showed an altered expression of cell cycle kinases including CDK6. Quantitative proteomics generates first comparative insight into the kinase complements of the CD4(+) Teff and Treg subset. Treg-specific expression pattern of 11 protein kinases substantiate the current opinion that TCR-mediated signaling cascades are altered in Tregs and further suggests that Tregs exhibit significant specificities in cell-cycle control and progression.",

We performed massive parallel assessment of kinase signatures of the radiations of the hematopoietic system, including long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC), short-term repopulating HSC (ST-HSC), immature natural killer (iNK) cells, NK cells, B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells. The LT-HSC kinome is characterized by noncanonical Wnt, Ca(2+) and classical protein kinase C (PKC)-driven signaling, which is lost upon the transition to ST-HSC, whose kinome signature prominently features receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation of the Ras/MAPK signaling cassette. Further differentiation to iNK maintains signaling through this cassette but simultaneously leads to activation of a PI3K/PKB/Rac signaling, which becomes the dominant trait in the kinase signature following full differentiation toward NK cells. Differentiation along the myeloid and B cell lineages is accompanied by hyperactivation of both the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/PKB/Rac signaling cassette. T cells, however, deactivate signaling and only display residual G protein-coupled pathways. Thus, differentiation along the hematopoietic lineage is associated with major remodelling of cellular kinase signature.",

Because current targeted therapies are biased toward a small subset of tyrosine kinases, we conducted a study to reveal novel therapeutic targets for thyroid cancer using a bead-based, high-throughput system.Methods: Thyroid tumors and matched normal tissues were harvested from twenty-six patients in the operating room. Protein lysates were analyzed using the Luminex immunosandwich, a bead-based kinase phosphorylation assay. Data was analyzed using GenePattern 3.0 software and clustered according to histology, demographic factors, and tumor status regarding capsular invasion, size, lymphovascular invasion, and extrathyroidal extension. Survival and invasion assays were performed to determine the effect of Src inhibition in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cells.Results: Tyrosine kinome profiling demonstrated upregulation of nine tyrosine kinases in tumors relative to matched normal thyroid tissue: EGFR, PTK6, BTK, HCK, ABL1, TNK1, GRB2, ERK, and SRC. Supervised clustering of well-differentiated tumors by histology, gender, age, or size did not reveal significant differences in tyrosine kinase activity. However, supervised clustering by the presence of invasive disease showed increased Src activity in invasive tumors relative to non-invasive tumors (60% v. 0%, p< 0.05). In vitro, we found that Src inhibition in PTC cells decreased cell invasion and proliferation.Conclusion: Global kinome analysis enables the discovery of novel targets for thyroid cancer therapy. Further investigation of Src targeted therapy for advanced thyroid cancer is warranted. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, maintains an integral link between cell cycle regulation and differentiation during its intricate life cycle. Whilst extensive changes in phosphorylation have been documented between the mammalian bloodstream form and the insect procyclic form, relatively little is known about the parasite's protein kinases (PKs) involved in the control of cellular proliferation and differentiation. To address this, a T. brucei kinome-wide RNAi cell line library was generated, allowing independent inducible knockdown of each of the parasite's 190 predicted protein kinases. Screening of this library using a cell viability assay identified >/=42 PKs that are required for normal bloodstream form proliferation in culture. A secondary screen identified 24 PKs whose RNAi-mediated depletion resulted in a variety of cell cycle defects including in G1/S, kinetoplast replication/segregation, mitosis and cytokinesis, 15 of which are novel cell cycle regulators. A further screen identified for the first time two PKs, named repressor of differentiation kinase (RDK1 and RDK2), depletion of which promoted bloodstream to procyclic form differentiation. RDK1 is a membrane-associated STE11-like PK, whilst RDK2 is a NEK PK that is essential for parasite proliferation. RDK1 acts in conjunction with the PTP1/PIP39 phosphatase cascade to block uncontrolled bloodstream to procyclic form differentiation, whilst RDK2 is a PK whose depletion efficiently induces differentiation in the absence of known triggers. Thus, the RNAi kinome library provides a valuable asset for functional analysis of cell signalling pathways in African trypanosomes as well as drug target identification and validation.",

We then applied the best classifiers to compounds most recently profiled in the NIH Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program and found good agreement of profiling results with predicted activities.

Standard factors governing ligand affinity, such as potential for intermolecular hydrophobic interactions or for intermolecular hydrogen bonding do not provide good markers to assess cross reactivity. Thus, a core question in the informatics of drug design is what type of molecular similarity among targets promotes promiscuity and what type of molecular difference governs specificity. This work answers the question for a sizable screened sample of the human pharmacokinome including targets with unreported structure.\\n\\nRESULTS: We show that drug design aimed at promoting pairwise interactions between ligand and kinase target actually fosters promiscuity because of the high conservation of the partner groups on or around the ATP-binding site of the kinase. Alternatively, we focus on a structural marker that may be reliably determined from sequence and measures dehydration propensities mostly localized on the loopy regions of kinases. Based on this marker, we construct a sequence-based kinase classifier that enables the accurate prediction of pharmacological differences. Our indicator is a microenvironmental descriptor that quantifies the propensity for water exclusion around preformed polar pairs. The results suggest that targeting polar dehydration patterns heralds a new generation of drugs that enable a tighter control of specificity than designs aimed at promoting ligand-kinase pairwise interactions.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY: The predictor of polar hot spots for dehydration propensity, or solvent-accessible hydrogen bonds in soluble proteins, named YAPView, may be freely downloaded from the University of Chicago website http://protlib.uchicago.edu/dloads.html.\\n\\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Activity of kinases was verified using immunoblot, and active Src- and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling were further explored using imatinib and dasatinib on chondrosarcoma in vitro.

PDGFR and Src kinases can be inhibited by imatinib and dasatinib, respectively.

However, inhibition of phosphorylated Src (Y419) was found both in responsive and nonresponsive cells. In conclusion, using kinome profiling, we found the Src pathway to be active in chondrosarcoma.

By employing a scheduled multiple-reaction monitoring analysis in conjunction with isotope-coded ATP affinity probes, we assessed the global kinome of radioresistant MCF-7/C6 cells and their parental MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. We rigorously quantified 120 kinases, of which (1)/3 exhibited significant differences in expression levels or ATP binding affinities. Several kinases involved in cell cycle progression and DNA damage response were found to be overexpressed or hyperactivated, including checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2 (CDK1 and CDK2), and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase. The elevated expression of CHK1, CDK1, and CDK2 in MCF-7/C6 cells was further validated by Western blot analysis. Thus, the altered kinome profile of radioresistant MCF-7/C6 cells suggests the involvement of kinases on cell cycle progression and DNA repair in tumor adaptive radioresistance.

Stimulation of the Fc receptor CD16 alone is sufficient for NK cell activation, whereas other receptors, such as 2B4 (CD244) and DNAM-1 (CD226), act synergistically. After receptor engagement, protein kinases play a major role in signaling networks controlling NK cell effector functions. However, it has not been characterized systematically which of all kinases encoded by the human genome (kinome) are involved in NK cell activation. RESULTS: A kinase-selective phosphoproteome approach enabled the determination of 188 kinases expressed in human NK cells. Crosslinking of CD16 as well as 2B4 and DNAM-1 revealed a total of 313 distinct kinase phosphorylation sites on 109 different kinases. Phosphorylation sites on 21 kinases were similarly regulated after engagement of either CD16 or co-engagement of 2B4 and DNAM-1. Among those, increased phosphorylation of FYN, KCC2G (CAMK2), FES, and AAK1, as well as the reduced phosphorylation of MARK2, were reproducibly observed both after engagement of CD16 and co-engagement of 2B4 and DNAM-1. Notably, only one phosphorylation on PAK4 was differentally regulated. CONCLUSIONS: The present study has identified a significant portion of the NK cell kinome and defined novel phosphorylation sites in primary lymphocytes. Regulated phosphorylations observed in the early phase of NK cell activation imply these kinases are involved in NK cell signaling. Taken together, this study suggests a largely shared signaling pathway downstream of distinct activation receptors and constitutes a valuable resource for further elucidating the regulation of NK cell effector responses.",

Large-scale CTx-0294885-based affinity purification followed by LC-MS/MS led to the identification of 235 protein kinases from MDA-MB-231 cells, including all members of the AKT family that had not been previously detected by other broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors.

Coupling phosphopeptide enrichment with affinity purification using the four inhibitors enabled the identification of 799 high-confidence phosphosites on 183 kinases, \u223c10% of which were localized to the activation loop, and included previously unreported phosphosites on BMP2K, MELK, HIPK2, and PRKDC. Therefore, CTx-0294885 represents a powerful new reagent for analysis of kinome signaling networks that may facilitate development of targeted therapeutic strategies. Proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium ( http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org ) via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD000239.",

Despite the vast extent of the phosphoproteome within the cell, connecting specific kinases with relevant targets remains a significant experimental frontier. The challenge of linking kinases and their substrates reflects the complexity of kinase function. For example, kinases tend to exert their biological effects through supernumerary, redundant phosphorylation, often on multiple protein complex components. Although these types of phosphorylation events are biologically significant, those kinases responsible are often difficult to identify. Recent methods for global analysis of protein phosphorylation promise to substantially accelerate efforts to map the dynamic phosphorylome.

To overcome these limitations, we developed a capture enrichment strategy to enable high-throughput transcript sequencing of the human kinome. This approach provides a global overview of kinase fusion events, irrespective of the identity of the fusion partner.

To identify genes essential for poxvirus infection, we used high-throughput RNA interference to screen the Drosophila kinome for factors required for vaccinia infection. We identified seven genes including the three subunits of AMPK as promoting vaccinia infection. AMPK not only facilitated infection in insect cells, but also in mammalian cells. Moreover, we found that AMPK is required for macropinocytosis, a major endocytic entry pathway for vaccinia. Furthermore, we show that AMPK contributes to other virus-independent actin-dependent processes including lamellipodia formation and wound healing, independent of the known AMPK activators LKB1 and CaMKK. Therefore, AMPK plays a highly conserved role in poxvirus infection and actin dynamics independent of its role as an energy regulator.",

DYRK2 directly phosphorylated and induced the proteasome-dependent degradation of the key Hh pathway-regulated transcription factor, GLI2.

        "abstract": "Protein kinases play key roles in oncogenic signaling and are a major focus in the development of targeted cancer therapies. Imatinib, a BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a successful front-line treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, resistance to imatinib may be acquired by BCR-Abl mutations or hyperactivation of Src family kinases such as Lyn. We have used multiplexed kinase inhibitor beads (MIBs) and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to compare kinase expression and activity in an imatinib-resistant (MYL-R) and -sensitive (MYL) cell model of CML. Using MIB/MS, expression and activity changes of over 150 kinases were quantitatively measured from various protein kinase families. Statistical analysis of experimental replicates assigned significance to 35 of these kinases, referred to as the MYL-R kinome profile. MIB/MS and immunoblotting confirmed the over-expression and activation of Lyn in MYL-R cells and identified additional kinases with increased (MEK, ERK, IKK\u03b1, PKC\u03b2, NEK9) or decreased (Abl, Kit, JNK, ATM, Yes) abundance or activity. Inhibiting Lyn with dasatinib or by shRNA-mediated knockdown reduced the phosphorylation of MEK and IKK\u03b1. Because MYL-R cells showed elevated NF-\u03baB signaling relative to MYL cells, as demonstrated by increased I\u03baB\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA expression, we tested the effects of an IKK inhibitor (BAY 65-1942). MIB/MS and immunoblotting revealed that BAY 65-1942 increased MEK/ERK signaling and that this increase was prevented by co-treatment with a MEK inhibitor (AZD6244). Furthermore, the combined inhibition of MEK and IKK\u03b1 resulted in reduced IL-6 mRNA expression, synergistic loss of cell viability and increased apoptosis. Thus, MIB/MS analysis identified MEK and IKK\u03b1 as important downstream targets of Lyn, suggesting that co-targeting these kinases may provide a unique strategy to inhibit Lyn-dependent imatinib-resistant CML. These results demonstrate the utility of MIB/MS as a tool to identify dysregulated kinases and to interrogate kinome dynamics as cells respond to targeted kinase inhibition.",

We aimed to define the cardiomyocyte kinome (i.e. the protein kinases expressed in cardiomyocytes) and identify kinases with altered expression in human failing hearts.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Expression profiling (Affymetrix microarrays) detected >400 protein kinase mRNAs in rat neonatal ventricular myocytes (NVMs) and/or adult ventricular myocytes (AVMs), 32 and 93 of which were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated (greater than two-fold), respectively, in AVMs. Data for AGC family members were validated by qPCR. Proteomics analysis identified >180 cardiomyocyte protein kinases, with high relative expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and other known cardiomyocyte kinases (e.g. CAMKs, cAMP-dependent protein kinase). Other kinases are poorly investigated (e.g. Slk, Stk24, Oxsr1). Expression of Akt1/2/3, BRaf, ERK1/2, Map2k1, Map3k8, Map4k4, MST1/3, p38-MAPK, PKC\u03b4, Pkn2, Ripk1/2, Tnni3k, and Zak was confirmed by immunoblotting. Relative to total protein, Map3k8 and Tnni3k were up-regulated in AVMs vs. NVMs. Microarray data for human hearts demonstrated variation in kinome expression that may influence responses to kinase inhibitor therapies. Furthermore, some kinases were up-regulated (e.g. NRK, JAK2, STK38L) or down-regulated (e.g. MAP2K1, IRAK1, STK40) in human failing hearts.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This characterization of the spectrum of kinases expressed in cardiomyocytes and the heart (cardiomyocyte and cardiac kinomes) identified novel kinases, some of which are differentially expressed in failing human hearts and could serve as potential therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "Reliable in silico prediction methods promise many advantages over experimental high-throughput screening (HTS): vastly lower time and cost, affinity magnitude estimates, no requirement for a physical sample, and a knowledge-driven exploration of chemical space. For the specific case of kinases, given several hundred experimental IC(50) training measurements, the empirically parametrized profile-quantitative structure-activity relationship (profile-QSAR) and surrogate AutoShim methods developed at Novartis can predict IC(50) with a reliability approaching experimental HTS. However, in the absence of training data, prediction is much harder. The most common a priori prediction method is docking, which suffers from many limitations: It requires a protein structure, is slow, and cannot predict affinity. (1) Highly accurate profile-QSAR (2) models have now been built for roughly 100 kinases covering most of the kinome. Analyzing correlations among neighboring kinases shows that near neighbors share a high degree of SAR similarity. The novel chemogenomic kinase-kernel method reported here predicts activity for new kinases as a weighted average of predicted activities from profile-QSAR models for nearby neighbor kinases. Three different factors for weighting the neighbors were evaluated: binding site sequence identity to the kinase neighbors, similarity of the training set for each neighbor model to the compound being predicted, and accuracy of each neighbor model. Binding site sequence identity was by far most important, followed by chemical similarity. Model quality had almost no relevance. The median R(2) = 0.55 for kinase-kernel interpolations on 25% of the data of each set held out from method optimization for 51 kinase assays, approached the accuracy of median R(2) = 0.61 for the trained profile-QSAR predictions on the same held out 25% data of each set, far faster and far more accurate than docking. Validation on the full data sets from 18 additional kinase assays not part of method optimization studies also showed strong performance with median R(2) = 0.48. Genetic algorithm optimization of the binding site residues used to compute binding site sequence identity identified 16 privileged residues from a larger set of 46. These 16 are consistent with the kinase selectivity literature and structural biology, further supporting the scientific validity of the approach. A priori kinase-kernel predictions for 4 million compounds were interpolated from 51 existing profile-QSAR models for the remaining >400 novel kinases, totaling 2 billion activity predictions covering the entire kinome. The method has been successfully applied in two therapeutic projects to generate predictions and select compounds for activity testing.",

M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infects the gastrointestinal tract of calves, localizing and persisting primarily in the distal ileum. A high percentage of cattle exposed to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis do not develop JD, but the mechanisms by which they resist infection are not understood. Here, we merge an established in vivo bovine intestinal segment model for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection with bovine-specific peptide kinome arrays as a first step to understanding how infection influences host kinomic responses at the site of infection. Application of peptide arrays to in vivo tissue samples represents a critical and ambitious step in using this technology to understand host-pathogen interactions. Kinome analysis was performed on intestinal samples from 4 ileal segments subdivided into 10 separate compartments (6 M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected compartments and 4 intra-animal controls) using bovine-specific peptide arrays. Kinome data sets clustered into two groups, suggesting unique binary responses to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Similarly, two M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-specific immune responses, characterized by different antibody, T cell proliferation, and gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) responses, were also observed. Interestingly, the kinomic groupings segregated with the immune response groupings. Pathway and gene ontology analyses revealed that differences in innate immune and interleukin signaling and particular differences in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway distinguished the kinomic groupings. Collectively, kinome analysis of tissue samples offers insight into the complex cellular responses induced by M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in the ileum and provides a novel method to understand mechanisms that alter the balance between cell-mediated and antibody responses to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection.",

Especially jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) are well known defense-inducing hormones. Here, the effects of MeJA and SA on the Arabidopsis thaliana kinome were monitored using PepChip arrays containing kinase substrate peptides to analyze posttranslational interactions in MeJA and SA signaling pathways and to test if kinome profiling can provide leads to predict posttranslational events in plant signaling. MeJA and SA mediate differential phosphorylation of substrates for many kinase families. Also some plant specific substrates were differentially phosphorylated, including peptides derived from Phytochrome A, and Photosystem II D protein. This indicates that MeJA and SA mediate cross-talk between defense signaling and light responses. We tested the predicted effects of MeJA and SA using light-mediated upward leaf movement (differential petiole growth also called hyponastic growth). We found that MeJA, infestation by the JA-inducing insect herbivore Pieris rapae, and SA suppressed low light-induced hyponastic growth. MeJA and SA acted in a synergistic fashion via two (partially) divergent signaling routes.

To investigate how host cell signal transduction pathways affect hepatocyte infection, we used RNAi to systematically test the entire kinome and associated genes in human Huh7 hepatoma cells for their potential roles during infection by P. berghei sporozoites. The three-phase screen covered 727 genes, which were tested with a total of 2,307 individual siRNAs using an automated microscopy assay to quantify infection rates and qRT-PCR to assess silencing levels. Five protein kinases thereby emerged as top hits, all of which caused significant reductions in infection when silenced by RNAi. Follow-up validation experiments on one of these hits, PKCsigma (PKCzeta), confirmed the physiological relevance of our findings by reproducing the inhibitory effect on P. berghei infection in adult mice treated systemically with liposome-formulated PKCsigma-targeting siRNAs. Additional cell-based analyses using a pseudo-substrate inhibitor of PKCsigma added further RNAi-independent support, indicating a role for host PKCsigma on the invasion of hepatocytes by sporozoites.

Clinical resistance to kinase inhibitors is an evident in all tyrosine kinase-driven malignancies, where high rates of mutation drive tumor evolution toward the insidious drug-resistant (DR) state through a variety of mechanisms. Unfortunately, this problem is likely to intensify in the future as the number of target kinases, approved inhibitors, and clinical indications increase. To empower the analysis of resistance in kinases, we have validated a bioinformatic, structural, and cellular workflow for designing and evaluating resistance at key mutational hotspots among kinome members.

In an effort to identify therapeutic targets for this disease, we performed a comprehensive loss-of-function screen of the protein kinome. Thirty kinases showed significant cellular cytotoxicity when depleted, with loss of the cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1/CHEK1) being the most potent. CHK1 mRNA expression was higher in MYC-Neuroblastoma-related (MYCN)-amplified (P < 0.0001) and high-risk (P = 0.03) tumors. Western blotting revealed that CHK1 was constitutively phosphorylated at the ataxia telangiectasia response kinase target site Ser345 and the autophosphorylation site Ser296 in neuroblastoma cell lines. This pattern was also seen in six of eight high-risk primary tumors but not in control nonneuroblastoma cell lines or in seven of eight low-risk primary tumors. Neuroblastoma cells were sensitive to the two CHK1 inhibitors SB21807 and TCS2312, with median IC(50) values of 564 nM and 548 nM, respectively. In contrast, the control lines had high micromolar IC(50) values, indicating a strong correlation between CHK1 phosphorylation and CHK1 inhibitor sensitivity (P = 0.0004). Furthermore, cell cycle analysis revealed that CHK1 inhibition in neuroblastoma cells caused apoptosis during S-phase, consistent with its role in replication fork progression. CHK1 inhibitor sensitivity correlated with total MYC(N) protein levels, and inducing MYCN in retinal pigmented epithelial cells resulted in CHK1 phosphorylation, which caused growth inhibition when inhibited. These data show the power of a functional RNAi screen to identify tractable therapeutical targets in neuroblastoma and support CHK1 inhibition strategies in this disease.",

Furthermore analysis of the signals obtained suggested activation of p21Ras by lipopolysaccharide, and this was confirmed by direct measurement of p21Ras GTP levels in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which represents the first direct demonstration of p21Ras activation by stimulation of a Toll receptor family member. Further confidence in the usefulness of peptide array technology for studying signal transduction came from Western blot analysis of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells, which corroborated the signals obtained using peptide arrays as well as from the demonstration that kinase inhibitors effected peptide array phosphorylation patterns consistent with the expected action of these inhibitors. We conclude that this first metabolic array is a useful method to determine the enzymatic activities of a large group of kinases, offering high throughput analysis of cellular metabolism and signal transduction.",

Herein, we have developed a polymer-protein core-shell nanomedicine to inhibit critically aberrant pro-survival kinases (mTOR, MAPK and STAT5) in primitive (CD34+/CD38-) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cells. The nanomedicine consists of poly-lactide-co-glycolide core (~250nm) loaded with mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, and albumin shell (~25nm thick) loaded with MAPK/STAT5 inhibitor, sorafenib and the whole construct was surface conjugated with monoclonal antibody against CD33 receptor overexpressed in AML. Electron microscopy confirmed formation of core-shell nanostructure (~290nm) and flow cytometry and confocal studies showed enhanced cellular uptake of targeted nanomedicine. Simultaneous inhibition of critical kinases causing synergistic lethality against leukemic cells, without affecting healthy blood cells, was demonstrated using immunoblotting, cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays. This cell receptor plus multi-kinase targeted core-shell nanomedicine was found better specific and tolerable compared to current clinical regime of cytarabine and daunorubicin.

The P. falciparum genome has been sequenced, which provides new opportunities for the identification of novel drug targets. Eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) form a large family of enzymes with crucial roles in most cellular processes; hence malarial ePKS represent potential drug targets. We report an exhaustive analysis of the P. falciparum genomic database (PlasmoDB) aimed at identifying and classifying all ePKs in this organism. RESULTS: Using a variety of bioinformatics tools, we identified 65 malarial ePK sequences and constructed a phylogenetic tree to position these sequences relative to the seven established ePK groups. Predominant features of the tree were: (i) that several malarial sequences did not cluster within any of the known ePK groups; (ii) that the CMGC group, whose members are usually involved in the control of cell proliferation, had the highest number of malarial ePKs; and (iii) that no malarial ePK clustered with the tyrosine kinase (TyrK) or STE groups, pointing to the absence of three-component MAPK modules in the parasite. A novel family of 20 ePK-related sequences was identified and called FIKK, on the basis of a conserved amino acid motif. The FIKK family seems restricted to Apicomplexa, with 20 members in P. falciparum and just one member in some other Apicomplexan species. CONCLUSION: The considerable phylogenetic distance between Apicomplexa and other Eukaryotes is reflected by profound divergences between the kinome of malaria parasites and that of yeast or mammalian cells.",

Although many of these agents have been described as \"targeted therapy\", they will typically inhibit multiple kinases with varying potency. Pre-clinical model testing has not predicted the numerous significant toxicities identified during clinical development. The purpose of this study was to develop a bioinformatics-based method to predict specific adverse events (AEs) in humans associated with the inhibition of particular kinase targets (KTs). Methods: The AE frequencies of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) were curated from three sources (PubMed, Thompson Physician Desk Reference and PharmGKB), and affinities of 38 PKIs for 317 kinases, representing >50% of the predicted human kinome, were collected from published in vitro assay results. A novel quantitative computational method was developed to predict associations between KTs and AEs that included a whole panel of 71 AEs and 20 PKIs targeting 266 distinct kinases with Kd < 10 \u03bcM. The method calculated an unbiased, kinome-wide association score via linear algebra on (i) the normalized frequencies of AEs associated with 20 PKIs and (ii) the negative log-transformed dissociation constant of kinases targeted by these PKIs. Finally, a reference standard was calculated by applying Fisher's exact test to the co-occurrence of indexed Pubmed terms (p \u2264 0.05, and manually verified) for AE and associated kinase targets (AE-KT) pairs from standard literature search techniques. We also evaluated the enrichment of predictions between the quantitative method and the literature search by Fisher's exact testing. Results: We identified significant associations among already empirically well established pairs of AEs (e.g. diarrhea and rash) and KTs (e.g. EGFR). The following less well recognized AE-KT pairs had similar association scores: diarrhea-(DDR1;ERBB4), rash-ERBB4, and fatigue-(CSF1R;KIT). With no filtering, the association score identified 41 prioritized associations involving 7 AEs and 19 KTs. Among them, eight associations were reported in the literature review. There were only 78 out of a total of 4522 AE-KT pairs meeting the evaluation threshold, indicating a strong association between the predicted and the text mined AE-KT pairs (p = 3 \u00d7 10-7). As many of these drugs remain in development, a larger volume of more detailed data on AE-PKI associations is accessible only through non-public databases. These prediction models will be refined with these data and validated through dedicated prospective human studies. Conclusion and future directions: Our in silico method can predict associations between kinase targets and AE frequencies in human patients. Refining this method should lead to improved clinical development of protein kinase inhibitors, a large new class of therapeutics. http://www.lussierlab.org/publication/PAS/. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we carried out a bioinformatic analysis of the expression levels of 459 human kinase genes in 5681 samples consisting of 44 healthy and 55 malignant human tissues. Defining the tissues where the kinase genes were transcriptionally active led to a functional genomic taxonomy of the kinome and a classification of human tissues and disease types based on the similarity of their kinome gene expression. The co-expression network around each of the kinase genes was defined in order to determine the functional context, i.e. the biological processes that were active in the cells and tissues where the kinase gene was expressed. Strong associations for individual kinases were found for mitosis (69 genes, including AURKA and BUB1), cell cycle control (73 genes, including PLK1 and AURKB), DNA repair (49 genes, including CHEK1 and ATR), immune response (72 genes, including MATK), neuronal (131 genes, including PRKCE) and muscular (72 genes, including MYLK2) functions. We then analyzed which kinase genes gain or lose transcriptional activity in the development of prostate and lung cancers and elucidated the functional associations of individual cancer associated kinase genes. In summary, we report here a systematic classification of kinases based on the bioinformatic analysis of their expression in human tissues and diseases, as well as grouping of tissues and tumor types according to the similarity of their kinome transcription.",

        "abstract": "Summary: The Syrian golden hamster has been increasingly used to study viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) pathogenesis and countermeasure efficacy. As VHFs are a global health concern, well-characterized animal models are essential for both the development of therapeutics and vaccines as well as for increasing our understanding of the molecular events that underlie viral pathogenesis. However, the paucity of reagents or platforms that are available for studying hamsters at a molecular level limits the ability to extract biological information from this important animal model. As such, there is a need to develop platforms/technologies for characterizing host responses of hamsters at a molecular level. To this end, we developed hamster-specific kinome peptide arrays to characterize the molecular host response of the Syrian golden hamster. After validating the functionality of the arrays using immune agonists of defined signaling mechanisms (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1), we characterized the host response in a hamster model of VHF based on Pichinde virus (PICV) infection by performing temporal kinome analysis of lung tissue. Our analysis revealed key roles for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL) responses, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) signaling, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in the response to PICV infection. These findings were validated through phosphorylation-specific Western blot analysis. Overall, we have demonstrated that hamster-specific kinome arrays are a robust tool for characterizing the species-specific molecular host response in a VHF model. Further, our results provide key insights into the hamster host response to PICV infection and will inform future studies with high-consequence VHF pathogens.",

        "abstract": "Genetic alterations in kinases have been linked to multiple human pathologies. To explore the landscape of kinase genetic variation in gastric cancer (GC), we used targeted, paired-end deep sequencing to analyze 532 protein and phosphoinositide kinases in 14 GC cell lines. We identified 10,604 single-nucleotide variants (SNV) in kinase exons including greater than 300 novel nonsynonymous SNVs. Family-wise analysis of the nonsynonymous SNVs revealed a significant enrichment in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-related genes (P < 0.01), suggesting a preferential involvement of this kinase family in GC. A potential antioncogenic role for MAP2K4, a gene exhibiting recurrent alterations in 2 lines, was functionally supported by siRNA knockdown and overexpression studies in wild-type and MAP2K4 variant lines. The deep sequencing data also revealed novel, large-scale structural rearrangement events involving kinases including gene fusions involving CDK12 and the ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase in MKN7 cells. Integrating SNVs and copy number alterations, we identified Hs746T as a cell line exhibiting both splice-site mutations and genomic amplification of MET, resulting in MET protein overexpression. When applied to primary GCs, we identified somatic mutations in 8 kinases, 4 of which were recurrently altered in both primary tumors and cell lines (MAP3K6, STK31, FER, and CDKL5). These results demonstrate that how targeted deep sequencing approaches can deliver unprecedented multilevel characterization of a medically and pharmacologically relevant gene family. The catalog of kinome genetic variants assembled here may broaden our knowledge on kinases and provide useful information on genetic alterations in GC.",

The pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line MiaPaCa-2 was transfected with 645 pairs of siRNAs directed to all human kinases. The same experiment was conducted in cells treated with 150 microM gemcitabine. Apoptosis was measured after 2 days and the results were normalized for cell viability. A panel of 56 kinases whose inhibition increased spontaneous apoptosis by at least 50% was established. Ten of them gave similar results on Panc1 and BxPC3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. A panel of 83 kinases whose inhibition increased gemcitabine-induced apoptosis by 50% or more was also established. Twelve kinases appeared in both panels. A cumulative increase in apoptosis was observed when inhibiting simultaneously several kinases. Such a systematic approach allowed characterization of all kinases involved in pancreatic cancer cell survival and resistance to gemcitabine. Inhibitors of these kinases, used alone or in combination, might improve the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.",

To assess host cell specificity, the confirmed hits were tested in the DENV-infected monocytic cell line U937. While the expression of EIF2AK3, ETNK2 and SMAD7 was regulated in both cell lines after infection, most kinases were hepatocyte-specific. Monocytic cells represent initial targets of infection and an antiviral treatment targeting these cells is probably most effective to reduce initial viral load.

There is a pressing need to identify conserved signalling components among eukaryotes, which will lead to the transfer of knowledge across kingdoms. Two useful properties of a eukaryote model for signalling are (1) reduced signalling complexity, (2) conservation of signalling components. The alga Ostreococcus tauri is described as the smallest free-living eukaryote. With less than 8,000 genes, it represents a highly constrained genomic palette.\\n\\nRESULTS: Our survey revealed 133 protein kinases and 34 protein phosphatases (1.7% and 0.4% of the proteome). We conducted phosphoproteomic experiments and constructed domain structures and phylogenies for the catalytic protein-kinases. For each of the major kinases families we review the completeness and divergence of O. tauri representatives in comparison to the well-studied kinomes of the laboratory models Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and of Homo sapiens. Many kinase clades in O. tauri were reduced to a single member, in preference to the loss of family diversity, whereas TKL and ABC1 clades were expanded. We also identified kinases that have been lost in A. thaliana but retained in O. tauri. For three, contrasting eukaryotic pathways - TOR, MAPK, and the circadian clock - we established the subset of conserved components and demonstrate conserved sites of substrate phosphorylation and kinase motifs.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that O. tauri satisfies our two central requirements. Several of its kinases are more closely related to H. sapiens orthologs than S. cerevisiae is to H. sapiens. The greatly reduced kinome of O. tauri is therefore a suitable model for signalling in free-living eukaryotes.",

        "abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) plays a central role in tumor progression by regulating genes involved in proliferation, glycolysis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. To improve our understanding of HIF-1 regulation by kinome, we screened a kinase-specific small interference RNA library using a hypoxia-response element (HRE) luciferase reporter assay under hypoxic conditions. This screen determined that depletion of cellular SMG-1 kinase most significantly modified cellular HIF-1 activity in hypoxia. SMG-1 is the newest and least studied member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase family, which consists of ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, mTOR, and SMG-1. We individually depleted members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase family, and only SMG-1 deficiency significantly augmented HIF-1 activity in hypoxia. We subsequently discovered that SMG-1 kinase activity was activated by hypoxia, and depletion of SMG-1 up-regulated MAPK activity under low oxygen. Suppressing cellular MAPK by silencing ERK1/2 or by treatment with U0126, a MAPK inhibitor, partially blocked the escalation of HIF-1 activity resulting from SMG-1 deficiency in hypoxic cells. Increased expression of SMG-1 but not kinase-dead SMG-1 effectively inhibited the activity of HIF-1alpha. In addition, cellular SMG-1 deficiency increased secretion of the HIF-1alpha-regulated angiogenic factor, vascular epidermal growth factor, and survival factor, carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), as well as promoted the hypoxic cell motility. Taken together, we discovered that SMG-1 negatively regulated HIF-1alpha activity in hypoxia, in part through blocking MAPK activation.",

Although characterized in Drosophila, the mechanisms that mediate the Hh signal downstream of the Smoothened (Smo) seven-transmembrane protein in vertebrates remain poorly understood. In particular, the Fused (Fu) kinase, which mediates Hh signaling in flies, is dispensable in mammals. To identify kinases that positively regulate the Hh pathway in mammals, we screened a mouse kinome small interfering RNA library and validated nine candidates that modulate Hh signaling. Among these candidates, Nek1 and Prkra did not directly function in the Hh pathway but exerted their effects on Hh signaling indirectly through a primary role in ciliogenesis. In contrast, another kinase, Cdc2l1, directly participated in the Hh pathway. Cdc2l1 was necessary and sufficient for activation of the Hh pathway, functioning downstream of Smo and upstream of the Glioma-associated (Gli) transcription factors. More specifically, Cdc2l1 interacted with the negative regulator Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) and relieved its inhibition on Gli, thus providing a mechanism for how Cdc2l1 might play a role in Hh signaling. Finally, with zebrafish as model organism, we showed that Cdc2l1 activated the Hh pathway in vivo. We propose that Cdc2l1 is a previously unrecognized member of the Hh signal transduction cascade.",

High PLK1 mRNA and protein correlated with a high Ki-67 score in primary ER(+) breast cancers after treatment with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole. RNAi-mediated knockdown of PLK1 inhibited ER expression, estrogen-independent growth, and ER transcription in MCF7 and HCC1428 LTED cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of PLK1 with volasertib, a small-molecule ATP-competitive PLK1 inhibitor, decreased LTED cell growth, ER transcriptional activity, and ER expression. Volasertib in combination with the ER antagonist, fulvestrant, decreased MCF7 xenograft growth in ovariectomized mice more potently than each drug alone. JUNB, a component of the AP-1 complex, was expressed 16-fold higher in MCF7/LTED compared with parental MCF7 cells. Furthermore, JUNB and BCL2L1 (which encodes antiapoptotic BCL-xL) mRNA levels were markedly reduced upon volasertib treatment in MCF7/LTED cells, while they were increased in parental MCF7 cells. Finally, JUNB knockdown decreased ER expression and transcriptional activity in MCF7/LTED cells, suggesting that PLK1 drives ER expression and estrogen-independent growth via JUNB. These data support a critical role of PLK1 in acquired hormone-independent growth of ER(+) human breast cancer and is therefore a promising target in tumors that have escaped estrogen deprivation therapy.",

        "abstract": "HER2(+) breast cancer is currently treated with chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 inhibitors. Many patients do not respond or relapse with aggressive metastatic disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapeutics that can target HER2(+) breast cancer and potentiate the effect of anti-HER2 inhibitors, in particular those that can target tumor-initiating cells (TIC). Here, we show that MMTV-Her2/Neu mammary tumor cells cultured as nonadherent spheres or as adherent monolayer cells select for stabilizing mutations in p53 that \"immortalize\" the cultures and that, after serial passages, sphere conditions maintain TICs, whereas monolayer cells gradually lose these tumorigenic cells. Using tumorsphere formation as surrogate for TICs, we screened p53-mutant Her2/Neu(+) tumorsphere versus monolayer cells with a lentivirus short hairpin RNA kinome library. We identified kinases such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase and the TGF\u03b2R protein family, previously implicated in HER2(+) breast cancer, as well as autophagy factor ATG1/ULK1 and the noncanonical I\u03baB kinase (IKK), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which have not been previously linked to HER2(+) breast cancer. Knockdown of TBK1 or pharmacologic inhibition of TBK1 and the related protein, IKK\u03b5, suppressed growth of both mouse and human HER2(+) breast cancer cells. TBK1/IKK\u03b5 inhibition promoted cellular senescence by suppressing p65-NF-\u03baB and inducing p16(Ink4a). In addition, TBK1/IKK\u03b5 inhibition cooperated with lapatinib, a HER2/EGFR1-targeted drug, to accelerate apoptosis and kill HER2(+) breast cancer cells both in culture and in xenografts. Our results suggest that patients with HER2(+) breast cancer may benefit from anti-TBK1/IKK\u03b5 plus anti-HER2 combination therapies and establish conditions that can be used to screen for additional TIC-specific inhibitors of HER2(+) breast cancer.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Oomycetes are a large group of economically and ecologically important species. Its most notorious member is Phytophthora infestans, the cause of the devastating potato late blight disease. The life cycle of P. infestans involves hyphae which differentiate into spores used for dispersal and host infection. Protein phosphorylation likely plays crucial roles in these stages, and to help understand this we present here a genome-wide analysis of the protein kinases of P. infestans and several relatives. The study also provides new insight into kinase evolution since oomycetes are taxonomically distant from organisms with well-characterized kinomes. RESULTS Bioinformatic searches of the genomes of P. infestans, P. ramorum, and P. sojae reveal they have similar kinomes, which for P. infestans contains 354 eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) and 18 atypical kinases (aPKs), equaling 2% of total genes. After refining gene models, most were classifiable into families seen in other eukaryotes. Some ePK families are nevertheless unusual, especially the tyrosine kinase-like (TKL) group which includes large oomycete-specific subfamilies. Also identified were two tyrosine kinases, which are rare in non-metazoans. Several ePKs bear accessory domains not identified previously on kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinases with integral cyclin domains. Most ePKs lack accessory domains, implying that many are regulated transcriptionally. This was confirmed by mRNA expression-profiling studies that showed that two-thirds vary significantly between hyphae, sporangia, and zoospores. Comparisons to neighboring taxa (apicomplexans, ciliates, diatoms) revealed both clade-specific and conserved features, and multiple connections to plant kinases were observed. The kinome of Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, an oomycete with a simpler life cycle than P. infestans, was found to be one-third smaller. Some differences may be attributable to gene clustering, which facilitates subfamily expansion (or loss) through unequal crossing-over. CONCLUSION The large sizes of the Phytophthora kinomes imply that phosphorylation plays major roles in their life cycles. Their kinomes also include many novel ePKs, some specific to oomycetes or shared with neighboring groups. Little experimentation to date has addressed the biological functions of oomycete kinases, but this should be stimulated by the structural, evolutionary, and expression data presented here. This may lead to targets for disease control.",

        "abstract": "Although a relation between diminished human immunity and stress is well recognized both within the general public and the scientific literature, the molecular mechanisms by which stress alters immunity remain poorly understood. We explored a novel model for acute human stress involving volunteers performing a first-time bungee jump from an altitude of 60 m and exploited this model to characterize the effects of acute stress in the peripheral blood compartment. Twenty volunteers were included in the study; half of this group was pretreated for 3 d with the \u03b2-receptor blocking agent propranolol. Blood was drawn 2 h before, right before, immediately after and 2 h after the jump. Plasma catecholamine and cortisol levels increased significantly during jumping, which was accompanied by significantly reduced ex vivo inducibility of proinflammatory cytokines as well as activation of coagulation and vascular endothelium. Kinome profiles obtained from the peripheral blood leukocyte fraction contained a strong noncanonical glucocorticoid receptor signal transduction signature after jumping. In apparent agreement, jumping down-regulated Lck/Fyn and cellular innate immune effector function (phagocytosis). Pretreatment of volunteers with propranolol abolished the effects of jumping on coagulation and endothelial activation but left the inhibitory effects on innate immune function intact. Taken together, these results indicate that bungee jumping leads to a catecholamine-independent immune suppressive phenotype and implicate noncanonical glucocorticoid receptor signal transduction as a major pathway linking human stress to impaired functioning of the human innate immune system.",

        "abstract": "Azithromycin is an azalide, a subclass of macrolide antibiotics. It is derived from erythromycin, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom incorporated into the lactone ring, thus making the lactone ring 15-membered. It prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis. It binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and thus inhibits translation of mRNA. Azithromycin is used to treat or prevent certain bacterial infections, most often those causing middle ear infections, strep throat, pneumonia, typhoid, bronchitis, and sinusitis. In recent years, it has been used primarily to prevent bacterial infections in infants and those with weaker immune systems. It is also effective against certain sexually transmitted infections, such as nongonococcal urethritis, chlamydia, and cervicitis. Recent studies have indicated it also to be effective against late-onset asthma, but these findings are controversial and not widely accepted. The present study gives a comprehensive profile of azithromycin, including detailed physico-chemical properties, nomenclature, formulae, methods of preparation, and methods of analysis (including compendial, electrochemical, spectroscopic, and chromatographic methods of analysis).

        "abstract": "This chapter focuses on citric acid. Citric acid occurs in the terminal oxidative metabolic system of a very few organisms. This system, variously referred to as the Krebs cycle, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, or the citric acid cycle, is a metabolic intermediate cycle involving the terminal steps in the conversion of carbohydrates, fats, or proteins to carbon dioxide and water with concomitant release of energy necessary for growth, movement, luminescence, chemosynthesis, and reproduction. The cycle also provides the carbonaceous materials from which amino acids and fats are synthesized by the cell. Citric acid chelates calcium and is used by blood banks, since the citrate-calcium chelate helps to prevent blood coagulation. A specific effect of citric acid treatment on isolated cell nuclei from bovine cerebral cortex results in extraction of a specific set of proteins from the nuclei rather than separation of inner and outer nuclear membranes. The general manufacture of citric acid is by the fermentation of solutions of glucose, sucrose, or purified cane-molasses in the presence of certain inorganic salts and air, by various molds or fungi, such as Citromyces pfefferianus and Aspergilus niger.",

Like all tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib works by preventing a tyrosine kinase enzyme. Because the {BCR-Abl} tyrosine kinase enzyme exists only in cancer cells and not in healthy cells, imatinib works as a form of targeted therapy-only cancer cells are killed through the drug's action. In this regard, imatinib was one of the first cancer therapies to show the potential for such targeted action and is often cited as a paradigm for research in cancer therapeutics. This study presents a comprehensive profile of imatinib, including detailed nomenclature, formulae, physico-chemical properties, methods of preparation, and methods of analysis (including compendial, electrochemical, spectroscopic, and chromatographic methods of analysis). Spectroscopic and spectrometric analyses include {UV/vis} spectroscopy, vibrational spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (({1)H} and ({13)C} {NMR)}, and mass spectrometry. Chromatographic methods of analyses include electrophoresis, thin layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Preliminary stability investigations for imatinib have established the main degradation pathways, for example, oxidation to N-oxide under oxidative stress conditions. Stability was also carried out for the formulation by exposing to different temperatures {0\u00b0C}, ambient temperature, and {40\u00b0C.} No remarkable change was found in the drug content of formulation. This indicates that the drug was stable at the above optimized formulation.

Understanding the molecular basis of binding specificity for protein kinases family, which is the central problem in discovery of cancer therapeutics, remains challenging as the inhibitor selectivity is not readily interpreted from chemical proteomics studies, neither it is easily discernable directly from sequence or structure information. We present an integrated view of sequence-structure-binding relationships in the tyrosine kinome space in which evolutionary analysis of the kinases binding sites is combined with computational proteomics profiling of the inhibitor-protein interactions. This approach provides a functional classification of the binding specificity mechanisms for cancer agents targeting protein tyrosine kinases.\\n\\nRESULTS: The proposed functional classification of the kinase binding specificities explores mechanisms in which structural plasticity of the tyrosine kinases and sequence variation of the binding-site residues are linked with conformational preferences of the inhibitors in achieving effective drug binding. The molecular basis of binding specificity for tyrosine kinases may be largely driven by conformational adaptability of the inhibitors to an ensemble of structurally different conformational states of the enzyme, rather than being determined by their phylogenetic proximity in the kinome space or differences in the interactions with the variable binding-site residues. This approach provides a fruitful functional linkage between structural bioinformatics analysis and disease by unraveling the molecular basis of kinase selectivity for the prominent kinase drugs (Imatinib, Dasatinib and Erlotinib) which is consistent with structural and proteomics experiments.",

However, the mechanism of PCD involved in cancer chemoprevention is much less clear and may be different between types of chemopreventive agents and tumour cell types involved. Therefore, from a pharmacological view, it is crucial during the earlier steps of drug development to define the cellular specificity of the candidate as well as its capacity to bypass dysfunctional tumoral signalling pathways providing insensitivity to death stimuli. Studying the cytotoxic effects of violacein, an antibiotic dihydro-indolone synthesised by an Amazon river Chromobacterium, we observed that death induced in CD34(+)/c-Kit(+)/P-glycoprotein(+)/MRP1(+) TF1 leukaemia progenitor cells is not mediated by apoptosis and/or autophagy, since biomarkers of both types of cell death were not significantly affected by this compound. To clarify the working mechanism of violacein, we performed kinome profiling using peptide arrays to yield comprehensive descriptions of cellular kinase activities. Pro-death activity of violacein is actually carried out by inhibition of calpain and DAPK1 and activation of PKA, AKT and PDK, followed by structural changes caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress and Golgi apparatus collapse, leading to cellular demise. Our results demonstrate that violacein induces kinome reprogramming, overcoming death signaling dysfunctions of intrinsically resistant human leukaemia cells.",

Here we report a novel approach of kinome profiling with an outcome that suggests an important role of specific cellular protein kinases, such as AMPK, ABL2 and Aurora A. Inhibition of AMPK and ABL kinases showed a significant reduction, whereas inhibition of Aurora A kinase led to a slight activation of HCMV replication, as measured in a GFP reporter-based replication assay. Furthermore, analysis of the mode of antiviral action suggested a substantial benefit for the efficiency of viral replication at the immediate early (AMPK) or early-late (ABL) phases of HCMV gene expression. In contrast, inhibition of Aurora A kinase promoted an enhancement of viral early-late gene expression, suggesting a putative role of Aurora A signaling in host defense. Thus, the combined data provide new information on host cell kinases involved in viral replication and uncovered potential targets for future antiviral strategies. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Analysis of biological processes is frequently performed with the help of phenotypic assays where data is mostly acquired in single end-point analysis. Alternative phenotypic profiling techniques are desired where time-series information is essential to the biological question, for instance to differentiate early and late regulators of cell proliferation in loss-of-function studies. So far there is no study addressing this question despite of high unmet interests, mostly due to the limitation of conventional end-point assaying technologies. We present the first human kinome screen with a real-time cell analysis system (RTCA) to capture dynamic RNAi phenotypes, employing time-resolved monitoring of cell proliferation via electrical impedance. RTCA allowed us to investigate the dynamics of phenotypes of cell proliferation instead of using conventional end-point analysis. By introducing data transformation with first-order derivative, i.e. the cell-index growth rate, we demonstrate this system suitable for high-throughput screenings (HTS). The screen validated previously identified inhibitor genes and, additionally, identified activators of cell proliferation. With the information of time kinetics available, we could establish a network of mitotic-event related genes to be among the first displaying inhibiting effects after RNAi knockdown. The time-resolved screen captured kinetics of cell proliferation caused by RNAi targeting human kinome, serving as a resource for researchers. Our work establishes RTCA technology as a novel robust tool with biological and pharmacological relevance amenable for high-throughput screening.",

Globally, MERS-CoV has been responsible for 877 laboratory-confirmed infections, including 317 deaths, since September 2012. As there is a paucity of information regarding the molecular pathogenesis associated with this virus or the identities of novel antiviral drug targets, we performed temporal kinome analysis on human hepatocytes infected with the Erasmus isolate of MERS-CoV with peptide kinome arrays. bioinformatics analysis of our kinome data, including pathway overrepresentation analysis (ORA) and functional network analysis, suggested that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling responses were specifically modulated in response to MERS-CoV infection in vitro throughout the course of infection. The overrepresentation of specific intermediates within these pathways determined by pathway and functional network analysis of our kinome data correlated with similar patterns of phosphorylation determined through Western blot array analysis. In addition, analysis of the effects of specific kinase inhibitors on MERS-CoV infection in tissue culture models confirmed these cellular response observations. Further, we have demonstrated that a subset of licensed kinase inhibitors targeting the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways significantly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in vitro whether they were added before or after viral infection. Taken together, our data suggest that ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling responses play important roles in MERS-CoV infection and may represent novel drug targets for therapeutic intervention strategies.",

Prior studies demonstrated that approximately half of these patients had genomic lesions leading to CRLF2 overexpression, with half of such cases harboring somatic mutations in the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2. To determine whether mutations in other tyrosine kinases might also occur in ALL, we sequenced the tyrosine kinome and downstream signaling genes in 45 high-risk pediatric ALL cases with either a Ph-like gene expression profile or other alterations suggestive of activated kinase signaling. Aside from JAK mutations and 1 FLT3 mutation, no somatic mutations were found in any other tyrosine kinases, suggesting that alternative mechanisms are responsible for activated kinase signaling in high-risk ALL.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the 8th leading cause of cancer death amongst American women. Most ECs are endometrioid, serous, or clear cell carcinomas, or an admixture of histologies. Serous and clear ECs are clinically aggressive tumors for which alternative therapeutic approaches are needed. The purpose of this study was to search for somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinome of serous and clear cell ECs, because mutated kinases can point to potential therapeutic targets.\\n\\nMETHODS: In a mutation discovery screen, we PCR amplified and Sanger sequenced the exons encoding the catalytic domains of 86 tyrosine kinases from 24 serous, 11 clear cell, and 5 mixed histology ECs. For somatically mutated genes, we next sequenced the remaining coding exons from the 40 discovery screen tumors and sequenced all coding exons from another 72 ECs (10 clear cell, 21 serous, 41 endometrioid). We assessed the copy number of mutated kinases in this cohort of 112 tumors using quantitative real time PCR, and we used immunoblotting to measure expression of these kinases in endometrial cancer cell lines.\\n\\nRESULTS: Overall, we identified somatic mutations in TNK2 (tyrosine kinase non-receptor, 2) and DDR1 (discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1) in 5.3% (6 of 112) and 2.7% (3 of 112) of ECs. Copy number gains of TNK2 and DDR1 were identified in another 4.5% and 0.9% of 112 cases respectively. Immunoblotting confirmed TNK2 and DDR1 expression in endometrial cancer cell lines. Three of five missense mutations in TNK2 and one of two missense mutations in DDR1 are predicted to impact protein function by two or more in silico algorithms. The TNK2(P761Rfs*72) frameshift mutation was recurrent in EC, and the DDR1(R570Q) missense mutation was recurrent across tumor types.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to systematically search for mutations in the tyrosine kinome in clear cell endometrial tumors. Our findings indicate that high-frequency somatic mutations in the catalytic domains of the tyrosine kinome are rare in clear cell ECs. We uncovered ten new mutations in TNK2 and DDR1 within serous and endometrioid ECs, thus providing novel insights into the mutation spectrum of each gene in EC.",

Two distinct subtypes of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) were recently identified: mesenchymal (MES) and proneural (PN). To identify mechanisms to target the more aggressive MES GSCs, we combined transcriptomic expression analysis and kinome-wide short hairpin RNA screening of MES and PN GSCs. In comparison to PN GSCs, we found significant upregulation and phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL in MES GSCs. Knockdown of AXL significantly decreased MES GSC self-renewal capacity in vitro and inhibited the growth of glioblastoma patient-derived xenografts. Moreover, inhibition of AXL with shRNA or pharmacologic inhibitors also increased cell death significantly more in MES GSCs. Clinically, AXL expression was elevated in the MES GBM subtype and significantly correlated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers. In conclusion, we identified AXL as a potential molecular target for novel approaches to treat glioblastoma and other solid cancers.",

Here we report the development of a unique knockout mouse model of CDKL5-related disorders and demonstrate that mice lacking CDKL5 show autistic-like deficits in social interaction, as well as impairments in motor control and fear memory. Neurophysiological recordings reveal alterations in event-related potentials (ERPs) similar to those observed in RTT and ASDs. Moreover, kinome profiling uncovers disruption of multiple signal transduction pathways, including the AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade, upon Cdkl5 loss-of-function. These data demonstrate that CDKL5 regulates signal transduction pathways and mediates autistic-like phenotypes and together establish a causal role for Cdkl5 loss-of-function in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorylation of cellular components catalyzed by kinases plays important roles in cell signaling and proliferation. Quantitative assessment of perturbation in global kinome may provide crucial knowledge for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of environmental toxicants. Here, we utilized an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) affinity probe coupled with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to assess quantitatively the arsenite-induced alteration of global kinome in human cells. We constructed a SILAC-compatible kinome library for scheduled multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis and adopted on-the-fly recalibration of retention time shift, which provided better throughput of the analytical method and enabled the simultaneous quantification of the expression of \u223c300 kinases in two LC-MRM runs. With this improved analytical method, we conducted an in-depth quantitative analysis of the perturbation of kinome of GM00637 human skin fibroblast cells induced by arsenite exposure. Several kinases involved in cell cycle progression, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK1 and CDK4) and Aurora kinases A, B, and C, were found to be hyperactivated, and the altered expression of CDK1 was further validated by Western analysis. In addition, treatment with a CDK inhibitor, flavopiridol, partially restored the arsenite-induced growth inhibition of human skin fibroblast cells. Thus, sodium arsenite may confer its cytotoxic effect partly through the aberrant activation of CDKs and the resultant perturbation of cell cycle progression. Together, we developed a high-throughput, SILAC-compatible, and MRM-based kinome profiling method and demonstrated that the method is powerful in deciphering the molecular modes of action of a widespread environmental toxicant. The method should be generally applicable for uncovering the cellular pathways triggered by other extracellular stimuli.",

Overall survival is approximately 60%, and has not significantly increased since the introduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the 1970s. The genomic profile of high-grade osteosarcoma is complex and heterogeneous. Integration of different types of genome-wide data may be advantageous in extracting relevant information from the large number of aberrations detected in this tumor.\\n\\nMETHODS: We analyzed genome-wide gene expression data of osteosarcoma cell lines and integrated these data with a kinome screen. Data were analyzed in statistical language R, using LIMMA for detection of differential expression/phosphorylation. We subsequently used Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to determine deregulated pathways in both data types.\\n\\nRESULTS: Gene set enrichment indicated that pathways important in genomic stability are highly deregulated in these tumors, with many genes showing upregulation, which could be used as a prognostic marker, and with kinases phosphorylating peptides in these pathways. Akt and AMPK signaling were identified as active and inactive, respectively. As these pathways have an opposite role on mTORC1 signaling, we set out to inhibit Akt kinases with the allosteric Akt inhibitor MK-2206. This resulted in inhibition of proliferation of osteosarcoma cell lines U-2 OS and HOS, but not of 143B, which harbors a KRAS oncogenic transformation.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified both overexpression and hyperphosphorylation in pathways playing a role in genomic stability. Kinome profiling identified active Akt signaling, which could inhibit proliferation in 2/3 osteosarcoma cell lines. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling may be effective in osteosarcoma, but further studies are required to determine whether this pathway is active in a substantial subgroup of this heterogeneous tumor.",

        "abstract": "Targeted therapy against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represents a major therapeutic advance in lung cancer treatment. Somatic mutations of the EGFR gene, most commonly L858R (exon 21) and short in-frame exon 19 deletions, have been found to confer enhanced sensitivity toward the inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. We have recently identified an EGFR mutation E884K, in combination with L858R, in a patient with advanced lung cancer who progressed on erlotinib maintenance therapy, and subsequently had leptomeningeal metastases that responded to gefitinib. The somatic E884K substitution appears to be relatively infrequent and resulted in a mutant lysine residue that disrupts an ion pair with residue R958 in the EGFR kinase domain C-lobe, an interaction that is highly conserved within the human kinome as demonstrated by our sequence analysis and structure analysis. Our studies here, using COS-7 transfection model system, show that E884K works in concert with L858R in-cis, in a dominant manner, to change downstream signaling, differentially induce Mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signaling-regulated kinase 1/2) signaling and associated cell proliferation and differentially alter sensitivity of EGFR phosphorylation inhibition by ERBB family inhibitors in an inhibitor-specific manner. Mutations of the conserved ion pair E884-R958 may result in conformational changes that alter kinase substrate recognition. The analogous E1271K-MET mutation conferred differential sensitivity toward preclinical MET inhibitors SU11274 (unchanged) and PHA665752 (more sensitive). Systematic bioinformatics analysis of the mutation catalog in the human kinome revealed the presence of cancer-associated mutations involving the conserved E884 homologous residue, and adjacent residues at the ion pair, in known proto-oncogenes (KIT, RET, MET and FAK) and tumor-suppressor gene (LKB1). Targeted therapy using small-molecule inhibitors should take into account potential cooperative effects of multiple kinase mutations, and their specific effects on downstream signaling and inhibitor sensitivity. Improved efficacy of targeted kinase inhibitors may be achieved by targeting the dominant activating mutations present.",

In this study, high-throughput kinomic and proteomic approaches enabled to identify aberrant activity profiles in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that defined druggable targets. This approach revealed impaired activity of proteins belonging to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Pharmacological druggable MAPK pathway targets tested in primary MLL-rearranged AML included MAPKK1/2 (MEK), cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and MAPK8/9 (JNK). MEK inhibition showed to severely decrease MLL-rearranged AML cell survival without showing cytotoxicity in normal controls, whereas inhibition of CREB and JNK failed to exhibit MLL selectivity. Exploring the working mechanism of MEK inhibition, we assessed proteome activity in response to MEK inhibition in THP-1. MAPK1/3 (Erk) phosphorylation was instantly decreased in concurrence with a sustained Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation that enabled a subpopulation of cells to survive MEK inhibition. After exhaustion of MEK inhibition the AML cells recovered via increased activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and Erk proteins to resume their proliferative state. Combined MEK and VEGFR-2 inhibition strengthened the reduction in MLL-rearranged AML cell survival by blocking the Akt/mTOR and MAPK pathways simultaneously. The generation of insights in cancerous altered activity profiles and alternative escape mechanisms upon targeted therapy allows the rational design of novel combination strategies.Leukemia advance online publication, 13 December 2013; doi:10.1038/leu.2013.342.",

We therefore conducted a kinome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) lethality study in myeloma tumor lines bearing common t(4;14), t(14;16), and t(11;14) translocations to identify critically vulnerable kinases in myeloma tumor cells without regard to preconceived mechanistic notions. Fifteen kinases were repeatedly vulnerable in myeloma cells, including AKT1, AK3L1, AURKA, AURKB, CDC2L1, CDK5R2, FES, FLT4, GAK, GRK6, HK1, PKN1, PLK1, SMG1, and TNK2. Whereas several kinases (PLK1, HK1) were equally vulnerable in epithelial cells, others and particularly G protein-coupled receptor kinase, GRK6, appeared selectively vulnerable in myeloma. GRK6 inhibition was lethal to 6 of 7 myeloma tumor lines but was tolerated in 7 of 7 human cell lines. GRK6 exhibits lymphoid-restricted expression, and from coimmunoprecipitation studies we demonstrate that expression in myeloma cells is regulated via direct association with the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) chaperone.

A detailed SAR study on the 4-position of the phenyl ring of the 14-member macrocyclic ureas 1a and d led to the identification of the potent Chk1 inhibitors 2, 5-7, 10, 13, 14, 19-21, 25, 27, and 31-34. These compounds significantly sensitize tumor cells to the DNA-damaging antitumor agent doxorubicin in a cell-based assay and efficiently abrogate the doxorubicin-induced G2/M and camptothecin-induced S checkpoints, indicating that the potent biological activities of these compounds are mechanism-based through Chk1 inhibition. Kinome profiling analysis of a representative macrocyclic urea 25 against a panel of 120 kinases indicates that these novel macrocyclic ureas are highly selective Chk1 inhibitors. Preliminary PK studies of 1a and b suggest that the 14-member macrocyclic inhibitors may possess better PK properties than their 15-member counterparts. An improved synthesis of 2 and 20 by using 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl (Teoc) to protect the amino group not only readily provided the desired compounds in pure form but also facilitated the scale up of potent compounds for various biological studies. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to identify potential molecular targets in breast cancer, we performed a synthetic siRNA-mediated RNAi screen of the human tyrosine kinome. A primary RNAi screen conducted in the triple-negative/basal-like breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 followed by secondary RNAi screens and further studies in this cell line and two additional triple-negative/basal-like breast cancer cell lines, BT20 and HCC1937, identified the G2/M checkpoint protein, WEE1, as a potential therapeutic target. Similar sensitivity to WEE1 inhibition was observed in cell lines from all subtypes of breast cancer. RNAi-mediated silencing or small compound inhibition of WEE1 in breast cancer cell lines resulted in an increase in gammaH2AX levels, arrest in the S-phase of the cell cycle, and a significant decrease in cell proliferation. WEE1-inhibited cells underwent apoptosis as demonstrated by positive Annexin V staining, increased sub-G1 DNA content, apoptotic morphology, caspase activation, and rescue by the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. In contrast, the non-transformed mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A, did not exhibit any of these downstream effects following WEE1 silencing or inhibition.

The high intracellular concentration of ATP can strongly affect inhibitor potency and selectivity depending on the affinity of the target kinase for ATP. Here we used a defined chemoproteomics system based on competition-binding assays in cell extracts from Jurkat and SK-MEL-28 cells with immobilized ATP mimetics (kinobeads). This system enabled us to assess the affinities of more than 200 kinases for the cellular nucleotide cofactors ATP, ADP, and GTP and the effects of the divalent metal ions Mg(2+) and Mn(2+). The affinity values determined in this system were largely consistent across the two cell lines, indicating no major dependence on kinase expression levels. Kinase-ATP affinities range from low micromolar to millimolar, which has profound consequences for the prediction of cellular effects from inhibitor selectivity profiles. Only a small number of kinases including CK2, MEK, and BRAF exhibited affinity for GTP. This extensive and consistent data set of kinase-nucleotide affinities, determined for native enzymes under defined experimental conditions, will represent a useful resource for kinase drug discovery.",

Currently, no effective treatments are available to cure these tumors, and it is necessary to identify a molecular alteration(s) that characterizes NE lung tumor cells. We aimed to identify a kinase mutation(s) associated with NE lung tumor by screening 517 kinase-encoding genes in human lung cancer cell lines. Our next-generation sequencing analysis of six NE lung tumor cell lines (four small cell lung cancer lines and two non-small cell lung cancer lines) and three non-NE lung tumor lines revealed various kinase mutations, including a nonsynonymous mutation in the proto-oncogene RET (c.2071G>A; p.G691S). Further evaluation of the RET polymorphism in total 15 lung cancer cell lines by capillary sequencing suggested that the frequency of the minor allele (A-allele) in NE lung tumor lines was significantly higher than its frequency in a reference population (p = 0.0001). However, no significant difference between non-NE lung tumor lines and a reference group was detected (p = 1.0). Nevertheless, neither RET expression levels were correlated with the levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a key NE marker, nor vandetanib and cabozantinib, small molecule compounds that inhibit RET, affected NSE levels in lung cancer cells. Our data suggest a potential association of G691S RET polymorphism with NE lung tumor, proposing the necessity of more thorough evaluation of this possibility.

In an effort to identify therapeutic targets for this disease, we performed a comprehensive loss-offunction screen of the protein kinome. Thirty kinases showed significant cellular cytotoxicity when depleted, with loss of the cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1/CHEK1) being the most potent. CHK1mRNAexpression was higher inMYC\u2013Neuroblastoma-related (MYCN)\u2013amplified (P < 0.0001) and high-risk (P = 0.03) tumors. Western blotting revealed that CHK1 was constitutively phosphorylated at the ataxia telangiectasia response kinase target site Ser345 and the autophosphorylation site Ser296 in neuroblastoma cell lines. This pattern was also seen in six of eight high-risk primary tumors but not in control nonneuroblastoma cell lines or in seven of eight low-risk primary tumors. Neuroblastoma cells were sensitive to the two CHK1 inhibitors SB21807 and TCS2312, with median IC50 values of 564 nM and 548 nM, respectively. In contrast, the control lines had high micromolar IC50 values, indicating a strong correlation between CHK1 phosphorylation and CHK1 inhibitor sensitivity (P = 0.0004). Furthermore, cell cycle analysis revealed that CHK1 inhibition in neuroblastoma cells caused apoptosis during S-phase, consistent with its role in replication fork progression. CHK1 inhibitor sensitivity correlated with total MYC(N) protein levels, and inducing MYCN in retinal pigmented epithelial cells resulted in CHK1 phosphorylation, which caused growth inhibition when inhibited. These data show the power of a functional RNAi screen to identify tractable therapeutical targets in neuroblastoma and support CHK1 inhibition strategies in this disease.",

The strongest enhancement was observed with several small-molecule inhibitors of Polo-like Kinase 1 (PLK 1) (e.g., HMN-214 and BI 2536), which enhanced luciferase expression up to 30-fold by arresting cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and influencing intracellular trafficking of plasmid DNA. Knockdown of PLK 1 using an shRNA-expressing lentivirus further confirmed the enhancement of polymer-mediated transgene expression. In addition, pairwise and three-way combinations of PLK1 inhibitors with the histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1) inhibitor Entinostat and the JAK/STAT inhibitor AG-490 enhanced luciferase expression to levels significantly higher than individual drug treatments acting alone. These findings indicate that inhibition of specific intracellular kinases (e.g., PLK1) can significantly enhance non-viral transgene expression for applications in biotechnology and medicine.",

However, the antitumor activity of AKIs in clinical trials has been modest. In order to improve the antitumor activity of AKIs in pancreatic cancer, we utilized a kinome focused RNAi screen to identify genes that, when silenced, would sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to AKI treatment. A total of 17 kinase genes were identified and confirmed as positive hits. One of the hits was the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, alpha polypeptide (PDGFRA), which has been shown to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells and tumor tissues. Imatinib, a PDGFR inhibitor, significantly enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of ZM447439, an Aurora B specific inhibitor, and PHA-739358, a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor. Further studies showed that imatinib augmented the induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by PHA-739358.

These inhibitors are being widely used as pharmacological probes of mTOR-dependent biology. To determine the potency and specificity of these agents, we have undertaken a systematic, kinome-wide effort to profile their selectivity and potency using chemical proteomics, and assays for enzymatic activity, protein binding and disruption of cellular signaling. Enzymatic and cellular assays revealed that all four compounds are potent inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC2, with Torin1 exhibiting approximately 20-fold greater potency for inhibition of T389 phosphorylation on S6 kinases (EC50 = 2 nM) relative to other inhibitors. In vitro biochemical profiling at 10 \u03bcM revealed binding of PP242 to numerous kinases, while WYE354 and KU63794 bound only to p38 kinases and PI3K isoforms and Torin1 to ATR, ATM and DNA-PK. Analysis of these proteins targets in cellular assays did not reveal any off-target activities for Torin1, WYE354 and KU63794 at concentrations below 1 \u03bcM but did show that PP242 efficiently inhibited RET receptor (EC50: 42 nM) and JAK1/2/3 kinases (EC50: 780 nM). In addition, Torin1 displayed unusually slow kinetics for inhibition of the mTORC1/2 complex, a property likely to contribute to the pharmacology of this inhibitor. Our results demonstrated that with the exception of PP242, available ATP-competitive compounds are highly selective mTOR inhibitors when applied to cells at concentrations below 1 \u03bcM, and that the compounds may represent a starting point for medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at developing inhibitors of other PIKK-family kinases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The complexity of phosphoinositide signaling in higher eukaryotes is partly due to expansion of specific families and types of phosphoinositide kinases (PIKs) that can generate all phosphoinositides via multiple routes. This is particularly evident in the PI3Ks and PIPKs, and it is considered an evolutionary trait associated with metazoan diversification. Yet, there are limited comprehensive studies on the PIK repertoire of free living unicellular organisms.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We undertook a genome-wide analysis of putative PIK genes in two free living ciliated cells, Tetrahymena and Paramecium. The Tetrahymena thermophila and Paramecium tetraurelia genomes were probed with representative kinases from all families and types. Putative homologs were verified by EST, microarray and deep RNA sequencing database searches and further characterized for domain structure, catalytic efficiency, expression patterns and phylogenetic relationships. In total, we identified and characterized 22 genes in the Tetrahymena thermophila genome and 62 highly homologues genes in Paramecium tetraurelia suggesting a tight evolutionary conservation in the ciliate lineage. Comparison to the kinome of fungi reveals a significant expansion of PIK genes in ciliates.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study highlights four important aspects concerning ciliate and other unicellular PIKs. First, ciliate-specific expansion of PI4KIII-like genes. Second, presence of class I PI3Ks which, at least in Tetrahymena, are associated with a metazoan-type machinery for PIP3 signaling. Third, expansion of divergent PIPK enzymes such as the recently described type IV transmembrane PIPKs. Fourth, presence of possible type II PIPKs and presumably inactive PIKs (hence, pseudo-PIKs) not previously described. Taken together, our results provide a solid framework for future investigation of the roles of PIKs in ciliates and indicate that novel functions and novel regulatory pathways of phosphoinositides may be more widespread than previously thought in unicellular organisms.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the signaling differences that distinguish human HER2-amplified (HER2-positive (HER2+)) breast cancers from other breast cancer subtypes may help to identify protein drug targets for the specific treatment of HER2+ breast cancers. We performed two kinome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens on five HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, seven breast cancer cell lines in which HER2 was not amplified and two normal breast cell lines. To pinpoint the main kinases driving HER2 signaling, we performed a comprehensive siRNA screen that identified loss of the HER2/HER3 heterodimer as having the most prominent inhibitory effect on the growth of HER2+ breast cancer cells. In a second siRNA screen focused on identifying genes that could sensitize HER2+ cells to trastuzumab treatment, we found that loss of signaling members downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) potentiated the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab. Loss of HER2 and HER3, as well as proteins involved in mitogenic and environmental stress pathways inhibited the proliferation of HER2+ cells only in the absence of trastuzumab, suggesting that these pathways are inhibited by trastuzumab treatment. Loss of essential G2/M cell cycle mediators or proteins involved in vesicle organization exerted inhibitory effects on HER2+ cell growth that were unaffected by trastuzumab. Furthermore, the use of a sensitization index (SI) identified targeting the PI3K pathway to sensitize to trastuzumab treatment. Antagonism using the SI identified MYO3A, MYO3B and MPZL1 as antagonizers to trastuzumab treatment among HER2+ cell lines. Our results suggest that the dimerization partners of HER2 are important for determining the activation of downstream proliferation pathways. Understanding the complex layers of signaling triggered downstream of HER2 homodimers and heterodimers will facilitate the selection of better targets for combination therapies intended to treat HER2+ breast cancers.",

        "abstract": "An intensive recent effort to develop ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors has resulted in several potent and selective molecules such as Torin1, PP242, KU63794, and WYE354. These inhibitors are being widely used as pharmacological probes of mTOR-dependent biology. To determine the potency and specificity of these agents, we have undertaken a systematic kinome-wide effort to profile their selectivity and potency using chemical proteomics and assays for enzymatic activity, protein binding, and disruption of cellular signaling. Enzymatic and cellular assays revealed that all four compounds are potent inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC2, with Torin1 exhibiting approximately 20-fold greater potency for inhibition of Thr-389 phosphorylation on S6 kinases (EC(50) = 2 nM) relative to other inhibitors. In vitro biochemical profiling at 10 muM revealed binding of PP242 to numerous kinases, although WYE354 and KU63794 bound only to p38 kinases and PI3K isoforms and Torin1 to ataxia telangiectasia mutated, ATM and Rad3-related protein, and DNA-PK. Analysis of these protein targets in cellular assays did not reveal any off-target activities for Torin1, WYE354, and KU63794 at concentrations below 1 muM but did show that PP242 efficiently inhibited the RET receptor (EC(50), 42 nM) and JAK1/2/3 kinases (EC(50), 780 nM). In addition, Torin1 displayed unusually slow kinetics for inhibition of the mTORC1/2 complex, a property likely to contribute to the pharmacology of this inhibitor. Our results demonstrated that, with the exception of PP242, available ATP-competitive compounds are highly selective mTOR inhibitors when applied to cells at concentrations below 1 muM and that the compounds may represent a starting point for medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at developing inhibitors of other PI3K kinase-related kinases.",

Availability of draft version of the human genomic data in the year 2001 enabled recognition of repertoire of protein kinases. However, over the years the human genomic data is being refined and the current release of human genomic data has helped us to recognize a larger repertoire of over 900 human protein kinases represented mainly by splice variants. Many of these identified protein kinases are alternatively spliced products. Interestingly, some of the human kinase splice variants appear to be significantly diverged in terms of their functional properties as represented by incorporation or absence of one or more domains. Many sets of protein kinase splice variants have substantially different domain organization and in a few sets of splice variants kinase domains belong to different subfamilies of kinases suggesting potential participation in different signal transduction pathways. Addition or deletion of a domain between splice variants of multi-domain kinases appears to be a means of generating differences in the functional features of otherwise similar kinases. It is intriguing that marked sequence diversity within the catalytic regions of some of the splice variant kinases result in kinases belonging to different subfamilies. These human kinase splice variants with different functions might contribute to diversity of eukaryotic cellular signaling.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The availability of interaction databases provides an opportunity for researchers to utilize immense amounts of data exclusively in silico. Recently there has been an emphasis on studying the global properties of biological interactions using network analysis. While this type of analysis offers a wide variety of global insights it has surprisingly not been used to examine more localized interactions based on mechanism. In as such we have particular interest in the role of key topological components in signal transduction cascades as they are vital regulators of healthy and diseased cell states.\\n\\nRESULTS: We have used publicly available databases and a novel software tool termed Hubview to model the interactions of a subset of the yeast interactome, specifically protein kinases and their interaction partners. Analysis of the connectivity distribution has inferred a fat-tailed degree distribution with parameters consistent with those found in other biological networks. In addition, Hubview identified a functional clustering of a large group of kinases, distributed between three separate groupings. The complexity and average degree for each of these clusters is indicative of a specialized function (cell cycle propagation, DNA repair and pheromone response) and relative age for each cluster.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Using connectivity analysis on a functional subset of proteins we have evidence that reinforces the scale free topology as a model for protein network evolution. We have identified the hub components of the kinase network and observed a tendency for these kinases to cluster together on a functional basis. As such, these results suggest an inherent trend to preserve scale free characteristics at a domain based modular level within large evolvable networks.",

        "abstract": "To determine whether aberrantly activated tyrosine kinases other than FLT3 and c-KIT contribute to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pathogenesis, we used high-throughput (HT) DNA sequence ana-lysis to screen exons encoding the activation loop and juxtamembrane domains of 85 tyrosine kinase genes in 188 AML patients without FLT3 or c-KIT mutations. The screen identified 30 nonsynonymous sequence variations in 22 different kinases not previously reported in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) databases. These included a novel FLT3 activating allele and a previously described activating mutation in MET (METT1010I). The majority of novel sequence variants were stably expressed in factor-dependent Ba/F3 cells. Apart from one FLT3 allele, none of the novel variants showed constitutive phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis and none transformed Ba/F3 cells to factor-independent growth. These findings indicate the majority of these alleles are not potent tyrosine kinase activators in this cellular context and that a significant proportion of nonsynonymous sequence variants identified in HT DNA sequencing screens may not have functional significance. Although some sequence variants may represent SNPs, these data are consistent with recent reports that a significant fraction of such sequence variants are \"passenger\" rather than \"driver\" alleles and underscore the importance of functional assessment of candidate disease alleles.",

Here, we screened a kinase-specific siRNA library using an autophagy assay in human embryonic kidney 293 cells that measures lipidation of the marker protein GFP-LC3 following amino acid starvation. This screen identified ULK1 in addition to other novel candidates that could be confirmed with multiple siRNAs. Knockdown of ULK1, but not the related kinase ULK2, inhibited the autophagic response. Also, ULK1 knockdown inhibited rapamycin-induced autophagy consistent with a role downstream of mTOR. Overexpression of ULK1 inhibited autophagy and this inhibition was independent of its kinase activity. Deletion of the PDZ domain-binding Val-Tyr-Ala motif at the ULK1 C terminus generated a more potent dominant-negative protein. Further deletions revealed that the minimal ULK1 dominant-negative region could be mapped to residues 1-351. Full-length ULK1 localized to cytoplasmic structures, some of which were GFP-LC3-positive, and this localization required the conserved C-terminal domain. In contrast, ULK1-(1-351) was diffuse in the cytoplasm. These experiments reveal at least two domains in ULK1 which likely function via unique sets of effectors to regulate autophagy.",

Although cancer genome sequencing studies are beginning to reveal the mutational patterns of genes in various cancers, identifying the small subset of \"causative\" mutations from the large subset of \"non-causative\" mutations, which accumulate as a consequence of the disease, is a challenge. In this article, we present an effective machine learning approach for identifying cancer-associated mutations in human protein kinases, a class of signaling proteins known to be frequently mutated in human cancers. We evaluate the performance of 11 well known supervised learners and show that a multiple-classifier approach, which combines the performances of individual learners, significantly improves the classification of known cancer-associated mutations. We introduce several novel features related specifically to structural and functional characteristics of protein kinases and find that the level of conservation of the mutated residue at specific evolutionary depths is an important predictor of oncogenic effect. We consolidate the novel features and the multiple-classifier approach to prioritize and experimentally test a set of rare unconfirmed mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR). Our studies identify T725M and L861R as rare cancer-associated mutations inasmuch as these mutations increase EGFR activity in the absence of the activating EGF ligand in cell-based assays.",

Structural characterization identified N-terminal winged helix domain (1-84), C-terminal kinase domain (148-275), and presence of other critical residues known for ATP binding and kinase activity. Using Q-site and pocket finder, a number of well-defined substrate (peptide) binding regions were identified in the catalytic core of the protein.

However, large numbers of women relapse, highlighting the need for the discovery of new regulatory targets modulating ERalpha pathways. An siRNA screen identified kinases whose silencing alters the estrogen response including those previously implicated in regulating ERalpha activity (such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT). Among the most potent regulators was lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3), for which a role has not previously been assigned. In contrast to other modulators of ERalpha activity, LMTK3 seems to have been subject to Darwinian positive selection, a noteworthy result given the unique susceptibility of humans to ERalpha+ breast cancer. LMTK3 acts by decreasing the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) and the phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473), thereby increasing binding of forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) to the ESR1 promoter. LMTK3 phosphorylated ERalpha, protecting it from proteasomal degradation in vitro. Silencing of LMTK3 reduced tumor volume in an orthotopic mouse model and abrogated proliferation of ERalpha+ but not ERalpha- cells, indicative of its role in ERalpha activity. In human cancers, LMTK3 abundance and intronic polymorphisms were significantly associated with disease-free and overall survival and predicted response to endocrine therapies. These findings yield insights into the natural history of breast cancer in humans and reveal LMTK3 as a new therapeutic target.",

Multiple elements of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway scored in the screen. As a regulator of carbon and nucleotide metabolism, AMPK is poised to activate many of the metabolic pathways induced by HCMV infection.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The cause of B lymphocyte hyperactivity and autoantibody production in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains unclear. Previously, we identified abnormalities in the level and translocation of signaling molecules in B cells in SLE patients. The present study was undertaken to examine the extent of signaling abnormalities that relate to altered B cell responses in SLE.\\n\\nMETHODS: B lymphocytes from 88 SLE patients and 72 healthy controls were isolated from blood by negative selection. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation and cellular kinase levels were analyzed by Western blotting, flow cytometry, and a kinome array protocol. Changes in protein phosphorylation were determined in ex vivo B cells and following B cell receptor engagement.\\n\\nRESULTS: Differences in tyrosine phosphorylation in B cells from patients with SLE, compared with matched controls, were demonstrated. Further, the kinome array analysis identified changes in the activation of key kinases, i.e., the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which regulates survival and differentiation, was up-regulated and the activity of Rac and Rho kinases, which regulate the cytoskeleton and migration, was increased. In contrast, the activity of ATR, which regulates the cell cycle, was down-regulated in SLE patients compared with controls. Differences in signaling pathways were seen in all SLE B lymphocyte subsets that manifested phenotypic features of immature, mature, and memory cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This study revealed dysregulation in multiple signaling pathways that control key responses in B cells of SLE patients. Data generated in this study provide a molecular basis for further analysis of the altered B lymphocyte responses in SLE.",

All Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-associated meningiomas and ~60% of sporadic meningiomas show loss of NF2 tumor suppressor protein. There are no effective medical therapies for progressive and recurrent meningiomas. Our previous work demonstrated aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling that led to ongoing clinical trials with rapamycin analogs for NF2 and sporadic meningioma patients. Here we performed a high-throughput kinome screen to identify kinases responsible for mTORC1 pathway activation in NF2-deficient meningioma cells. Among the emerging top candidates were the mTORC2-specific target serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) and p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). In NF2-deficient meningioma cells, inhibition of SGK1 rescues mTORC1 activation, and SGK1 activation is sensitive to dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014, but not to rapamycin. PAK1 inhibition also leads to attenuated mTORC1 but not mTORC2 signaling, suggesting that mTORC2/SGK1 and Rac1/PAK1 pathways are independently responsible for mTORC1 activation in NF2-deficient meningiomas. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we generated isogenic human arachnoidal cell lines (ACs), the origin cell type for meningiomas, expressing or lacking NF2. NF2-null CRISPR ACs recapitulate the signaling of NF2-deficient meningioma cells. Interestingly, we observe increased  SGK1  transcription and protein expression in NF2-CRISPR ACs and in primary NF2-negative meningioma lines. Moreover, we demonstrate that the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor, AZD2014 is superior to rapamycin and PAK inhibitor FRAX597 in blocking proliferation of meningioma cells. Importantly, AZD2014 is currently in use in several clinical trials of cancer. Therefore, we believe that AZD2014 may provide therapeutic advantage over rapalogs for recurrent and progressive meningiomas.",

        "abstract": "Despite vast improvements in our understanding of cancer genetics, a large percentage of cancer cases present without knowledge of the causative genetic events. Tyrosine kinases are frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous types of cancer, but identification and validation of tyrosine kinase targets in cancer can be a time-consuming process. We report the establishment of an efficient, functional screening assay using RNAi technology to directly assess and compare the effect of individually targeting each member of the tyrosine kinase family. We demonstrate that siRNA screening can identify tyrosine kinase targets containing activating mutations in Janus kinase (JAK) 3 (A572V) in CMK cells and c-KIT (V560G) in HMC1.1 cells. In addition, this assay identifies targets that do not contain mutations, such as JAK1 and the focal adhesion kinases (FAK), that are crucial to the survival of the cancer cells. This technique, with additional development, might eventually offer the potential to match specific therapies with individual patients based on a functional assay.",

        "abstract": "Gemcitabine is among the most efficacious and widely used antimetabolite agents. Its molecular targets are ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) and elongating DNA. Acquired and de novo resistance as a result of RRM1 overexpression are major obstacles to therapeutic efficacy. We deployed a synthetic lethality screen to investigate if knockdown of 87 selected protein kinases by siRNA could overcome RRM1-dependent gemcitabine resistance in high and low RRM1-expressing model systems. The models included genetically RRM1-modified lung and breast cancer cell lines, cell lines with gemcitabine-induced RRM1 overexpression, and a series of naturally gemcitabine-resistant cell lines. Lead molecular targets were validated by determination of differential gemcitabine activity using cell lines with and without target knock down, and by assessing synergistic activity between gemcitabine and an inhibitor of the lead target. CHK1 was identified has the kinase with the most significant and robust interaction, and it was validated using AZD7762, a small-molecule ATP-competitive inhibitor of CHK1 activation. Synergism between CHK1 inhibition and RRM1-dependent gemcitabine efficacy was observed in cells with high RRM1 levels, while antagonism was observed in cells with low RRM1 levels. In addition, four cell lines with natural gemcitabine resistance demonstrated improved gemcitabine efficacy after CHK1 inhibition. In tumor specimens from 187 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, total CHK1 and RRM1 in situ protein levels were significantly (p = 0.003) and inversely correlated. We conclude that inhibition of CHK1 may have its greatest clinical utility in malignancies where gemcitabine resistance is a result of elevated RRM1 levels. We also conclude that CHK1 inhibition in tumors with low RRM1 levels may be detrimental to gemcitabine efficacy.",

This includes the entire tyrosine kinase-like (TKL) group, which is expanded in Dictyostelium and includes several novel receptor kinases. Dictyostelium lacks tyrosine kinase group kinases, and most tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be mediated by TKL kinases. About half of Dictyostelium kinases occur in subfamilies not present in yeast or metazoa, suggesting that protein kinases have played key roles in the adaptation of Dictyostelium to its habitat.

A common complication of GC therapy is insulin resistance, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains obscure. Evidence is increasing for rapid genomic-independent GC action on cellular physiology. Here, we generate a comprehensive description of nongenomic GC effects on insulin signaling using peptide arrays containing 1,176 different kinase consensus substrates. Reduced kinase activities of the insulin receptor (INSR) and several downstream INSR signaling intermediates (i.e. p70S6k, AMP-activated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and Fyn) were detected in adipocytes and T lymphocytes due to short-term treatment with dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic fluorinated GC. Western blot analysis confirmed suppressed phosphorylation of the INSR and a series of downstream INSR targets (i.e. INSR substrate-1, p70S6k, protein kinase B, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase, Fyn, and glycogen synthase kinase-3) after DEX treatment. DEX inhibited insulin signaling through a GR-dependent (RU486 sensitive) and transcription-independent (actinomycin D insensitive) mechanism. Overall, we postulate here a molecular mechanism for GC-induced insulin resistance based on nongenomic GR-dependent inhibition of insulin signaling.",

        "abstract": "The protein kinases are a large family of enzymes that play fundamental roles in propagating signals within the cell. Because of the high degree of binding site similarity shared among protein kinases, designing drug compounds with high specificity among the kinases has proven difficult. However, computational approaches to comparing the 3-dimensional geometry and physicochemical properties of key binding site residue positions have been shown to be informative of inhibitor selectivity. The Combinatorial Clustering Of Residue Position Subsets (ccorps) method, introduced here, provides a semi-supervised learning approach for identifying structural features that are correlated with a given set of annotation labels. Here, ccorps is applied to the problem of identifying structural features of the kinase atp binding site that are informative of inhibitor binding. ccorps is demonstrated to make perfect or near-perfect predictions for the binding affinity profile of 8 of the 38 kinase inhibitors studied, while only having overall poor predictive ability for 1 of the 38 compounds. Additionally, ccorps is shown to identify shared structural features across phylogenetically diverse groups of kinases that are correlated with binding affinity for particular inhibitors; such instances of structural similarity among phylogenetically diverse kinases are also shown to not be rare among kinases. Finally, these function-specific structural features may serve as potential starting points for the development of highly specific kinase inhibitors.",

Identifying the kinases involved in the pathologic phosphorylation of tau may provide targets at which to aim new AD-modifying treatments. RESULTS: We report results from a screen of 572 kinases in the human genome for effects on tau hyperphosphorylation using a loss of function, high-throughput RNAi approach. We confirm effects of three kinases from this screen, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 2 (EIF2AK2), the dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), and the A-kinase anchor protein 13 (AKAP13) on tau phosphorylation at the 12E8 epitope (serine 262/serine 356). We provide evidence that EIF2AK2 effects may result from effects on tau protein expression, whereas DYRK1A and AKAP13 are likely more specifically involved in tau phosphorylation pathways. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify novel kinases that phosphorylate tau protein and provide a valuable reference data set describing the kinases involved in phosphorylating tau at an AD-relevant epitope.",

Here, we present a systematic analysis of protein kinases in the budding yeast, screening for differential localization during filamentous growth. Filamentous growth is an important stress response involving mitogen-activated protein kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase signaling modules, wherein yeast cells form interconnected and elongated chains. Because standard strains of yeast are nonfilamentous, we constructed a unique set of 125 kinase-yellow fluorescent protein chimeras in the filamentous \u03a31278b strain for this study. In total, we identified six cytoplasmic kinases (Bcy1p, Fus3p, Ksp1p, Kss1p, Sks1p, and Tpk2p) that localize predominantly to the nucleus during filamentous growth. These kinases form part of an interdependent, localization-based regulatory network: deletion of each individual kinase, or loss of kinase activity, disrupts the nuclear translocation of at least two other kinases. In particular, this study highlights a previously unknown function for the kinase Ksp1p, indicating the essentiality of its nuclear translocation during yeast filamentous growth. Thus, the localization of Ksp1p and the other kinases identified here is tightly controlled during filamentous growth, representing an overlooked regulatory component of this stress response.",

RS1 is in the catalytic loop, RS2 is the Phe in the DFG motif, RS3 is at the C-terminus of the ??C-Helix, and RS4 is at the beginning of ??4. Assembly of the R-spine is typically facilitated by phosphorylation of the Activation Loop. The assembled R-spine brings together all of the functional motifs that are essential for transferring the phosphate from ATP to a tethered protein substrate. This includes the G-Loop, which anchors the ATP, the catalytic loop, the DFG motif fused to the Activation Loop, and the ??C-Helix. We focus here on the properties of the ??C-Helix showing 1) how residues communicate with different parts of the molecule, 2) how it is recruited to the active site as a consequence of assembling of the R-spine, and 3) how it is regulated by linkers/motifs/proteins that lie outside the conserved kinase core.

It constitutes about 3% of all malignancies in women and accounts for 5% of all female cancer related deaths. A standard treatment is cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, and re-treatment with platinum based chemotherapy at the time of relapse. In order to improve cisplatin response in ovarian cancer cells, we utilized a high-throughput RNAi screening to identify kinase modulators. Methods: A high-throughput RNAi screen was performed using a siRNA library targeting 572 kinases to identify potentiators of cisplatin response in the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3. Results: RNAi screening identified at least 55 siRNAs that potentiated the growth inhibitory effects of cisplatin in SKOV3 cells. Inhibition of ATR and CHK1 resulted in the greatest modulation of cisplatin response. Drug dose response of cisplatin in the presence of siRNA validated the effects of these target genes. To show that the siRNA data could be successfully translated into potential therapeutic strategies, CHK1 was further targeted with small molecule inhibitor PD 407824 in combination with cisplatin. Results showed that treatment of SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells with CHK1 inhibitor PD 407824 led to sensitization of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin.

Binding data (% binding) for 451 human kinases (~80% of the human kinome) were initially collected at a single concentration (10 uM). For kinases that displayed significant binding, potencies (KD) were measured in dose-response format. Results At a common concentration of 100 nM, imatinib and nintedanib bound to 12 and 50 kinases, respectively. Maximal drug concentrations (Cmax) observed in patients were used to project therapeutically relevant kinase inhibition for both drugs. Using these criteria, nintedanib binds 44 kinases at drug levels seen in patients (KD < Cmax of 64 nM). Imatinib binds 34 kinases at drug levels seen in patients (KD < Cmax of 7500 nM). 14 kinases were bound by both compounds, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB and VEGFR2. Conclusions Our results suggest that nintedanib and imatinib have partially overlapping inhibition profiles; the kinases that are targeted by both agents are unlikely to be responsible for efficacy differences. Further work is required to identify which of the remaining kinase target (s) are responsible for efficacy in IPF and could therefore represent targets for follow-up compounds.",

Understanding the relationship(s) between CASP3 and its PK substrates is necessary to delineate the apoptosis signaling cascades that are controlled by CASP3 activity. We report herein the characterization of a CASP3-substrate kinome using a simple cell-free system to synthesize a library that contained 304 PKs tagged at their N- and C-termini (NCtagged PKs) and a luminescence assay to report CASP3 cleavage events. Forty-three PKs, including 30 newly identified PKs, were found to be CASP3 substrates, and 28 cleavage sites in 23 PKs were determined. Interestingly, 16 out of the 23 PKs have cleavage sites within 60 residues of their N- or C-termini. Furthermore, 29 of the PKs were cleaved in apoptotic cells, including five that were cleaved near their termini in vitro. In total, approximately 14% of the PKs tested were CASP3 substrates, suggesting that CASP3 cleavage of PKs may be a signature event in apoptotic-signaling cascades. This proteolytic assay method would identify other protease substrates.",

        "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) triggers apoptosis selectively in tumor cells through interaction with TRAIL-R1/DR4 or TRAIL-R2/DR5 and this process is considered a promising avenue for cancer treatment. TRAIL resistance, however, is frequently encountered and hampers anti-cancer activity. Here we show that whereas H460 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells display canonical TRAIL-dependent apoptosis, A549 and SW1573 NSCLC cells are TRAIL resistant and display pro-tumorigenic activity, in particular invasion, following TRAIL treatment. We exploit this situation to contrast TRAIL effects on the kinome of apoptosis-sensitive cells to that of NSCLC cells in which non-canonical effects predominate, employing peptide arrays displaying 1024 different kinase pseudosubstrates more or less comprehensively covering the human kinome. We observed that failure of a therapeutic response to TRAIL coincides with the activation of a non-canonical TRAIL-induced signaling pathway involving, amongst others, Src, STAT3, FAK, ERK and Akt. The use of selective TRAIL variants against TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 subsequently showed that this non-canonical migration and invasion is mediated through TRAIL-R2. Short-hairpin-mediated silencing of RIP1 kinase prevented TRAIL-induced Src and STAT3 phosphorylation and reduced TRAIL-induced migration and invasion of A549 cells. Inhibition of Src or STAT3 by shRNA or chemical inhibitors including dasatinib and 5,15-diphenylporphyrin blocked TRAIL-induced invasion. FAK, AKT and ERK were activated in a RIP1-independent way and inhibition of AKT sensitized A549 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We thus identified RIP1-dependent and -independent non-canonical TRAIL kinase cascades in which Src and AKT are instrumental and could be exploited as co-targets in TRAIL therapy for NSCLC.",

The drug is also used for the treatment of patients with an elevated serum TG levels and for patients with primary dysbetaliproteinemia, who do not respond adequately to diet. Atorvastatin calcium is also indicated to reduce the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (e.g., LDL apheresis). Metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the drug Atorvastatin calcium is presented in this chapter. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, toxicity, and elimination (ADMTE) properties of the drug are discussed in this chapter. The chapter also discusses toxicity, such as muscle-related toxicity, gastrointestinal side effects, liver-related toxicity, and other side effects. Myotoxic side effects, including myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, have been observed with the usage of Atorvastatin calcium. Painful myalgia with a significant creatine kinase release (>2000 IU/l) is also associated with the use of Atorvastatin. Gastrointestinal side effects, such as constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain, are common with the consumption of the drug. Hepatic dysfunction due to Atorvastatin administration is characterized by a raised serum aspartate (AST) or alanine (ALT) level.

        "abstract": "Clopidogrel contains a center of dissymmetry, and hence is capable of being resolved into its two mirror image compounds. It has been found that only the (S)-enantiomer, which corresponds to the dextrorotatory form, has antithrombotic activity and that the (R)-enantiomer, which corresponds to the levorotatory form, does not exhibit antithrombotic activity. Moreover, in animal studies, the (R)-enantiomer triggered convulsions at high doses. Consequently, (R)-clopidogrel bisulfate is considered to be one of the impurities in (S)-clopidogrel bisulfate bulk drug substance. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized in vivo by carboxylesterase hydrolysis on the ester function, resulting in the formation of clopidogrel carboxylic acid (CCA) as the inactive metabolite of clopidogrel. In addition, small amounts of clopidogrel are converted to a pharmacologically active metabolite (AM) via the intermediate metabolite inactive 2-oxoclopidogrel, which is then converted to an AM by a two-step cytochrome P450 oxidation process. Due to the instability of clopidogrel AM and the abundant availability of the more stable CCA in human plasma, CCA is used to indirectly determine the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel. Furthermore, there is also a possibility that (S)-clopidogrel undergoes an in vivo chiral inversion into the other clopidogrel enantiomer, which becomes hydrolyzed to (R)-CCA. Metabolic pathways and potential in vivo chiral inversions of clopidogrel are described. Until recently, only chromatographic methods were used to determine clopidogrel in biological samples. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

Over time, it became clear that optical activity could exist in compounds having no asymmetric atoms, and that other compounds existed that contained two or more asymmetric carbons, but still could not be rendered optically active. These findings necessitated a return to the proposal of Pasteur, who held that optical activity is a consequence of molecular dissymmetry. In other words, a molecule superimposable with its mirror image cannot be optically active, and any molecule not superimposable with its mirror image will exhibit optical activity. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "This book aims to give students neither too formal, nor too informal, access to a true classic in algebraic topology: the classification of compact surfaces (up to homeomorphism). Chapter 1 (The Classification Theorem: Informal Presentation) gives an overview of the classification theorem and outlines in which parts of the book missing notions and arguments are presented. Chapter 2 (Surfaces) gives a formal definition of surfaces. In Chapter 3 (Simplices, Complexes, and Triangulations) triangulations are defined via simplicial complexes. Chapter 4 (The Fundamental Group, Orientability) gives a quick introduction to fundamental groups, including a description of the fundamental group of the punctured plane (via winding numbers), and a definition of orientability via the fundamental group. Moreover, surfaces with boundary are introduced in this chapter. In Chapter 5 (Homology Groups), another classical invariant from algebraic topology is introduced: simplicial homology and (very briefly) singular homology. Chapter 6 (The Classification Theorem for Compact Surfaces) contains the proof of the classification theorem, based on manipulations and normal forms of certain cell complexes (similar to the outline in Chapter 1). Furthermore, the book contains several appendices. They cover visualisations of the real projective plane, a standard structural result for finitely generated Abelian groups, basic point-set topology, more historical background on the classification theorem, Thomassen's proof that every surface can be triangulated, and proofs that the authors did not want to include in the main text. The book includes many historical comments throughout and contains lots of pictures\u2014both of the mathematicians involved in the classification theorem and of examples illustrating the mathematical content. Many examples are given that help one understand the basic tools (e.g., there are several nice examples that illustrate simplicial homology). However, mathematically, the book could be more streamlined: the goal of the classification theorem of compact surfaces could be achieved with either the fundamental group or homology. Homology is used as a homeomorphism invariant and computed through triangulations; however, the central fact that simplicial homology of a simplicial complex coincides with singular homology of the geometric realisation is not proved in the book. Similarly, in Chapter 6, where the classification is used to compute fundamental groups of surfaces, the fact that the combinatorial description of the fundamental group and the ordinary fundamental group coincide is not proved. Also, other essential tools from algebraic topology (invariance of domain, the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem) are used, but not much indication on the proofs is given. Categorial language is avoided altogether and some of the definitions seem to be ad hoc (e.g., the cell complexes in Chapter 6; it would be nicer to have a single combinatorial concept attached with surfaces, not both triangulations and cell complexes), and the central notion of triangulation is multiply defined (in Chapter 3 and in Appendix E, which might be confusing). It would have been nice also if the classification up to homotopy equivalence would have been included, and if the classification up to diffeomorphism and the possible Riemannian structures would have been briefly discussed.",

Most species in this family have their pelvic fins fused into a suction disk with weak adhesion, the external lateral line being usually absent. The subfamily Gobionellinae, which includes the round goby, is mostly confined to the Caspian, Black, and Azov seas (Nelson 1994). Members of this subfamily are primarily benthic and therefore do not have a swim bladder (Nikolsky 1954). Neogobius melanostomus is a small, soft-bodied fish. Its head width is about equal to its depth; the snout is oblique and convex in profile. The anterior and middle nape, upper opercule, breast, pectoral fin lobes, and part of abdomen are covered with cycloid scales, the rest of body with weak ctenoid scales. The dorsal fins are contiguous. The second dorsal fin is uniform in height, while the first dorsal fin has a prominent posterior black spot (Berg 1949, Miller 1986). Both sexes have an erectile urogenital papilla between the anus and the base of the anal fin, a subject of sexual dimorphism (Miller 1984).",

FTV will bring an epochal change in the history of television since this function has not yet been achieved by conventional TV technology. FTV will greatly contribute to the development of industry, society, life and culture because FTV has an infinite number of viewpoints and hence it has very high sensing and representation capabilities. Tanimoto Lab of Nagoya University proposed the concept of FTV and constructed the worlds first real-time system including the complete chain of operation from image capture to display. We also realized FTV on a single PC and FTV with free listening-point audio. FTV is a ray-based system rather than a pixel-based system. We are creating ray-based image engineering through the development of FTV. MPEG regards FTV as the most challenging 3D media and has been conducting the international standardization activities of FTV.

        "abstract": "Invasions by human-introduced non-indigenous species (NIS) are one of the main threats to biodiversity and a driving force of global change (Vitousek et al. 1997, Mack et al. 2000, Clavero and Garc\ufffda-Berthou 2005). The Iberian Peninsula (IP) is a hotspot of biodiversity (M\ufffddail and Qu\ufffdzel 1999) and a knowledge of the invasive species inhabiting it is essential for conservation and environmental management. Naturalized vertebrates and plants in the IP have received considerable attention (see e.g. Vil\ufffd et al. 2001, Pleguezuelos 2002, Sobrino et al. 2002, Lloret et al. 2004, Alcaraz et al. 2005), but its invasive invertebrates are very poorly known. Although there are many records of some invertebrate invasive species, particularly crustaceans, there are very few available reviews of selected taxa of invertebrate invaders in the IP (e.g. Espadaler and Collingwood 2001). The aim of this chapter is to review the animal species naturalized in Iberian inland waters, including vertebrates and free-living and parasitic invertebrates. As usual, the taxonomy and biogeography of vertebrate species are much better known than for invertebrates, so our data for invertebrates should be regarded as a preliminary check-list. Similarly, the parasites of non-commercial aquatic species are poorly studied and the data in the IP mostly come from studies of the eel, Anguilla anguilla (Linnaeus), thus certainly underestimating the range of introduced parasites (Blanc 1997, 2001). We feel, however, that it is important to provide such a first check-list because many of the invertebrates involved are nowadays common in the IP and for many of them it is largely unknown even by biologists that they are not indigenous to the IP. Increasing the awareness on the introduced status and current distribution of these species is essential to reduce their spread and impact.",

After a survey of the patent and open literature, it was determined that aripiprazole has been crystallized in nine genuine polymorphic forms and in eight genuine solvatomorphic forms. It was also learned that several other reported \"crystal forms\" did not consist of a single solid-state phase, and were most likely mixtures of different structures. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

It is prescribed for the treatment of severe persistent asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Different methods were used to prepare (R)-(-)-salmeterol such as: mixing a sample of 4-benzyloxy-3-hydroxymethyl-??-bromoacetophenone with sodium lauryl sulfate and the mixture was added to the microbial culture of Rhodotorula rubra, treatment of p-hydroxyacetophenone with Eschenmoser's salt and carbonate exchange resin followed by a sequence of supported reagents and scavenging agents or via Rh-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. The enantioselective synthesis of (S)-salmeterol was achieved via asymmetric reduction of the azidoketone 4 by Pichia angusta yeast. Physical characteristics of salmeterol xinafoate were confirmed via: X-ray powder diffraction pattern, thermal analysis and UV, vibrational, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectroscopical data. Initial improvement in asthma control may occur within 30min following oral inhalation of salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone propionate. Clinically important improvements are maintained for up to 12h in most patients. It is extensively metabolized in the liver by hydroxylation, thus increased plasma concentrations may occur in patients with hepatic impairment.",

Accordingly, most of the today temperate freshwater fauna in this area has become established within the last 10,000\u201315,000 years, a process that has not yet stopped. Although prehistoric man had already favoured the distribution of various plant and animal species, a considerable change in species distributions started with the onset of the great expeditions and continued with the subsequent alterations of the cultural landscape. Predominantly, plant species were transported to Europe and with them various species of animals and fungi arrived. In addition to the intentional introductions, many species were transferred to European fresh waters accidentally. The general decline of species diversity in many types of ecosystems has been a result of all these activities in central Europe. This is expected to be intensified, leading to a drastic increase of non-indigenous species (NIS).",

Another is the direct stimulation of the release of this eicosanoid by vascular endothelium, and the third is the inhibition of cellular uptake and metabolism of adenosine (thereby increasing its concentration at the platelet vascular interface). The chapter outlines the procedure for synthesizing of dipyridamole.

In addition, different analytical methods for determination of vardenafil are also described in this profile. Pharmacokinetic properties of VAR have great impact on efficacy. VAR is rapidly absorbed and slowly metabolized, with an absolute bioavailability of 15%. It is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 into several metabolites, the most pharmacologically active of which is N-desethyl VAR (M1). The elimination half-life of VAR and M1 is about 4-5h. VAR is primarily excreted as metabolites in the feces and to a small extent in urine. VAR is generally well tolerated, with a favorable safety profile and few transient side effects, including headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and rhinitis. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anopheles gambiae is the primary mosquito vector of human malaria parasites in sub-Saharan Africa. To date, three innate immune signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent Toll and immune deficient (IMD) pathways and the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak-STAT) pathway, have been extensively characterized in An. gambiae. However, in addition to NF-kappaB-dependent signaling, three mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways regulated by JNK, ERK and p38 MAPK are critical mediators of innate immunity in other invertebrates and in mammals. Our understanding of the roles of the MAPK signaling cascades in anopheline innate immunity is limited, so identification of the encoded complement of these proteins, their upstream activators, and phosphorylation profiles in response to relevant immune signals was warranted.\\n\\nRESULTS: In this study, we present the orthologs and phylogeny of 17 An. gambiae MAPKs, two of which were previously unknown and two others that were incompletely annotated. We also provide detailed temporal activation profiles for ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK in An. gambiae cells in vitro to immune signals that are relevant to malaria parasite infection (human insulin, human transforming growth factor-beta1, hydrogen peroxide) and to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. These activation profiles and possible upstream regulatory pathways are interpreted in light of known MAPK signaling cascades.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The establishment of a MAPK \"road map\" based on the most advanced mosquito genome annotation can accelerate our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and broader physiology of An. gambiae and other mosquito species. Further, future efforts to develop predictive models of anopheline cell signaling responses, based on iterative construction and refinement of data-based and literature-based knowledge of the MAP kinase cascades and other networked pathways will facilitate identification of the \"master signaling regulators\" in biomedically important mosquito species.",

The major components of the RIG-I- and TLR pathways have putatively been identified, but previously unrecognised kinases may contribute to virus infection-induced activation of the IFN response. Here, we screened a human kinase cDNA library, termed the kinome, using an IFN-\u03bb1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay in HEK293 cells during Sendai virus infection. Of the 568 kinases analysed, nearly 50 enhanced IFN-\u03bb1 gene expression at least twofold in response to Sendai virus infection. The best activators were FYN (FYN oncogene related to SRC, FGR, YES), serine/threonine kinase 24, activin A receptor type 1 and SRPK1 (SFRS protein kinase 1). These kinases enhanced RIG-I-dependent IFN-\u03bb1 promoter activation via IFN-stimulated response and NF-\u03baB elements, as confirmed using mutant IFN-\u03bb1 promoter constructs. FYN and SRPK1 enhanced IFN-\u03bb1 and CXCL10 protein production via the RIG-I pathway, and stimulated RIG-I and MyD88-dependent phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors, respectively. We conclude that several previously unrecognised kinases, particularly FYN and SRPK1, positively regulate IFN-\u03bb1 and similarly regulated cytokine and chemokine genes during viral infection.",

In this study, we sought to identify kinases essential for growth of ER(+) breast cancer cells resistant to long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED). A kinome-wide siRNA screen showed that the insulin receptor (InsR) is required for growth of MCF-7/LTED cells. Knockdown of InsR and/or insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) inhibited growth of 3 of 4 LTED cell lines. Inhibition of InsR and IGF-IR with the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor OSI-906 prevented the emergence of hormone-independent cells and tumors in vivo, inhibited parental and LTED cell growth and PI3K/AKT signaling, and suppressed growth of established MCF-7 xenografts in ovariectomized mice, whereas treatment with the neutralizing IGF-IR monoclonal antibody MAB391 was ineffective. Combined treatment with OSI-906 and the ER downregulator fulvestrant more effectively suppressed hormone-independent tumor growth than either drug alone. Finally, an insulin/IGF-I gene expression signature predicted recurrence-free survival in patients with ER(+) breast cancer treated with the antiestrogen tamoxifen. We conclude that therapeutic targeting of both InsR and IGF-IR should be more effective than targeting IGF-IR alone in abrogating resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer.",

These events have motivated efforts to develop research tools that can offer insight into the causes of declining bee health as well as identify biomarkers to guide breeding programs. Here we report the development of a bee-specific peptide array for characterizing global cellular kinase activity in whole bee extracts. The arrays reveal distinct, developmentally-specific signaling profiles between bees with differential susceptibility to infestation by Varroa mites. Gene ontology analysis of the differentially phosphorylated peptides indicates that the differential susceptibility to Varroa mite infestation does not reflect compromised immunity; rather, there is evidence for mite-mediated immune suppression within the susceptible phenotype that may reduce the ability of these bees to counter secondary viral infections. This hypothesis is supported by the demonstration of more diverse viral infections in mite-infested, susceptible adult bees. The bee-specific peptide arrays are an effective tool for understanding the molecular basis of this complex phenotype as well as for the discovery and utilization of phosphorylation biomarkers for breeding programs.",

We previously identified a novel schizophrenia-associated missense mutation (valine to leucine) in the NRG1 transmembrane domain. This variant inhibits formation of the NRG1 intracellular domain (ICD) and causes decreases in dendrite formation. To assess the global effects of this mutation, we used lymphoblastoid cell lines from unaffected heterozygous carriers (Val/Leu) and non-carriers (Val/Val). Transcriptome data showed 367 genes differentially expressed between the two groups (Val/Val N = 6, Val/Leu N = 5, T test, FDR (1 %), \u03b1 = 0.05, -log10 p value >1.5). Ingenuity pathway (IPA) analyses showed inflammation and NRG1 signaling as the top pathways altered. Within NRG1 signaling, protein kinase C (PKC)-eta (PRKCH) and non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) were down-regulated in heterozygous carriers. Novel kinome profiling (serine/threonine) was performed after stimulating cells (V/V N = 6, V/L N = 6) with ErbB4, to induce release of the NRG1 ICD, and revealed significant effects of treatment on the phosphorylation of 35 peptides. IPA showed neurite outgrowth (six peptides) as the top annotated function. Phosphorylation of these peptides was significantly decreased in ErbB4-treated Val/Val but not in Val/Leu cells. These results show that perturbing NRG1 ICD formation has major effects on cell signaling, including inflammatory and neurite formation pathways, and may contribute significantly to schizophrenia pathophysiology.",

Next, we predicted the binding profile of the chemotherapy drug mitoxantrone, and chose the predicted top five kinase targets for in vitro kinase assays. Remarkably, mitoxantrone was shown to possess low nanomolar inhibitory activity against PIM1 kinase and to inhibit the PIM1-mediated phosphorylation in cancer cells. We further determined the crystal complex structure of PIM1 bound with mitoxantrone, which reveals the structural and mechanistic basis for a novel mode of PIM1 inhibition. Although mitoxantrone's mechanism of action had been originally thought to act through DNA intercalation and type II topoisomerase inhibition, we hypothesize that PIM1 kinase inhibition might also contribute to mitoxantrone's therapeutic efficacy and specificity.",

Microarray analysis of the libraries confirmed the previous results but also revealed an unforeseen preferential expression of translation- and metabolism-associated genes in the LT-HSCs.

        "abstract": "The hepatitis C virus NS5A protein plays a critical role in virus replication, conferring interferon resistance to the virus through perturbation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways. Since NS5A is a phosphoprotein, it is of considerable interest to understand the role of phosphorylation in NS5A function. In this report, we investigated the phosphorylation of NS5A by taking advantage of 119 glutathione S-transferase-tagged protein kinases purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to perform a global screening of yeast kinases capable of phosphorylating NS5A in vitro. A database BLAST search was subsequently performed by using the sequences of the yeast kinases that phosphorylated NS5A in order to identify human kinases with the highest sequence homologies. Subsequent in vitro kinase assays and phosphopeptide mapping studies confirmed that several of the homologous human protein kinases were capable of phosphorylating NS5A. In vivo phosphopeptide mapping revealed phosphopeptides common to those generated in vitro by AKT, p70S6K, MEK1, and MKK6, suggesting that these kinases may phosphorylate NS5A in mammalian cells. Significantly, rapamycin, an inhibitor commonly used to investigate the mTOR/p70S6K pathway, reduced the in vivo phosphorylation of specific NS5A phosphopeptides, strongly suggesting that p70S6 kinase and potentially related members of this group phosphorylate NS5A inside the cell. Curiously, certain of these kinases also play a major role in mRNA translation and antiapoptotic pathways, some of which are already known to be regulated by NS5A. The findings presented here demonstrate the use of high-throughput screening of the yeast kinome to facilitate the major task of identifying human NS5A protein kinases for further characterization of phosphorylation events in vivo. Our results suggest that this novel approach may be generally applicable to the screening of other protein biochemical activities by mechanistic class.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma, the most common primary malignant brain tumor, is incurable with current therapies. Genetic and molecular analyses demonstrate that glioblastomas frequently display mutations that activate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and Pi-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways. In Drosophila melanogaster, activation of RTK and PI3K pathways in glial progenitor cells creates malignant neoplastic glial tumors that display many features of human glioblastoma. In both human and Drosophila, activation of the RTK and PI3K pathways stimulates Akt signaling along with other as-yet-unknown changes that drive oncogenesis. We used this Drosophila glioblastoma model to perform a kinome-wide genetic screen for new genes required for RTK- and PI3K-dependent neoplastic transformation. Human orthologs of novel kinases uncovered by these screens were functionally assessed in mammalian glioblastoma models and human tumors. Our results revealed that the atypical kinases RIOK1 and RIOK2 are overexpressed in glioblastoma cells in an Akt-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that overexpressed RIOK2 formed a complex with RIOK1, mTor, and mTor-complex-2 components, and that overexpressed RIOK2 upregulated Akt signaling and promoted tumorigenesis in murine astrocytes. Conversely, reduced expression of RIOK1 or RIOK2 disrupted Akt signaling and caused cell cycle exit, apoptosis, and chemosensitivity in glioblastoma cells by inducing p53 activity through the RpL11-dependent ribosomal stress checkpoint. These results imply that, in glioblastoma cells, constitutive Akt signaling drives RIO kinase overexpression, which creates a feedforward loop that promotes and maintains oncogenic Akt activity through stimulation of mTor signaling. Further study of the RIO kinases as well as other kinases identified in our Drosophila screen may reveal new insights into defects underlying glioblastoma and related cancers and may reveal new therapeutic opportunities for these cancers.",

In mammalian cells and brain, LRRK2 is phosphorylated and treatment of cells with inhibitors of LRRK2 kinase activity can induce LRRK2 dephosphorylation at a cluster of serines including Ser910/935/955/973. It has been suggested that phosphorylation levels at these sites reflect LRRK2 kinase activity, however kinase-dead variants of LRRK2 or kinase activating variants do not display altered Ser935 phosphorylation levels compared to wild type. Furthermore, Ser910/935/955/973 are not autophosphorylation sites, therefore, it is unclear if inhibitor induced dephosphorylation depends on the activity of compounds on LRRK2 or on yet to be identified upstream kinases. Here we used a panel of 160 ATP competitive and cell permeable kinase inhibitors directed against all branches of the kinome and tested their activity on LRRK2 in vitro using a peptide-substrate-based kinase assay. In neuronal SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing LRRK2 we used compound-induced dephosphorylation of Ser935 as readout. In silico docking of selected compounds was performed using a modeled LRRK2 kinase structure. Receiver operating characteristic plots demonstrated that the obtained docking scores to the LRRK2 ATP binding site correlated with in vitro and cellular compound activity. We also found that in vitro potency showed a high degree of correlation to cellular compound induced LRRK2 dephosphorylation activity across multiple compound classes. Therefore, acute LRRK2 dephosphorylation at Ser935 in inhibitor treated cells involves a strong component of inhibitor activity on LRRK2 itself, without excluding a role for upstream kinases. Understanding the regulation of LRRK2 phosphorylation by kinase inhibitors aids our understanding of LRRK2 signaling and may lead to development of new classes of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors.",

Treatment with single TKI represents a logical step towards personalized cancer therapy, but intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms limit their long-term benefit. In this study, we deployed RNAi-based functional genomic screens to identify protein kinases controlling the intrinsic sensitivity of FGFR1-dependent lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) cells to ponatinib, a multi-kinase FGFR-active inhibitor. We identified and validated a synthetic lethal interaction between Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (MTOR) and ponatinib in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. Additionally, treatment with MTOR-targeting shRNAs and pharmacological inhibitors revealed that MTOR is an essential protein kinase in other FGFR1-expressing cancer cells. The combination of FGFR inhibitors and MTOR or AKT inhibitors resulted in synergistic growth suppression vitro. Notably, tumor xenografts generated from FGFR1-dependent lung cancer cells exhibited only modest sensitivity to monotherapy with the FGFR-specific TKI, AZD4547, but when combined with the MTOR inhibitor, AZD2014, significantly attenuated tumor growth and prolonged survival. Our findings support the existence of a signaling network wherein FGFR1-driven ERK and activated MTOR/AKT represent distinct arms required to induce full transformation. Further, they suggest clinical efficacy of treatments for FGFR1-driven lung cancers and HNSCC may be achieved by combining MTOR inhibitors and FGFR-specific TKI.",

These bacteria show little regulation in gene expression, suggesting an important role for the control of protein activities. We have studied protein phosphorylation in M. pneumoniae to identify phosphorylated proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry allowed the detection of 63 phosphorylated proteins, many of them enzymes of central carbon metabolism and proteins related to host cell adhesion. We identified 16 phosphorylation sites, among them 8 serine and 8 threonine residues, respectively. A phosphoproteome analysis with mutants affected in the two annotated protein kinase genes or in the single known protein phosphatase gene suggested that only one protein (HPr) is phosphorylated by the HPr kinase, HPrK, whereas four adhesion-related or surface proteins were targets of the protein kinase C, PrkC. A comparison with the phosphoproteomes of other bacteria revealed that protein phosphorylation is evolutionarily only poorly conserved. Only one single protein with an identified phosphorylation site, a phosphosugar mutase (ManB in M. pneumoniae), is phosphorylated on a conserved serine residue in all studied organisms from archaea and bacteria to man. We demonstrate that this protein undergoes autophosphorylation. This explains the strong conservation of this phosphorylation event. For most other proteins, even if they are phosphorylated in different species, the actual phosphorylation sites are different. This suggests that protein phosphorylation is a form of adaptation of the bacteria to the specific needs of their particular ecological niche.",

The goal of this study is to identify kinase based potential therapeutic target in osteosarcomas.\\n\\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used a lentiviral-based shRNA kinase library to screen for kinases which play a role in osteosarcoma cell survival. The cell proliferation assay was used to evaluate cell growth and survival. siRNA assays were applied to confirm the observed phenotypic changes resulting from the loss of kinase gene expression. CDK11 (PITSLRE) was identified as essential for the survival of osteosarcoma cells, and its expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Overall patient survival was correlated with the CDK11 expression and its prognosis. The role of CDK11 expression in sustaining osteosarcoma growth was further evaluated in an osteosarcoma xenograft model in vivo.\\n\\nRESULTS: Osteosarcoma cells display high levels of CDK11 expression. CDK11 expression knocked down by either lentiviral shRNA or siRNA inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that patients with osteosarcoma with high CDK11 tumor expression levels were associated with significantly shorter survival than patients with osteosarcoma with low level of tumor CDK11 expression. Systemic in vivo administration of in vivo ready siRNA of CDK11 reduced the tumor growth in an osteosarcoma subcutaneous xenograft model.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We show that CDK11 signaling is essential in osteosarcoma cell growth and survival, further elucidating the regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression of CDK11 and ultimately develop a CDK11 inhibitor that may provide therapeutic benefit against osteosarcoma.",

This has spurred the development of multitargeted therapies, including small molecules that can inhibit multiple kinases. A major challenge in designing such molecules is to determine which kinases to inhibit in each cancer to maximize efficacy and therapeutic index. We describe an approach to this problem implementing RNA interference technology. In order to identify Akt-cooperating kinases, we screened a library of kinase-directed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for enhanced cancer cell killing in the presence of Akt inhibitor A-443654. siRNAs targeting casein kinase I gamma 3 (CSNK1G3) or the inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) significantly enhanced A-443654-mediated cell killing, and caused decreases in Akt Ser-473 and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation. Small molecules targeting CSNK1G3 and/or IPMK in addition to Akt may thus exhibit increased efficacy and have the potential for improved therapeutic index.",

The prototypical (canonical) NF-\u03baB pathway controls cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation in response to stimulation by the mononuclear cytokine, TNF. Despite intensive investigation, the spectrum of kinases involved in the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway has not yet been systematically determined. Here we have applied a high throughput-siRNA (HT-siRNA)-mediated loss-of-function screening assay to identify novel kinases important in TNF-induced NF-\u03baB signaling. Type II A549 epithelial cells stably expressing an IL-8/Luciferase reporter gene optimized for HT-siRNA format (Z prime score of 0.65) and siRNAs for 636 human kinases were reverse-transfected and screened in the assay. 36 candidate genes were identified that inhibited TNF signaling with a z score deviation of <-1.3 in replicate plates. From this group, 11 kinases were selected for independent validation, of which 8 were successfully silenced. Six kinases were validated, including ATM, CDK2,-5 and -7, CALM3, MAPAKP5, and MAP3K/MEKK3. The surprising function of ATM in TNF signaling was confirmed where reduced NF-kB/RelA translocation and Ser 276 phosphorylation was seen in ATM(-/-)MEFs. These data indicate that ATM is a key regulatory kinase that may control global NF-\u03baB activation in the TNF-induced canonical pathway.",

Dientamoeba was once described as a rare and harmless commensal though recent reports suggest it is common and potentially pathogenic. Molecular data on Dientamoeba is scarce which limits our understanding of this parasite. To address this, sequencing of the Dientamoeba transcriptome was performed. Messenger RNA was extracted from cultured Dientamoeba trophozoites originating from clinical stool specimens, and sequenced using Roche GS FLX and Illumina HiSeq technologies. In total 6,595 Dientamoeba transcripts were identified. These sequences were analysed using the BLAST2GO software suite and via BLAST comparisons to sequences available from TrichDB, GenBank, MEROPS and kinase.com. Several novel KEGG pathway maps were generated and gene ontology analysis was also performed. These results are thoroughly discussed guided by knowledge available for other related protozoa. Attention is paid to the novel biological insights afforded by this data including peptidases and kinases of Dientamoeba, as well as its metabolism, novel chemotherapeutics and possible mechanisms of pathogenicity. Currently, this work represents the largest contribution to our understanding of Dientamoeba molecular biology and also represents a major contribution to our understanding of the trichomonads generally, many of which are important pathogens of humans and animals.",

Surprisingly, amongst the thousands of protein kinase targets that have been reported in the literature, there are not so many for which there is good evidence for phosphorylation having functional consequences in vivo. Here we review the approaches that can be used to establish physiologically important protein phosphorylation according to the Krebs and Beavo criteria, taking as an example heart 6-phosphofruco-2-kinase phosphorylation-induced activation by insulin. We also point out the pitfalls of the various techniques that can be used to implicate the involvement of a particular protein kinase in a biological response.

        "abstract": "The central role of the BRAF-MEK-ERK pathway in controlling cell fate has made this pathway a primary target for deregulated activation in cancer. BRaf is activated by Ras proteins allowing Ras oncogenes to constitutively activate the pathway. Activating BRaf mutations are also frequent in several cancers, being the most common oncogenic mutation in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma. There are currently two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, approved for treatment of malignant melanoma having activating BRaf mutations. Concurrent administration of BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor (trametinib) is significantly more active in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma than either single agent alone, but progression to resistance ultimately occurs by different mechanisms that increase the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Such adaptive changes in tumor cell signaling networks allow bypass of targeted oncoprotein inhibition. This is true with targeted inhibitors for BRaf and MEK as well as specific inhibitors for AKT, mTOR, and many receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGF receptor (EGFR) and HER2. It is this adaptive response to targeted kinase inhibitors that contributes to the failure of single-agent kinase inhibitors to have durable responses. This failure is seen in virtually all cancers treated with single-agent kinase inhibitors, most of which are not as dependent on a single signaling pathway such as BRaf-MEK-ERK in melanoma. Thus, understanding the breadth of adaptive reprogramming responses to specific targeted kinase inhibition will be critical to develop appropriate combination therapies for durable clinical responses.

        "abstract": "To identify host factors relevant for SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication, we performed an siRNA library screen targeting the human kinome. Protein kinases are key regulators of many cellular functions and the systematic knockdown of their expression should provide a broad perspective on factors and pathways promoting or antagonizing coronavirus replication. In addition to 40 proteins that promote SARS-CoV replication, our study identified 90 factors exhibiting an antiviral effect. Pathway analysis grouped subsets of these factors in specific cellular processes, including the innate immune response and the metabolism of complex lipids, which thus appear to play a role in SARS-CoV infection. Several factors were selected for in-depth validation in follow-up experiments. In cells depleted for the beta2 subunit of the coatomer protein complex (COPB2), the strongest proviral hit, we observed reduced SARS-CoV protein expression and a >2-log reduction in virus yield. Knockdown of the COPB2-related proteins COPB1 and Golgi-specific brefeldin A-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) also suggested that COPI-coated vesicles and/or the early secretory pathway are important for SARS-CoV replication. Depletion of the antiviral double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) enhanced virus replication in the primary screen, and validation experiments confirmed increased SARS-CoV protein expression and virus production upon PKR depletion. In addition, cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) was identified as a novel antiviral host factor in SARS-CoV replication. The inventory of pro- and antiviral host factors and pathways described here substantiates and expands our understanding of SARS-CoV replication and may contribute to the identification of novel targets for antiviral therapy. IMPORTANCE: Replication of all viruses including SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) depends on and is influenced by cellular pathways. Although substantial progress has been made in dissecting the coronavirus replicative cycle, our understanding of the host factors that stimulate (proviral factors) or restrict (antiviral factors) infection remains far from complete. To study the role of host proteins in SARS-CoV infection, we set out to systematically identify kinase-regulated processes that influence virus replication. Protein kinases are key regulators in signal transduction, control a wide variety of cellular processes, and many of them are targets of approved drugs and other compounds. Our screen identified a variety of hits and will form the basis for more detailed follow-up studies that should contribute to a better understanding of SARS-CoV replication and coronavirus-host interactions in general. The identified factors could be interesting targets for the development of host-directed antiviral therapy to treat infections with SARS-CoV or other pathogenic coronaviruses.",

Because of their important role maintaining proper cellular function, they are often misregulated during tumorigenesis and associated with clinical outcomes in cancer patients, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, less is known about the global expression status of these genes in renal cell carcinoma and their association with clinical outcomes. We performed a systematic analysis of gene expression for 503 kinases in 93 tumor samples and adjacent normal tissues. Expression patterns for 41 kinases were able to clearly differentiate tumor and normal samples. Expression of I-kappa-B kinase epsilon (IKBKE) was associated with a 5.3-fold increased risk of dying [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.93-14.59, P-value: 0.0012]. Individuals with high IKBKE expression were at a significantly increased risk of death (hazard ratio: 3.34, 95% CI: 1.07-10.40, P-value: 0.038) resulting in a significantly reduced overall survival time compared with those with low IKBKE tumor expression (P-value: 0.049). These results for IKBKE were validated in a replication population consisting of 237 ccRCC patients (P-value: 0.0021). Furthermore, IKBKE was observed to be higher expressed in tumors compared with adjacent normal tissues (P-value < 10(-7)). IKBKE is a member of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway and interestingly, gene expression patterns for other members of the NF-\u03baB pathway were not associated with survival, suggesting that IKBKE gene expression may be an independent marker of variation in overall survival. Overall, these results support a novel role for IKBKE expression in modulating overall survival in ccRCC patients.",

        "abstract": "Kinases constitute an important class of therapeutic targets being explored both by academia and the pharmaceutical industry. The major focus of this effort was directed toward the identification of ATP competitive inhibitors. Although it has long been recognized that the intracellular concentration of ATP is very different from the concentrations utilized in biochemical enzyme assays, little thought has been devoted to incorporating this discrepancy into our understanding of translation from enzyme inhibition to cellular function. Significant work has been dedicated to the discovery of JAK kinase inhibitors; however, a disconnect between enzyme and cellular function is prominently displayed in the literature for this class of inhibitors. Herein, we demonstrate utilizing the four JAK family members that the difference in the ATP Km of each individual kinase has a significant impact on the enzyme to cell inhibition translation. We evaluated a large number of JAK inhibitors in enzymatic assays utilizing either 1 mM ATP or Km ATP for the four isoforms as well as in primary cell assays. This data set provided the opportunity to examine individual kinase contributions to the heterodimeric kinase complexes mediating cellular signaling. In contrast to a recent study, we demonstrate that for IL-15 cytokine signaling it is sufficient to inhibit either JAK1 or JAK3 to fully inhibit downstream STAT5 phosphorylation. This additional data thus provides a critical piece of information explaining why JAK1 has incorrectly been thought to have a dominant role over JAK3. Beyond enabling a deeper understanding of JAK signaling, conducting similar analyses for other kinases by taking into account potency at high ATP rather than Km ATP may provide crucial insights into a compound's activity and selectivity in cellular contexts.",

Five-wk-old homozygous Ren2 rats were left untreated or treated with the ACEi ramipril (1 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) for 4 wk; age-matched SD rats served as controls (n = 5 each). Peptide array chips were incubated with renal cortical lysates in the presence of radioactively labeled ATP. Radioactivity incorporated into the substrate motifs was measured to quantify kinase activity. A number of kinases with modulated activities, which might contribute to renal damage, were validated by Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry. Relevant kinases identified by the peptide array and confirmed using conventional techniques included p38 MAP kinase and PDGF receptor-beta, which were increased in Ren2 and reversed by ACEi. Furthermore, insulin receptor signaling was reduced in Ren2 compared with control rats, and G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) activity decreased in Ren2 + ACEi compared with untreated Ren2 rats.

However, in practice, employees have two other options: to move to another job within the same company (internal turnover) or stay in their current job for an indefinite period. From the perspective of turnover prevention, it would be advantageous if research would identify intention profiles according to these three options. This study aims to explore the different intention profiles of employees and whether job satisfaction; job-search behavior and rates of voluntary and internal turnover differ according to these profiles. The analysis of results collected from 434 agents from three call centers suggests the existence of four intention profiles, which are about equal in number: (1) Stay in present job (strong intention to remain in current job, low intention to progress internally and low intention to leave for a job externally); (2) Stay whilst waiting to progress (strong intention to remain in current job, but strong intention to progress to a job internally and low intention to leave for a job externally); (3) Priority is to progress (low intention to stay in current job, strong intention to progress internally and low intention to leave for an external job); (4) Priority is to move on (low intention to stay in current job, strong intention to progress internally and leave for a job externally).The results of the study show that these four intention profiles reveal different levels of job satisfaction and job-search behavior. Similarly, the rates of voluntary staff turnover and internal turnover vary according to the intention profile. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Oxygen profiles obtained with spin-labeled lipid chains have a Boltzmann sigmoidal dependence on the depth into each lipid leaflet, which represents a two-compartment distribution between outer and inner regions of the membrane, with a transfer free energy that depends linearly on distance from the dividing planes. Transmembrane profiles for intramembrane polarity, and for water penetration into the membrane, have an identical form, but are of the reverse sign. Comparison with recently published oxygen profiles from a site-specifically spin-labeled alpha-helical transmembrane peptide validates the use of spin-labeled lipids for all these profiles and provides the necessary bridge to generate the full bilayer from a single lipid leaflet.",

        "abstract": "In this chapter, the extension of the multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) method to the simultaneous analysis of multiple data sets bearing information in common is presented. The basic assumption in this extension of multivariate curve resolution (MCR) methods is the fulfillment of a common bilinear model for the simultaneously analyzed data sets, which implies that they share at least some parts of their data variance, e.g.,. some chemical components or species are common among them. Different data arrangements are possible in this approach, depending on the common information shared among the different simultaneously analyzed data sets. If the common information is shared in the variables or column space, a column-wise data matrix augmentation scheme will be adequate to improve MCR analysis and results. On the contrary, if the common information is shared in the samples or row space, a row-wise data matrix augmentation scheme will be more adequate to improve MCR analysis and results. Finally, when these two possibilities are present, a row- and column-wise data matrix augmentation will give the optimal data arrangement for optimal MCR analysis and results. Using these different data matrix augmentation schemes, MCR analysis of multiset arrangements and of more structured multiway data sets is possible. Implementation of constraints during the alternating least squares (ALS) optimization can be tailored according to the specific features of each data matrix and higher order structures, allowing also for the fulfillment of trilinear and multilinear models. Apart from improved resolution capabilities, extended MCR via matrix augmentation is also a powerful tool to break chemical rank deficiencies that often plague chemical reaction-based systems and to perform accurate quantitative estimations deduced from the relative comparison of some parameters of the resolved concentration profiles (height, area) of the common components in the different data sets. A further extension of MCR methods is the inclusion of a priori fundamental knowledge or laws about the nature or behavior of some (or all) of the components in the system. This implies the inclusion of physical or deterministic (hard) modeling in the general frame of the MCR soft bilinear modeling. Kinetics and thermodynamics are the key disciplines of chemistry and are fundamental to all aspects of reaction analysis, where either equilibria mass action laws or kinetic rate laws govern the shape of the concentration profiles of the chemical species linked by multiple equilibria or by kinetics. The possibility of hybridizing these two types of modeling, also called hybrid hard\u2013soft modeling (or gray modeling, considering hard-modeling as white modeling and soft-modeling as black modeling), opens the door to the use of extended MCR in fundamental studies in physical sciences in general and allows for the analysis of complex natural systems where the estimation of parameters (thermodynamic, kinetic) governing these systems is also of relevance and should be performed in the presence of interference contributions. This hybrid approach is especially interesting in cases where the strictly controlled conditions of a laboratory environment cannot be achieved and/or where unknown phenomena disturb the measured signals. Using extended MCR hybrid hard\u2013soft models allows modeling a part of the data variance fulfilling strictly the requirements of physical laws and modeling another part of it freely by a bilinear type of soft model.",

We explore a recently introduced computational approach for in silico profiling of the tyrosine kinases binding specificity with a class of the pyrido-[2,3-d]pyrimidine kinase inhibitors. Computational proteomics analysis of the ligand-protein interactions using parallel simulated tempering with an ensemble of the tyrosine kinases crystal structures reveals an important molecular determinant of the kinase specificity. The pyrido-[2,3-d]pyrimidine inhibitors are capable of dynamically interacting with both active and inactive forms of the tyrosine kinases, accommodating structurally different kinase conformations with a similar binding affinity. Conformational tolerance of the protein tyrosine kinases binding with the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine inhibitors provides the molecular basis for the broad spectrum of potent activities and agrees with the experimental inhibition profiles. The analysis of the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine sensitivities against a number of clinically relevant ABL kinase mutants suggests an important role of conformational adaptability of multitargeted kinase inhibitors in developing drug resistance mechanisms. The presented computational approach may be useful in complementing proteomics technologies to characterize activity signatures of small molecules against a large number of potential kinase targets",

The profiles also represent the needs for data curation from the perspective of the data producers, using their own language. As such, they support the exploration of data curation across different research domains in real and practical terms. With the sponsorship of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, investigators from Purdue University and the University of Illinois interviewed 19 faculty subjects to identify needs for discovery, access, preservation, and reuse of their research data. For each subject, a profile was constructed that includes information about his or her general research, data forms and stages, value of data, data ingest, intellectual property, organization and description of data, tools, interoperability, impact and prestige, data management, and preservation. Each profile also presents a specific dataset supplied by the subject to serve as a concrete example. The Data Curation Profiles are being published to a public wiki for questions and discussion, and a blank template will be disseminated with guidelines for others to create and share their own profiles. This study was conducted primarily from the viewpoint of librarians interacting with faculty researchers; however, it is expected that these findings will complement a wide variety of data curation research and practice outside of librarianship and the university environment.",

Based on responses to a survey questionnaire, students were grouped by cluster analysis into six distinct clusters according to the frequency with which they read diverse printed materials and were involved in various Internet activities. The multiliteracy profiles are described, first from the perspective of literacy activities and further examined in relation to students' gender, reading literacy performance, socio-economic background as well as access to books and computers.

        "abstract": "While DNA abnormalities have long been recognized as the cause of cancer, the contribution of chromatin is a relatively recent discovery. Excitement in the field of cancer epigenetics is driven by 3 key elements: 1. Chromatin may play an active and often critical role in controlling gene expression, DNA stability and cell identity. 2. Chromatin modifiers are frequent targets of DNA aberrations, in some cancers reaching near 100%. Particularly in cancers with low rates of DNA mutations, the key \"driver\" of malignancy is often a chromatin modifier. 3. Cancer-associated aberrant chromatin is amenable to pharmacologic modulation. This has sparked the rapidly expanding development of small molecules targeting chromatin modifiers or reader domains, several of which have shown promise in clinical trials. In parallel, technical advances have greatly enhanced our ability to perform comprehensive chromatin/histone profiling. Despite the discovery that distinct histone profiles are associated with prognostic subgroups, and in some instances may point towards an underlying aberration that can be targeted, histone profiling has not entered clinical diagnostics. Even eligibility for clinical trials targeting chromatin hinges on traditional histologic or DNA-based molecular criteria rather than chromatin profiles. This review will give an overview of the philosophical debate around the role of histones in controlling or modulating gene expression and discuss the most common techniques for histone profiling. In addition, we will provide prominent examples of aberrantly expressed or mutated chromatin modifiers that result in either globally or locally aberrant histone profiles, and that may be promising therapeutic targets.",

We assessed 96 subjects using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHODAS II). Clustering Based on Rules (ClBR) (a hybrid technique of Statistics and Artificial Intelligence) was used in the analysis. Four groups of subjects with different profiles of FD were ordered according to an increasing degree of disability: \"Low,\" self-dependent subjects with no physical or emotional problems; \"Intermediate I,\" subjects with low or moderate physical and emotional disability, with high perception of disability; \"Intermediate II,\" subjects with moderate or severe disability concerning only physical problems related to self-dependency, without emotional problems; and \"High,\" subjects with the highest degree of disability, both physical and emotional. The order of the four classes is paralleled by a significant difference (<0.001) in the WHODAS II standardized global score. In this paper, a new ontology for the knowledge of FD, based on the use of ClBR, is proposed. The definition of four classes, qualitatively different and with an increasing degree of FD, helps to appropriately place each patient in a group of individuals with a similar profile of disability and to propose standardized treatments for these groups.",

A twofold approach is followed: on one hand, we analytically solve the problem whenever small-slope profiles are in order; on the other hand, we present a partly analytical and partly numerical setup to cope with the general-slope case. By means of the analytical approach, we evaluate in closed form both the structure function and the power density spectrum of the radar signal. An appropriately smoothed (physical) fractional Brownian model (fBm) process is employed; its introduction is justified by the finite sensor resolution. A fractal scattering model is employed. It is shown that for a fractal profile modeled as an fBm stochastic process, the backscattered signal turns out to be strictly related to the associated fractional Gaussian noise process if a small-slope regime for the observed profile can be assumed. In the analytical-numerical framework, a profile with prescribed fractal parameters is first synthesized; then, fractal scattering methods (applicable to wider slope regimes with respect to the previous case) are employed to compute the signal backscattered toward the sensor. Finally, the power density spectrum of the acquired radar image is estimated. The obtained spectra are favorably compared with the theoretical results, and a parametric study is performed to assess the overall method behavior.",

The increased amplitudes of the corrugations on both the sphere and the plate allowed observation of an asymmetry of the lateral Casimir force, i.e., deviation of its profile from a perfect sine function. The dependences of the lateral force on the phase shift between the corrugations on both test bodies were measured at different separations in two sets of measurements with different amplitudes of corrugations on the sphere. The maximum magnitude of the lateral force as a function of separation was also measured in two successive experiments. All measurement data were compared with the theoretical approach using the proximity force approximation and with the exact theory based on Rayleigh expansions with no fitting parameters. In both cases real material properties of the test bodies and nonzero temperature were taken into account. The data were found to be in a good agreement with the exact theory but deviate significantly from the predictions of the proximity force approximation approach. This provides the quantitative confirmation for the observation of diffraction-type effects that are disregarded within the PFA approach. Possible applications of the phenomenon of the lateral Casimir force in nanotechnology for the operation of micromachines are discussed. \ufffd 2010 The American Physical Society.</p>",

However, several tools are now available that promise to accelerate the development of DSML environments. In this paper, we evaluate five such tools (GME, Tau G2, RSA, XMF-Mosaic, and Eclipse with GEF and EMF) by observing how well they can be used to create graphical editors for the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL), for which a simplified metamodel is provided. We discuss the evaluation criteria, results, and lessons learned during the creation of GRL editors with these technologies.",

A situation-aware or situated web application is one that renders the user with an experience (content, interaction and presentation) that is so tailored to his/ her current situation. This requires the facts and opinions regarding the context to be communicated to the server by means of a profile, which is then applied against the description of the application objects at the server in order to generate the required experience. This paper discusses a profiles view of the situated web architecture and analyzes the key technologies and capabilities that enable them.

        "abstract": "Accurate measurements of the mass distribution in galaxy and cluster halos are essential to test the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. The cosmological model predicts a universal shape for the density profile in all halos, independent of halo mass. Its profile has a `cuspy' centre, with no evidence for the constant density core. In this paper we carry out a careful analysis of twelve galaxy clusters, using Chandra data to compute the mass distribution in each system under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. Due to their low concentration, clusters provide ideal objects for studying the central cusps in dark matter halos. The majority of the systems are consistent with the CDM model, but 4 objects exhibit flat inner density profiles. We suggest that the flat inner profile found for these clusters is due to an underestimation of the mass in the cluster centre (rather than any problem with the CDM model), since these objects also have a centrally peaked gas mass fraction. We discuss possible causes for erroneously low mass measurements in the cores of some systems.",

In a sample of 712 University alumni, we found evidence of six profiles of commitment, reflecting different combinations of commitment forms. The AC Dominant, AC-NC Dominant, and Committed profiles displayed lower turnover intention than the Continuance Dominant and Not Committed profiles. Moreover, the Continuance Dominant profile and the profiles in which AC was high displayed lower turnover rates than the Not Committed profile.

Among recent advances are the discoveries that inflammation-induced cytokines and growth factors affect protein accumulation of HIF-1alpha under normoxia conditions. TNFalpha, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes tumorigenesis is known as a stimulator of HIF-1alpha activity. To improve our understanding of TNFalpha-mediated regulation of HIF-1alpha nuclear accumulation we screened a kinase-specific siRNA library using a cell imaging-based HIF-1alpha-eGFP chimera reporter assay. Interestingly, this systematic analysis determined that depletion of kinases involved in conventional TNFalpha signaling (IKK/NFkappaB and JNK pathways) has no detrimental effect on HIF-1alpha accumulation. On the other hand, depletion of PRKAR2B, ADCK2, TRPM7, and TRIB2 significantly decreases the effect of TNFalpha on HIF-1alpha stability in osteosarcoma and prostate cancer cell lines. These newly discovered regulators conveyed their activity through a non-conventional RELB-depended NFkappaB signaling pathway and regulation of superoxide activity. Taken together our data allow us to conclude that TNFalpha uses a distinct and complex signaling mechanism to induce accumulation of HIF-1alpha in cancer cells. In summary, our results illuminate a novel mechanism through which cancer initiation and progression may be promoted by inflammatory cytokines, highlighting new potential avenues for fighting this disease.",

        "abstract": "The scaffold concept was applied to systematically determine, analyze, and compare core structures of kinase inhibitors. From publicly available inhibitors of the human kinome, scaffolds and cyclic skeletons were systematically extracted and organized taking activity data, structural relationships, and retrosynthetic criteria into account. Scaffold coverage varied greatly across the kinome, and many scaffolds representing compounds with different activity profiles were identified. The majority of kinase inhibitor scaffolds were involved in well-defined yet distinct structural relationships, which had different consequences on compound activity. Scaffolds exclusively representing highly potent compounds were identified as well as structurally analogous scaffolds with very different degrees of promiscuity. Scaffold relationships presented herein suggest a variety of hypotheses for inhibitor design. Our detailed organization of the kinase inhibitor scaffold universe with respect to different activity and structural criteria, all scaffolds, and the original compound data assembled for our analysis are made freely available.",

        "abstract": "We have observed a total of 67 pulsars at five frequencies ranging from 243 to 3100 MHz. Observations at the lower frequencies were made at the Giant Metre-Wave Telescope in India and those at higher frequencies at the Parkes Telescope in Australia. We present profiles from 34 of the sample with the best signal-to-noise ratio and the least scattering. The general `rules' of pulsar profiles are seen in the data; profiles get narrower, the polarization fraction declines and outer components become more prominent as the frequency increases. Many counterexamples to these rules are also observed, and pulsars with complex profiles are especially prone to rule breaking. We hypothesize that the location of pulsar emission within the magnetosphere evolves with time as the pulsar spins down. In highly energetic pulsars, the emission comes from a confined range of high altitudes, in the middle range of spin down energies the emission occurs over a wide range of altitudes whereas in pulsars with low spin-down energies it is confined to low down in the magnetosphere.",

        "abstract": "One of the most important and frequently studied variable in forests and the most basic element in governing transport processes of airflow is wind speed. The study of wind profile, defined as the change of wind velocity with height, and wind ve- locity are important because of tree physiological and developmental responses. Generally, wind profiles above the ground or at a canopy surface follow classical logarithm law, but wind profiles in a single tree and in a forest stand are not logarithmic. This paper summarizes the results of wind profile studies within a single tree, in a forest stand, above the forest canopy and in a forest area from recent research in a coastal pine forest. The results demonstrate that: 1) wind profiles with in a single conifer tree crown showed an exponentialfunction with height, 2) wind profiles in forest stands were able to be expressed by attenuation coefficient of wind, 3) wind profiles over a forest canopy could be determined using profile parameters (friction velocity, rough- ness length and displacement), and 4) for a forest area, the extreme wind speed could be predicted reasonably using the methods developed for the design of buildings. More research will be required to demonstrate: 1) relationships between wind profiles and tree or stand characteristics, 2) the simple methods for predicting wind profile parameters, and 3) the applications of wind profile in studies of tree physiology, forest ecology and management, and the detail ecological effects of wind on tree growth.",

Yet, with all of the attention on bullying, particularly school bullying, sibling bullying has been vastly overlooked. Sibling bullying is a type of violence prevalent in the lives of most children, but little is known about the phenomenon. The purpose of this study was to profile sibling bullying by examining prevalence rates, the extent to which siblings perceive sibling bullying to be normative, and victim-perpetrator differences in perceptions of sibling bullying. Twenty-seven sibling pairs who wrote stories about personal experiences of sibling bullying and victimization completed questionnaires about these experiences and responded to their sibling partners' stories. Of the siblings surveyed, 78% reported being bullied by their sibling and 85% reported bullying their sibling during their childhood. This is far greater than published statistics on peer bullying. Not surprisingly, victims viewed sibling bullying more negatively than perpetrators. Sadly, there was a norm of acceptance of sibling bullying among most of the sibling pairs. Practical implications are discussed.",

AIMS: Some immunohistochemical markers are expected to distinguish the sweat gland types in their secretory and excretory parts. METHODS: This study used two sets of antibodies. The first panel was composed of antibodies directed to well-defined sweat gland structures. The molecular targets included the low-molecular-weight cytokeratins CAM 5.2, the S100-B protein, the epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and the lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1). A second exploratory panel of antibodies targeted syndecan-1 (CD138), NKI-C3 (CD63), and CD68. They were used to disclose some undescribed antigen expressions in human sweat glands. RESULTS: The first set of antibodies confirmed previous findings. The immunoreactivities of the three sweat gland types were similar in the excretory ducts. By contrast, they were distinguished in the deeper coiled secretory portions of the glands. CONCLUSION: Clues supporting their distinction and probably their functional activity were obtained by immunohistochemistry using the S100-B protein, CEA and CD63 antibodies. The immunoreactivity to the S100-B protein, CEA and CD63 possibly help identifying apoeccrine sweat glands or a peculiar functional activity of eccrine sweat glands.",

        "abstract": "A review. With the passage of the National Nanoscale Initiative in 2001 there was increasing attention and funding given to nanomaterial research. This has led to a no. of new materials developed at the nanoscale (< 100 nm) level, which often possess chem. and phys. properties distinct from those of their bulk materials. These unique qualities are proving to be quite useful in a no. of new applications. For example, biol. applications in imaging, treatment, and drug delivery are particularly promising as well as the increasing engineering potential of nanocircuitry and materials science. As the no. of applications increases however, so too does the potential for human exposure to nanomaterials through a no. of routes: dermal, ingestion, inhalation, and even injection. Interestingly, some of the properties of these nanomaterials that make them useful in these emerging technologies are the same properties that can increase their toxic potential. This is leading to an emerging discipline - nanotoxicol., which can be defined as safety evaluation of engineered nanostructures and nanodevices. Nanotoxicol. research will not only provide information for risk assessment of nanomaterials based on data for hazard identification, dose response relationships and biokinetics, but will also help to further advance the field of nanoresearch by providing information to alter undesirable nanomaterials properties. Although nanotoxicol. is in its infancy, there are some preliminary studies with newly developed materials that provide some insight into potential effects, which when coupled with older studies provides information on how these nanomaterials impact the biol. system. The following text summarizes results of studies with nanosized particles with a focus on the respiratory system and skin as portals of entry. The ability of particles to translocate from their site of entry, their ability to elicit biol. responses, and their presumed mechanisms of action will be highlighted. This will be an attempt to illustrate how pervasive these materials can be, which may or may not be detrimental. With proper toxicol. assessment this potential may be harnessed leading to breakthroughs at the nanotechnol.-biol. interface. [on SciFinder (R)]",

For instance, should a military academy exclude women because, on average, women are more sensitive to hazing than men? Should airlines force all pilots to retire at age sixty, even though most pilots at that age have excellent vision? Can all pit bulls be banned because of the aggressive characteristics of the breed? And, most controversially, should government and law enforcement use racial and ethnic profiling as a tool to fight crime and terrorism?  Frederick Schauer strives to analyze and resolve these prickly questions. As Schauer argues, there is good profiling and bad profiling. If we can effectively determine which is which, we stand to gain, not lose, a measure of justice.   ",

        "abstract": "The release of tritiated water (HTO) to the atmosphere during the winter can contribute significantly to snow contamination and to water-soil-plant contamination after the spring thaw. The dose significance of such a release depends on the persistence of tritiated water in the snowpack, which is primarily controlled by the HTO diffusion process in snow and the rate of re-emission into the atmosphere from the snowpack surface. Monitoring data collected after an acute winter release at Chalk River Laboratories and data obtained in winter over a chronically contaminated area were analyzed to estimate the diffusion coefficient of HTO in the snowpack. Under conditions of cold and dry snow, the diffusion coefficient lay in the range 1-2??10 -10m 2s -1, an order of magnitude lower than diffusion in water but an order of magnitude higher than self-diffusion in ice. These results confirm the theoretical predictions (Bales, 1991). Values up to six times higher were found for warmer periods and just before spring melt, when other processes contribute to profile evolution. The low diffusion rate of tritium in cold, dry snow means that tritium remains in the snowpack throughout the winter, to be released during spring thaw to potentially contaminate surface water, soil and crops. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

Renal impairment is a risk factor for bleeding and thrombosis during anticoagulant therapy and can influence the balance between the safety and efficacy of such agents. Some of the more established anticoagulants, such as the low-molecular-weight heparins, warfarin, and fondaparinux, are contraindicated for use in patients with severe renal impairment. Of the new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are at the most advanced stages of development. Dabigatran requires dose adjustment in patients with moderate renal impairment and is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Rivaroxaban can be administered as a fixed dose for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients with moderate renal impairment and should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Apixaban excretion is also partly dependent on renal function, although the impact of renal insufficiency has not been determined.

The ongoing challenge of collecting reliable and consistent data created an opportunity in 2001 for the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Practice Administration Network (PAN) to develop a practice-based survey that measured the variables most related to the bottom line. METHODS: The PAN designed a comprehensive practice survey in 2001 that has been distributed to > 2,000 ACCP members each year. The specialty-specific survey differed from those offered in the market, as its aim was to capture information about pulmonary, critical care, and sleep practices. The single-answer survey included practice expense categories and those related to accounts receivable management. An on-line survey vendor (www.surveymonkey.com) was selected as the platform based on broad functionality and a flexible architecture. RESULTS: The survey was conducted each June for 5 consecutive years. In 2001, survey respondents represented 68 pulmonary physicians. By 2005, 229 practices responded representing 774 individual physicians. Participants included members of ACCP Leadership, ACCP Committees, and related networks, and past survey participants. The data are presented in graphic format as a percentage of total respondents. CONCLUSION: The survey offered participants a mechanism to contrast and compare specialty-based trends in practice expense, staffing levels, clinical services, malpractice cost, facilities utilization, and financial management strategies of \"better performing\" practices. It has served as the groundwork for related Practice Management Committee and Practice Management Department initiatives. The ACCP anticipates future survey collaboration with the Medical Group Management Association.",

In essence, the subject has thus far evolved to a choice of shape functions, which are described by a small set of parameters. Additional efforts have attempted to relate these parameters to more fundamental quantities, such as average grain size of the bottom sediment, wave environment, geometric aspects of the beach, and the like. This approach has a long history and can rightly claim a certain level of success. However, the usual collections of shape functions are well-known to have difficulties very near the shoreline, let alone on the nearshore portion of the beach. This study extends the equilibrium profile up to and somewhat past the shoreline. Three shape functions are used in conjunction with a Taylor expansion for the nearshore and above water portions of the profile. A nonlinear fitting technique is applied to estimate the model's best parameter values. Moreover, reduced versions of the proposed models can be employed for prediction based only on parameters related to sediment characteristics or wave conditions and geometry of the visible beach.

        "abstract": "Abstract A column of dry air in hydrostatic equilibrium is considered, bounded by two fixed values of the pressure, and the question is asked, what vertical temperature profile maximizes the total entropy of the column? Using an elementary variational calculation, it is shown how the result depends on what is kept fixed in the maximization process. If one assumes that there is no net heat exchange between the column and its surroundings?implying that the vertical integral of the absolute temperature remains constant?an isothermal profile is obtained in accordance with classical thermodynamics and the kinetic theory of gases. If instead the vertical integral of the potential temperature is kept fixed?as argued by several authors to be appropriate in the case of convective mixing?an isentropic profile results. It is argued that, if one wishes to apply the latter constraint, it should be used as an additional, rather than as an alternative, constraint. The variational problem with both constraints leads to a profile in between the isothermal and the isentropic extremes. This profile has the merit of reproducing very accurately the tropospheric part of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microscopic examination of living cells often reveals that cells from some cell strains appear to be in a permanent state of disarray without obvious reason. In all probability such a disorderly state affects cell functioning. The aim of this study was to establish whether a disorderly state could occur that adversely affects gene expression profiles and whether such a state might have biomedical consequences. To this end, the expression profiles of the 14 genes of the proteasome derived from the GEO SAGE database were utilized as a model system.\\n\\nRESULTS: By adopting the overall expression profile as the standard for normal expression, deviation in transcription was frequently observed. Each deviating tissue exhibited its own characteristic profile of over-expressed and under-expressed genes. Moreover such a specific deviating profile appeared to be epigenetic in origin and could be stably transmitted to a clonal derivative e.g. from a precancerous normal tissue to its tumor. A significantly greater degree of deviation was observed in the expression profiles from the tumor tissues. The changes in the expression of different genes display a network of interdependencies. Therefore our hypothesis is that deviating profiles reflect disorder in the localization of genes within the nucleus. The underlying cause(s) for these disorderly states remain obscure; it could be noise and/or deterministic chaos. Presence of mutational damage does not appear to be predominantly involved.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: As disturbances in expression profiles frequently occur and have biomedical consequences, its determination could prove of value in several fields of biomedical research.",

Temperamental profiles were based on the Juvenile Temperament and Character Inventory. Children with the CBCL-DP had a temperamental profile characterized by high Novelty Seeking, high Harm Avoidance, low Reward Dependence and low Persistence. Linear mixed models and regression-based models demonstrated that the CBCL-DP was associated with a \"disengaged\" temperamental profile. This profile is similar to the profile seen in adult disorders of self-regulation, including cluster B personality disorders.

Conventional wisdom posits that terrorists are typically male, uneducated, impoverished and between the ages of 18 and 23. Studies and emerging patterns over the past decade have refuted many of these stereotypes. Of the existing empirical research in the literature, single-case studies dominate. Although highly informative, they are also context-specific and thus their findings may not easily translate to other conflict areas. To address these shortcomings, the socio-demographic and role profiles of 219 Palestinian suicide bombers are compared with 510 terrorists indicted within the United States. These cases allow us to simultaneously compare the profiles of two very different contexts. More importantly, we are able to evaluate and compare the profiles of suicide bombers with more conventional terrorists.",

The proportion of men was shown to be higher among individuals with the left-side, symmetrical, and intersecting motor lat- erality profiles. Men with a dominant left leg or without asymmetry in the profile were more frequent than women, whereas women prevailed among persons with a dominant left eye. Different laterality profiles were obtained for different factors of the Cattell test. Comparison of the sensorimotor laterality and the BTSA data showed that more than half of persons with the left-hemispheric sensorimotor profile prefer right-hemispheric cognitive strategies.

Profile breaks are also found in dwarf disks, but some dwarf Type IIs are flat or increasing out to a break before falling off. Here we re-examine the stellar disk profiles of 141 dwarfs: 96 dwarf irregulars (dIms), 26 Blue Compact Dwarfs (BCDs), and 19 Magellanic-type spirals (Sms). We fit single, double, or even triple exponential profiles in up to 11 passbands: GALEX FUV and NUV, ground-based UBVJHK and H\u03b1, and Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 \u03bcm. We find that more luminous galaxies have brighter centers, larger inner and outer scale lengths, and breaks at larger radii; dwarf trends with MB extend to spirals. However, the V-band break surface brightness is independent of break type, MB , and Hubble type. Dwarf Type II and III profiles fall off similarly beyond the breaks but have different interiors and IIs break ~twice as far as IIIs. Outer Type II and III scale lengths may have weak trends with wavelength, but pure Type II inner scale lengths clearly decrease from the FUV to visible bands whereas Type III inner scale lengths increase with redder bands. This suggests the influence of different star formation histories on profile type, but nonetheless the break location is approximately the same in all passbands. Dwarfs continue trends between profile and Hubble types such that later-type galaxies have more Type II but fewer Type I and III profiles than early-type spirals. BCDs and Sms are over-represented as Types III and II, respectively, compared to dIms.",

        "abstract": "The concept of the genome tree depends on the potential evolutionary significance in the clustering of species according to similarities in the gene content of their genomes. In this respect, genome trees have often been identified with species trees. With the rapid expansion of genome sequence data it becomes of increasing importance to develop accurate methods for grasping global trends for the phylogenetic signals that mutually link the various genomes. We therefore derive here the methodological concept of genome trees based on protein conservation profiles in multiple species. The basic idea in this derivation is that the multi-component \"presence-absence\" protein conservation profiles permit tracking of common evolutionary histories of genes across multiple genomes. We show that a significant reduction in informational redundancy is achieved by considering only the subset of distinct conservation profiles. Beyond these basic ideas, we point out various pitfalls and limitations associated with the data handling, paving the way for further improvements. As an illustration for the methods, we analyze a genome tree based on the above principles, along with a series of other trees derived from the same data and based on pair-wise comparisons (ancestral duplication-conservation and shared orthologs). In all trees we observe a sharp discrimination between the three primary domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The new genome tree, based on conservation profiles, displays a significant correspondence with classically recognized taxonomical groupings, along with a series of departures from such conventional clusterings.",

The image size and shape produced in the focal plane of the concentrator system depends on the solar brightness distribution. Therefore, the forward scattering of solar radiation by the Earth's atmosphere modifies the solar brightness distribution and creates a circumsolar aureole. The circumsolar ratio, the energy contained in the solar aureole compared to total energy, can impact the performance of these concentrating systems. Based on about 2300 sunshape measurements from sites in France, Germany, and Spain made with a camera system developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), average solar brightness profiles with a circumsolar ratio of about 0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% were generated. These profiles are compared to the measurements taken by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) in the late 1970s and a commonly used limb-darkened solar brightness profile, as known from astronomy. A statistical analysis gives information on the frequency of occurrence of each of the average profiles. The profiles combined with the statistical weight should offer a numerical database for calculating the influence of variable conditions of the sunlight scattering on solar concentrating systems.

Life satisfaction tends to be influenced by individual psychological traits and external social factors. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between individual character and SWB.; Methods: Data from 3522 university students were analyzed in this study. Character profiles were evaluated using the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised Short version (TCI-RS). Life satisfaction was assessed using the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). All statistical tests regarding the correlations between each character profile and life satisfaction were conducted using ANOVAs, t-tests, multiple linear regression models and correlation analyses.; Results: The creative (SCT) profile was associated with the highest levels of life satisfaction, whereas the depressive (sct) profile was associated with the lowest levels of life satisfaction. Additionally, high self-directedness, self-transcendence and cooperation were associated with high life satisfaction. The results of gender-adjusted multiple regression analysis showed that the effects of self-directedness were the strongest in the assessment of one's quality of life, followed by self-transcendence and cooperativeness, in that order. All of the three-character profiles were significantly correlated with one's quality of life, and the character profiles of TCI-RS explained 27.6% of life satisfaction in total. Among the three-character profiles, the self-directedness profile was most associated with life satisfaction.; Limitations: Our study was cross-sectional, and self-reported data from students at a single university were analyzed.; Conclusions: The results of this study showed that, among the character profiles, the effects of self-directedness were the strongest for predicting life satisfaction.; Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We apply the quoted method to structures on galactic scales and clusters of galaxies scales. We find that the inner logarithmic density slope, of dark matter halos with baryons has a significant dependence on halo mass and redshift with slopes ranging from 0 for dwarf galaxies to 0.4 for objects of M = 10^13M_solar and 0.94 for M = 10^15M_solar clusters of galaxies. Structures slopes increase with increasing redshift and this trend reduces going from galaxies to clusters. In the case of density profiles constituted just of dark matter the mass and redshift dependence of slope is very slight. In this last case, we used the Merrit et al. (2006) analysis who compared N-body density profiles with various parametric models finding systematic variation in profile shape with halo mass. This last analysis suggests that the galaxy-sized halos obtained with our model have a different shape parameter, i.e. a different mass distribution, than the cluster-sized halos, obtained with the same model. The results of the present paper argue against universality of density profiles constituted by dark matter and baryons and confirm claims of a systematic variation in profile shape with halo mass, for dark matter halos.",

When a region adjacent to a reference level (e.g., sea level) is uplifted, a rapid change in gradient occurs near the river mouth. The erosional process causes this change in gradient to migrate upstream. Thus a river profile is effectively a 'tape recording' of the uplift rate history, provided that the erosional process can be adequately parameterized. Here, we use a non-linear equation to relate the shape of a river profile, z(x), to uplift rate history, U(t). If erosion is assumed to be dominated by knickpoint retreat, an inverse model can be formulated and used to calculate uplift rate histories. Our model builds upon standard stream profile analysis, which focuses on the relationship between profile slope and drainage area. We have applied this analytical approach to river profiles from the Bi\u00e9 Dome, Angola. Calculated uplift rate histories agree with independent geologic estimates.",

Unfortunately, in an attempt to restrict profile definitions to a single meta level, predefined modeling elements are currently specified exclusively at the meta-model level, and therefore can be applied solely through the mechanism of meta-instantiation. We identify the problems associated with such a restriction and explain why model level inheritance also has a role to play in the definition of predefined modeling elements. We point out the fundamental differences and relationships between the two mechanisms in the context of defining UML profiles and provide guidelines as to which mechanism should be used under which circumstance.

The shapes of the filament profiles are linked to their physical state. Before drawing conclusions on the observed column density profiles, we must evaluate the observational uncertainties. We want to estimate the bias that could result from radiative transfer effects or from variations of submm dust emissivity. We use cloud models obtained with magnetohydrodynamic simulations and carry out radiative transfer calculations to produce maps of sub-millimetre emission. Column densities are estimated based on the synthetic observations. For selected filaments, the estimated profiles are compared to those derived from the original column density. Possible effects from spatial variations of dust properties are examined. With instrumental noise typical of the Herschel observations, the parameters derived for nearby clouds are correct to within a few percent. The radiative transfer effects have only a minor effect on the results. If the signal-to-noise ratio is degraded by a factor of four, the errors become significant and for half of the examined filaments the values cannot be constrained. The errors increase in proportion to the cloud distance. Assuming the resolution of Herschel instruments, the model filaments are barely resolved at a distance of ~400 pc and the errors in the parameters of the Plummer function are several tens of per cent. The Plummer parameters, in particular the power-law exponent p, are sensitive to noise but can be determined with good accuracy using Herschel data. One must be cautious about possible line-of-sight confusion. In our models, a large fraction of the filaments seen in the column density maps are not continuous structures in three dimensions.",

METHODS: Using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays, the authors measured the simultaneous expression of approximately 10,000 genes in muscle specimens from 45 patients in four major disease categories (dystrophy, congenital myopathy, inflammatory myopathy, and normal). The authors separately analyzed gene expression in 14 patients limited to the three major subtypes of IM. Bioinformatics techniques were used to classify specimens with similar expression profiles based on global patterns of gene expression and to identify genes with significant differential gene expression compared with normal. RESULTS: Ten of 11 patients with IM, all normals and nemaline myopathies, and 10 of 12 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy were correctly classified by this approach. The various subtypes of inflammatory myopathies have distinct gene expression signatures. Specific sets of immune-related genes allow for molecular classification of patients with IBM, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis. Analysis of differential gene expression identifies as relevant to disease pathogenesis previously reported cytokines, major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules, granzymes, and adhesion molecules, as well as newly identified members of these categories. Increased expression of actin cytoskeleton genes is also identified. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular profiles of muscle tissue in patients with inflammatory myopathies are distinct and represent molecular signatures from which diagnostic insight may follow.

        "abstract": "We analyze the mass accretion histories (MAHs) and density profiles of cluster-size halos with virial masses of (0.6-2.5)\u00d71014h-1Msolar in a flat \u039bCDM cosmology. We find that most MAHs have a similar shape: an early merger-dominated mass increase followed by a more gradual accretion-dominated growth. For some clusters the intense merger activity and rapid mass growth continue until the present-day epoch. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the concentration of the density distribution is tightly correlated with the halo's MAH and with its formation redshift. During the period of fast mass growth, the concentration remains approximately constant and low, cv~3-4, while during the slow accretion stages the concentration increases with decreasing redshift as cv~(1+z)-1. We consider fits of three widely discussed analytic density profiles to the simulated clusters, focusing on the most relaxed inner regions. We find that there is no unique best-fit analytic profile for all the systems. At the same time, if a cluster is best fitted by a particular analytic profile at z=0, the same is usually true at earlier epochs out to z~1-2. The local logarithmic slope of the density profiles at 3% of the virial radius ranges from -1.2 to -2.0, a remarkable diversity for the relatively narrow mass range of our cluster sample. Interestingly, for all the studied clusters the logarithmic slope down to the smallest resolved scale (<~1% of the virial radius) becomes shallower with decreasing radius without reaching an asymptotic value. We do not find a clear correlation of the inner slope with the formation redshift or the shape of the halo's MAH. We do find, however, that during the period of rapid mass growth the density profiles can be well described by a single power law \u03c1(r)~r-\u03b3 with \u03b3~1.5-2. The relatively shallow power-law slopes result in low concentrations at these stages of evolution, as the scale radius at which the density profiles reach the slope of -2 is at large radii. This indicates that the inner power law-like density distribution of halos is built up during the periods of rapid mass accretion and active merging, while the outer steeper profile is formed when the mass accretion slows down. To check the convergence and robustness of our conclusions, we resimulate one of our clusters by using 8 times as many particles and twice as good force resolution. We find good agreement between the two simulations in all the results discussed in our study.",

The selection does not use brightness, morphology or any other property derived from optical or other spectral bands. We investigate the degree of isolation, the morphology and other properties gathered or derived from open data bases and show that some objects have wide Hi profiles probably because they are disturbed or are interacting, or might be confused in the ALFALFA beam. We identify a subsample of 14 galaxies lacking immediate interacting neighbours and showing regular, symmetric, two-horned Hi profiles that we propose as candidate high-mass disc galaxies (CHMDs). We measure the net-H\u03b1 emission from the CHMDs and combine this with public multispectral data to model the global star formation (SF) properties of each galaxy. The H\u03b1 observations show SF rates not higher than a few Myr-1. Simple SF models indicate that the CHMDs formed most of their stars almost a Hubble time ago, but most also underwent an SF event in the last 106-107 yr; the young stars now produce 10-30 per cent of the visible light. The spatial distribution of the SF regions is compatible with recycled stellar ejecta. We calculate representative dynamical masses, Mdyn, for the CHMDs ranging from 1011 to 7 \u00d7 1011M. The Mdyn values are larger by factors of 2.5-7.5 than the baryonic masses of the luminous stars and gas but are affected by rather large errors. We test the Tully-Fisher relation for the CHMDs and show that these lie below the relation defined by lower mass galaxies, that is, their Mdyn is lower than expected when extrapolating the relation from lower mass galaxies to higher Hi linewidths.

A better understanding of the tumor metabolism might help us meet the challenges in controlling brain metastases. The study aims to characterize the metabolic profile of brain metastases of different origin using high resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to correlate the metabolic profiles to clinical and pathological information. Biopsy samples of human brain metastases (n = 49) were investigated. A significant correlation between lipid signals and necrosis in brain metastases was observed (p < 0.01), irrespective of their primary origin. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed that brain metastases from malignant melanomas cluster together, while lung carcinomas were metabolically heterogeneous and overlap with other subtypes. Metastatic melanomas have higher amounts of glycerophosphocholine than other brain metastases. A significant correlation between microscopically visible lipid droplets estimated by Nile Red staining and MR visible lipid signals was observed in metastatic lung carcinomas (p = 0.01), indicating that the proton MR visible lipid signals arise from cytoplasmic lipid droplets. MRS-based metabolomic profiling is a useful tool for exploring the metabolic profiles of metastatic brain tumors.",

        "abstract": "Websites typically provide several links on each page visited by a user. Whereas some of these links help users easily navigate the site, others are typically used to provide targeted recommendations based on the available user profile. When the user profile is not available (or is inadequate), the site cannot effectively target products, promotions, and advertisements. In those situations, the site can learn the profile of a user as the user traverses the site. Naturally, the faster the site can learn a user's profile, the sooner the site can benefit from personalization. We develop a technique that sites can use to learn the profile as quickly as possible. The technique identifies links for sites to make available that will lead to a more informative profile when the user chooses one of the offered links. Experiments conducted using our approach demonstrate that it enables learning the profiles markedly better after very few user interactions as compared to benchmark approaches. The approach effectively learns multiple attributes simultaneously, can learn well classes that have highly skewed priors, and remains quite effective even when the distribution of link profiles at a site is relatively homogeneous. The approach works particularly well when a user's traversal is influenced by the most recently visited pages on a site. Finally, we show that the approach is robust to noise in the estimates for the probability parameters needed for its implementation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The etiology of microscopic colitis is unclear; an autoimmune response and pharmacological induction have been proposed as possible mechanisms. We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional study to compare the antibody profiles of patients with collagenous and lymphocytic colitis with those of a control group. METHODS: The medical histories and antibody profiles of 26 patients with collagenous and 16 patients with lymphocytic colitis were compared with the corresponding data of 43 controls without gastroenterological disease. Antibodies to the following structures were determined: intestinal goblet cells, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA), tissue transglutaminase, gliadin, pancreatic acini, glutamate decarboxylase, tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 and thyroid (microsomal anitbodies, MAB). RESULTS: Patients with collagenous and lymphocytic colitis had been treated significantly more often with H(2)-receptor antagonists and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (P = 0.026 and 0.014, respectively). Additional diseases of presumed autoimmune etiology were present in 43% (18/42) of patients. Comparison with the controls showed significantly more positive findings for ANA immunoglobulin G (IgG), gliadin immunoglobulin A (IgA) and ASCA (IgA and IgG) in patients with collagenous colitis but not in those with lymphocytic colitis. Collagenous colitis was associated with positive ASCA in 15% of patients and lymphocytic colitis in 13%. CONCLUSIONS: The autoantibodies investigated are of no diagnostic relevance to microscopic colitis. Positive ANA and strong associations with other autoimmune diseases point to an autoimmune etiology. H(2)-receptor antagonists and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs might also be of pathogenetic significance.",

Since injection profiles are affected by multiple geological and development factors, it is difficult to model their complicated, non-linear relationships using conventional approaches. In this paper, two adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) based neuro-fuzzy systems are presented. The two neuro-fuzzy systems are: (1) grid partition based fuzzy inference system (FIS), named ANFIS-GRID, and (2) subtractive clustering based FIS, named ANFIS-SUB. We compare the performance of resultant FIS and study the effect of parameters. A real-world injection profile data set from the Daqing Oilfield, China is used. FIS are generated and tested using training and testing data from that data set. The impact of data quality on the performance of FIS is also studied. Experiments demonstrate that although soft computing methods are somewhat of tolerant of inaccurate inputs, cleaned data results in more robust models for practical problems. ANFIS-GRID outperforms ANFIS-SUB due to its simplicity in parameter selection and its fitness in the target problem. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "We analyse the influence of rotation on shapes of pulse profiles of fast-rotating (millisecond) pulsars. Corotation has two opposing effects: 1) the caustic enhancement of the trailing side (TS) by aberration and retardation (AR), which squeezes the emission into a narrower phase interval; 2) the weakening of the TS caused by the asymmetry of curvature radiation about the dipole axis. Analysis of the radii of curvature of electron trajectories in the inertial observer's frame (IOF) enables these two effects to be considered together. We demonstrate that for dipolar magnetic field lines on the TS there exists a `caustic phase' beyond which no emission can be observed. This phase corresponds to the zero (or minimum) curvature of the IOF trajectories and maximum bunching of the emission. The maximum gradient of polarisation angle (PA) in the S-shaped PA curve is also associated with the curvature minimum and occurs at exactly the same phase. The asymmetry of trajectory curvature with respect to the dipole axis affects the curvature emissivity and the efficiency of pair production, suggesting a minimum at the caustic phase. Emission over a fixed range of altitudes, as expected in millisecond pulsars, leads to broad leading profiles and sharp peaks with a cutoff phase on the TS. We apply our results to the main pulse of the 5 ms pulsar J1012+5307.",

By applying a recently developed sequence prediction algorithm and a novel ensemble averaging calculation, we generate a diverse collection of peptide sequences that are predicted to have significant affinity for the protein. Using output from the simulations, we create position-specific scoring matrices, or virtual interaction profiles (VIPs). Comparison of VIPs for a collection of binding motifs to sequences determined experimentally indicates that the prediction algorithm is accurate and applicable to a diverse range of structures. With these VIPs, one can scan protein sequence databases rapidly to seek binding partners of potential biological significance. Overall, this method can significantly enhance the information contained within a protein- peptide crystal structure, and enrich the data obtained by experimental selection methods such as phage display.",

Significant differences in the total polyphenol content as well as the profiles of the apple cultivars under study were observed. For dessert apples the total polyphenol content ranged from 154 to 178 mg/L, whereas for 'old' German cider apple cultivars 261-970 mg/L were determined. Boskoop showed the highest (970 mg/L) and Granny Smith the lowest (154 mg/L) polyphenol content of the freshly prepared samples under study. Hydroxycinnamic acids, with chlorogenic acid as dominating constituent, ranged from 57 to 68 mg/L as well as from 134-593 mg/L in juices made from dessert apples and that from cider apples, respectively. Dessert apple juices showed lower contents of dihydrochalcones (10-35 mg/L) and flavan-3-ols (50-95 mg/L) compared to that of cider apples (34-171 mg/L and 70-393 mg/L, respectively). Quercetin and its derivatives were found from 0.4-4 mg/L and 0.4-27 mg/L in juices made from dessert apples and that of cider apples, respectively. Compared with freshly made juices, lower contents of polyphenols were determined in the commercial samples under study. Amounts ranging from 110-459 mg/L, dominated by chlorogenic acid with concentrations from 53-217 mg/L, were determined.

Elastic deformation and the laws of friction. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 243, 190-205]. Here, more realistic fractal rough surface profiles are considered, by using the Weierstrass series with random phases, and with much lower separation of the various scales, using a full or a hybrid numerical/analytical technique. A non-linear layer algorithm is developed which is a very efficient approximate tool to study this problem, avoiding the need for averaging over various realizations of profiles with random phases. The multiscale problem is solved by a cascade of 2-scales problems, each of which is solved with a few elements for an imposed contact area, deriving load as a function of indentation and the conductance by differentiation using Barber's analogy theorem. Dimensionless results for the conductance as a function of applied pressures show that the conductance seems to be close to a power law at low loads, and is nearly linear at intermediate loads (following the normalized single sinusoidal case except at the origin). At high loads, the conductance becomes strongly dependent on fractal dimension because of weak dependence on the contribution of small wavelength scales (higher order terms in the series). Since roughness tends to be squeezed out, the conductance tends to increase more than linearly (more so, the smaller is the fractal dimension). However, another limit could be found in terms of the finite size of the specimen, which may suggest reaching a finite limit. The resulting curves could then be sigmoidal, as confirmed by qualitative comparisons with experiments in the literature. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Analyses of RNA samples taken at 2 or 4 h intervals throughout development of Dictyostelium discoideum have defined the developmental changes in transcriptional profiles. Comparisons of the transcriptome of wild-type cells to that of mutant strains lacking a gene critical to progression through the developmental stages have defined key steps in the progression. The transcriptional response to cAMP pulses depends on the expression of pulse-independent genes that have been identified by transcriptional profiling with microarrays. Similar techniques were used to discover that the DNA binding protein GBF functions in a feed-forward loop to regulate post-aggregation genes and that expression of a set of late genes during culmination is dependent on the DNA binding protein SrfA. RNA-seq is able to reliably measure individual mRNAs present as a single copy per cell as well as mRNAs present at a thousand fold higher abundance. Using this technique it was found that 65% of the genes in Dictyostelium change twofold or more during development. Many decrease during the first 8 h of development, while the rest increase at specific stages and this pattern is evolutionarily conserved as found by comparing the transcriptomes of D. discoideum and Dictyostelium purpureum. The transcriptional profile of each gene is readily available at dictyBase and more sophisticated analyses are available on DictyExpress.",

        "abstract": "Formerly, models have been used mostly in design and documentation. MDA and its surrounding techniques put them into the center of the software development process as the platform-independent model serves as foundation for tasks such as platform-dependent code generation or testing. Obviously, unambiguous models are crucial for the successful accomplishment of these tasks. The UML as the most popular modeling language is not able to ensure this which delegates the validation of models to further tasks. Our goal is to improve this situation by making models reliable as it is neither likely that another modeling language will displace UML in the near future not that a new - improved - UML version will be adopted soon. We reuse the existing OCL-based static semantics of UML and strengthen them by rectification and extension. As a result, the structural soundness of class and object diagrams is automatically ascertained and model-based tasks can be smoothly performed afterwards. Our approach supports the usage of profiles as long as these specify their static semantics on OCL. We show this by an example taken from the railway control systems domain. Behavioral soundness is not checked as we believe that it is not desirable to define one concrete behavioral semantics for UML as different application domains require different semantics at least in details. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify metabolite patterns associated with childhood obesity, to examine relations of these patterns with measures of adiposity and cardiometabolic risk, and to evaluate associations with maternal peripartum characteristics.\\n\\nMETHODS: Untargeted metabolomic profiling was used to quantify metabolites in plasma of 262 children (6-10 years). Principal components analysis was used to consolidate 345 metabolites into 18 factors and identified two that differed between obese (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200995\u2030; n\u2009=\u200984) and lean children (BMI\u2009<\u200985\u2030; n\u2009=\u2009150). The relations of these factors with adiposity (fat mass, BMI, skinfold thicknesses) and cardiometabolic biomarkers (HOMA-IR, triglycerides, leptin, adiponectin, hsCRP, IL-6) using multivariable linear regression was then investigated. Finally, the associations of maternal prepregnancy obesity, gestational weight gain, and gestational glucose tolerance with the offspring metabolite patterns was examined.\\n\\nRESULTS: A branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-related pattern and an androgen hormone pattern were higher in obese vs. lean children. Both patterns were associated with adiposity and worse cardiometabolic profiles. For example, each increment in the BCAA and androgen pattern scores corresponded with 6% (95% CI: 1, 13%) higher HOMA-IR. Children of obese mothers had 0.61 (0.13, 1.08) higher BCAA score than their counterparts.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: BCAA and androgen metabolites were associated with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk during mid-childhood. Maternal obesity may contribute to altered offspring BCAA metabolism.",

A recurring feature of these outflows is their broad ionization distribution including essentially ions (e.g., of Fe) from neutral to fully ionized. The absorption measure distribution (AMD) is defined as the distribution of column density with ionization parameter |d N_H/d (log xi)|. AMDs of Seyfert outflows can span up to five orders of magnitude in xi. We present the AMD of five outflows and show that they are all rather flat, perhaps slightly rising towards high ionization. More quantitatively, a power-law fit for log AMD ~ (log xi)^a yields slopes of 0 < a < 0.4. These slopes tightly constrain the density profiles of the wind, which until now could be addressed only by theory. If the wind is distributed on large scales, the measured slopes imply a generic density radial profile of n ~ r^{-alpha} with 1 < alpha < 1.3. This scaling rules out a mass conserving radial flow of n ~ r^{-2}, or a constant density absorber, but is consistent with a non-spherical MHD outflow model in which n ~ r^{-1} along any given line of sight. On the other hand, if ionization variations are a result of local (delta r) density gradients, e.g. as in the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), the AMD slopes imply density scaling of n ~ delta r^{-alpha} with 0.7 < alpha < 1.0, which is quite different from the scaling of approximately n ~ delta r^{0.4} found in the Milky Way ISM and typical of incompressible turbulence.",

Salla disease leads to learning disability* with a wide clinical variation. Two main categories of the disease have been classified: a conventional subtype and a severe subtype with more severe defects. We present detailed neurocognitive profiles of 41 Finnish patients with Salla disease (19 females, 22 males; age range 11mo to 63y, median 19y). The neurocognitive development of patients with Salla disease was assessed by psychological and neuropsychological testing. All patients were also examined by a paediatric neurologist and a speech therapist. The characteristic cognitive profile consisted of a lower non-verbal performance (mean developmental age 13mo) compared with linguistic skills (mean developmental age 17mo). In particular, spatial and visual-constructive impairments were typical of these patients. Tactile and visual discrimination of forms was poor. Tasks demanding hand-eye coordination, maintenance of visual attention, and those requiring short-term visual memory and executive skills were performed better. Receptive language skills were notably better compared with expressive speech. The patients' interactive and non-verbal communication skills were quite strong. Another typical pattern with Salla disease was severe motor disability. After the second decade of life, the decline in these skills was more pronounced than patients' cognitive deterioration. Our results indicate that even though there is a considerable variation in the clinical findings of patients with Salla disease, the characteristic neurocognitive profile of the disease can be outlined.",

The mean age of the cohort of 74 children at the time of evaluation was 10 years and 7 months. At follow-up all patients underwent a thorough neurological examination and a psychometric test battery, which included intellectual assessment and evaluation of behaviour by means of the CBCL/6-18. Results indicated elevated mean scores (T > 60) on CBCL/6-18 scales which measure problems with anxiety, depression, attention, social relationships, disruptive and rule-breaking behaviour. Mean CBCL scores of stage III patients were significantly higher than the mean scores of stage II patients on scales which measure social problems, disruptive and rule-breaking behaviour. In addition, problems with conduct, attention, attention-deficit/hyperactivity problems, affective problems as well as the total problem scores were more pronounced in the patients with stage III TBM.

The most important challenge to interpretation in this setting arises when either or both of \"drop-out\" and \"drop-in\" create discordances between the crime scene DNA profile and the DNA profile expected under the prosecution allegation. Stutter and unbalanced peak heights are also problematic, in addition to the effects of masking from the profile of a known contributor. We outline a framework for assessing such evidence, based on likelihood ratios that involve drop-out and drop-in probabilities, and apply it to two casework examples. Our framework extends previous work, including new approaches to modelling homozygote drop-out and uncertainty in allele calls for stutter, masking and near-threshold peaks. We show that some current approaches to interpretation, such as ignoring a discrepant locus or reporting a \"Random Man Not Excluded\" (RMNE) probability, can be systematically unfair to defendants, sometimes extremely so. We also show that the LR can depend strongly on the assumed value for the drop-out probability, and there is typically no approximation that is useful for all values. We illustrate that ignoring the possibility of drop-in is usually unfair to defendants, and argue that under circumstances in which the prosecution relies on drop-out, it may be unsatisfactory to ignore any possibility of drop-in. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The children's families varied substantially in their socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity. To develop the profiles, the dimensions derived from the School-Age Temperament Inventory were subjected to a second order principal factor analysis with varimax rotation. Pearson chi-squares were used to determine whether sociodemographic variables were proportionally represented among the profiles. Forty-two percent of the children were classified into four temperament profiles. High maintenance and cautious/slow to warm up were deemed as challenging temperaments. Industrious and social/eager to try were mirror images of those profiles and were labeled easy. Some children were both types of challenging or easy profiles. The generalizability of the profiles in relation to the sociodemographic variables of gender, age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status was also examined. Challenging temperament profiles were disproportionately represented by boys, Hispanic children, and those from lower socioeconomic families. Girls were over represented in the group that included both types of easy temperaments. Social/eager to try children were more often from higher rather than lower socioeconomic status families. Clinical applications and research implications for the profiles are discussed. The profiles can be used as exemplars that parents can use to recognize their child's temperament. Further research is needed to explore whether different developmental outcomes are associated with the profiles. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.",

The profiles were based on four motivational types delineated by self-determination theory (i.e., external, introjected, identified, intrinsic). Latent profile analysis revealed six distinct motivational profiles. One of these was a self-determined profile (high identified and intrinsic motivation, moderately low introjected motivation, and low external motivation). Four other profiles combined average levels of external motivation with either very low, low, moderately low, or high internal (i.e., introjected, identified, and intrinsic) motivation. The final profile involved moderately high levels of all four motives. The antecedents of profile membership examined were perceived supervisor support and perceived organizational politics. The career-related outcomes of profile membership were work attitudes and promotability. The self-determined and high internal motivation profiles were associated with the most favorable work attitudes, followed by the moderately high motivation profile. The low internal motivation profiles were associated with the least favorable attitudes. Promotability did not differ across the profiles. With respect to the antecedents, low levels of supervisor support and high levels of politics increased the odds that a manager would exhibit profiles that were less desirable than the self-determined profile. Our findings provide initial information about managers' motivational profiles, as well as the antecedents and consequences of these profiles. Further, these results demonstrate the promise of a person-centered approach for advancing motivation research and management development.",

The three-second gust speed is derived using Durst's model in terms of the mean wind speed and turbulence intensity given in the former versions of ASCE 7. A review of these profiles suggests a notable inconsistency in the embedded relationship among the wind profiles in ASCE 7-98, which is also apparent when these are compared to the profiles in major international codes and standards. To overcome this inconsistency in the definition of wind profiles, this paper proposes a modified turbulence intensity profile and suggests retaining the current mean wind and gust speed profiles.

In the recent years, we have witnessed the development of highly sophisticated inversion codes that are now widely applied to spectro-polarimetric observations. The majority of these inversion codes are based on the optimization of a complicated non-linear merit function. The experience gained has facilitated the recovery of the model that best fits a given observation. However, and except for the recently developed inversion codes based on database search algorithms together with the application of Principal Component Analysis, no reliable and statistically well-defined confidence intervals can be obtained for the parameters inferred from the inversions.Aims.A correct estimation of the confidence intervals for all the parameters that describe the model is mandatory. Additionally, it is fundamental to apply efficient techniques to assess the ability of models to reproduce the observations and to determine to what extent the models have to be refined or can be simplified.Methods.Bayesian techniques are applied to analyze the performance of the model to fit a given observed Stokes vector. The posterior distribution, that takes into account both the information about the priors and the likelihood, is efficiently sampled using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. For simplicity, we focus on the Milne-Eddington approximate solution of the radiative transfer equation and we only take into account the generation of polarization through the Zeeman effect. However, the method is extremely general and other more complex forward models can be applied, even allowing for the presence of atomic polarization.Results.We illustrate the method with different problems, from academic to more realistic examples. We show that the information provided by the posterior distribution is fundamental to understand and determine the amount of information available in the Stokes profiles in these particular cases. \u00a9 2007 ESO.",

Beneficial effects have been reported for interventions incorporating adaptive coping in bipolar disorder. Identification of differential coping preferences in bipolar disorder sub-types has etiological and clinical implications. As most studies to date have focused exclusively on bipolar I disorder, the current study examines coping profiles in those with a bipolar I or II disorder, contrasted with unipolar depressive and healthy controls. Methods Groups were derived on the basis of agreement between clinician and DSM-IV diagnoses. Participants (94 bipolar I, 114 bipolar II, 109 unipolar recurrent depression, 100 healthy controls) completed coping style measures including the Brief Cope, Responses to Positive Affect questionnaire, Response Styles Questionnaire, the Coping Inventory for Prodromes of Mania, and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Results Bipolar (I and II) participants were more likely than unipolar participants to ruminate about positive affect, and engage in risk taking when faced with negative affect. Medication status and current mood symptoms influenced risk-taking scores in the bipolar sub-sets, however rumination about positive affect appeared to represent a trait-like response in those with a bipolar II disorder. Behavioral coping strategies differentiated bipolar sub-types, with bipolar II participants being less likely to seek support when faced with stress, and less likely to engage in strategies to down-regulate hypomania. Conclusion Coping style differences were observed between bipolar sub-types. Further consideration of such differentiating characteristics should serve to direct the focus towards specific targets for clinical intervention, reflecting nuances integral to the differing conditions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

The neuroendocrine window into the brain has been considered as a fruitful and promising approach to the study of mental disorders, as suggested by studies of some neuroendocrine challenge tests in depression that demonstrated their potential use as biological markers. The modern approach to hormonal dynamics focuses on the circadian and pulsatile profiles that truly represent physiological modulation and tests the hypothesis that an abnormality in circadian rhythms is present in affective illness. From the fundamental point of view, such studies performed using a frequent sampling interval over the 24-h cycle aim to clarify the control and significance of the temporal sleep and wake fluctuations of neuroendocrine system activities. Twenty-four-hour hypersecretion of cortisol, diurnal hypersecretion of growth hormone, and normal 24-h levels of prolactin have been reported in careful chronobiological studies of depressed patients, along with sleep recordings. In addition, a nocturnal quiescent period, and a subsequent increase towards the morning maximum, have been consistently found in a subset of depressed patients suffering from endogenous depression. After successful treatment with antidepressants, most of these abnormalities (with the exception of those found in the prolactin study) tend to correct. The normalization of the timing of hormonal secretion was accompanied by a correction of sleep abnormalities and in particular, a lengthening of the REM latencies. Normalization of cortisol secretion was associated with a decrease in the magnitude of episodic cortisol pulses whereas normalization of growth hormone secretion was due to a diminished number of secretory pulses. In conclusion, a disorder of circadian time-keeping seems to characterize acute episodes of major endogenous depression in some patients. This abnormality as well as the associated increases in adrenocorticotropic and somatotropic activities seem to be a state-, rather than trait-dependent phenomenon.",

Methods An e-mail-based survey was distributed to EVST representatives in 33 countries. The questionnaire examined the current structure of vascular surgery training and certification (monospecialty, subspecialty, no specialty), as well as the evolving revisions of national curricula. Questionnaires were returned from 31 countries, two of which implement two training models. Results Vascular surgery (VS) as a monospecialty is the leading training model in 18 out of 31 countries, nine countries follow the subspecialty model, and six countries have no accredited vascular programs. The mean duration of dedicated VS training in monospecialty is significantly longer compared with subspecialty (3.8 vs. 2.9 years, p =.036) or no specialty models (3.8 vs. 1 years, p <.001). 83% of countries implementing an independent certification have recently updated their training curriculum; the respective rates for countries implementing a subspecialty or no specialty model are 56% and 17%. Among countries that offer VS certification, the endovascular logbook is mandatory in 78%, quality control of training centers or trainers is implemented in 62%, and training centers are reported as heterogeneous in 46%.

In early pregnancy (median 13.0 weeks, 90% range 10.4\u201317.1), we assessed the maternal folate and homocysteine blood concentrations, folic acid supplement use, and the MTHFR C677T genotype in mothers and newborns. In newborns, DNA methylation was measured in umbilical cord blood white blood cells at 11 regions of the seven genes: NR3C1, DRD4, 5-HTT, IGF2DMR, H19,KCNQ1OT1, and MTHFR. The associations between the 1-C determinants andDNAmethylation were examined using linear mixed models. An association was observed between maternal folate deficiency and lower newborn DNA methylation, which attenuated after adjustment for potential confounders. The maternal MTHFR TT genotype was significantly associated with lower DNA methylation. However, maternal homocysteine and folate concentrations, folic acid supplement use, and the MTHFR genotype in the newborn were not associated with newborn DNA methylation. The maternal MTHFR C677T genotype, as a determinant of folate status and 1-C metabolism, is associated with variations in the epigenome of a selection of genes in newborns.

Expression profiles can exist at various levels of abstraction, yielding information across various tissues or across diseases within a particular tissue.

For the profiles to be so close to Gaussian, the calculations indicate that these masers must originate in quite hot gas with temperatures greater than 1200 K-a conclusion that is supportive of C-type shocks as the origin of these masers. In addition, the degree of saturation of these masers must be less than approximately one-third, from which it follows that the beaming angles are less than about 10-4 sr and the actual luminosities are modest.

In the upper part of the vertical profile, the measured data exhibit an exponential decay distribution with a positive deviation occurring in the near-bed region. The measured longitudinal profiles are similar to the measured vertical profiles. Linking both profiles and the modes of sand transport, it is possible that saltating sand grains give rise to the well-known exponential decay distribution of mass flux, and that creeping and reptating grains force a deviation from it. A simple equation applicable for both the vertical and the longitudinal sand mass flux variations is introduced and the parameters are estimated from experimental data. ?? 2002 Elsevier B.V.

While UML has established itself in detailed software design, its us- age as an architecture description language is still taking its shape. In particular, there is a growing need for techniques to define domain specific architectural constraints and con- ventions in UML.We address this issue by adopting the con- cept of UML profiles for architectural design. Architectural profiles are specialized for describing and constraining soft- ware architecture descriptions for a given domain. We argue that these profiles represent an appropriate abstraction level to elaborate architectural constraints and conventions. We present a general schema for arranging architectural profiles and a set of conformance rules that define how these profiles are interpreted, constituting a profile definition language for validating architectural design.

Contaminated electrolyte profiles are an overlooked and potentially dangerous source of inaccurate clinical data. This study aimed to develop a method to accurately identify electrolyte profiles contaminated with normal saline to prevent reporting of erroneous measurements. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 76,497 electrolyte profiles from 5032 patients in a deidentified clinical database of all patients in the electronic medical record at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Five methods to identify errors in quantification based on either deviations from observed concentration distributions or expected numerical changes from saline contamination were developed and tested. Potentially contaminated measurements were validated based on changes in electrolyte concentrations observed in the subsequent sample. Results: Identification of erroneous electrolyte profiles based on absolute and percent deviations from normal variation rarely resulted in > 50% of identified samples validated as contaminated. A targeted methodology based on expected changes in calcium and chloride concentrations due to saline contamination validated approximately 80% of identified samples when higher thresholds for changes in electrolyte concentration were used and 50% of identified samples when lower thresholds were used. Conclusions: Targeted methodology based on changes in chloride and calcium successfully identified electrolyte profiles suspicious for contamination. Implementation of this methodology could prevent misinterpretation of a patient's clinical course, inappropriate interventions, and unwarranted changes in treatment strategy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Our work comprises the study of the galaxy density profiles and the fraction of galaxies per spectral type as a function of the group-centric distance. We have calculated the projected galaxy density profiles of galaxy groups using composite samples in order to increase the statistical significance of the results. Special cares have been taken in order to avoid possible biases in the group identification and the construction of the projected galaxy density profile estimator. The results show that the projected galaxy density profiles obtained for both redshift surveys are in agreement with a projected Navarro, Frenk & White predictions in the range $0.15< r/r_{200} < 1$, whereas a good fit for the measured profiles in the whole range of $r/r_{200}$ is given by a projected King profile. We have adopted a generalized King profile to fit the measured projected density profiles per spectral type. In order to infer the 3-D galaxy density profiles, we deproject the 2-D density profiles using a deprojection method similar to the developed by Allen & Fabian. From 2-D and 3-D galaxy density profiles we have estimated the corresponding galaxy fractions per spectral type. The 2-D fraction of galaxies computed using the projected profiles show a similar segregation of galaxy spectral types as the obtained by Dom\\'{\\i}nguez et al. for groups in the early data release of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. As expected, the trends obtained for the 3-D galaxy fractions show steeper slopes than the observed in the 2-D fractions.",

The data are from 40 nail clippings from eight donors where approximately 4\u00a0mm(2) of nail is added directly to the PCR. The NGM\u2122 kit was used that amplifies 15 STR loci plus amelogenin. No increase in cycle number was used and no enrichment of the PCR products was performed. Full DNA profiles were observed in 17 of the 40 profiles with 21 generating partial DNA profiles. The process omits the DNA extraction process, and hence there is no opportunity to quantify the DNA prior to amplifying the STRs, but by not performing a DNA extraction step, the amount of DNA available for PCR is maximized. Single source DNA profiles were observed in 29 of the 38 profiles obtained. The source of the DNA is assumed to be adhering to the underside of the nail. This simple method offers a significant reduction in time to generate DNA profiles from nail clippings, such as those taken from victims of mass disasters, and should be included into a forensic process relatively easily as it requires no change to manufacturer's instructions for amplification.",

Thus, the intrinsic differential equation bearing on arc-length and tangent direction angle was studied. Using the inherent differential equation and general functional theory, the conversion ideas between the expression of intrinsic differential equation and the expression in Cartesian coordinate was studied, and the condition of involutes characteristic was presented. The detailed analysis of four typical scroll profiles was given. According to the four typical scroll profiles and based on the method of Taylor series, the unified formation of general functional integration scroll profiles was established, which perfected general theory of scroll profiles increasingly. The envelope method to seek conjugation engagement profiles was studied. The unified general functional equation of scroll profiles represented the admissible function scrolls and the conjugation engagement characteristic of which was studied. The engagement condition of conjugation scroll profiles and the expression in Cartesian coordinate of conjugation scroll profiles of general functional integration scroll profiles were educed. Therefore, the restriction of inherent characteristics of single scroll profiles model is broken through. Solid modeling and machine tool path simulation can bridge the gap between design and manufacture which is essential for the design and manufacture of scroll compressors. With this method a perfect solid model can be achieved, which leads to an optimal design in terms of quality, delivery time and cost.

Examination of the changes in the values of the apparent kinetic parameters KS[superscript app], k[subscript cat][superscript app], and (k[subscript cat]/K[subscript M])[superscript app] in response to various modes of inhibition may be informative to students when presented in combination with Gibbs energy profiles. Herein, the symbolism of standard Gibbs energy profiles is utilized to derive expressions for the changes in Gibbs energy associated with the apparent kinetic parameters and to describe their behavior in the presence of either a competitive, uncompetitive, noncompetitive, or linear mixed-type inhibitor under rapid equilibrium conditions.

Traditional port-based technique has become much less effective since many new applications no longer use well-known port numbers. In this paper, we propose a novel profile-based approach to identify traffic flows belonging to the target application. In contrast to classifying traffic based on statistics of individual flows in previous studies, we build behavioral profiles of the target application, which describe dominant patterns of the application. Based on the behavioral profiles, a two-level matching is used in identifying new traffic. We first determine if a host participates in the application by comparing its behavior with the profiles. Subsequently, for each flow of the host we compare if it matches with the patterns in the profiles to determine which flows belong to this application. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on campus traffic traces. Our results show that one can identify the popular P2P applications with very high accuracy.",

The method is demonstrated by the evolution of an approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drug into brain-penetrable ligands with either specific polypharmacology or exquisite selectivity profiles for G-protein-coupled receptors. Overall, 800 ligand-target predictions of prospectively designed ligands were tested experimentally, of which 75% were confirmed to be correct. We also demonstrate target engagement in vivo. The approach can be a useful source of drug leads when multi-target profiles are required to achieve either selectivity over other drug targets or a desired polypharmacology.",

This novel application provided detectable levels of over one hundred fifteen volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) from a single 40. mL puff. The aerosol profiles from four commercially available e-cigarettes were compared to their respective solution profiles with the same GC-MS method. Solution profiles produced upwards of sixty four unidentified and identified (some only tentatively) constituents and aerosol profiles produced upwards of eighty two compounds. Results demonstrated distinct analyte profiles between liquid and aerosol samples. Most notably, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and siloxanes were found in the aerosol profiles; however, these compounds were never present in the solutions. These results implicate the aerosolization process in the formation of compounds not found in solutions; have potential implications for human health; and stress the need for an emphasis on electronic cigarette aerosol testing.",

Information was further collected regarding potential determinants of the functional features of the intensity profiles at three levels: trait-, episode-, and moment-determinants. Regarding steepness at onset, it was found for positive and negative emotions that intensity profiles have an especially explosive start when the eliciting stimulus is important, when the stimulus is still present during the beginning of the episode, and, in case of positive emotions, when the participant is an extravert. Concerning skewness, it was found for positive and negative emotions that profiles reach their peak more often towards the end when the eliciting stimulus is important, when the stimulus is absent during the beginning of the episode but present towards the end, and, in case of negative emotions, when the stimulus is uncontrollable. Regarding the number of peaks, it was found that profiles more often have multiple peaks when the eliciting stimulus is absent during the middle of the emotional episode.",

However, accumulating evidences suggest that both arms of many pre-miRNAs can yield mature functional miRNAs. Herein, we attempted to compare the isomiR expression profiles between the two arms through analyzing in-house and published small RNA deep sequencing datasets. Although many miR-#-5p and miR-#-3p have been reported as functional miRNAs, fewer miRNA pairs (11 and 6 pairs are collected in tumor and normal cells, respectively) are simultaneously identified as abundant miRNA species. According to isomiR types and dominant isomiR species, miR-#-5p and miR-#-3p show various isomiR expression profiles as well as diverse enrichment levels. IsomiR profiles of non-dominant arm are not well-conserved in 5' ends as well as isomiR profiles of dominant arm. If both the miR-#-5p and miR-#-3p are abundantly expressed, their isomiR expression profiles are always stable across different samples. Similar to diverse enrichment levels of miR-#-5p and miR-#-3p, the isomiR expression patterns may also be influenced by the phenomenon of \"arm switching\". The diverged isomiR expression profiles further enrich the complexity of multiple isomiRs, and complicate the coding-non-coding RNA regulatory network. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

The experimental Compton profiles are in good agreement with theoretical profiles employing the local density approximation\u2013based band theory framework. Extensive comparisons between the computed and measured profiles, their first derivatives, and anisotropies defined as differences between various pairs of profiles show an excellent level of accord. The details related to the Fermi surface are clearly seen in the experimental Compton profiles. However, subtle but systematic direction-dependent discrepancies remain between the experimental and theoretical profiles, suggesting that a better treatment of electron correlation effects in the inhomogeneous electron gas is needed to develop a satisfactory description of the momentum density in Be. Our analysis also indicates that the effective momentum resolution in low-energy Compton experiments possesses intrinsic limitations due to final-state interactions and possibly cannot be enhanced arbitrarily by improving the instrumental resolution.",

We find that the circular velocity curves are substantially better described by Stoehr et al. (SWTS) profiles than by Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) or Moore et al. profiles. Our findings confirm that no asymptotic slope is reached and that the profiles are nearly universal, but not perfectly. The velocity profiles curve at a constant rate in log (r) over the full converged range in radii and the corresponding extrapolated density profiles reach a finite maximum density. We find that the claim of a strong discrepancy between the observed inner slopes of the density profiles of low surface brightness galaxies and their simulated counterparts on the grounds of currently available observations and simulations is unfounded. In addition, if the SWTS profile turns out to be a good description of the halo profile for the regions that cannot be probed with simulations of today, then even in these regions the agreement between simulations and observations is very reasonable.",

Of the poor readers with normal verbal ability, 60% were classified as phonological dyslexics and none was classified as surface dyslexic. In students low in verbal ability, surface dyslexia was more common. However, when imbalanced word-reading profiles were defined in relation to fourth-grade reading-level controls, only 12 phonological dyslexics and 1 surface dyslexic were identified.

The important leaders of history are dead and (adapting a quotation from Glad, 1973) they have taken their personality characteristics-Oedipus complexes, authoritarianism, or power motivation-with them. Living leaders are protected from direct intrusions of psychological inquiry, so that one cannot even imagine giving them standard personality tests, questionnaires, surveys, or even psychological interviews. For these reasons, this chapter focuses on ways of measuring leaders' personalities indirectly, at a distance. After a brief prologue discussing when and how personality might be expected to affect political outcomes, I survey the major methods political psychologists have employed to study the personalities of individual actors. I use a fourfold framework of the different elements or variables of personality to discuss the many specific variables commonly used in these at-a-distance studies, focusing particularly on successful leadership and conflict escalation.

The longer the duration time for these coals, the greater possibility for spontaneous combustion to take place. Spontaneously burnt coals result in economical and environmental problems. Therefore, taking the necessary precautions before an outburst of the spontaneous combustion phenomenon is too important in terms of its severe results. In this study, a stockpile having industrial dimensions was formed in coal stockyard. The effective parameters on the stockpiles of coal such as temperature and humidity of the weather, time, and atmospheric pressure values were measured. The interior temperature variations of these stockpiles caused by the atmospheric conditions were also measured. The interior temperature distribution maps of the stockpile together with maximum and minimum temperature values were expressed visually and numerically by the assistance of obtained data.",

        "abstract": "The highly coordinated output of the hypothalamic biological clock does not only govern the daily rhythm in sleep/wake (or feeding/fasting) behaviour but also has direct control over many aspects of hormone release. In fact, a significant proportion of our current understanding of the circadian clock has its roots in the study of the intimate connections between the hypothalamic clock and multiple endocrine axes. This chapter will focus on the anatomical connections used by the mammalian biological clock to enforce its endogenous rhythmicity on the rest of the body, using a number of different hormone systems as a representative example. Experimental studies have revealed a highly specialised organisation of the connections between the mammalian circadian clock neurons and neuroendocrine as well as pre-autonomic neurons in the hypothalamus. These complex connections ensure a logical coordination between behavioural, endocrine and metabolic functions that will help the organism adjust to the time of day most efficiently. For example, activation of the orexin system by the hypothalamic biological clock at the start of the active phase not only ensures that we wake up on time but also that our glucose metabolism and cardiovascular system are prepared for this increased activity. Nevertheless, it is very likely that the circadian clock present within the endocrine glands plays a significant role as well, for instance, by altering these glands' sensitivity to specific stimuli throughout the day. In this way the net result of the activity of the hypothalamic and peripheral clocks ensures an optimal endocrine adaptation of the metabolism of the organism to its time-structured environment.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The possible detrimental effect of hypoxia on the barrier function of corneal epithelial cells and whether keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) might protect against such an effect were investigated. METHODS: Simian virus 40-transformed human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells were cultured for 4 days to allow the establishment of barrier function. They were then deprived of serum for 24 hours before exposure to 1% (hypoxia) or 21% (normoxia) oxygen for 24 hours. Barrier function was evaluated by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). The localization of ZO-1 and occludin was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy, and the expression of these tight junctional proteins as well as the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK, p38, and JNK were examined by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: Hypoxia induced a decrease in the TER of HCE cells compared with that of cells maintained under normoxia. The localization of ZO-1 at cell-cell borders was disrupted by hypoxia, whereas the distribution of occludin was not affected. Hypoxia also induced the downregulation of ZO-1 and a decrease in the phosphorylation of ERK without affecting the phosphorylation of p38 or JNK. All these effects of hypoxia were inhibited by KGF. The effects of KGF on TER and ZO-1 localization in cells exposed to hypoxia were inhibited by PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK signaling. Neither hypoxia nor KGF exhibited mitogenic or cytotoxic effects in HCE cells. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia induces disruption of the barrier function of HCE cells by eliciting the redistribution and degradation of ZO-1, and this effect is inhibited by KGF in a manner dependent on ERK activation.",

While historically software validation focused on the functional requirements, recent approaches also encompass the validation of quality requirements; for example, system reliability, performance or usability. Application development for mobile platforms opens an additional area of quality - power consumption. In PDAs or mobile phones, power consumption varies depending on the hardware resources used, making it possible to specify and validate correct or incorrect executions. Tools to find the power inconsistencies and to validate software from the energy point of view are needed. We obtained the power consumption and global event traces of mobile phone applications and matched them against the power consumption model providing the first evidence that software can be validated for the energy consumption.",

As the vehicle travels along the road with velocity v, the random process x (d) is converted to a random process x (t) which is input to the vehicle suspension via the tyre. The random process x (d) is usually described in terms of its power spectral density as a function of frequency in either radians or cycles per unit distance. However, there are several different ways of defining power spectral density, and this makes it difficult to compare published data without knowing how the power spectral density has been defined.

A large number of hot spots were observed that correlate well with those noted by previous observers. The hotspots tend to correspond to craters. Certain more extended regions, the maria and portions of maria, are warmer than the highlands. The 4.3 ??m temperature contrasts observed at various regions of the eclipsed Moon by MSX also agree with the mid-infrared values previously published, although there is a tendency for the MSX values to be warmer.

        "abstract": "3 Foreword Foreword This report provides information required by countries to assess their situation in face of the growing threat posed by noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The data included add to the WHO Global status report on noncommunicable diseases 2010. They are presented in this report as country-specifi c pages. The WHO Global status report on noncommunicable diseases 2010 (GSR 2010) showed that NCDs are the biggest cause of death worldwide. More than 36 million people died from NCDs in 2008, mainly cardiovascular diseases (48%), cancers (21%), chronic respiratory diseases (12%) and diabetes (3%). More than 9 million of these deaths occurred before the age of 60 and could have largely been prevented. Premature deaths from NCDs range from 22% among men and 35% among women in low-income countries to 8% among men and 10% among women in high-income countries. The GSR 2010 provides a baseline for future monitoring of NCD-related trends and for assessing the progress that countries are making to address cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers and chronic lung disease. It also provides a framework to monitor NCDs, focusing on exposures (risk factors), outcomes (morbidity and mortality) and health system capacity and response. This report adopts the same approach and areas of focus. It provides for the fi rst time for each Member State estimates on the burden of NCD mortality, prevalence and trends of selected major behavioural and metabolic risk factors and the country\u2019s capacity to respond to the NCD crisis. Data in this report are drawn from multiple sources including data provided by countries, estimates developed by WHO and the results of the global survey on assessment of national capacity for the prevention and control of NCDs which was conducted in 2009/2010. Every effort has been made to incorporate the most comprehensive, recent and reliable data and to validate these data with countries and other sources. However, where data were scarce there is greater uncertainty around these estimates. Exposure to the four main behavioural risk factors that contribute to NCDs - tobacco use, physical inactivity, harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets - remains high worldwide and is increasing in the majority of low- and middle-income countries. The country profi les presented here reveal an enormous burden on mortality and alarming rates for risk factors like tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, raised blood pressure, overweight and obesity, raised cholesterol and raised blood glucose. However, there are also signs of positive improvement in some countries where health systems have been strengthened and population strategies have been effectively applied. The profi les also show that health-care systems for NCDs in many countries struggle to establish and maintain integrated policies and deliver a comprehensive range of essential primary care services,from promotion and prevention, to early detection and timely treatment. As a result, a large proportion of people with high NCD risk remain undiagnosed and untreated. Improving health is not just about investing more resources. It is equally important to set national targets and measure results. I hope that the information contained in this report will be useful to countries and other stakeholders in identifying areas for priority action, in evaluating policy and programme interventions and in tracking progress. In this respect, WHO will continue to work with Member States to address the data gaps and improve the accuracy of the information included in the next edition of this report. Halting premature deaths from NCDs will require global solidarity and alliances that go beyond national boundaries. Eleven years since the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases to reduce the toll of premature deaths, the world has witnessed another breakthrough: the High-level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of NCDs in September 2011. The opportunity provided by this meeting, attended by heads of state and government, is unprecedented. This is the second time in the history of the United Nations that the General Assembly is meeting on a health issue with a major socio-economic impact. Implementing the political declaration of this High-level Meeting and the Action Plan of the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of NCDs is a major challenge to governments, other stakeholders and the international community. By ensuring that the response to NCDs is at the forefront of international efforts to promote inclusive economic growth and protect health, we will achieve a more balanced distribution of the benefi ts of global progress and reinforce the broader scope of human security. This gives me cause for great optimism. Dr Ala Alwan Assistant Director-General World Health Organization",

Contrary to earlier suggestions, we do not find indications of spontaneous 'transitional' CP violation in the MSSM. On the other hand, in case there is explicit CP violation in the stop and chargino/neutralino sectors, the relative phase between the Higgses does become space dependent, but only mildly even in the maximal case. We also demonstrate that spontaneous CP violation within the bubble wall could occur, e.g., if the Higgs sector of the MSSM were supplemented by a singlet. Finally we point out some implications for baryogenesis computations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Considerable effort has been expended over the last ten years on optimizing the design of the metal delivery system, particularly the pouring nozzle, in order to allow the consistent production of high quality steel at a high throughput. This paper looks forward to possible systems that are capable of tomographically imaging the distribution of molten steel flows in these applications. The paper will concentrate on the feasibility of using electromagnetic methods. The paper will present some initial results; an overview of the applied image reconstruction process will also be included. The paper will conclude with a discussion of possible future developments, such as the use of a tomographic or multi-frequency approach, future research on the reconstruction image procedures and the potential for Visualization and flow measurement. There is a need for further research in this area and some priority areas for future work will be suggested.",

However, design has often lacked sufficient hydraulic analysis to adequately assess the potential effects on flow resistance and flood levels. This paper describes the results of a hydraulic field study of four steep gravel\u2013cobble bed rivers where it was found that the energy loss across natural and constructed riffle\u2013pool sequences varied between 50 and 100% of the total energy loss over a range of high discharges up to, and including bankfull. This demonstrates that riffle reconstruction can influence postrehabilitation flood elevations, and that the additional flow resistance should be an important consideration in design. Importantly, the observed riffle energy loss is found to vary between 0.5 and 1 times the riffle amplitude, and it is proposed that this relationship can be used to account for the additional hydraulic resistance imparted by constructed riffles in the design and analysis of riffle\u2013pool rehabilitation initiatives in steep gravel\u2013cobble bed rivers.",

This paper presents a study of the characteristics of the users of MySpace web site, with the objective of studying relationships and interactions among users and deriving hints about their behavior. The analysis relies on data collected by monitoring the web site for 12 weeks. Typical user behaviors have been derived and classes of users characterized by different levels of participation to the social network have been identified. In particular, the analysis reveals that most of the users actively participate to the social network and specify many personal details.

We examine a previously proposed statistic for determining whether a group of strains is more similar than expected. We show the limitations of this statistic and propose a new statistic which better addresses the hypotheses that are usually considered in this field of study. The statistic proposed is based on similarity between strains within the group of interest and with those outside. This statistic also needs to account for the dependence in the raw data, and we use the correlation between elements of the dissimilarity matrix to investigate how this dependence affects the underestimation of the variance. Using examples involving the pathogenic yeast Candida, we show how permutation tests can be applied to the differentiation of groups of strains.",

Although the etiopathogeneses of these syndromes are different, they share many clinical and biochemical signs, such as hirsutism, acne, and chronic anovulation. Experimental data have shown that peripheral T-lymphocytes function as molecular sensors, being able to record molecular signals either at staminal and mature cell levels, or hormones at systemic levels. METHODS: Twenty PCOS women and 10 CAH with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, aged between 18-35 yr, were studied. T-cells purified from all patients and 20 healthy donors have been analyzed by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Silver-stained proteomic map of each patient was compared with a control map obtained by pooling protein samples of the 20 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Spots of interest were identified by peptide mass fingerprint. Computer analysis evidenced several peptidic spots significantly modulated in all patients examined. Some proteins were modulated in both syndromes, others only in PCOS or in CAH. These proteins are involved in many physiological processes as the functional state of immune system, the regulation of the cytoskeleton structure, the oxidative stress, the coagulation process, and the insulin resistance. CONCLUSION: Identification of the physiological function of these proteins could help to understand ethiopathogenetic mechanisms of hyperandrogenic syndromes and its complications.",

DESIGN: We analyzed Medicare claims data for a random sample of 0.1% of all Medicare beneficiaries with expenditures between 1993 and 1998. This sample yielded 7,966 deaths. SETTING: Medicare claims data. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries. MEASUREMENTS: We classified decedents into groups representing four trajectories at the end of life: sudden death, terminal illness, organ failure, and frailty. RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of decedents were captured by the profiling strategy. The four trajectory groups had distinct patterns of demographics, care delivery, and Medicare expenditures. Frailty was a dominant pattern, with 47% of all decedents, whereas sudden death claimed only 7%; cancer claimed 22%, and organ system failure, 16%. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical scheme to classify decedents appears to fit most decedents and to form groups with substantial clinical differences. Acknowledging the differences among these groups may be a fruitful way to evaluate expenditures and develop strategies to improve care at the end of life.",

However, the incorrectly assumed rectangular profiles are still mostly used especially in numerical optimizations. The reason is that the acquisition of injection profiles, for each injection volume and each flow rate considered in a computer-assisted optimization requires a too large number of experiments. In this article a new function is proposed, which enables highly accurate predictions of the injection profiles and thus more accurate computer optimizations, with a minimum experimental effort. To model the injection profiles for any injection volume at a constant flow rate, as few as two experimental injection profiles are required. If it is desirable to also take the effect of flow rate on the injection profiles into account, then just two additional experiments are required. The overlap between fitted and experimental injection profiles at different flow rates and different injection volumes were excellent, more than 90%, using experimental injection profiles from just four different injection volumes at two different flow rates. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the flow rate has a minor influence on the injection profiles and that the injection volume is the main parameter that needs to be accounted for. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

The region was recorded with the Vector-Spectromagnetograph of the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun facility. The active region produced several successive X-class flares between 19:00 UT and 24:00 UT on September 13, 2005 and we aim to quantify transient and permanent changes in the magnetic field and velocity field during one of the flares, which has been fully captured. Methods: The Stokes profiles were inverted using the height-dependent inversion code LILIA to analyze magnetic field vector changes at the flaring site. We report multilobed asymmetric Stokes V profiles found in the \u03b4-sunspot umbra. We fit the asymmetric Stokes V profiles assuming an atmosphere consisting of two components (SIR inversions) to interpret the profile shape. The results are put in context with Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) magnetograms and reconstructed X-ray images from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager. Results: We obtain the magnetic field vector and find signs of restructuring of the photospheric magnetic field during the flare close to the polarity inversion line at the flaring site. At two locations in the umbra we encounter strong fields (~3 kG), as inferred from the Stokes I profiles, which, however, exhibit a low polarization signal. During the flare we observe in addition asymmetric Stokes V profiles at one of these sites. The asymmetric Stokes V profiles appear co-spatial and co-temporal with a strong apparent polarity reversal observed in MDI-magnetograms and a chromospheric hard X-ray source. The two-component atmosphere fits of the asymmetric Stokes profiles result in line-of-sight velocity differences in the range of ~12 km s-1 to 14 km s-1 between the two components in the photosphere. Another possibility is that local atmospheric heating is causing the observed asymmetric Stokes V profile shape. In either case our analysis shows that a very localized patch of ~5\u2033 in the photospheric umbra, co-spatial with a flare footpoint, exhibits a subresolution fine structure.",

Three self-similar dynamic inside-out core collapse models - the conventional polytropic model, the empirical hybrid model and the isothermal model - for star-forming molecular clouds are examined and compared. The isothermal model cannot produce observed asymmetric double-peak molecular line profiles. The conventional polytropic model, which gives flow velocity, mass density and temperature profiles self-consistently, can produce asymmetric double-peak line profiles for a core collapsing cloud. In particular, the blue peak is stronger than the red peak, consistent with a broad class of molecular line-profile observations. We find that line profiles are robust against variations in the polytropic index \u03b3 once the effective line-centre opacity \u03ba0 is specified. The relative strengths of the blue and red peaks within a molecular line profile are determined by the cloud temperature gradient, but the emission at frequencies between the two line peaks is determined by detailed density and velocity profiles in the cloud core. In the presence of a static dense kernel at the centre of a collapsing cloud, strong internal absorption along the line of sight may occur, causing a suppression to the red wing of the blue line peak. If reliably resolved in frequency by observations, this signature may be potentially useful for probing the environs of an infant protostar. The conventional polytropic model can be utilized to produce molecular line-profile templates, for extracting dynamical information from line spectra of molecular globules undergoing a gravitational core collapse. We show a sample fit using the 140GHz H2CO emission line from the central region of the molecular globule B335 by our model with \u03b3 = 1.2. The calculation of line profiles and fitting processes also offer a scenario to estimate the protostellar mass, the kernel mass accretion rate and the evolution time-scale of a core collapsing cloud. Our model can be readily adapted to other tracer molecules with more or less constant abundances in star-forming clouds.",

Setting: IROC-Institut f\u00fcr Refraktive und Ophthalmo-Chirurgie, and Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. Methods: The basic ablation profile for myopic, hyperopic, and astigmatic correction is derived from the 2nd-order Zernike representation of wavefront aberrations. Including 4th-order spherical aberration and higher-order astigmatism in the theoretical calculation of the ablation profile allows precompensation for the expected amount of higher-order aberrations (HOAs). The shapes of wavefront-optimized ablation profiles are compared with the shapes of \"classic\" ablation profiles for myopic and astigmatic corrections. Results: The introduction of precompensating spherical aberration and higher-order astigmatism leads to a more aspheric ablation profile with a significant increase in ablation depth (up to 35%) in the midperiphery of the optical zone. The central ablation depth remains unchanged in the myopic correction but increases by 3% in cylinder correction. Conclusions: Wavefront-optimized ablation profiles provide a simple method to precompensate for the expected 4th-order spherical aberration and higher-order astigmatism in the average eye. Further clinical studies must be performed to prove the theoretical results; demonstrate the reduction in HOAs; and predict safety, predictability, and stability of wavefront-optimized ablation profiles. \u00a9 2004 ASCRS and ESCRS.",

METHODS: 36 subjects were defined as refractory on the basis of further attachment loss after scaling and root planing, surgery and systemically administered antibiotics. A total of 890 subgingival plaque samples (mean/subject=24.7) were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject at baseline and individually processed for their content of 40 subgingival taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Cluster analysis was performed on mean within subject species counts using the chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. Significant differences among clusters for individual and complexes of species were sought using the Kruskal Wallis test. The microbial profiles of the refractory subjects were compared with those of 27 periodontally healthy subjects (n plaque samples=708), 35 periodontally well-maintained elder subjects (n plaque samples=801) and 115 untreated adult periodontitis subjects (n plaque samples=2871). RESULTS: 28 of 36 refractory subjects fell into 4 clusters with >29% similarity. 10 of 40 species and 4 of 7 complexes differed significantly among clusters. Profile (Cluster) I (n=4) was characterized by high proportions of \"yellow\" and \"green\" complex species, profile II (n=3) by low total counts and high proportions of \"orange\" and \"purple\" complex species, profile III (n=9) by high total counts and counts of Actinomyces and \"purple\" complex species, profile IV (n=12) by high proportions of \"red\" and \"orange\" complex species. The mean profiles of each cluster were subjected to cluster analysis with microbial data from 4380 (mean 24.7) baseline subgingival plaque samples from 27 periodontally healthy, 35 treated, well-maintained elders and 115 untreated adult periodontitis subjects. 12 clusters were formed with >41% similarity. 3 of the refractory profiles were detected in 3 cluster groups. Profile II in a cluster of 1 healthy, 1 elder and 4 untreated periodontitis subjects; profile III in a cluster of 1 healthy, 2 elder and 12 periodontitis subjects; Profile IV, with 1 healthy and 5 untreated periodontitis subjects. The profile not detected in non refractory subjects was dominated by Streptococcus species. 9 clusters did not harbor refractory profiles. 11.1% of healthy, 8.6% of elder and 18.3% of periodontitis subjects were in clusters exhibiting refractory microbial profiles. CONCLUSIONS: 4 subgingival microbial profiles were detected among refractory subjects. \"Refractory microbial profiles\" could be detected in subjects who had not yet exhibited refractory disease.",

These technologies present us with unprecedented amounts of data - but with this sequencing data comes errors that are not only platform specific but also depend on the library preparation method and the type of sequencing (i.e. amplicon or metagenome). Illumina\u2019s sequencing platforms are currently among the most utilized platforms as they are able to generate millions of reads at relatively low cost \u2013 but Illumina error profiles are still poorly understood. A better knowledge of the error profiles is essential for sequence analysis and vital in order to draw valid conclusions. It has been reported that the major source of errors for Illumina are substitution-type miscalls. We developed a program that enables us to infer error profiles based on sequencing data from mock communities. This allows us to study and compare different errors and biases introduced by different sequencing machines, different library preparation methods as well as different types of sequencing. Here, we present the metagenome error profiles for a mock community that was sequenced on the Genome Analyzer (GA) II for the standard Illumina library preparation method (TruSeq). Being able to infer error profiles for individual sequencing runs has the potential to greatly improve our ability to correct errors and thus enhance further sequencing analysis. ",

Information on the actual usage of the application, in the form of \"usage profiles,\" is used to ensure that a new version of the application will function correctly. Usage profiles, sequences of events that end-users execute on a GUI, are used to develop a probabilistic usage model of the application. An algorithm uses the model to generate test cases that represent events the user is most likely to execute. Reverse engineering methods are used to extract the underlying structure of the application. An empirical study on four open source GUI applications reveals that test suites generated from the probabilistic model are 0.2-22% of the size of test suites produced directly from usage profiles. Furthermore, the test suites generated from the model detect more faults per test case than those detected directly from the usage profiles, and detect faults not detected by the original profiles",

The aim of this study was to establish the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of five periodontal pathogens to six commonly used antibiotics in periodontics. A total of 247 periodontal bacterial isolates were tested for susceptibility to the six antibiotics using the Etest method. MIC50 and MIC90 values (minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) were calculated. Both European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints were used in the study to interpret results. ??-Lactamase production was tested when amoxicillin resistance was found. MIC90 values of the anaerobic bacteria were all well below breakpoint values, except for three isolates of Prevotella intermedia and one isolate of Fusobacterium nucleatum that were resistant to amoxicillin (CLSI breakpoints); these isolates were ??-lactamase-positive. Two isolates of the capnophilic Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans appeared to be amoxicillin-resistant but failed to show ??-lactamase activity. Comparison with a previous study from The Netherlands showed minor differences in susceptibility profiles, but the MIC90 values of A. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin, clindamycin, azithromycin and tetracycline were higher. Geographical differences in the susceptibility profiles of Porphyromonas gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans between European countries were noted. Comparison of European susceptibility profiles with that of a South American country (Colombia) revealed a much higher resistance in the latter. Owing to these differences in susceptibility profiles, it is of concern to regularly perform surveillance studies on antibiotic resistance. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.",

Because proteins that participate in a common structural complex or metabolic pathway are likely to evolve in a correlated fashion, the phylogenetic profiles of such proteins are often 'similar' or at least 'related' to each other. The question we address in this paper is the following: how to measure the 'similarity' between two profiles, in an evolutionarily relevant way, in order to develop efficient function prediction methods? RESULTS: We show how the profiles can be mapped to a high-dimensional vector space which incorporates evolutionarily relevant information, and we provide an algorithm to compute efficiently the inner product in that space, which we call the tree kernel. The tree kernel can be used by any kernel-based analysis method for classification or data mining of phylogenetic profiles. As an application a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained to predict the functional class of a gene from its phylogenetic profile is shown to perform better with the tree kernel than with a naive kernel that does not include any information about the phylogenetic relationships among species. Moreover a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) of the phylogenetic profiles illustrates the sensitivity of the tree kernel to evolutionarily relevant variations.",

At first, the complexity of the chromatographic signals is reduced by chemometric resolution of the pure constituents. For this, the application of multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares leads to the decomposition of the multiway data block into a chemically meaningful bilinear model representing the chromatographic profiles and their spectral signatures. The flexible implementation of a spectral selectivity constraint allows the background to be differentiated from the constituent spectra. Hereby, the pure concentration profiles are obtained which are consequently individually aligned by correlation optimized warping. In its final step, the procedure reconstitutes the original data with the aligned chromatographic profiles and their corresponding spectra. The alignment is evaluated for two sets of chromatographic signals. The new procedure improves the original application of correlation optimized warping minimizing the risks of aligning noncorresponding chromatographic information.",

The theory is applied to water vapor and nitrogen in the Stefan tube as an example of two-dimensional fluid transport.

Comparison with the classic Stefan-diffusion equation shows that for wide tubes the latter approach is still reasonable, but for narrow tubes shear effects dominate. The nitrogen circulation causes radial concentration profiles. For small diameter tubes, the axial velocity profiles from the present model are close to those from the velocity profile model of Kerkhof et al. [2001.

It was shown that the curvature can be measured with highest accuracy and high lateral resolution. However, the reconstruction of surface profiles from curvature data involves the numerical solution of an ordinary differential equation for which initial or boundary values must be specified. This paper investigates the accuracy with which surface profiles can be reconstructed from curvature data. The stability of the reconstructions is examined with respect to the presence of measurement noise and the accuracy of the initial values. The assessment of the reconstruction accuracy is based on an analytical solution (up to numerical integration) derived for the case when the measurement results are given in Cartesian coordinates, and on numerical results in the polar case. The results presented for the latter case allow, in particular, conclusions to be drawn regarding the minimum accuracy of data and initial values required for reconstructing aspheres from curvature measurements with nanometer accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Online dating systems play a prominent role in the social lives of millions of their users, but little research has considered how users perceive one another through their personal profiles. We examined how users perceive attractiveness in online dating profiles, which provide their first exposure to a potential partner. Participants rated whole profiles and profile components on such qualities as how attractive, extraverted, and genuine and trustworthy they appeared. As past research in the psychology of attraction would suggest, the attractiveness and other qualities of the photograph were the strongest predictors of whole profile attractiveness, but they were not alone: the free-text component also played an important role in predicting overall attractiveness. In turn, numerous other qualities predicted the attractiveness ratings of photos and free-text components, albeit in different ways for men and women. The fixed-choice elements of a profile, however, were unrelated to attractiveness.",

We determine the shape and width parameters of the different distributions, when each flattened profile has the same radius and slope of the irradiance at its half-height point, and then we evaluate the implicit functional relationship between the shape and width parameters for matched profiles, which provides a quantitative way to compare profiles described by different families of functions. We conclude from an analysis of each profile with matched parameters using Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction theory and M2 analysis that the diffraction patterns as they propagate differ by small amounts, which may not be distinguished experimentally. Thus, beam shaping optics is designed to produce either of these four flattened output irradiance distributions with matched parameters will yield similar irradiance distributions as the beam propagates.",

The miRNA profiles are surprisingly informative, reflecting the developmental lineage and differentiation state of the tumours. We observe a general downregulation of miRNAs in tumours compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, we were able to successfully classify poorly differentiated tumours using miRNA expression profiles, whereas messenger RNA profiles were highly inaccurate when applied to the same samples.

The most correct method for deconvolution to obtain underlying T(e) and n(e) profiles is by consideration of scattered signals. However, deconvolution at the scattered signal level is complex since it requires knowledge of all spectral and absolute calibration data. In this paper a simple technique is presented where only knowledge of the instrument function I(r) and the measured profiles, T(e, observed)(r) and n(e, observed)(r), are required to obtain underlying T(e)(r) and n(e)(r). This method is appropriate for most TS systems and is particularly important where high spatial sampling is obtained relative to \u0394(R).",

The cam profiles, the paths of the cutter and the pressure angles can then be expressed in the form of parametric vector equations.

We discuss various details of the velocity profiles in all the regions of the flow curve and emphasize the complex, non-Newtonian nature of the flow in the highly sheared band.",

The study includes, for the first time, a self-consistent chemical and dynamical model which is then directly coupled to an appropriate radiative transfer model. The assumptions of chemical uniformity or simple monotonic variations within such cores are shown to be unacceptable. The results show that the abundance variations and the line profiles are highly sensitive to the assumed values of the free parameters in the chemical model. Extreme caution is therefore advised in the quantitative analysis of emission-line profiles from infall sources. The implied degeneracy can be overcome by multiple line-of-sight observations of many species and transitions.",

        "abstract": "The abundance of an mRNA species depends not only on the transcription rate at which it is produced, but also on its decay rate,which determines how quickly it is degraded. Both transcription rate and decay rate are important factors in regulating gene expression. With the advance of the age of genomics, there are a considerable number of gene expression datasets, in which the expression profiles of tens of thousands of genes are often non-uniformly sampled. Recently,numerous studies have proposed to infer the regulatory networks from expression profiles. Nevertheless, how mRNA decay rates affect the computational prediction of transcription rate profiles from expression profiles has not been well studied. To understand the influences, we present a systematic method based on a gene dynamic regulation model by taking mRNA decay rates, expression profiles and transcription profiles into account. Generally speaking,an expression profile can be regarded as a representation of a biological condition. The rationale behind the concept is that the biological condition is reflected in the changing of gene expression profile. Basically,the biological condition is either associated to the cell cycle or associated to the environmental stresses. The expression profiles of genes that belong to the former, so-called cell cycle data, are characterized by periodicity, whereas the expression profiles of genes that belong to the latter, so-called condition-specific data, are characterized by a steep change after a specific time without periodicity. In this paper, we examine the systematic method on the simulated expression data as well as the real expression data including yeast cell cycle data and condition-specific data (glucose-limitation data). The results indicate that mRNA decay rates do not significantly influence the computational prediction of transcription-rate profiles for cell cycle data. On the contrary,the magnitudes and shapes of transcription-rate profiles for condition specific data are significantly affected by mRNA decay rates. This analysis provides an opportunity for researchers to conduct future research on inferring regulatory networks computationally with available expression profiles under different biological conditions.",

The charging pattern of EVs is the main factor that determines these effects. Unregulated charging (probably when returning home) would have undesirable consequences (e.g. increase in variable costs, emissions, reduction of reliability) for the system, it is therefore necessary to develop an \u201cintelligent\u201d charging strategy. These characteristics justify the existence of different smart charging profiles. It is also important to assess the effect of using day-ahead management systems instead of pre-set profiles. This docu- ment compares different possible strategies for charging EVs and their consequences in the power system. The impact on variable costs, emissions and renewable energy sources integration will be obtained using an operation planning model. The Spanish power system for 2020 is analysed under different EV penetration levels and charging strategies. The results show the benefits of using smart charging profiles instead of an unregulated profile, obtaining large cost reductions and maintaining system reliability levels.Moreover, the benefits of using a day-ahead management system are also eval- uated, resulting in a small reduction of system variable cost compared to the use of pre-defined charging profiles",

This article investigates a simple integration method for producing accurate approximations to likelihood profiles that avoid problems associated with producing exact profiles. A basic theorem guarantees that the approximation can achieve any desired precision.In many cases the method requires no more than adding a few lines of code to that required to produce the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter vector. Standard methods for computing likelihood profiles are based on solving a sequence of constrainedmaximum likelihood problems. Each problem generates a point on the profile. An earlier article proposed an integration method that generates the entire profile directly by solving a differential equation. That method, however, requires the Hessian of the log-likelihood which can be difficult to produce. The method considered here requiresonly the gradient. It may be particularly useful in conjunction with the EM algorithm which typically does not produce any type of confidence interval.",

The ISIS and Alouette topside sounder satellites from the sixties to the eighties recorded millions of ionograms but most were not analyzed in terms of electron density profiles. In recent years an effort started to digitize the analog recordings to prepare the ionograms for computerized analysis. As of November 2001 about 350 000 ionograms have been digitized from the original 7-track analog tapes. These data are available in binary and CDF format from the anonymous ftp site of the National Space Science Data Center. A search site and browse capabilities on CDAWeb assist the scientific usage of these data. All information and access links can be found at http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/space/isis/isis-status. html. This paper describes the ISIS data restoration effort and shows how the digital ionograms are automatically processed into electron density profiles from satellite orbit altitude (1400 km for ISIS-2) down to the F peak. Because of the large volume of data an automated processing algorithm is imperative. The TOPside Ionogram Scaler with True height algorithm TOPIST software developed for this task is successfully scaling ~ 70% of the ionograms. An \u00abediting process\u00bb is available to manually scale the more difficult ionograms. The automated processing of the digitized ISIS ionograms is now underway, producing a much-needed database of topside electron density profiles for ionospheric modeling covering more than one solar cycle.",

However, the currency of such analysis is rapidly eroded by system changes; in dynamic systems these include the need to support ad-hoc collaboration, and dynamic connectivity between the system's components. This paper resolves these problems by showing how risks can be assessed incrementally as a system changes, using risk profiles, which characterize the risk to a system from subverted components. We formally define risk profiles, and show that their calculation can be fully distributed; each component is able to compute its own profile from neighbouring information. We further show that profiles converge to the same risks as systematic threat path enumeration, that changes in risk are efficiently propagated throughout a distributed system, and that the distributed computation provides a criterion for when the security consequences of a policy change are local to a component, or will propagate into the wider system. Risk profiles have the potential to supplement conventional risk assessments with useful new metrics, maintain accurate continuous assessment of risks in dynamic distributed systems, link a risk assessment to the wider environment of the system, and evaluate defence-in-depth strategies. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Treatment strategies that optimize benefit and minimize morbidities depend on accurate estimates of disease status and likelihood of progression. Emerging technologies capable of qualitatively and quantitatively profiling genes expressed by neoplastic tissues may provide insights into tumor behavior. This review discusses the use of microarray based transcript expression profiling to stratify human cancers into risk categories. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE was used to perform a comprehensive literature review of reports describing the assessment of gene expression profiles in malignant diseases. Particular emphasis was placed on studies developing models using individual genes or gene cohorts as predictors of prostate cancer outcome. RESULTS: Alterations in the expression of individual genes identified by microarray analyses have been used in studies of outcome in cancers of the prostate and other tissue types. Profiles of expressed genes have been used to develop prediction models that stratify cancers into prognostic categories based on relapse rates or responses to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profiles offer an opportunity for acquiring molecular determinants correlating with clinical outcome. With rare exceptions these profiles have yet to be validated or used in prospective studies. Future research will benefit from assessments of intratumor heterogeneity and host factors such as the immune response and hormonal milieu. The prospective validation of predictive models will serve to prove usefulness in the clinical arena.",

ATSDR also developed six interaction profiles for chemical mixtures. Two profiles were developed for persistent environmental chemicals that are often found in contaminated fish and also can be detected in human breast milk. The mixture included chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, hexachlorobenzene, dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethane, methyl mercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Two profiles each were developed for mixtures of metals and mixtures of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) that are frequently found at hazardous waste sites. The two metal profiles dealt with (a) lead, manganese, zinc, and copper; and (b) arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and lead; the two VOCs mixtures dealt with (a) 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene; and (b) benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTEX). Weight-of-evidence methodology was used to assess the joint toxic action for most of the mixtures. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling was used for BTEX.

We controlled for age, gender, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Hispanics have more risk factors above clinical risk levels than do Whites but fewer than Blacks. Differences between Hispanics and Whites disappeared after we controlled for socioeconomic status, but results differed by nativity. After we controlled for socioeconomic status, the differences between foreign-born Hispanics and Whites were eliminated, but US-born Mexican Americans still had higher biological risk scores than did both Whites and foreign-born Mexican Americans. CONCLUSIONS: There is no Hispanic paradox in biological risk profiles. However, our finding that foreign-born Hispanics and Whites had similar biological risk profiles, but US-born Mexican Americans had higher risk, was consistent with hypothesized effects of migrant health selectivity (healthy people in-migrating and unhealthy people out-migrating) as well as some differences in health behaviors between US-born and foreign-born Hispanics.",

Transcription factors (TFs) play important regulatory roles in this kind of differential gene expression. Therefore, to elucidate how these TFs regulate the complex differential gene expression, it is necessary to identify all target genes of them and construct the gene transcription regulatory network controlled by them. DNA binding is a key step for TFs regulating gene transcription. Therefore, in order to identify their target genes, it is indispensable to identify all possible DNA sequences that can be recognized and bound by TFs at the molecular level of their interactions with DNA, i.e., construction of the DNA-binding profiles of TFs. In recent years, along with the development of DNA microarray and high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques, there appeared some revolutionary new techniques for constructing DNA-binding profiles of TFs, which greatly promotes studies in this field. These techniques include ChIP-chip and ChIP-Seq for constructing in vivo DNA-binding profiles of TFs, dsDNA microarray, SELEX-SAGE, Bind-n-Seq, MMP-SELEX, EMSA-Seq, and HiTS-FLIP for constructing in vitro DNA-binding profiles of TFs.

However, there are many ways one can measure the similarity of expression profiles, and it is not clear a priori what is the most effective one. Moreover, so far no clear distinction has been made as for the type of the functional link between genes as suggested by microarray data. Similarly expressed genes can be part of the same complex as interacting partners; they can participate in the same pathway without interacting directly; they can perform similar functions; or they can simply have similar regulatory sequences. Here we conduct a study of the notion of functional link as implied from expression data. We analyze different similarity measures of gene expression profiles and assess their usefulness and robustness in detecting biological relationships by comparing the similarity scores with results obtained from databases of interacting proteins, promoter signals and cellular pathways, as well as through sequence comparisons. We also introduce variations on similarity measures that are based on statistical analysis and better discriminate genes which are functionally nearby and faraway.

The EEA profiles consisted of assays for 21 hydrolases, measured using fluorogenic substrates arrayed on 96-well microplates. Commercially available BiOLOG(R) GN and ECO plates, which contained 120 different substrates, were used for the SIR profiles. 3. The EEA data were more dynamic than the SIR. Five enzymes, leucine aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminopeptidase, arginine aminopeptidase and P-glucosidase, showed consistently high activity; ten others were ubiquitous at lower activity levels; the remainder were detected intermittently. The SIR data showed less temporal variability. With one exception (citrate), the 20 substrates that generated the largest responses were all saccharides or their derivatives. 4. The EEA and SIR data did not generally correlate. Both methods were effective for ordinating bacterioplankton although, unlike the SIR, the EEA ordination followed a clear temporal trajectory. 5. Because the SIR profiles are based on a culture response, whilst the EEA profiles measure activity of the extant community, the latter appear to be more directly linked to the mechanics of DOM processing.",

        "abstract": "Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are released by cells throughout the nephron and contain biomolecules from their cells of origin. Although uEV-associated proteins and RNA have been studied in detail, little information exists regarding uEV glycosylation characteristics. Surface glycosylation profiling by flow cytometry and lectin microarray was applied to uEVs enriched from urine of healthy adults by ultracentrifugation and centrifugal filtration. The carbohydrate specificity of lectin microarray profiles was confirmed by competitive sugar inhibition and carbohydrate-specific enzyme hydrolysis. Glycosylation profiles of uEVs and purified Tamm Horsfall protein were compared. In both flow cytometry and lectin microarray assays, uEVs demonstrated surface binding, at low to moderate intensities, of a broad range of lectins whether prepared by ultracentrifugation or centrifugal filtration. In general, ultracentrifugation-prepared uEVs demonstrated higher lectin binding intensities than centrifugal filtration-prepared uEVs consistent with lesser amounts of co-purified non-vesicular proteins. The surface glycosylation profiles of uEVs showed little inter-individual variation and were distinct from those of Tamm Horsfall protein, which bound a limited number of lectins. In a pilot study, lectin microarray was used to compare uEVs from individuals with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease to those of age-matched controls. The lectin microarray profiles of polycystic kidney disease and healthy uEVs showed differences in binding intensity of 6/43 lectins. Our results reveal a complex surface glycosylation profile of uEVs that is accessible to lectin-based analysis following multiple uEV enrichment techniques, is distinct from co-purified Tamm Horsfall protein and may demonstrate disease-specific modifications.",

Using 1280 individuals with ASD ascertained through the Simons Simplex Collection, our purposes were to investigate the existence of domain discrepancy profiles based on verbal and nonverbal intelligence scores, and to explore the relationships between cognitive profiles and other measurable outcomes. Methods Used: Based on stringent requirements for identifying significant differences in verbal and nonverbal IQ scores, a chi-squared test identified subjects as having either a nonverbal > verbal intelligence split, no split (verbal = nonverbal intelligence), or a nonverbal < verbal intelligence split. Chi-squared analysis was used to look at gender breakdown within profile groups. Relationships between these profiles and other aspects of autism symptomatology, including socialization skills, fine motor skills, adaptive behaviors, head circumference, and autism severity were analyzed using multivariate analyses of variance. Age was included as a covariate. Summary of Results: A significantly greater number of individuals with a cognitive split was found in the ASD group than would be expected. While no relationships between cognitive profile and adaptive behavior or fine motor skills were identified, results indicate that individuals with a nonverbal > verbal profile showed greater overall autism symptom severity according to clinician observation and individuals with a nonverbal < verbal discrepancy profile showed greater social impairment according to parent report. Conclusions: These findings indicate that there is an increased rate of nonverbal and verbal intelligence discrepancies in ASD and suggest that cognitive profiles within the autism spectrum may provide a useful method of identifying ASD subtypes. Further investigation of these cognitive profile subtypes may elucidate differential genetic mechanisms and provide guidelines for determining the maximally effective interventions tailored to ability profiles to further improve outcomes.",

We analyzed 357 T-ALL cases for FLT3 mutations and transcript expression. FLT3 mutations (3% overall) and overexpression (FLT3 high expresser (FLT3(High))) were restricted to immature/TCR\u03b3\u03b4 T-ALLs. In vitro FLT3 inhibition induced apoptosis in only 30% of FLT3(High) T-ALLs and did not correlate with mutational status. In order to investigate the mechanisms of primary resistance to FLT3 inhibition, a broad quantitative screen for receptor kinome transcript deregulation was performed by Taqman Low Density Array. FLT3 deregulation was associated with overexpression of a network of receptor kinases (RKs), potentially responsible for redundancies and sporadic response to specific FLT3 inhibition. In keeping with this resistance to FLT3 inhibition could be reversed by dual inhibition of FLT3 and KIT with a synergistic effect. We conclude that immature T-ALL may benefit from multitargeted RK inhibition and that exploration of the receptor kinome defines a rational strategy for testing multitarget kinase inhibition in malignant diseases.",

        "abstract": "Background: Until the dementias are cured, treatments are likely to have effects which may be difficult to discern. Early disease expression in dementia consists chiefly of symptoms so that there is renewed interest in the understanding typical constellation of dementia symptoms, especially at the earliest stage. Here, we describe typical symptom frequencies and profiles in relation to the stage of dementia. Methods: Visitors to www. dementiaguide.com who were care partners for people with dementia were invited to build individualized dementia symptom profiles of the people for whom they cared. Profiles were developed from 70 symptoms using the online profiling tool, SymptomGuide . With this, care partners target symptoms for monitoring disease progression and treatment efficacy. A staging algorithm based on the Dependence Scale (DS) was developed and validated in a separate study. Results: Of 1427 site visitors who started a symptom profile, complete informant-reported clinical and demographic data were available on 762 (mean age was 74.9 years (SD 13.1); 64% women). Almost all profilees (725; 95%) lived in the community and 135 (18%) lived alone. Alzheimer's disease was the most common diagnosis (36%); 25 people had CIND or MCI profiles. Most people tracked between 7-14 symptoms. The most common symptoms were impaired recent memory, irritability, verbal repetition and misplacing objects, each reported in 25-30% profilees. They were related to stage; e.g., verbal repetition was targeted in 25% of people with a DS score of 0-3, 50%with a DS score of 4-7 and 59% with a DS score of 8-11. These symptoms were most common to a DS score of 11, after which personal care symptoms dominated. Only with DS scores> 8 were each of the most common dementia symptoms targeted in a majority of patients. Conclusions: Common dementia symptoms were targeted by care partners of people with dementia. Except in severe dementia, the most common symptoms each occurred in only a minority of profilees. This combination of recognizable profiles of symptoms that each occur in less than half of patients suggests the need for individualizing patient profiles for efficient clinical evaluation of drugs which delay dementia onset.",

Study design: A telephone- and web-based survey of a sample of the health profiles' target audience was conducted, along with an analysis of web statistics. Methods: In total, 285 telephone interviews were undertaken. Fifty-three percent of the respondents were National Health Service employees. An evaluation form was also available through the Health Profiles website, which elicited 117 responses (19 scrutiny officers and 83 members of the public). Results: There was a positive response to the content and format of Health Profiles 2006. The majority of respondents felt that the profiles provided a unique summary of local-authority-based health and health inequality information that was both accessible and understandable. Conclusions: A number of recommendations are made to improve health profile production as a tool for information for health improvement. These include simplifying graphics, greater local input into commentary, and a more interactive website so that the data can be accessed and explored. However, the recommendations for change must be viewed alongside the number of comments specifically relating to the English health profiles that nothing should be changed other than updating the data and filling in the gaps. \u00a9 2009 The Royal Society for Public Health.",

Latent class analysis (LCA) of nonaggressive and aggressive behaviors, as reported by mothers, indicated four distinct paternal disciplinary profiles: low discipline, low aggression, moderate physical aggression, and high physical and psychological aggression. Serious forms of psychological aggression directed toward the child were uncommon but may identify those fathers most in need of intervention. Use of nonaggressive discipline was high and nearly equivalent among the parenting profiles. However, child aggressive behavior increased as the child's exposure to paternal aggression increased, even when aggressive discipline was combined with high levels of nonaggressive discipline. Fathers who exhibited more aggression toward their child had higher levels of alcohol use, used more psychological aggression toward the child's mother, and were more likely to spank their child.",

It is also a helpful start before taking on further analysis. We propose an algorithm for DDP by iteratively picking out pairs of gene expression patterns which have the largest dissimilarities. This method can also be used as preprocessing to initialize centers for clustering methods, like K-means.

It is necessary to understand the excitation, the road profile, in order to set the target chassis loads. Defining a large set of roads is impractical, so roads with similar characteristics must be grouped. Rough roads used for chassis development are not easily characterised however. In this work, roads are characterised via a Markov chain. Any realisation generated from this process represents all profiles in the set. Realisations of any length can be generated, allowing efficient simulation. Some definitions and elementary properties of road profiles and Markov chains are reviewed before introducing a transition matrix as a tool to characterise a measured road profile. A statistical test is introduced to assess whether a given road profile could be a realisation of a given transition matrix.

Treatment recommendations for batterer types have relied primarily on aggregated statistical analyses of the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI), but may be misleading because the MCMI is designed to be interpreted using individual profiles. The authors employed a profile analysis with MCMI-III results of 100 batterers randomly drawn from 840 men enrolled in four batterer programs. Case examples are used to illustrate the personality profiles and their treatment implications. The profile analysis suggests six major personality groupings that in part reflect previously established types. However, the majority of batterers exhibit narcissistic or avoidant traits that are well suited for the prevailing cognitive-behavioral group treatment approach.

        "abstract": "Recently, many researchers and practitioners have shown interest on profile monitoring as a relatively new subarea of statistical process control. One main reason for this interest, and perhaps a key factor for the contributions of many researchers to this field, is the various applications of profile monitoring in real life. Although one can easily encounter many univariate applications of profile monitoring in service and manufacturing environments, there exist situations where quality of a product or process needs to be modeled in multivariate terms. In this paper, we investigate monitoring of multivariate simple linear profiles in phase II when independence assumption of observations within profile is violated. A remedial measure based on a transformation method is proposed to remove the autocorrelation structure within multivariate profiles, and numerical simulation is used as a vehicle to evaluate the effect of the proposed solution. Finally, a case study is considered to show the application of the model in practice. \u00a9 2012 Springer-Verlag London.",

Latent profile analysis (LPA) was employed to analyze subordinate response profiles of 1,146 platoon leaders who rated their company commanders in the Taiwanese military. Results indicated the prevalence of three leadership profiles: most common was a moral-authoritarian leadership profile (60.1%), followed by a moral-benevolent leadership profile (29.1%). Least prevalent was an authoritarian leadership profile (10.8%) low on both morality and benevolence. The probability of subordinate responses fitting in the moral-benevolent leadership profile was associated with greater supervisor identification, more occupational commitment, better task performance, and lower intention to leave; probability of subordinate responses fitting the authoritarian profile was associated with greater intention to leave. There was considerable variability in leadership profile perceptions for the same company commander rated by different subordinates.",

Existing knowledge sources, such as Entrez Gene and the MEDLINE database, contain information concerning the characteristics of a particular gene that could be used to disambiguate gene symbols. RESULTS: For each gene, we create a profile with different types of information automatically extracted from related MEDLINE abstracts and readily available annotated knowledge sources. We apply the gene profiles to the disambiguation task via an information retrieval method, which ranks the similarity scores between the context where the ambiguous gene is mentioned, and candidate gene profiles. The gene profile with the highest similarity score is then chosen as the correct sense. We evaluated the method on three automatically generated testing sets of mouse, fly and yeast organisms, respectively. The method achieved the highest precision of 93.9% for the mouse, 77.8% for the fly and 89.5% for the yeast.

The estimation of such range profiles is equivalent to estimation of a vector of regression coefficients in an underdetermined linear system. Each coefficient corresponds to a certain range bin in the illuminated area. If a range bin contains a target the reflections from that bin will, in some applications, result in a value of the corresponding coefficient which is significantly larger than the value corresponding to a target-free range bin. Under the assumption of a mixture of semi-sparse linear Gaussian models, we derive the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate of the range profile. We then find computationally efficient approximations of this MMSE estimate. As a by-product we also obtain a maximum a posteriori (MAP) target detector that does not require the choice of any detection threshold.

To quantify the expression of a particular gene, the normalisation with respect to the expression of a reference gene is carried out.

Xenopus laevis studies have frequently used eEF-1 alpha, GAPDH, ODC, L8, and H4 as reference genes. The aim of this work was to examine, by real-time RT-PCR, the expression profiles of the above-mentioned five reference genes during early development of X. laevis. It is shown that their expression profiles vary greatly during X. laevis development. The developmental changes of mRNA expression can thus significantly compromise the relative mRNA quantification based on these reference genes, when different developmental stages are to be compared. The normalisation against total RNA is recommended instead.",

However, the observed and simulated voids display remarkably different profile shapes, with the former having much steeper profiles than the latter. Sparsity can not be the main reason for this discrepancy, as we demonstrate that the profile can be recovered with reasonable accuracy even with very sparse samples of tracers. On the other hand, the observed profile shows a significant dependence on the galaxy sample used to trace the matter distribution. Samples including low-mass galaxies lead to shallower profiles with respect to the samples where only massive galaxies are used, as faint galaxies live closer to the void centre. We argue that galaxies are biased tracers when used to probe the matter distribution within voids.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objective Altered lipid levels may occur in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, serum lipid profiles in patients with dermatomyositis (DM) have not been investigated. Our aim was to identify lipid profiles in untreated DM patients, and to assess the relationship of the inflammatory condition of DM with lipid profiles. Methods This work was designed and conducted as a case-control study. Forty-one DM patients and 41 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included. None of the patients had received corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs prior to the study. Triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were assessed using standard techniques. Results Twenty-nine patients (70.7%) had an increase level of TG, and 41.5% had a decrease level of HDL-C. The levels of HDL-C in DM were significantly lower than in controls (P < 0.01). The levels of TG, Non- HDL-cholesterol and very LDL-cholesterol (VLDL-C) were significantly higher than in controls (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 respectively). The ratios of VLDL-C/LDL-C, TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C were significantly higher than in controls (P < 0.001). Spearman's correlation test demonstrated that serum CRP levels correlated negatively with HDL-C in DM(r = -0.420, P = 0.006). Conclusion Dyslipoproteinemia is a common feature in patients with DM that is characterized by an increase in TG and a decrease in HDL-C, suggesting a high risk of atherosclerosis. Inflammation might partly account for the changes of serum lipid profiles in DM.",

Longitudinal series can be used to improve the precision of estimates - a feature that is particularly important for providers who treat a small number of patients per year. We extend and apply hierarchical models to examine and classify provider performance over time using two examples, one in the area of cardiology and the other in mental health. Performance is evaluated using the squared Mahalanobis distance and posterior probabilities based on this distance. By comparing providers based on level and temporal trend simultaneously, conservative but comprehensive assessments of performance are possible.

The series of entropy values is plotted as a function of resolution, resulting in a multiresolution profile of fragmentation pattern in the landscape. If a categorical raster map is available at a single resolution only, a series of degraded maps at increasingly coarser resolutions is generated and the fragmentation profile is computed for this series. An algorithm has been developed for obtaining the profile directly from the single resolution map without having to generate and store the coarser resolution maps.

Two distinct personality profiles were found: two-thirds of participants showed a personality profile that was quite similar to the general population, with the exception of a higher self-reported emotional stability and self-deceptive enhancement, while the remaining third showed higher levels of any personality domain than both the other cluster and the general population. These officers also endorsed lower scores in measures of depression, anxiety, professional exhaustion, loss of empathy, and higher scores in a measure of organizational resilience, suggesting that they may represent the most suitable personnel for the delicate tasks their unit usually has to accomplish.

However, in most cases, it is not the imbalance of a single divalent metal ion but a plethora of metal ions reported to be altered. Given that different divalent metal ions are often able to bind to a protein in a competitive manner, although with different affinities, and that they might use similar transporters for uptake and regulation, it is likely that the imbalance of one metal ion will downstream affect the homeostasis of other metal ions. Thus, based on this assumption, we hypothesize that the dysregulation of a specific metal ion will lead to a characteristic biometal profile. Similar profiles might therefore be detected in various neurological disorders. Moreover, if such shared biometal profiles exist across different neurological disorders, it is possible that shared behavioural impairments in these disorders result from the imbalance in metal ion homeostasis. Thus, here, we evaluate the reported excess or deficiency of metal ions in various neurological disorders and aim to integrate reported alterations in metal ions to generate a characteristic biometal profile for the disorder. Based on this, we try to predict which alterations in biometals will be caused by the overload or deficiency of one particular metal ion. Moreover, investigating the behavioural phenotypes of rodent models suffering from alterations in biometals, we assess whether a shared behavioural phenotype exists for disorders with similar biometal profiles. Our results show that observed behavioural aspects of some neurological disorders are reflected in their specific biometal profile and mirrored by mouse models suffering from similar biometal deregulations.",

However, their global structures are poorly known because of limited information from in situ observations. Some modern global reanalyses provide the tem- perature tendency from the physical processes. Their proper applications require an assessment of their ac- curacy and uncertainties. In this study, diabatic heating profiles from three recent global reanalyses[ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), and Modern Era Ret- rospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA)]are compared to those derived from currently available sounding observations in the tropics and to each other in the absence of the observations. Diabatic heating profiles produced by the reanalyses match well with those based on sounding observations only at some locations. The three reanalyses agree with each other better in the extratropics, where large-scale condensation dominates the precipitation process in data assimilation models, than in the tropics, where cumulus parameterization dominates. In the tropics, they only agree with each other in gross features, such as the contrast between the ITCZs over different oceans. Their largest disagreement is the number and level of heating peaks in the tropics. They may produce a single, double, or triple heating peak at a given location. It is argued that cumulus parameterization cannot be the sole source of the disagreement. Implications of such disagreement are discussed.",

Theoretical considerations suggest that the density of a dipole-confined plasma will vary with radius as 1/r(4). Measurements have been made for LDX plasmas, where the dipole-field was produced by a coil that was not levitating but rather suspended from a central column by thin supports. A ray-tracing code has been written to fit the chord data, which are line-integrated densities, to azimuthally-symmetric electron density profiles n (e) (r, t). Initial analysis has focused on the model n(e)(r,t) = A(t)(r-r(0))(-alpha(t)), where A(t) and alpha(t) are free parameters; alpha(t) is referred to as the \"steepness exponent.\" The density profiles are observed to exhibit dynamics due to ECR heating and neutral-gas fueling. The model-fit, meant only to serve as a rough approximation, suggests that LDX plasmas have steepness exponents in the range of 1.5-4. The density at the location of the 2.45 GHz ECRH resonance is reconstructed and found to be of the same order of magnitude as the heating cut-off n(e) similar to n(c) = 7.4 x 10(10) cm(-3).",

Latent profile analysis was used to identify profiles of loneliness within the caregiving unit. Subsequently, latent profile membership was used as a between-subject variable to examine correlates of the latent profiles.\\n\\nRESULTS: A 2-profile solution was deemed most plausible. This classification consisted of a large (174 caregiving units; 78%) more favorable profile in terms of loneliness and a smaller (49 caregiving units; 22%) lonelier profile. Profile classification was associated with a variety of quality of life, well-being, social relations, and sociodemographic indicators of the 3 members of the caregiving unit.\\n\\nIMPLICATIONS: The study provides a needed recognition of the potential interdependence among members of the caregiving unit and calls for research and practice that go beyond the individual level. The assessment of loneliness at the caregiving unit can provide valuable information about at-risk units as well as about the potential effectiveness of interventions that target the entire caregiving unit.",

One way to measure physiologic variability is to analyze growth on different carbon sources. The carbon source utilization profiles of 18 F. virguliforme isolates were examined using the Biolog FF 96-well microplate, which contains 95 different carbon sources. The utilization of dextrin,D-mannitol, maltotriose,D-lactic acid methyl ester, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, salicin, D-trehalose, and L-alanine differed significantly among isolates (P = 0.05). Carbon sources were grouped into 3 clusters based on their ability to promote growth of F. virguliforme, after calculating Euclidean distances among them. About 12% of the carbon sources promoted a high amount of mycelial growth, 39% promoted a medium amount of growth, and 49% promoted a low amount of mycelial growth; the latter was not significantly different from the water blank control. A hierarchical tree diagram was produced for the 18 isolates based on their carbon source utilization profiles using Ward's hierarchical analysis method. Two main clusters of isolates were formed. One cluster represented greater average mycelial growth on all of the carbon sources than the other cluster. In this study, variability in carbon source utilization among F. virguliforme isolates was evident, but the results were not associated with geographic origin of the isolates, year collected, or published data on aggressiveness. Additional research is needed to determine if these carbon utilization profiles are associated with other biological characteristics, like spore germination, propagule formation, and saprophytic competitiveness.",

Using measured electricity use data from 103 homes in Austin, TX, this analysis sought to (1) determine the shape of seasonally-resolved residential demand profiles, (2) determine the optimal number of normalized representative residential electricity use profiles within each season, and (3) draw correlations to the different profiles based on survey data from the occupants of the 103 homes. Within each season, homes with similar hourly electricity use patterns were clustered into groups using the k-means clustering algorithm. Then probit regression was performed to determine if homeowner survey responses could serve as predictors for the clustering results. This analysis found that Austin homes fall into one of two seasonal groups with some homes using more expensive electricity (from a wholesale electricity market perspective) than others. Regression results indicate that variables such as if someone works from home, hours of television watched per week, and education levels have significant correlations with average profile shape, but might vary across seasons. The results herein also indicate that policies such as time-of-use or real-time electricity structures might be more likely to affect lower income households during some high electricity use parts of the year.",

Public and private efforts in the new field of toxicogenomics are focused on populating databases with gene expression profiles of compounds where toxicological and pathological endpoints are well characterized. The validity and utility of a toxicogenomics is dependent on whether gene expression profiles that correspond to different chemicals can be distinguished. The principal hypothesis underlying a toxicogenomic or pharmacogenomic strategy is that chemical-specific patterns of altered gene expression will be revealed using high-density microarray analysis of tissues from exposed organisms. Analyses of these patterns should allow classification of toxicants and provide important mechanistic insights. This report provides a verification of this hypothesis. Patterns of gene expression corresponding to liver tissue derived from chemically exposed rats revealed similarity in gene expression profiles between animals treated with different agents from a common class of compounds, peroxisome proliferators [clofibrate (ethyl-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate), Wyeth 14,643 ([4-chloro-6(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio]acetic acid), and gemfibrozil (5-2[2,5-dimethylphenoxy]2-2-dimethylpentanoic acid)], but a very distinct gene expression profile was produced using a compound from another class, enzyme inducers (phenobarbital).",

Methods: The participants (N = 1339, response rate 75%) completed standardised questionnaires covering demographic items, physical health, work performance, stress symptoms, pain and musculoskeletal symptoms, and overall biopsychosocial health. Results: Physical symptoms (present often or continually) were reported by 15%, psychosomatic by 19% and psychosocial by 14%. The intercorrelations between 73 biopsychosocial variables revealed nine factors explaining 54.5% of variance for intrapersonal profiles and four factors explaining 59.2% of variance for interpersonal profiles. The Cronbach alphas for reliability ranged from .76 to .83. Three distinct biopsychosocial cluster profiles were found: Cluster 1 (n = 290, 27%) loaded positively with the somatic and psychosocial variables, Cluster 2 (n = 558, 51%) loaded negatively with the various biopsychosocial symptoms, and Cluster 3 (n = 235, 22%) loaded positively with anxiety. Conclusion: Discriminant function analysis confirmed that this cluster solution correctly classified 95.2% of the subjects in a nonpatient multiprofessional population, which supports the biopsychosocial approach also in work life issues. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

They are of concern because they have the potential to transform into malignant melanomas.\\n\\nAIMS: To describe gene expression profiles of GHN and nearby normal skin from patients with GHN and normal control skin (from patients with cleft lip/palate).\\n\\nMETHODS: Tissues from three patients with GHN and two normal controls were studied for differences in gene expression profiles. Total RNA was isolated from normal skin near the hairy naevus, GHN, and skin from normal controls. The RNA samples were subjected to probe labelling, hybridisation to chips, and image acquisition according to the standard Affymetrix protocol.\\n\\nRESULTS: There were 227 genes affected across all samples, as determined by DNA microarray analysis. There was increased expression of 22 genes in GHN compared with nearby normal skin. Decreased expression was noted in 73 genes. In addition, there was increased expression of 36 genes in normal skin near GHN compared with normal control skin, and decreased expression of five genes. Categories of genes affected were those encoding structural proteins, proteins related to developmental processes, cell death associated proteins, transcription factors, growth factors, stress response modulators, and collagen associated proteins. Changes in mRNA expression were checked by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Genetic profiles of GHN may provide insight into their pathogenesis, including their potential for malignant transformation. Such information may be useful in improving the understanding and management of these lesions.",

It is not known, however, how these members\u2019 contributions affect their teams\u2019 knowledge diffusion process, or whether their personality profiles are responsible for their dominant presence. Objective: We set out to address this gap through the study of repository artifacts. Method: Artifacts from ten teams were mined from the IBM Rational Jazz repository. We employed social network analysis (SNA) to group practitioners into two clusters, Top Members and Others, based on the numbers of messages they communicated and their engagement in task changes. SNA metrics (density, in-degree and closeness) were then used to study practitioners\u2019 importance in knowledge diffusion. Thereafter, we performed psycholinguistic analysis on practitioners\u2019 messages using linguistic dimen- sions that had been previously correlated with the Big Five personality profiles. Results: For our sample of 146 practitioners we found that Top Members occupied critical roles in knowl- edge diffusion, and demonstrated more openness to experience than the Others. Additionally, all personality profiles were represented during teamwork, although openness to experience, agreeableness and extroversion were particularly evident. However, no specific personality predicted members\u2019 involvement in knowledge diffusion. Conclusion: Task assignment that promotes highly connected team communication networks may mitigate tacit knowledge loss in global software teams. Additionally, while members expressing openness to experience are likely to be particularly driven to perform, this is not entirely responsible for a global team\u2019s success.",

As such, a primary objective of the present study is to describe and account for variability in temporal profiles of experienced emotional intensity. Participants were asked to make detailed drawings of intensity profiles of recently experienced episodes of anger, sadness, joy and affection. Functional data analysis revealed three features that together accounted for 84% of the total variability: (i) steepness at onset; (ii) skewness; and (iii) the number of peaks. Emotions differed with regard to the first two features, with the rise at onset being steeper for sadness and joy and affection being the most negatively skewed emotion under study. Individual differences regarding each of the three features were found, however, they did not strongly generalise across emotions.",

RESULTS: The genes involved in inflammation, Toll-like receptor signaling, coagulation, fibrinolysis, cell adhesion, tissue repair and homeostasis were measured in lung tissue, leukocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and tracheal epithelial cells in mice, before and after intranasal infection with influenza A. Most of the genes investigated were differentially expressed during the course of infection and returned to baseline levels when mice had recovered from the infection. However, expression of several genes remained altered even though mice had completely cleared the virus.

Cases and controls were matched for age, body mass index and fasting glucose. Five branched-chain and aromatic amino acids had highly significant associations with future diabetes: isoleucine, leucine, valine, tyrosine and phenylalanine. A combination of three amino acids predicted future diabetes (with a more than fivefold higher risk for individuals in top quartile).

        "abstract": "This study explored the emotional and behavioral profiles of 41 neglected children, ages 6 to 12 years, who were compared with a control group of 41 children. The Achenbach System was used in order to describe emotional and behavioral profiles based on the Diagnostic Criteria of the DSM-IV [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.]). Neglected children had more symptoms on DSM-IV Scales related to conduct or attention/hyperactivity problems. Based on the perceptions of teachers, children exposed to neglect showed more externalized and internalized problems as well as symptoms on DSM-IV Scales. Results supported the relevance of using the Diagnostic Criteria of the DSM-IV and the importance of getting the different perceptions of respondents to better understand the emotional and behavioral portrait of neglected children.",

However, little is known about how anger experiences differ among individuals with SAD and whether any heterogeneity might relate to negative outcomes. This investigation sought to empirically define anger profiles among 136 treatment-seeking individuals with SAD and to assess their association with distress and impairment. A latent class analysis was conducted utilizing the trait subscales of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 as indicators of class membership. Analysis revealed four distinct anger profiles, with greatest distress and impairment generally demonstrated by individuals with elevated trait anger, a greater tendency to suppress the expression of anger, and diminished ability to adaptively control their anger expression. These results have implications for tailoring more effective interventions for socially anxious individuals.",

        "abstract": "Theoretical considerations suggest that exponential or quadratic functions are apt for describing the longitudinal profiles of aggrading, alluvial systems that are unaffected by significant lateral inputs of water or sediment. A new set of field data confirms this for individual sedimentary links along a wandering gravel-bed river in British Columbia, Canada. Each link is viewed as a simple alluvial system, without major water or sediment inputs, within which grain size typically fines downstream in a relatively systematic manner. Such homogeneous reaches are suitable for the investigation of simple profile form. It is found that quadratic approximations are the most flexible descriptor for link longitudinal profiles. Overall, the river forms an irregularly cuspate long profile structured by these fundamental length-scale units. Both link gradients and link fining rate reflect size-selective aggradation associated with the bounding lateral inputs.",

This algorithm is verified with three theoretical test cases: finite depth Ekman layer, plane laminar jet flow, and rotating disk flow. The computed results indicate good accuracy. Finally, the ability of nonlinear calculations in realistic problems is revealed by applying the present algorithm to the tidal estuary of the Zhousui River in Taiwan.

Here we describe PRIAM, a method for automated enzyme detection in a fully sequenced genome, based on the classification of enzymes in the ENZYME database. PRIAM relies on sets of position-specific scoring matrices ('profiles') automatically tailored for each ENZYME entry. Automatically generated logical rules define which of these profiles is required in order to infer the presence of the corresponding enzyme in an organism. As an example, PRIAM was applied to identify potential metabolic pathways from the complete genome of the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. The results of this automated method were compared with the original genome annotation and visualised on KEGG graphs in order to facilitate the interpretation of metabolic pathways and to highlight potentially missing enzymes.",

In order to evaluate the impact and robustness of the methods introduced, two experiments are reported, which were performed on a massive dataset containing GPS traces of private cars: (i) the impact of the car pooling application based on profile matching is measured, in terms of percentage shareable traffic; (ii) the approach is adapted to coarser-grained mobility data sources that are nowadays commonly available from telecom operators. In addition the ensuing loss in precision and coverage of profile matches is measured.",

It has been demonstrated that the vertical root profiles which maximize transpiration in numerical experiments reflect well the characteristics of root profiles observed in nature for water-limited ecosystems. Previous research has demonstrated how the optimal vertical root profile depends on both the mean annual precipitation (MAP) and the soil texture. Recently, in the climate literature, it has been suggested Chou et al. (2012) [5] that increased greenhouse forcing in the tropics can lead to a simultaneous decrease in the frequency and increase in the intensity of precipitation. In this paper we demonstrate how such a change in the statistical structure of rainfall, even with no change to MAP, requires deeper root distributions to maintain optimal water use. These results raise interesting questions for future studies of nutrient dynamics, the cost of additional below ground carbon allocation, and inter plant functional type competition. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

Some of the most effective BE schemes in the literature are the tree-based schemes of complete subtree (CS) and subset difference (SD). The key distribution trees in these schemes are traditionally constructed without considering user preferences. In fact these schemes can be made significantly more efficient when user profiles are taken into account. In this paper, we consider this problem and study how to construct the CS and SD trees more efficiently according to user profiles. We first analyze the relationship between the transmission cost and the user profile distribution and prove a number of key results in this aspect. Then we propose several optimization algorithms which can reduce the bandwidth requirement of the CS and SD schemes significantly. This reduction becomes even more significant when a number of free riders can be allowed in the system. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

As a first concrete application we consider the identification of piecewise constant doping profiles in p-n diodes. Finally, we discuss the stable solution of the inverse doping problem by regularization methods and their numerical implementation.

Methods: The four novel metrics (rho, rho [subscript] m, delta [subscript] a, and delta [subscript] s), along with f [subscript] 2, were applied to dissolution data from FAST and SLOW metoprolol tartrate tablets. For example, rho [subscript] m is defined as: rho [subscript] m = Sigma [subscript] t=1 [superscript] n (R [subscript] t + T [subscript] t) [RATIO [subscript] t-1]/Sigma [subscript] t=1 [superscript] n (R [subscript] t + T [subscript] t) where R, is the percent dissolved of the reference product at time t, T [subscript] t the percent dissolved of the test product at time t, and RATIO [subscript] t the larger of either R [subscript] t/T [subscript] t, or T [subscript] t/R [subscript] t, The mean metric values, upper (or lower) confidence limits, and skewness values were calculated, in order to characterize the performance of each metric. Results: The mean values of rho, rho [subscript] m, delta [subscript] a, delta [subscript] s, and f [subscript] 2 were 1.80, 0.80, 0.47, 0.36, and 19.6, respectively. The novel metrics indicate that greater than a 50% relative difference exists between the FAST and SLOW profiles. The upper 95% confidence limits for rho, rho [subscript] m, delta [subscript] a, and delta [subscript] s were 1.84, 0.83, 0.48, and 0.38, respectively, with f [subscript] 2 having a lower limit of 19.1.

The efficacy of a recommender system is strictly connected with the possibility of creating meaningful user profiles, including information about user preferences, interests, goals, usage data and interactive behavior. In particular, analysis of user preferences is important to predict user behaviors and make appropriate recommendations. In this paper, we present a fuzzy framework to represent, learn and update user profiles. The representation of a user profile is based on a structured model of user cognitive states, including a competence profile, a preference profile and an acquaintance profile. The strategy for deriving and updating profiles is to record the sequence of accessed resources by each user, and to update preference profiles accordingly, so as to suggest similar resources at next user accesses. The adaption of the preference profile is performed continuously, but in earlier stages it is more sensitive to updates (plastic phase) while in later stages it is less sensitive (stable phase) to allow resource recommendation. Simulation results are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

These encapsulate ways and extent of coping during the week after cancer surgery. Accommodative Coping was characterized by low levels of active problem-directed strategies but a high degree of acceptance and humour, whereas Assimilative Coping represented positive reframing and active strategies. Based on 122 couples, associations between patients' coping profiles and subsequent spousal support provision were examined.

This study assessed the variability in long-term outcome predictions among physicians and aimed to identify factors that may account for this variability.\\n\\nMETHODS: Based on a clinical vignette describing a comatose patient suffering from post-anoxic brain injury intensivists were asked in a semi-structured interview about the patient's specific neurological prognosis and about prognostication in general. Qualitative research methods were used to identify areas of variability in prognostication and to classify physicians according to specific prognostication profiles. Quantitative statistics were used to assess for associations between prognostication profiles and physicians' demographic and practice characteristics.\\n\\nRESULTS: Eighteen intensivists participated. Functional outcome predictions varied along an evaluative dimension (fair/good-poor) and a confidence dimension (certain-uncertain). More experienced physicians tended to be more pessimistic about the patient's functional outcome and more certain of their prognosis. Attitudes toward quality of life varied along an evaluative dimension (good-poor) and a \"style\" dimension (objective-subjective). Older and more experienced physicians were more likely to express objective judgments of quality of life and to predict a worse quality of life for the patient than their younger and less experienced counterparts.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Various prognostication profiles exist among intensivists. These may be dictated by factors such as physicians' age and clinical experience. Awareness of these associations may be a first step to more uniform prognostication.",

The current existence of on-line evaluations in such repositories has opened the possibility of searching for statistical profiles of highly-rated resources that can be used as priori indicators of quality. In this paper, we analyzed 35 metrics in learning objects refereed inside the MERLOT repository and elaborated profiles for these resources regarding the different categories of disciplines and material types available. We found that some of the intrinsic metrics presented significant differences between highly rated and poorly-rated resources and that those differences are dependent on the category of discipline to which the resource belongs and on the type of the resource. Moreover, we found that different profiles should be identified according to the type of rating (peer-review or user) under evaluation. At last, we developed an initial model using linear discriminant analysis to evaluate the strength of relevant metrics when performing an automated quality classification task. The initial results of this work are promising and will be used as the foundations for the further development of an automated tool for contextualized quality assessment of learning objects inside repositories. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "A quantitative evaluation of the influence of sampling on the numerical fractal analysis of experimental profiles is of critical importance. Although this aspect has been widely recognized, a systematic analysis of the sampling influence is still lacking. Here we present the results of a systematic analysis of synthetic self-affine profiles in order to clarify the consequences of the application of a poor sampling (up to 1000 points) typical of scanning probe microscopy for the characterization of real interfaces and surfaces. We interpret our results in terms of a deviation and a dispersion of the measured exponent with respect to the \"true\" one. Both the deviation and the dispersion have always been disregarded in the experimental literature, and this can be very misleading if results obtained from poorly sampled images are presented. We provide reasonable arguments to assess the universality of these effects and propose an empirical method to take them into account. We show that it is possible to correct the deviation of the measured Hurst exponent from the \"true\" one and give a reasonable estimate of the dispersion error. The last estimate is particularly important in the experimental results since it is an intrinsic error that depends only on the number of sampling points and can easily overwhelm the statistical error. Finally, we test our empirical method calculating the Hurst exponent for the well-known 1+1 dimensional directed percolation profiles, with a 512-point sampling.",

A practical and accurate technique for solving this problem from profiles alone is developed. It is precise enough to reconstruct the shape of the object. No correspondences between points or lines are necessary. Symmetry of the surface of revolution swept out by the rotating object is exploited to obtain the image of the rotation axis and the homography relating epipolar lines in two views robustly and elegantly. These, together with geometric constraints for images of rotating objects, are used to obtain first the image of the horizon, which is the projection of the plane that contains the camera centers, and then the epipoles, thus fully determining the epipolar geometry of the image sequence. The estimation of this geometry by this sequential approach avoids many of the problems found in other algorithms. The search for the epipoles, by far the most critical step, is carried out as a simple 1D optimization. Parameter initialization is trivial and completely automatic at all stages. After the estimation of the epipolar geometry, the Euclidean motion is recovered using the fixed intrinsic parameters of the camera obtained either from a calibration grid or from self-calibration techniques. Finally, the spinning object is reconstructed from its profiles using the motion estimated in the previous stage. Results from real data are presented, demonstrating the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed methods",

We also use the algorithm to characterize the response of human T cells to stimulations of antigen-receptor signaling gene expression temporal profiles measured in six different biological conditions and we identify common and unique genes. These studies suggest that the methodology proposed here is useful in identifying and distinguishing uniquely stimulated genes from commonly stimulated genes in response to variable stimuli.

        "abstract": "We have derived detailed R-band luminosity profiles and structural parameters for a total of 430 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), down to a limiting surface brightness of 24.5 mag arcsec-2. Light profiles were initially fitted with a S\u00e9rsic's R 1/n model, but we found that 205 (~48%) BCGs require a double component model to accurately match their light profiles. The best fit for these 205 galaxies is an inner S\u00e9rsic model, with indices n ~ 1-7, plus an outer exponential component. Thus, we establish the existence of two categories of the BCG luminosity profiles: single and double component profiles. We found that double profile BCGs are brighter (~0.2 mag) than single profile BCGs. In fact, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test applied to these subsamples indicates that they have different total magnitude distributions, with mean values MR = -23.8 \u00b1 0.6 mag for single profile BCGs and MR = -24.0 \u00b1 0.5 mag for double profile BCGs. We find that partial luminosities for both subsamples are indistinguishable up to r = 15 kpc, while for r > 20 kpc the luminosities we obtain are on average 0.2 mag brighter for double profile BCGs. This result indicates that extra-light for double profile BCGs does not come from the inner region but from the outer regions of these galaxies. The best-fit slope of the Kormendy relation for the whole sample is a = 3.13 \u00b1 0.04. However, when fitted separately, single and double profile BCGs show different slopes: a single = 3.29 \u00b1 0.06 and a double = 2.79 \u00b1 0.08. Also, the logarithmic slope of the metric luminosity \u03b1 is higher in double profile BCGs (\u03b1double = 0.65 \u00b1 0.12) than in single profile BCGs (\u03b1single = 0.59 \u00b1 0.14). The mean isophote outer ellipticity (calculated at \u03bc ~ 24 mag arcsec-2) is higher in double profile BCGs (e double = 0.30 \u00b1 0.10) than in single profile BCGs (e single = 0.26 \u00b1 0.11). Similarly, the mean absolute value of inner minus outer ellipticity is also higher in double profile BCGs. From a subsample of 24 BCGs, we found strong evidence that extra-light at intermediate radii in double profile BCGs is related to the presence of a faint stellar envelope. Similarly, from another subsample of 12 BCGs we also found that extra-light is related to star formation. On the other hand, we did not find differences between these two BCG categories when we compared global cluster properties such as the BCG-projected position relative to the cluster X-ray center emission, X-ray luminosity, or BCG orientation with respect to the cluster position angle.",

        "abstract": "Purpose--This paper aims to use a risk management approach for re-profiling of sovereign debt. It develops profiles that trade off expected cost of financing alternative debt structures against their risk. The risk profiles are particularly informative for countries facing sovereign debt crisis, as they allow us to identify, with high probability, debt unsustainability. Risk profiles for two eurozone countries with excessive debt, Cyprus and Italy, were developed. In addition, risk profiles were developed for a proposal to impose debt sanctions in the Ukrainian crisis and it was shown that the financial impact could be substantial. Design/methodology/approach--Using scenario analysis, a risk measure of the sovereign's debt--Conditional Debt-at-Risk--was developed, and an optimization model was then used to trade off expected cost of debt financing against the Conditional Debt-at-Risk. The model is applied to three diverse settings from current crises. Findings--The methodology traces informative risk profiles to identify sustainable debt structures. Interesting, although tentative, conclusions are drawn for the countries where the methodology was applied. Cyprus's debt sustainability hinges on current International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections about gross domestic product growth and small deviations can push debt into unsustainable territory. For Italy, our analysis provides evidence of debt unsustainability. Common assumption of debt by eurozone member states could restore sustainability for Italy. Finally, it is shown how a proposal to impose debt sanctions against Russia for the Ukrainian crisis could have significant financial impact for Ukraine. Research limitations/implications--Additional work is needed to calibrate the simulation models for each country separately. Nevertheless, the direction of the results is such that more careful calibration will most likely not alter the conclusions but make them stronger instead. Practical implications--The results provide significant insights for the management of sovereign debt for Cyprus and Italy. They also show the significant positive impact on Ukrainian public finances from debt sanctions. However, the most important practical implication is to show how the proposed methodology provided a decision support tool for restructuring and rescheduling sovereign debt for crisis countries. Social implications--There is widespread acceptance that debt restructuring has been too little and too late in recent crises failing to re-establish market access in a durable way. How to develop risk profiles for alternative debt structures has been illustrated. Debt profiles that are unsustainable can be identified, with high probability, and alternative structures proposed that restore sustainability. The methodology proposed in this paper is providing a useful tool of analysis. The topic of debt relief is currently debated widely at policy circles by the IMF and the United Nations, and the analysis of this paper provides some insightful input to the debate. Originality/value--The use of scenario analysis for sovereign debt modeling and the use of an optimization model developed by the authors in previous research provide empirical analysis for three current problems in sovereign debt management. Useful insights are obtained for three important real-world cases for Cyprus, Italy and Ukraine.",

        "abstract": "Water and debris flows exiting confined valleys have a tendency to deposit sediment on steep fans. On alluvial fans where water transport of gravel predominates, channel slopes tend to decrease downfan from similar to 0.10-0.04 to similar to 0.01 across wide ranges of climate and tectonism. Some have argued that this pattern reflects grain-size fining downfan such that higher threshold slopes are required just to entrain coarser particles in the waters of the upper fan, whereas lower slopes are required to entrain finer grains downfan (threshold hypothesis). An older hypothesis is that slope is adjusted to transport the supplied sediment load, which decreases downfan as deposition occurs (transport hypothesis). We have begun to test these hypotheses for alluvial fan long-profiles using detailed hydraulic and particle-size data in sediment transport models. On four alluvial fans in the western U.S., we find that channel hydraulic radiiare largely 0.54.9 m at fan heads, decreasing to 0.1-0.2 m at distal margins. We find that median gravel diameter does not change systematically along the upper 60%-80% of active fan channels as slope declines, so downstream gravel fining cannot explain most of the observed channel slope reduction. However, as slope declines, channel-bed sand cover increases systematically downfan from areal fractions of <20% above fan heads to distal fan values in excess of 70%. As a result, entrainment thresholds for bed material might decrease systematically downfan, leading to lower slopes. However, current models of this effect alone tend to underpredict downfan slope changes. This is likely due to off-channel gravel deposition. Calculations that match observed fan long-profiles require an exponential decline in gravel transport rate, so that on some fans approximately half of the load must be deposited off channel every similar to 0.20-1.4 km downfan. This leads us to hypothesize that some alluvial fan long-profiles are statements about the rate of overbank deposition of coarse particles downfan, a process for which there is currently no mechanistic theory.",

A generalized equation employing lumped parameters was derived to model such ubiquitously observed patterns:C = frac(C0, frac(C0 - Cx = 0, Cx = 0) exp (??ini ?? over(k, ??) ?? x) + 1)Here C, Cx = 0, and Co are the concentrations of an element at a given depth x, at the top of the reaction front, or in parent respectively. ??ini is the roughness of the dissolving mineral in the parent and k???? is a lumped kinetic parameter. This kinetic parameter is an inverse function of the porefluid advective velocity and a direct function of the dissolution rate constant times mineral surface area per unit volume regolith. This model equation fits profiles of concentration versus depth for albite in seven weathering systems and is consistent with the interpretation that the surface area (m2 mineral m- 3 bulk regolith) varies linearly with the concentration of the dissolving mineral across the front. Dissolution rate constants can be calculated from the lumped fit parameters for these profiles using observed values of weathering advance rate, the proton driving force, the geometric surface area per unit volume regolith and parent concentration of albite. These calculated values of the dissolution rate constant compare favorably to literature values. The model equation, useful for reaction fronts in both steady-state erosional and quasi-stationary non-erosional systems, incorporates the variation of reaction affinity using pH as a master variable. Use of this model equation to fit depletion fronts for soils highlights the importance of buffering of pH in the soil system. Furthermore, the equation should allow better understanding of the effects of important environmental variables on weathering rates. ?? 2008.",

The authors have carried out an investigation to monitor the rate of ingress of chlorides during a 48-week cyclic wetting and drying regime using a variety of cement blends, viz. pulverised fuel ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, metakaolin and microsilica. Chloride profiles were obtained by analysing concrete dust samples extracted from different depths from the surface that was exposed to the chloride exposure regime. The resistivity of the concrete was determined by measuring conductance between pairs of electrodes, in order to assess if this could be used to determine the presence of chlorides. The water absorption (sorptivity) of the concrete was also measured in order to determine if any correlation existed with the chloride ingress. The chloride profiles depended on both the duration of exposure and the type of cementitious material. A linear relationship was established between the depths to a constant chloride concentration of 0.2% by weight of cementitious material and the square root of time, yielding a rate of chloride ingress coefficient. This coefficient was found to depend on the type of cementitious material. The lowest value was obtained for slag concrete and the highest value was found for the OPC concrete. This corresponded well with the results from the resistivity profiles which indicated slag cement was best at resisting chloride penetration and the OPC concrete the worst. The sorptivity decreased significantly after the testing regime, due to pore refinement caused by continued hydration and the binding of chloride ions, leading to a reduction in continuous porosity. No correlation was found between the sorptivity and the rate of chloride ingress, which indicates that the dominant mechanism responsible for the transport of the chloride ions was not absorption. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this work is to provide a reliable theoretical framework for performing statistical analysis on ecological diversity by means of the joint use of diversity profiles and functional data analysis. We point out that ecological diversity is a multivariate concept as it is a function of the relative abundances of species in a biological community. For this, several researchers have suggested using parametric families of indices of diversity for obtaining more information from the data. Patil and Taillie introduced the concept of intrinsic diversity ordering which can be determined by using the diversity profile. It may be noted that the diversity profile is a non-negative and convex curve which consists of a sequence of measurements as a function of a given parameter. Thus, diversity profiles can be explained through a process that is described in a functional setting. Recent developments in environmental studies have focused on the opportunity to evaluate community diversity changes over space and/or correlation of diversity with environmental characteristics. For this, we develop an innovative analysis of diversity based on a functional data approach. Whereas conventional statistical methods process data as a sequence of individual observations, functional data analysis is designed to process a collection of functions or curves. Moreover, unconstrained models may lead to negative and/or non-convex estimates for the diversity profiles. To overcome this problem, a transformation is proposed which can be constrained to be non-negative and convex. We focus on some applications showing how functional data analysis provides an alternative way of understanding biological diversity and its interaction with natural and/or human factors.

        "abstract": "Obesity in youth has increased during the last 10 years in Western countries. Several studies have investigated physical activity and its effects on obesity and health, showing that regular physical activity combined with improved physical fitness reduces the risk of obesity and several metabolic problems (e.g. diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, heart disease) and also improves overall health. However, there is only limited scientific information available concerning the changes in the physical fitness profiles of youth. It is obvious that only slight changes observed in endurance-type physical activity can also be observed in aerobic capacity. Today and in the future, a major public health concern for teenage and young adults is the combination of increasing body fatness together with decreasing physical fitness. In order to evaluate overall fitness level, it is particularly essential to examine both aerobic and neuromuscular fitness. Therefore, in clinical practice work and health behaviour education, a person's physical fitness should be measured more frequently with various measures. Furthermore, population-based surveys should be combined with regular measurement of physical fitness to study sedentary lifestyles, particularly in young people. This article presents a review of current physical fitness profiles of male children, adolescents and young adults, which hopefully initiates further studies in this relevant scientific field. In addition, the importance of physical fitness level is evaluated in relation to obesity and health. Collectively, studies examining physical fitness profiles of young men suggest a disturbing worldwide trend of decreased aerobic fitness and increased obesity. Continued efforts to foster improved physical fitness and healthy lifestyles should be encouraged to combat these trends. Such efforts should include frequent and objective assessment of physical fitness rather than solely relying on subjective assessment of physical activity.",

The Gauss-Hermite expansion, which is widely used to describe the line of sight velocity distributions extracted from absorption spectra of elliptical galaxies, is not readily applicable to samples of discrete stellar velocity measurements, accompanied by individual measurement errors and probabilities of membership. We introduce two parameter families of probability distributions describing symmetric and asymmetric distortions of the line profiles from Gaussianity. These are used as the basis of a maximum likelihood estimator to quantify the shape of the line profiles. Tests show that the method outperforms a Gauss-Hermite expansion for discrete data, with a lower limit for the relative gain of approx 2 for sample sizes N approx 800. To ensure that our methods can give reliable descriptions of the shape, we develop an efficient test to assess the statistical quality of the obtained fit. As an application, we turn our attention to the discrete velocity datasets of the dwarf spheroidals of the Milky Way. In Sculptor, the symmetric deviations are everywhere consistent with velocity distributions more peaked than Gaussian. This may suggest a radially biased orbital structure. In Fornax, there is an evolution in the symmetric deviations of the line profile from a peakier to more flat-topped distribution on moving outwards. This may be an indication of tangential anisotropy in the outer parts. Our methods are sensitive enough to detect evidence for velocity distributions more peaked than Gaussian in Carina and Sextans, which suggest radial anisotropy in the outer parts of these two galaxies. This is all consistent with a picture in which Fornax may have had a different evolutionary history to Sculptor, Carina and Sextans.",

        "abstract": "Personalization is ubiquitous in modern online applications as it provides significant improvements in user experience by adapting it to inferred user preferences. However, there are increasing concerns related to issues of privacy and control of the user data that is aggregated by online systems to power personalized experiences. These concerns are particularly significant for user profile aggregation in online advertising. This paper describes a practical, learning-driven client-side personalization approach for keyword advertising platforms, an emerging application previously not addressed in literature. Our approach relies on storing user-specific information entirely within the user's control (in a browser cookie or browser local storage), thus allowing the user to view, edit or purge it at any time (e.g., via a dedicated webpage). We develop a principled, utility-based formulation for the problem of iteratively updating user profiles stored client-side, which relies on calibrated prediction of future user activity. While optimal profile construction is NP-hard for pay-per-click advertising with bid increments, it can be efficiently solved via a greedy approximation algorithm guaranteed to provide a near-optimal solution due to the fact that keyword profile utility is submodular: it exhibits the property of diminishing returns with increasing profile size. We empirically evaluate client-side keyword profiles for keyword advertising on a large-scale dataset from a major search engine. Experiments demonstrate that predictive client-side personalization allows ad platforms to retain almost all of the revenue gains from personalization even if they give users the freedom to opt out of behavior tracking backed by server-side storage. Additionally, we show that advertisers can potentially increase their return on investment significantly by utilizing bid increments for keyword profiles in their ad campaigns.",

Recent research has identified the independent contribution of several maternal and child factors to the development of childhood overweight/obesity. Few studies, however, have examined risk profiles of childhood obesity. Aim: This study used classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to examine the combined effect of maternal and child factors in generating risk profiles for overweight/obesity among preschoolers. Study design: Data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) study were used. The sample was comprised of preschool children. CART and logistic regression models were built and compared. Results: Children who were overweight/obese at two years of age had an increased risk of being overweight/obese at four years of age. Children born to overweight/obese mothers were more likely to be overweight/obese by age four, even if their BMI at two years of age was normal. Children with high birth weight (???4000. g.) were also more likely to be overweight/obese at age four years if they were born to mothers with a normal pregravid BMI, but were of a lower socioeconomic status. Among preschoolers whose mothers were black or white and who had a high pregravid BMI, breastfeeding duration and parity played an important role in determining their risk of being overweight/obese. Conclusions: Classification tree analysis confirms and extends current knowledge of preschool overweight/obesity by providing preliminary risk profiles that are structured within the context of prenatal and postnatal maternal and child characteristics. ?? 2010.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have been widely applied to describe fluvial long profiles. However, aggrading rivers simulated in laboratory experiments typically display much less profile curvature than a diffusion model would predict, whether aggradation is driven by subsidence or by base-level rise. Here we explore the possibility that this is due to nonclassical or non-Fickian, anomalous sediment transport in braided networks, which are known to have fractal planform geometry. We solve a fractional diffusion equation for a steady state aggrading fluvial profile for fractional exponents in the spatial derivative a in the range 1.1 < a + 1 < 2. The domain is bounded at both ends, and a constant sediment sink forces extraction of all of the imposed, constant sediment supply. We assume the fractional behavior is expressed solely by a nonlocal sediment flux term. Using the right-hand Caputo fractional derivative, we are able to construct a fractional diffusion equation that admits an analytical fluvial profile closely matching the laboratory-scale physical observations. We show that this solution is also in good agreement with a Monte Carlo simulation obtained using step lengths drawn from a L\u00e9vy probability density. However, despite the clear nonlocal behavior, we are unable to establish a direct physical link between the power law statistics of the fluvial transport system and the mathematical ingredients in a fractional diffusion model. In general, we expect the fractional behavior to be most pronounced when the length scale of significant downstream sediment extraction is comparable to the scale range of the fractal channel pattern behavior. This is typically the case for laboratory experiments but not at field scales, which could explain why anomalously flat fluvial long profiles have not been reported from the field. Applying fractional calculus to depositional river profiles, at any scale, exposes problems in applying fractional calculus posed by the bounded domain and the presence of a distributed sink associated with sediment extraction. With present understanding, the benefit of fractional calculus, which is its ability to capture effects of power law statistics in the underlying dynamics, comes at a significant cost in terms of flexibility to handle other physical effects such as complex domains, boundary conditions, and source terms.",

        "abstract": "Human disease is heterogeneous, with similar disease phenotypes resulting from distinct combinations of genetic and environmental factors. Small-molecule profiling can address disease heterogeneity by evaluating the underlying biologic state of individuals through non-invasive interrogation of plasma metabolite levels. We analyzed metabolite profiles from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 50 individuals, 25 with normal (NGT) and 25 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Our focus was to elucidate underlying biologic processes. Although we initially found little overlap between changed metabolites and preconceived definitions of metabolic pathways, the use of unbiased network approaches identified significant concerted changes. Specifically, we derived a metabolic network with edges drawn between reactant and product nodes in individual reactions and between all substrates of individual enzymes and transporters. We searched for \"active modules\"--regions of the metabolic network enriched for changes in metabolite levels. Active modules identified relationships among changed metabolites and highlighted the importance of specific solute carriers in metabolite profiles. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis demonstrated that changed metabolites in OGTT naturally grouped according to the activities of the System A and L amino acid transporters, the osmolyte carrier SLC6A12, and the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate transporter SLC25A13. Comparison between NGT and IGT groups supported blunted glucose- and/or insulin-stimulated activities in the IGT group. Using unbiased pathway models, we offer evidence supporting the important role of solute carriers in the physiologic response to glucose challenge and conclude that carrier activities are reflected in individual metabolite profiles of perturbation experiments. Given the involvement of transporters in human disease, metabolite profiling may contribute to improved disease classification via the interrogation of specific transporter activities.",

For increasing gravity there is a discontinuous freezing transition induced by the container wall where few crystalline layers are spontaneously formed at the bottom of the sample. This crystalline part then grows continuously as the gravitational field is further enhanced. The results are compared with density functional theory of freezing where a weighted density approximation is used. While good overall agreement of the laterally averaged profile and the lateral crystallinity is achieved, density functional theory yields a discontinuous crystal growth via layering transitions.",

Two different conventions for the transverse pressure, due respectively to Harasima and to Irving and Kirkwood, are shown to give distinguishable, but similar, forms. The equivalence of these definitions with those based on the grand potential density is clarified. The profiles, and the location of the surface of tension, depend dramatically on the orientation of the director relative to the interface.

Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) constitute an heterogeneous group of tumours with different morphologic, immunophenotypic, and clinical characteristics. Their complexity and their low frequency in the western countries have made difficult the identification of molecular events responsible of the development of these tumours. The first studies on expression profiling of PTCL have also revealed heterogeneity at this level, mainly regarding the PTCL NOS subgroup. Different molecular subgroups within PTCL unspecified have been identified associated to different expression profiles. However, the clinical significance of this molecular sub-classification remains to be probed in studies involving larger number of samples. In addition, the expression level of NF-kB pathway genes allowed to differentiate two PTCL subgroups, and this difference could have clinical interest. In general, PTCL expression profiles are difficult to interpret due to the significant proportion of other infiltrating cells accompanying the tumour. However, microarrays are being a helpful tool in the initial task of dissecting the PTCL expression profile.",

We assessed the expression of microRNA and the association between microRNA expression and the prognosis of serous ovarian carcinoma. Experimental Design: Twenty patients diagnosed with serous ovarian carcinoma and eight patients treated for benign uterine disease between December 2000 and September 2003 were enrolled in this study. The microRNA expression profiles were examined using DNA microarray and Northern blot analyses. Results: Several microRNAs were differentially expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma compared with normal ovarian tissues, including miR-21, miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-100, miR-145, miR-16, and miR-99a, which were each differentially expressed in >16 patients. In addition, the expression levels of some microRNAs were correlated with the survival in patients with serous ovarian carcinoma. Higher expression of miR-200, miR-141, miR-18a, miR-93, and miR-429, and lower expression of let-7b, and miR-199a were significantly correlated with a poor prognosis (P < 0.05).

The aim of this empirical paper using three waves of the European Community Household Panel (1994-1996) is to acquire a deeper insight into the flows on the labour market and the factors that might be responsible for the great variations in these employment patterns between individuals and households both within and across countries. The focus will be especially on longitudinal patterns of employment according to the attachment of the person to the labour market in a given period of time. These longitudinal employment patterns are called working profiles and it is claimed that these profiles provide a better insight into modern labour markets because of their focus on the dynamics or changes of employment and unemployment status over time. We use an amended version of Esping-Andersen's welfare state typology to test whether longitudinal employment patterns differ across these regimes according to the typical institutional set-ups of their labour market and social security policies. We added a Southern regime type because we found that the classification including such a regime type performs better in explaining differences in longitudinal employment patterns across Europe than one without it. Within a job search theoretical framework we estimated some multinomial logit models to test whether indeed regime types matter in explaining transitions in longitudinal employment statuses over time. The results show that regimes matter and that the Southern regime performs markedly different compared to the other three regime types. ",

As a consequence, there is significant benefit in identifying drivers who engage in unsafe driving practices. Driver behaviour profiles (DBPs) are introduced here as an approach for evaluating driver behaviour as a function of the risk of a casualty crash. They employ data collected using global positioning system (GPS) devices, supplemented with spatiotemporal information. These profiles are comprised of common risk scores that can be used to compare drivers between each other and across time and space. The paper details the development of these DBPs and demonstrates their use as an input into modelling the factors that influence driver behaviour. The results show that even having controlled for the influence of the road environment, these factors remain the strongest predictors of driver behaviour suggesting different spatiotemporal environments elicit a variety of psychological responses in drivers. The approach and outcomes will be of interest to insurance companies in enhancing the risk-profiling of drivers with on-road driving and government through assessing the impacts of behaviour-change interventions.",

Study design: Statistical analysis of a retrospective cohort. Results: CSF profiles from 823 infants with negative test results for infection were analyzed. For 677 infants with atraumatic lumbar punctures (red blood cell [RBC] count <1000/mm 3), the mean and median CSF white blood cell (WBC) counts were 4.3/mm3 and 3.0/mm3, respectively, with a range from 0 to 12/mm3. Mean CSF WBC counts (6.1/mm3 versus 3.1/mm 3 and 3.0/mm3) and protein levels (75.4 mg/dL versus 58.9 mg/dL and 39.2 mg/dL) were higher in the first month compared with months 2 and 3, respectively (P < .001 for all). CSF glucose levels were lower in the first month compared with month 3 (45.3 mg/dL versus 48.0 mg/dL and 57.7 mg/dL; P < .001). Increasing RBC counts were statistically associated with increasing WBC counts (P < .001). However, the contribution of RBC < 10 000/mm3 was small, and the reference range for WBC in uninfected infants with traumatic lumbar punctures was 0 to 16/mm3. Conclusion: CSF WBC counts in febrile infants without evidencse of bacterial or enteroviral infection, even in those with traumatic lumbar puncture, are lower than reported in pediatric references. ?? 2011 Mosby Inc.

Unlike item-based collaborative filtering, we focus on discovering the characteristic descriptors that underlie the item-user association. Such information is used as supplemental features in a content-based filtering system. The main objective of virtual profiles is to provide a means to tap into rich-content information from one type of entity and propagate features extracted from which to other affili- ated entities that may suffer from relative data scarcity. We empirically evaluate the proposed method on a real-world community recommendation problem at LinkedIn. The re- sult shows that the virtual profiles outperform a collabora- tive filtering based approach (user who likes this also likes that).

Atypical meningiomas, which are WHO grade 2 tumors, and anaplastic meningiomas, which are WHO grade 3 tumors, exhibit an increased risk of recurrence and premature death compared with benign WHO grade 1 tumors. Although atypical and anaplastic meningiomas account for <10% of all of meningiomas, it can be difficult to distinguish them from benign meningiomas by morphologic criteria alone. We used selective tissue microdissection to examine 24 human meningiomas and did two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to determine protein expression patterns. Proteins expressed differentially by meningiomas of each WHO grade were identified and sequenced. Proteomic analysis revealed protein expression patterns unique to WHO grade 1, 2, and 3 meningiomas and identified 24 proteins that distinguish each subtype. Fifteen proteins showed significant changes in expression level between benign and atypical meningiomas, whereas nine distinguished atypical from anaplastic meningiomas. Differential protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.

        "abstract": "We recently proposed that molecular cloud dense cores undergo a prolonged period of quasi-static contraction prior to true collapse. This theory could explain the observation that many starless cores exhibit, through their spectral line profiles, signs of inward motion. We now use our model, together with a publicly available radiative transfer code, to determine the emission from three commonly used species - N2H+, CS, and HCN. A representative dense core of 3 Msun that has been contracting for 1 Myr has line profiles that qualitatively match the observed ones. In particular, optically thick lines have about the right degree of blue-red asymmetry, the empirical hallmark of contraction. The J=2-1 rotational transition of CS only attains the correct type of profile if the species is centrally depleted, as has been suggested by previous studies. These results support the idea that a slow, but accelerating, contraction leads to protostellar collapse. In the future, the kind of analysis presented here can be used to assign ages to individual starless cores.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many cases of hereditary breast cancer are due to mutations in either the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene. The histopathological changes in these cancers are often characteristic of the mutant gene. We hypothesized that the genes expressed by these two types of tumors are also distinctive, perhaps allowing us to identify cases of hereditary breast cancer on the basis of gene-expression profiles. METHODS: RNA from samples of primary tumor from seven carriers of the BRCA1 mutation, seven carriers of the BRCA2 mutation, and seven patients with sporadic cases of breast cancer was compared with a microarray of 6512 complementary DNA clones of 5361 genes. Statistical analyses were used to identify a set of genes that could distinguish the BRCA1 genotype from the BRCA2 genotype. RESULTS: Permutation analysis of multivariate classification functions established that the gene-expression profiles of tumors with BRCA1 mutations, tumors with BRCA2 mutations, and sporadic tumors differed significantly from each other. An analysis of variance between the levels of gene expression and the genotype of the samples identified 176 genes that were differentially expressed in tumors with BRCA1 mutations and tumors with BRCA2 mutations. Given the known properties of some of the genes in this panel, our findings indicate that there are functional differences between breast tumors with BRCA1 mutations and those with BRCA2 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly different groups of genes are expressed by breast cancers with BRCA1 mutations and breast cancers with BRCA2 mutations. Our results suggest that a heritable mutation influences the gene-expression profile of the cancer.",

Results indicate high expressions of one IQ sub-dimension (i.e. critical thinking) and three EQ sub-dimensions (i.e. influence, motivation and conscientiousness) in successful managers in all types of projects. Other sub-dimensions varied by project type. Comparison was made to existing profiles for goal oriented, involving and engaging leadership styles. Implications derived are the need for practitioners to be trained in the soft factors of leadership, particular for their types of projects.

        "abstract": "We study the effect of chain self-avoidance on the polymer density profiles that are induced by a single colloidal particle of nonspherical shape such as an ellipsoid, a dumbbell, or a lens in a solution of nonadsorbing polymers. For colloid sizes sigma much smaller than the size R(x) of the polymers, we observe a pronounced difference between ideal and self-avoiding chains. In the case of ideal polymers, the surfaces of constant density always have the same character as the surface of the particle, e.g., are oblate for an oblate ellipsoid. In the self-avoiding case, however, the character changes with increasing distance r from the particle, and an oblate particle induces prolate surfaces of constant density if sigma<<r<<R(x). For sigma<<r, R(x), the isotropic and anisotropic contributions to the densities factor into a dependence on the particle size and shape and a dependence on r, R(x). The latter is determined by distance distributions within a chain in the absence of the particle. For self-avoiding polymers in two spatial dimensions, exact density profiles are derived for sigma, r<<R(x), which explicitly show the above-mentioned change of the contours of constant density.",

The resulting monthly means show that all vertical profiles are influenced by the high roughness and by the thermal properties of the urban surface. Main features are a missing diurnal course of the wind speed a few tens of meters above mean roof-top level and variances that increase considerably with height not only during daytime but also in many nights. While the first feature is typical for boundary-layers over rough surfaces, the second feature is only explainable by the larger heat input into the urban boundary-layer from the surface below. It is proposed to rely more on vertical remote sensing than on the vertical extrapolation of Prandtl-layer similarity theories when assessing the vertical structure of an urban boundary-layer. \u00a9 Gebr\u00fcder Borntraeger, Berlin, Stuttgart 2004.",

        "abstract": "Deduction is the ability to draw necessary conclusions from previous knowledge. Here we propose a novel approach to understanding the neural basis of deduction, which exploits fine-grained inter-participant variability in such tasks. Participants solved deductive problems and were grouped by the behavioral strategies employed, i.e., whether they were sensitive to the logical form of syllogistic premises, whether the problems were solved correctly, and whether heuristic strategies were employed. Differential profiles of neural activity can predict membership of the first two of these groups. The predictive power of activity profiles is distributed non-uniformly across the brain areas activated by deduction. Activation in left ventro-lateral frontal (BA47) and lateral occipital (BA19) cortices predicts whether logically valid solutions are sought. Activation of left inferior lateral frontal (BA44/45) and superior medial frontal (BA6/8) cortices predicts sensitivity to the logical structure of problems. No specific pattern of activation was associated with the use of a non-logical heuristic strategy. Not only do these findings corroborate the hypothesis that left BA47, BA44/45 and BA6/8 are critical for making syllogistic deductions, but they also imply that they have different functional roles as components of a dedicated network. We propose that BA44/45 and BA6/8 are involved in the extraction and representation of the formal structure of a problem, while BA47 is involved in the selection and application of relevant inferential rules. Finally, our findings suggest that deductive reasoning can be best described as a cascade of cognitive processes requiring the concerted operation of several, functionally distinct, brain areas. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

This research compared the inorganic profiles of sludge from full-scale processes (activated sludge and anaerobic digestion) with and without iron dosing, with the aim of identifying changes in inorganic distribution resulting from iron dosing. Sludge phosphorus and metals were fractionated using sequential chemical extraction. Bioavailable iron was lower in iron-dosed activated sludge, as was bioavailable phosphorus (6.5 g/kg compared with 1.8 g/kg), with most of the iron and phosphorus bound as iron-hydroxy-phosphates. Similar results were found for anaerobically digested sludge after iron dosing; iron and phosphorus in the sludge increased by 4 and 1.35 times, respectively, but bioavailability was decreased. The ratio of chemical oxygen demand to bioavailable phosphorus in the digester was 840 : 1 after iron dosing. By contrast, calcium, magnesium, copper and zinc were increasingly bioavailable in the digester after iron dosing. The reported changes were linked to the iron content of the sludge; hence the level of iron dosing is key to minimising changes in sludge inorganic profiles.",

Developing calvaria undergoes a typical intramembranous bone-forming process. To identify genes associated with osteoblast differentiation, we isolated total RNAs from parietal bones, that represent active osteoblasts, and sutural mesenchyme, that represents osteoprogenitor cells, and comprehensively analyzed their gene expression profiles using an oligo-based Affymetrix microarray chip containing 22,690 probes. About 2100 genes with \"Present\" calls had more than 2-fold higher expression in bone compared to sutures while 73 of these genes had more than 8-fold expression. Some of these genes are already known to be bone-related biomarkers: VitD receptor, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin, osteopontin, MMP13, etc. Eight genes were selected and subjected to confirmation by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses. All the genes tested showed higher expression in bones, ranging from 5- to 140-fold. Several of these genes are ESTs while others are already known but their functions in osteogenesis were not previously known. Most genes of the BMP and FGF families probed in the Genchip analysis were more highly expressed in bone tissues compared to suture. All differentially-expressed Runx and Dlx family genes also showed higher expression in bone. These results imply that our data is valid and can be used as a good standard for the mining of osteogenesis-related genes. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

We first consider simple oillair and oil/water interfaces, and then proceed to lipid monolayers at air/water and oil/water interfaces. The results are qualitatively similar in both atomistic and coarse-grained models. The lateral pressure profile in a monolayer is characterized by a headgroup/water pressure-interfacial tension-chain pressure pattern. In contrast to lipid bilayers, the pressure decreases towards the chain free ends. An additional chain/air tension peak is present in monolayers at the air/water interface. Lateral pressure profiles are calculated for monolayers of different lipid composition under varying surface tension. Increasing the surface tension suppresses both pressure peaks and widens the interfacial tension in monolayers at the oil/water interface, and mainly suppresses the chain pressure in monolayers at the air/water interface. In monolayers in the liquid-condensed phase, the pressure peaks split due to ordering. Variation of lipid composition leads to noticeable changes in all regions of the pressure profile at a fixed surface tension.",

In addition, we developed methods to compensate photon and detection biases.

We present first VLTI measurements of visibility values beyond the first minimum which were taken on the giant star \u03a8 Phe. Here, the capabilities to synthesize baselines of different lengths and to use different aperture sizes were used for the first time with the VLTI. We close with an outlook on the future potential on studies of stellar surface structure with the six-way beam combination at the NPOI and with the completed VLTI.

Moreover, understanding the health effects associated with exposure to pollutant mixtures may lead to new regulatory strategies. Objectives: Recently we have introduced a new approach that uses cluster analysis to identify distinct air pollutant mixtures by classifying days into groups based on their pollutant concentration profiles. In Boston during the years 1999-2009, we examined whether the effect of PM2.5 on total mortality differed by distinct pollution mixtures. Methods: We applied a time series analysis to examine the association of PM2.5 with daily deaths. Subsequently, we included an interaction term between PM2.5 and the pollution mixture clusters. Results: We found a 1.1% increase (95% CI: 0.0, 2.2) and 2.3% increase (95% CI: 0.9-3.7) in total mortality for a 10\u03bcg/m3 increase in the same day and the two-day average of PM2.5 respectively. The association is larger in a cluster characterized by high concentrations of the elements related to primary traffic pollution and oil combustion emissions with a 3.7% increase (95% CI: 0.4, 7.1) in total mortality, per 10\u03bcg/m3 increase in the same day average of PM2.5. Conclusions: Our study shows a higher association of PM2.5 on total mortality during days with a strong contribution of traffic emissions, and fuel oil combustion. Our proposed method to create multi-pollutant profiles is robust, and provides a promising tool to identify multi-pollutant mixtures which can be linked to the health effects. \u00a9 2014.",

Recent studies have suggested that miRNA deregulation is associated with the initiation and progression of human cancer. However, information about ovarian cancer-related miRNA is mostly limited to tissue miRNA. The aim of this study was to find specific profiles of plasma-derived miRNAs of ovarian cancer. In this present study, the expression profiles of 740 miRNAs in plasma from 18 patients and 24 healthy women subjects were evaluated using microfluidic based multiplex qRT-PCR. Our results demonstrated that expression levels of eight miRNAs were significantly upregulated in patients with ovarian cancer when compared with a control group (p < 0.05). Expression levels of four miRNAs were found significantly downregulated in patients with ovarian cancer (p < 0.05). In addition, 10 miRNAs were expressed only in the ovarian cancer group and miR-138-5p of these miRNAs is ovarian specific. In conclusion, our study suggests that detecting these ovarian cancer specific miRNAs in plasma might serve as novel non-invasive biomarkers for ovarian cancer.",

        "abstract": "Metadata is needed to facilitate data sharing among geospatial informa- tion communities. Geographic Metadata Standards are available but tend to be general and complex in nature and also are not well suited to overcome semantic heterogeneities across vocabularies of different domains and user communities. Current formalizations of metadata standards are not flexible enough to allow reuse and extension of metadata specifications, in particular for Web based information systems. In order to address this problem we propose a methodology to create community specific metadata profiles for the Semantic Web by reusing metadata specifications and domain vocabularies encoded as resources for the Web. This ensures that these community profiles are semantically compatible so they can be used in Web based information systems. The ISO-19115:2003 geographic metadata standard is the most general standard available and is being used in conjunction with the Web Ontology Language as the expression medium to test the methodology for each one of the possible extensions documented in ISO-19115:2003. It is shown that it is possible to extend and reuse metadata specifications and vocabularies dis- tributed in the Web using the Web Ontology Language, by utilizing the language\u2019s flexibility to create restrictions on inherit properties and to make interferences on web distributed resources. Examples from the area of Hydrology are provided to demonstrate the technical details of the approach.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little quantitative information exists regarding the effect that retinitis pigmentosa (RP) has on the choroid. The aim of this study was to determine choroidal thickness profiles in patients with RP. DESIGN: Prospective. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two RP and 22 control subjects participated in the study. RP patients had mild to severe disease, with a visual acuity range of logMAR 0.1 to no light perception. METHODS: Images of the retina and choroid were obtained using the enhanced depth-imaging method and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Choroidal thickness measures were determined via manual segmentation of the OCT image. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The thickness profiles of the normal and RP groups were compared. The associations between choroidal thickness, visual acuity and duration of RP were determined. RESULTS: The choroid was thickest in the control eyes at the subfoveal location (336.60 +/- 70.42 mum), and the thickness gradually decreased towards the peripheral retina (temporal 8 degrees = 295.55 +/- 60.52 mum; nasal 8 degrees = 251.68 +/- 49.93 mum). In RP, the mean thickness was also greater at the fovea (215.60 +/- 94.91 mum) than the temporal (191.66 +/- 72.42 mum) and nasal (149.91 +/- 57.42 mum) retina, but all values were significantly lower than those of the controls (P </= 0.001). Subfoveal choroidal thickness was significantly correlated with visual acuity (r = -0.46, P < 0.001) and duration of disease (r = -0.4, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RP have a thinner choroid than controls. Patients with poorer visual acuity or longer duration of symptoms tended to have thinner choroids. Knowledge of choroidal thickness profile in RP is important for the field of restorative vision research and the development of suprachoroidal retinal prostheses.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depending on their larval environment, female honeybees develop into either queens or workers. As in other polyphenisms, this developmental switch depends not on genomic differences between queens and workers but on the differential expression of entire suites of genes involved with larval fate. As such, this and other polyphenic systems can provide a novel tool for understanding how genomes and environmental conditions interact to produce different developmental trajectories. Here we use gene-expression profiles during honeybee caste determination to present the first genomic view of polyphenic development. RESULTS: Larvae raised as queens or workers differed greatly in their gene-expression patterns. Workers remained more faithful than queens to the expression profiles of younger, bipotential, larvae. Queens appeared to both downregulate many of the genes expressed by bipotential larvae and turn on a distinct set of caste-related genes. Queens overexpressed several metabolic enzymes, workers showed increased expression of a member of the cytochrome P450 family, hexameric storage proteins and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and young larvae overexpressed two putative heat-shock proteins (70 and 90 kDa), and several proteins related to RNA processing and translation. CONCLUSIONS: Large differences in gene expression between queens and workers indicate that social insect castes have faced strong directional selection pressures. Overexpression of metabolic enzymes by queen-destined larvae appears to reflect the enhanced growth rate of queens during late larval development. Many of the differently expressed genes we identified have been tied to metabolic rates and cellular responses to hormones, a result consistent with known physiological differences between queen and worker larvae.",

They range from pilocytic astrocytoma, with a generally good prognosis, to the extremely aggressive malignant glioblastoma. In addition to these 2 types of contrasting neoplasms, several other subtypes can be distinguished, each characterized by specific phenotypic, as well as genotypic features. Recently, the epigenotype, as evident from differentially methylated DNA loci, has been proposed to be useful as a further criterion to distinguish between tumor types. In our study, we screened 139 tissue samples, including 33 pilocytic astrocytomas, 46 astrocytomas of different grades, 7 oligoastrocytomas, 10 oligodendrogliomas, 10 glioblastoma multiforme samples and 33 control tissues, for methylation at CpG islands of 15 different gene loci. We used the semiquantitative high throughput method MethyLight to analyze a gene panel comprising ARF, CDKN2B, RB1, APC, CDH1, ESR1, GSTP1, TGFBR2, THBS1, TIMP3, PTGS2, CTNNB1, CALCA, MYOD1 and HIC1. Seven of these loci showed tumor specific methylation changes. We found tissue as well as grade specific methylation profiles. Interestingly, pilocytic astrocytomas showed no evidence of CpG island hypermethylation, but were significantly hypomethylated, relative to control tissues, at MYOD1. Our results show that glioma subtypes have characteristic methylation profiles and, with the exception of pilocytic astrocytomas, show both locus specific hyper- as well as hypomethylation.",

In order to judge on compliance of the business processing, the degree of behavioural deviation of a case, i.e., an observed execution sequence, is quantified with respect to a process model (referred to as fitness, or recall). Recently, different compliance measures have been proposed. Still, nearly all of them are grounded on state-based techniques and the trace equivalence criterion, in particular. As a consequence, these approaches have to deal with the state explosion problem. In this paper, we argue that a behavioural abstraction may be leveraged to measure the compliance of a process log a collection of cases. To this end, we utilise causal behavioural profiles that capture the behavioural characteristics of process models and cases, and can be computed efficiently. We propose different compliance measures based on these profiles, discuss the impact of noise in process logs on our measures, and show how diagnostic information on non-compliance is derived. As a validation, we report on findings of applying our approach in a case study with an international service provider. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

In this study the variation in the shape of the directional tuning profiles among a population of cells recorded from the arm area of the motor cortex of monkeys using movements in 20 directions, every 18\u00b0, was examined systematically. This allowed the investigation of tuning functions with extra parameters to capture additional features of the tuning curve (i.e. tuning breadth, symmetry, and modality) and determine an 'optimal' tuning function. These functions provided better fit than the standard cosine one. The optimal function for the large majority of tuned cells was unimodal (84%), and only for a few of them (16%) it was bimodal. Of the unimodal cells, 73% exhibited symmetric and 27% asymmetric shape. The half-width, \u03c3, at the midpoint of optimal tuning curves differed among cells from 30 to 90\u00b0, with a median at 56\u00b0. This is much narrower than in the standard cosine tuning function with a fixed width of \u03c3 = 90\u00b0. It was concluded that motor cortical cells are more sharply tuned than previously thought.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The design of targeted therapeutic strategies for cancer has largely been driven by the identification of tumor-specific genetic changes. However, the large number of genetic alterations present in tumor cells means that it is difficult to discriminate between genes that are critical for maintaining the disease state and those that are merely coincidental. Even when critical genes can be identified, directly targeting these is often challenging, meaning that alternative strategies such as exploiting synthetic lethality may be beneficial. To address these issues, we have carried out a functional genetic screen in >30 commonly used models of breast cancer to identify genes critical to the growth of specific breast cancer subtypes. In particular, we describe potential new therapeutic targets for PTEN-mutated cancers and for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers. We also show that large-scale functional profiling allows the classification of breast cancers into subgroups distinct from established subtypes.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE: Despite the wealth of molecular profiling data that describe breast tumors and breast tumor cell models, our understanding of the fundamental genetic dependencies in this disease is relatively poor. Using high-throughput RNA interference screening of a series of pharmacologically tractable genes, we have generated comprehensive functional viability profiles for a wide panel of commonly used breast tumor cell models. Analysis of these profiles identifies a series of novel genetic dependencies, including that of PTEN-null breast tumor cells upon mitotic checkpoint kinases, and provides a framework upon which additional dependencies and candidate therapeutic targets may be identified.",

The definition therein explored was based on the R\u00e9nyi entropy of probability density estimation (pdf) using the Parzen's window method and applied to Chaos Game Representation/Universal Sequence Maps (CGR/USM). Subsequent work proposed a fractal pdf kernel as a more exact solution for the iterated map representation. This report extends the concepts of continuous entropy by defining DNA sequence entropic profiles using the new pdf estimations to refine the density estimation of motifs. RESULTS: The new methodology enables two results. On the one hand it shows that the entropic profiles are directly related with the statistical significance of motifs, allowing the study of under and over-representation of segments. On the other hand, by spanning the parameters of the kernel function it is possible to extract important information about the scale of each conserved DNA region. The computational applications, developed in Matlab m-code, the corresponding binary executables and additional material and examples are made publicly available at http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/~svinga/ep/. CONCLUSION: The ability to detect local conservation from a scale-independent representation of symbolic sequences is particularly relevant for biological applications where conserved motifs occur in multiple, overlapping scales, with significant future applications in the recognition of foreign genomic material and inference of motif structures.",

The recommended methodology is physically based, produces results that most closely represent the measured data, and will permit results from different field and laboratory studies to be compared using a standardized convention. The recommended protocol suggests the following: (1) measure vertical flux profiles with as many traps as feasible with shorter traps near the bed; (2) measure bed elevation before, during, and after data collection; (3) use the geometric mean to represent trap centers; (4) use the saltation-enhanced aerodynamic roughness length when approximating the bottom elevation of traps deployed at the bed (0 mm); (5) plot vertical mass-flux data with height above the bed as the independent variable; and (6) fit vertical mass-flux curves using non-linear, exponential curve fitting. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In the 17th century, music-theoretical concepts of sonority, root, and inversion emerged. I propose that since then, the primary perceptual reference in tonal music has been the tonic triad sonority (not the tonic tone or chroma) in an experiential (not physical or notational) representation. This thesis is consistent with the correlation between the key profiles of Krumhansl and Kessler (1982; here called chroma stability profiles) and the chroma salience profiles of tonic triads (after Parncutt, 1988). Chroma stability profiles also correlate with chroma prevalence profiles (of notes in the score), suggesting an implication-realization relationship between the chroma prevalence profile of a passage and the chroma salience profile of its tonic triad. Convergent evidence from psychoacoustics, music psychology, the history of composition, and the history of music theory suggests that the chroma salience profile of the tonic triad guided the historical emergence of major-minor tonality and continues to influence its perception today.",

Generally the quality assessment is performed through manual examination of the DNA profiles based on empirical knowledge, or by comparing the intensities (allelic peak heights) of the capillary electrophoresis electropherograms.\\n\\nRESULTS: We recently developed a ranking index for unbiased and quantitative quality assessment of forensic DNA profiles, the forensic DNA profile index (FI) (Hedman et al. Improved forensic DNA analysis through the use of alternative DNA polymerases and statistical modeling of DNA profiles, Biotechniques 47 (2009) 951-958). FI uses electropherogram data to combine the intensities of the allelic peaks with the balances within and between loci, using Principal Components Analysis. Here we present the construction of FI. We explain the mathematical and statistical methodologies used and present details about the applied data reduction method. Thereby we show how to adapt the ranking index for any Short Tandem Repeat-based forensic DNA typing system through validation against a manual grading scale and calibration against a specific set of DNA profiles.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The developed tool provides unbiased quality assessment of forensic DNA profiles. It can be applied for any DNA profiling system based on Short Tandem Repeat markers.

METHODS: We constructed a dataset of phylogenomic profiles (vectors that encode the similarity, measured by BLAST scores, of a gene across many species) for a series of 31 pathogenic bacteria of interest with 1073 genes taken from the reference organisms Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We applied Bayesian Decomposition, a matrix decomposition algorithm, to identify functional metabolic units comprising overlapping sets of genes in this dataset. RESULTS: Although no information on phylogeny was provided to the system, Bayesian Decomposition retrieved the known bacteria phylogenic relationships on the basis of the proteins necessary for survival. In addition, a set of genes required by all bacteria was identified, as well as components and enzymes specific to subsets of bacteria.

Due to the high frame rate of the camera, several flow features can be observed. Quantitative statements can be made by analysing the images with a pattern matching algorithm. This provides us with flow-normal velocity profiles with a very high temporal and spatial resolution. We find that even on flat surfaces, velocity profiles are strongly changing through the flow and for the range of investigated chute angles (from 26 to 36) clear trends can be recognised. In the head of the avalanche the velocity is highest, decreasing continuously over the length of the avalanche. Thus, the investigated granular avalanches stretch through the flow.

The alphasyllabary of Kannada comprises more than 400 symbols called akshara; each symbol is visuo-spatially complex with a consistent representation at the dual levels of the syllable and the phoneme. We investigated reading difficulties in Kannada among 8\u201312 year old children by conducting a between-groups followed by a case series analysis. We compared the children with reading difficulties with same age competent readers and younger readers who were similar in language level, matched on measures of vocabulary, syntactic processing, and morphological processing. Reading difficulties were characterized by poor akshara knowledge. Concomitant impairments were in syllable and phoneme level phonological skills, in rapid naming and in oral language skills. The case series analysis highlighted the variability of profiles among poor readers with the most common impairments being in akshara knowledge and phonological processing. Sub-groups of poor readers showed additional deficits in oral language, rapid naming, and visual processing skills. Together our findings indicate that the core deficit associated with reading difficulty in the alphasyllabary of Kannada is in the phonological domain. However, accompanying deficits in related skills, including visual processing, can further inhibit reading attainment. The findings from this study support a multifactorial model of reading development. {(PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2011 {APA}, all rights reserved)",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical model for the prediction of near-shore hydrodynamics in the surf zone along long straight beaches. The waves may be periodic or narrow-banded random waves, and the beach profile may be plane or barred. The theoretical model consists of three components: wave model, surface roller model, and near-shore mean current model. Both wave and surface roller models are based on simple energy balance equations and all the variables applied for the current model are determined in terms of wave energies. The near-shore mean current model consists of two-layer 2DH momentum equations, integrated above the wave trough level and over the entire depth, which determine mean shear stresses at the trough level and on the bottom, respectively. Coupled with a simple turbulent eddy viscosity model, analytical solutions are obtained for the vertical mean shear current profiles. The bottom boundary condition is specified by a wave\u2013current bottom boundary layer model requiring knowledge of the equivalent bottom roughness. Model predictions of undertow velocity profiles compare favorably with experimental observations which were not used in the model\u2019s development.",

One hundred eighty six seventh-graders participated in the study (98 boys and 88 girls). Comprehension was assessed for three short texts, and reading speed for one of these. Students also completed vocabulary test, strategic reading questionnaire and short-term and working memory tasks. The ability to detect focus words in the sentences and inappropriate sentences in the text was also tested. Cluster analysis yielded four distinct student-profiles. The first cluster consists of poor readers who score below the average in all the tasks. The fourth cluster consists of good readers who score above the average in all the tasks, except for average reading speed. The second and the third cluster consist of students of average comprehension, reading speed, vocabulary and efficiency in detecting focus words and inappropriate sentences. The students from the second cluster have significantly smaller short-term and working memory spans than students from the third cluster, but they report more frequent use of reading strategies. These results are in line with theories emphasizing the importance of compensatory strategies in overcoming working memory limitations (Walczyk et al., 2001; 2007).",

        "abstract": "We constructed two-dimensional representations of profiles of gene conservation across different genomes using the genome of Escherichia coli as a model. These profiles permit both the visualization at the genome level of different traits in the organism studied and, at the same time, reveal features related to the genomes analyzed (such as defective genomes or genomes that lack a particular system). Conserved genes are not uniformly distributed along the E. coli genome but tend to cluster together. The study of gene distribution patterns across genomes is important for the understanding of how sets of genes seem to be dependent on each other, probably having some functional link. This provides additional evidence that can be used for the elucidation of the function of unannotated genes. Clustering these patterns produces families of genes which can be arranged in a hierarchy of closeness. In this way, functions can be defined at different levels of generality depending on the level of the hierarchy that is studied. The combined study of conservation and phenotypic traits opens up the possibility of defining phenotype/genotype associations, and ultimately inferring the gene or genes responsible for a particular trait.",

No correction therefore was attempted for the latter. The corrected data of the earlier flights are presented in the form of seasonally averaged profiles over Scotts Bluff, Nebraska; Death Valley, California; and the Pacific offshore of San Luis Obispo, California. As to be expected, the vertical profiles from the earlier flights show a decrease in the D content with altitude and a seasonal variation at all altitudes. However, when plotted against the water vapor mixing ratio, the D data from all seasons collapse on a line which closely follows that given by Rayleigh condensation with a fractionation factor alpha = 1.1, constant with altitude. These data can be explained by a simple one-dimensional convection model and the assumption that condensed water is lofted along with the water vapor.",

        "abstract": "The inflammatory caspases, human caspases-1, -4, and -5, proteolytically modulate diverse physiological outcomes in response to proinflammatory signals. Surprisingly, only a few substrates are known for these enzymes, including other caspases and the interleukin-1 family of cytokines. To more comprehensively characterize inflammatory caspase substrates, we combined an enzymatic N-terminal enrichment method with mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify newly cleaved proteins. Analysis of THP-1 monocytic cell lysates treated with recombinant purified caspases identified 82 putative caspase-1 substrates, three putative caspase-4 substrates, and no substrates for caspase-5. By contrast, inflammatory caspases activated in THP-1 cells by mimics of gout (monosodium urate), bacterial infection (lipopolysaccharide and ATP), or viral infection (poly(dA.dT)) were found to cleave only 27, 16, and 22 substrates, respectively. Quantitative stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) comparison of these three inflammatory stimuli showed that they induced largely overlapping substrate profiles but different extents of proteolysis. Interestingly, only half of the cleavages found in response to proinflammatory stimuli were contained within our set of 82 in vitro cleavage sites. These data provide the most comprehensive set of caspase-1-cleaved products reported to date and indicate that caspases-4 and -5 have far fewer substrates. Comparisons between the in vitro and in vivo data highlight the importance of localization in regulating inflammatory caspase activity. Finally, our data suggest that inducers of inflammation may subtly alter caspase-1 substrate profiles.",

Histopathology, immunological profiles of mononuclear cells from M. tuberculosis-infected rat lung tissue, and the expression patterns of cytokine and iNOS mRNAs were examined over time. M. tuberculosis induced granulomatous lesions in the lungs, spleen, lymph nodes and liver, but these lesions lacked central necrosis. Multinucleate giant cells were observed in late-phase tuberculosis. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells increased with time and reached a peak 5 weeks after infection, decreasing gradually thereafter. ED1 antigen, suggestive of alveolar macrophages, was expressed at a high level in early phase tuberculosis and remained at the same level even in the late phase. OX62 antigen increased gradually and reached a peak 5 weeks after infection. Interferon-gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and iNOS mRNAs were expressed strongly over time, but their expression decreased 12 weeks after infection. Because rat tuberculosis is very similar to murine tuberculosis and it is easy to obtain mononuclear cells from M. tuberculosis-infected rat lung tissue, the rat tuberculosis model appears to be suitable for immunological studies in vivo.",

There were significant changes in the expression of a number of miRNAs, including miR-155, in chicken B cells stimulated with CD40 ligand. Similarly, avian leukosis virus (ALV)-transformed DT40 cells also showed changes in miRNA expression in relation to the na\u00efve cells. Embryonic stem cell line BP25 demonstrated a distinct cluster of upregulated miRNAs, many of which were shown previously to be involved in embryonic stem cell development. Finally, chicken macrophage cell line HD11 showed changes in miRNA profiles, some of which are thought to be related to the transformation by v-myc transduced by the virus.

First, we used previously known miRNA sequences from humans and mice to perform blast searches against the porcine expressed sequence tag (EST) database; 98 new miRNA candidates were identified according to a range of filtering criteria. These miRNA candidates and 73 known miRNAs (miRBase 13.0) from pigs were chosen for porcine miRNA microarray analysis. A total of 16 newly identified miRNAs and 31 previously known miRNAs were detected in porcine skeletal muscle tissues. During later foetal development at E90, miR-1826, miR-26a, miR-199b and let-7 were highly expressed, whilst miR-1a, miR-133a, miR-26a and miR-1826 showed highest abundance during the fast growing stage at PD120. Using the 47 miRNAs detected by the microarray assay, we performed further investigations using the publicly available porcine mRNA database from NCBI and computed potential target hits using the software rnahybrid. This study identified 16 new miRNA candidates, computed potential target hits for 18 miRNA families and determined the miRNA expression profiles in porcine skeletal muscle tissues at different developmental stages.

We develop a methodology for spatially resolved spectroscopy of extended sources, adapted to XMM background and vignetting characteristics. The effect of the particle induced background is discussed. A simple unbiased method is proposed to correct for vignetting effects, in which every photon is weighted according to its energy and location on the detector. We were able to derive the temperature profile of A1795 up to 0.4 times the virial radius. A significant and spatially resolved drop in temperature towards the center (r<200 kpc) is observed, which corresponds to the cooling flow region of the cluster. Beyond that region, the temperature is constant with no indication of a fall-off at large radii out to 1.2 Mpc.

Further- more, with the growing of Web 2.0, some web sites allow users to share their own trajectories. In such web sites, users are able to search trajectories that are interested by users. To provide more insights into these trajectories, in this paper, we target at the problem of discovering com- munities among users, where users in the same community have similar moving behaviors. Note that moving behav- iors are usually represented as trajectory patterns where a user frequently travels. In this paper, we propose a frame- work to discover communities of users. Explicitly, we adopt a probabilistic suffix tree (abbreviated as PST) as a trajec- tory profile which truly reflects user moving behavior of a user. In light of trajectory profiles, we further formulate a similarity measurement among trajectory profiles of users. Based on the similarity measurement, we develop algorithm CI (standing for Community Identification) to discover user communities. Furthermore, for the same community, one representative PST is selected. When a new user is added, one could simply derive the similarity measurement by com- paring representative PSTs, which is able to efficiently de- termine which community this new user should join. To evaluate our proposed methods, we conduct experiments on the synthetic dataset generated from one real dataset. Ex- perimental results show that the trajectory profile proposed can effectively reflect user moving behavior, and our pro- posed methods can accurately identify communities among users.",

These observations were made with a new 128-MHz baseband recorder at the Parkes Observatory. There has been some suggestion that millisecond pulsar profiles can undergo radical changes in both pulse shape and polarimetry, mainly due to discrepancies between the Bonn and Jodrell Bank polarimetric studies. If millisecond pulsars are intrinsically unstable, this has ramifications for precision timing and the millisecond pulsar emission mechanism. However, we find ourselves in good agreement with the Jodrell Bank data, and, in most cases, very poor agreement with the Bonn results. The presented polarimetric observations do display some phenomena common to those displayed by normal pulsars, including orthogonal mode transitions in position angle and associated sense changes of circular polarization. The behaviour of the position angle presented by these pulsars is, with some significant exceptions, a shallow or flat sweep across the pulse. This behaviour lends support to theories that suggest millisecond pulsar emission regions are wider, at least in terms of pulse longitude, than those of the normal pulsars. The broad millisecond pulsars J2124-3358 and J2145-0750 display position-angle behaviour that departs significantly from that expected if the magnetic field of these pulsars has a simple dipolar structure.",

        "abstract": "Cancer patients often show heterogeneous drug responses such that only a small subset of patients is sensitive to a given anticancer drug. With the availability of large-scale genomic profiling via next-generation sequencing, it is now economically feasible to profile the whole transcriptome and genome of individual patients in order to identify their unique genetic mutations and differentially expressed genes, which are believed to be responsible for heterogeneous drug responses. Although subtyping analysis has identified patient subgroups sharing common biomarkers, there is no effective method to predict the drug response of individual patients precisely and reliably. Herein, we propose a novel computational algorithm to predict the drug response of individual patients based on personal genomic profiles, as well as pharmacogenomic and drug sensitivity data. Specifically, more than 600 cancer cell lines (viewed as individual patients) across over 50 types of cancers and their responses to 75 drugs were obtained from the genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer database. The drug-specific sensitivity signatures were determined from the changes in genomic profiles of individual cell lines in response to a specific drug. The optimal drugs for individual cell lines were predicted by integrating the votes from other cell lines. The experimental results show that the proposed drug prediction algorithm can be used to improve greatly the reliability of finding optimal drugs for individual patients and will, thus, form a key component in the precision medicine infrastructure for oncology care.",

The study examined patterns of memory impairment in a large cohort of AD patients, with particular attention to the relationship between working and long-term declarative memory. Tests of working memory, visual and verbal recall and recognition, and recent personal memory were administered to 67 AD patients in the early to moderate stages of disease and to 30 age-matched controls. Performance on all measures was significantly poorer in patients than in controls. Factor analysis of test scores delineated five factors representing the domains of working memory, visual recall, verbal recall, recognition, and personal memory, indicating that these aspects of memory can break down separately. Cluster analysis revealed distinct memory profiles. Some patients showed predominant problems in working memory, with relatively superior long term retention, whereas other patients showed the reverse pattern. Qualitatively distinct profiles arose at comparable levels of severity. Problems in working memory, but not long term memory were associated with the presence of language and perceptuospatial deficits. The results reinforce previous findings that both working and long term memory failure contribute to the memory symptoms of AD patients, and demonstrate dissociations in memory breakdown across the cohort. The link between working memory and language performance, together with findings of posterior hemisphere abnormalities on neuroimaging, lead us to reassess the nature of working memory deficits in AD.",

In this report independent component analysis is used to analyze photoacoustic data acquired from a multilayer sample in an attempt to isolate the spectra of the constituent layers. The ICA findings are compared to the approach of eliciting this information through difference spectroscopy. The results suggest that ICA may offer substantial benefits for segmentation of PAS depth profiles without user intervention.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thermodynamic profiles of the associations of dimeric betaA3 and betaB1 and tetrameric betaB1/betaA3 were measured using sedimentation equilibrium. The homo- and heteromolecular associations of betaB1 crystallin are dominated by exothermic enthalpy (-13.3 and -24.5 kcal/mol, respectively).

We find that the pressure inside the bilayer changes qualitatively for cholesterol concentrations of about 20% or higher. The pressure profile in the inside of the bilayer then turns from a rather flat shape into an alternating sequence of regions with large positive and negative lateral pressure.

By comparing reading scores (as estimates of premorbid ability) to tests of concurrent cognitive abilities (i.e., memory, attention, etc.), it was determined that SLE presents a profile distinct from TBI, with the most significant impairments noted in expressive language (Zdiff = -1.39), attention (Zdiff = -0.41), and speed of processing (Zdiff = -0.40). In contrast to TBI, no impairment was noted in intelligence, memory, or cognitive flexibility. Results suggest that memory problems reported by individuals with SLE may be related to inattention.

Areas covered: A literature search was conducted using keywords apt to identify information on safety profile of the fluoroquinolones. Publications concerned with descriptive and etiological surveys were manually reviewed. Expert opinion: Cardiac alterations and blood glucose impairments might be associated with any fluoroquinolone. However, the benefit/risk profile of these agents could be stratified for the single compounds. Several predisposing factors, such as diabetes, heart illnesses and their related pharmacotherapies, might exacerbate the risk of potentially serious adverse events. In this context, the opportunity of the more appropriate choice among different fluoroquinolones could be applicable. (copyright) 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.",

Ratings of ethos in Japan and the US were reliable and yielded plausible descriptions of culture. However, measures of ethos based on the analysis of stories were not meaningfully correlated with aggregate personality traits or national character stereotypes.

It is the parameter most affected by seeing; furthermore, the value of n that can be measured is always smaller than the real one. It is shown that the luminosity density of the S\u00e8rsic profile with n less than 0.5 has a central depression, which is physically unlikely. Also, the intrinsic ellipticity of the sources has been taken into account and we show that the parameters are dependent when the effects of seeing are non-negligible.

Both GA(3) and GA(4) showed a dramatic increase in the samples taken from the apical part of axillary branches from plants 4-5 m high, which corresponds to the maximum vegetative development prior to macroscopically visible inflorescences. Notable increases in the cytokinins trans-zeatin (t-Z), isopentenyladenine (iP), and the riboside and ribotide forms of iP were also obtained. The auxin, indole-3-acetic acid, was the most abundant plant hormone, and its content was highest during vegetative growth.

Hence, an usually large number of wavelength samples, may be substituted by a few such coefficients, thus reducing considerably the size of data files and the analysis of observable information. Moreover, since the set of Hermite functions is an universal basis, it promises to help in modern inversion techniques of the radiative transfer equation that infer the solar physical quantities from previously compiled look-up tables or artificial neural networks.

The data source was the Institut de Medicina Legal de Catalunya. Diagnoses were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification, and classified using the Barell Matrix. Of the 719 deaths studied, 45% were pedestrians, 32% two wheel motor vehicle users, and 23% car occupants. The injury profile of the road traffic deaths in Barcelona is internal injuries and fractures to the torso and to the head/neck. This profile is repeated in all the road user groups, although pedestrians present higher frequencies of fractures and contusions to extremities and contusions to the head/neck, and fewer internal torso injuries than car occupants or two wheel motor vehicle users. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Gati, Landman, Davidovitch, Asulin-Peretz, and Gadassi suggested that the way individuals make career decisions should not be described by a single decision-making style but rather by a multidimensional profile based on a consideration of 11 dimensions. The results showed that the Italian version of the CDMP has adequate psychometric properties and structural validity. As hypothesized, the scores of the Problem-Solving Inventory were correlated with the information-related dimensions of the CDMP. Decided adolescents had more adaptive CDMP profiles than undecided adolescents, supporting the concurrent validity of the CDMP. Female adolescents were more likely to consult with and depend on others, invest greater effort, and, consequently, take more time to make a decision. Theoretical and counseling implications are discussed.",

The local vibrational densities of states are evaluated using the recursion method with the force-constant matrix generated from a N-body interatomic potential based on the second moment approximation of the tight-binding scheme. We show that the maximum of the segregation vibrational entropy is not located in the surface plane but in the first underlayer that recovers the bulk coordination number of nearest neighbours. Furthermore, we show that surface relaxations are essential to obtain this unexpected vibrational entropy profile. For the (3 1 0) surface, the maximum value of the segregation vibrational entropy is located on the third underlayer and is larger than for the (0 0 1) orientation.

After 5 months the plants were harvested and the lignan profile in the roots and aerial parts was analysed using GC-MS. The plants from the seeds of the 4 locations showed several significant phenotypic differences in, for instance, dry-weight. However the 4 groups did not differ significantly in their lignan profile in their roots. The lignans in the roots of A. sylvestris, deoxypodophyllotoxin, yatein and anhydropodorhizol reached, on average, equal amounts in all 4 groups. Within the 4 groups, however, a large quantitative variation in lignan profile between the individual plants was observed, pointing to within-population genetic differences between individual plants.",

Comparisons with parametric spectra and profiles under wave spectra from the Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) and buoy observations reveal much better agreement than the monochromatic profile even for complex sea states. That the profile gives a closer match and a more correct shear has implications for ocean circulation models since the Coriolis\u2013Stokes force depends on the magnitude and direction of the Stokes drift profile, and Langmuir turbulence parameterizations depend sensitively on the shear of the profile.

We find that at small radii, the mass density distribution is dominated by a nearly constant density core with a core radius of a few kpc. For rho(r) ~ r^a, the distribution of inner slopes a is strongly peaked around a = -0.2. This is significantly shallower than the cuspy a < -1 halos found in CDM simulations. While the observed distribution of alpha does have a tail towards such extreme values, the derived value of alpha is found to depend on the spatial resolution of the rotation curves: a ~ -1 is found only for the least well resolved galaxies. Even for these galaxies, our data are also consistent with constant density cores (a = 0) of modest (~ 1 kpc) core radius, which can give the illusion of steep cusps when insufficiently resolved. Consequently, there is no clear evidence for a cuspy halo in any of the low surface brightness galaxies observed.",

The heat generation in multi-layer actuators is studied as a function of driving frequency and applied electric field. The heat transfer coefficients and the total hysteresis loss per cycle in the device are estimated from fitting experimental data to analytical expressions of time-temperature profiles. The temperature rise is found to be approximately proportional to the frequency, while the total loss of the actuator per cycle increases with applied field and frequency. The high estimated values of heat transfer coefficient, which range from 140 to 210Wm-2K-1, are due to the high conductivity and thermal mass of the sample holder. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In order to compute tight lower bounds we provide a column generation technique. The subproblem is a shortest path problem in a network where the arcs have multiple weights. Upper bounds, that is, feasible solutions are calculated by means of local search. We present computational results for randomly generated instances and empirical results for examples from practice.

However, although a high proportion of patients achieve 'undetectability', many then experience a return to a state of detectability at a later date. As evaluation of virologic response provides a useful measure of therapy efficacy, it is of interest to estimate the proportions of cases with undetectable viral load over time following commencement of treatment. These proportions depend on the rates of transition from detectability to undetectability and subsequent return to detectability, and may be related to covariates or risk factors, possibly differing in both transitions. We consider construction of detectability profiles as estimates of these proportions, based on parametric modelling of the component survival distributions. The method is applied to an examination of the effects of baseline CD4 T-cell lymphocyte counts on virologic response to therapy amongst patients of the Western Australian HIV Cohort Study.",

We found that serum total FFA concentrations at baseline were 67% higher in preeclamptic than in normotensive pregnancies (P=0.0002). The difference between the two groups was largest in the concentrations of oleic (75%), linoleic (129%) and arachidonic (315%) acids. Oral intake of glucose suppressed total FFA in preeclamptic women by 40% (95% CI 32.1-46.1%, P<0.0001) but only 24% in control women (95% CI 0.01-42.0%, P=0.045).

The method is based on the derivation of pointwise Green function bounds and the description of the linearized solution operator. A new feature in the present analysis is the construction of the resolvent kernel for the case of an eigenvalue system of equations of degenerate type. Nonlinear stability then follows in standard fashion by linear estimates derived from these pointwise bounds, combined with nonlinear-damping\u2013type energy estimates.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a study assessing the probability of selecting a resolution approach to tackle an obsolescence issue. First, the Delphi method was applied across an industry expert panel to derive a set of 15 obsolescence resolution profiles (ORPs). The ORPs represent the probability of using each obsolescence resolution approach to tackle an obsolescence issue. Each ORP is characterized by the complexity level of the obsolete component and the level of proactiveness for obsolescence management, which have been identified as the two major factors that influence the probability of using each resolution approach. Second, the results were enhanced by means of a definitions refinement workshop. Finally, the ORPs were refined and validated by means of a workshop with experts based on the theoretical trends expected for each resolution probability. More than 40 experts in obsolescence from across the UK from the defence, aerospace, railway and nuclear sectors have participated in the study.",

We extend this research to stereotypes. Specifically, we examined peoples' preconceptions about the situation-behavior profiles that social groups are likely to display, as well as the implications of such preconceptions for behavioral judgments. Focusing on gender stereotypes, in Study 1 we found that perceivers' expectations about men's and women's assertiveness are qualified by situational information. Study 2 revealed that perceivers' beliefs about the mentalistic attributes (e.g., goals, beliefs, motivations) that characterize men and women mediated the relationship between target gender and perceivers' expectations about situation-behavior patterns. Study 3 explored how such contextualized stereotypes affect on-line judgments of targets' behavior, showing that perceivers judge a given behavior's assertiveness based not only on target gender but also on situation type. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Our method, referred to as credible case-based inference, makes use of so-called similarity profiles as a formal model of the key hypothesis underlying case-based reasoning (CBR), namely, the assumption that similar problems have similar solutions. Proceeding from this formalization, it becomes possible to derive theoretical properties of the corresponding inference scheme in a rigorous way. In particular, it can be shown that, under mild technical conditions, a set of candidates covers the true solution with high probability. Thus, the approach supports an important subtask in CBR, namely, to generate potential solutions for a new target problem in a sound manner and hence contributes to the methodical foundations of CBR. Due to its generality, it can be employed for different types of performance tasks and can easily be integrated in existing CBR systems.",

The purpose of our study was to examine microRNA expression in Barrett esophagus and esophageal cancer to identify potential markers for disease progression. METHODS: MicroRNA was isolated from 35 frozen specimens (10 adenocarcinoma, 10 squamous cell carcinoma, 9 normal epithelium, 5 Barrett esophagus, and 1 high-grade dysplasia). MicroRNA expression was analyzed with Ambion bioarrays (Ambion, Austin, Tex) containing 328 human microRNA probes. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchic clustering resulted in four major branches corresponding with four histologic groups. One branch consisted of 7 normal epithelium samples and 1 squamous cell carcinoma sample. The second branch consisted of 7 squamous cell carcinoma samples and 1 normal epithelium sample. The third branch contained 4 Barrett esophagus samples and 1 squamous cell carcinoma sample. The fourth contained all the adenocarcinoma samples and 1 sample each of Barrett esophagus, normal epithelium, squamous cell carcinoma, and high-grade dysplasia. Supervised classification with principal component analysis determined that the normal epithelium samples were more similar to the squamous cell carcinoma tumors, whereas the Barrett esophagus samples were more similar to adenocarcinoma. Pairwise comparisons between sample types revealed microRNAs that may be markers of tumor progression. Both mir_203 and mir_205 were expressed 2- to 10-fold lower in squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinomas than in normal epithelium. The mir_21 expression was 3- to 5-fold higher in both tumors than in normal epithelium. Prediction analysis of microarray classified 3 Barrett esophagus samples as Barrett esophagus, 1 as adenocarcinoma, and 1 as normal epithelium. CONCLUSION: Expression profiles of miRNA distinguish esophageal tumor histology and can discriminate normal tissue from tumor.

        "abstract": "In the present study, we present analyzed profiles of observed classroom experiences in terms of emotional and instructional dimensions of quality. Over 800 first-grade classrooms across the United States were included, selected by virtue of having a student participating in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development enrolled in the classroom. Our aim was to present a typology of first grades. We examined correlates of classroom profiles in terms of teacher (years of experience, education, and beliefs), child (gender, ethnicity, family socioeconomic status, maternal education, and preschool achievement), and school (public vs. private, class size, presence of teachers' assistants) characteristics. Data were collected via teacher and parent questionnaires, classroom observations conducted by trained data collectors using the Classroom Observation System for First Grade, and individually administered child assessments (Woodcock Johnson Psycho-educational Battery Revised Tests of Cognitive Ability and Tests of Achievement). Findings indicated discernible, replicable types of first-grade classrooms (descriptively titled high quality, mediocre quality, low quality, and positive emotional climate/lower academic demand) that demonstrated different levels of emotional and instructional support and were related to several of the characteristics of children, families, teachers, and schools listed above. Of note, characteristics such as teachers' years of experience and class size were not differentially related to the four classroom types.

        "abstract": "With the increase in resource-sharing websites such as YouTube and Flickr, many shared resources have arisen on the Web. Personalized searches have become more important and challenging since users demand higher retrieval quality. To achieve this goal, personalized searches need to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provides a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. In this article, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized searches. To handle these limitations, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles in collaborative tagging systems. We use a normalized term frequency to indicate the preference degree of a user on a tag. A novel search method using such profiles of users and resources is proposed to facilitate the desired personalization in resource searches. In our framework, instead of the keyword matching or similarity measurement used in previous works, the relevance measurement between a resource and a user query (termed the query relevance) is treated as a fuzzy satisfaction problem of a user's query requirements. We implement a prototype system called the Folksonomy-based Multimedia Retrieval System (FMRS). Experiments using the FMRS data set and the MovieLens data set show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extra-cellular microRNAs have been identified within blood and their profiles reflect various pathologies; therefore they have potential as disease biomarkers. Our aim was to investigate how circulating microRNA profiles change during cancer treatment. Our hypothesis was that tumour-related profiles are lost after tumour resection and therefore that comparison of profiles before and after surgery would allow identification of biomarker microRNAs. We aimed to examine whether these microRNAs were directly derived from tumours, and whether longitudinal expression monitoring could provide recurrence diagnoses. METHODS: Plasma was obtained from ten breast cancer patients before and at two time-points after resection. Tumour tissue was also obtained. Quantitative PCR were used to determine levels of 367 miRNAs. Relative expressions were determined after normalisation to miR-16, as is typical in the field, or to the mean microRNA level. RESULTS: 210 microRNAs were detected in at least one plasma sample. Using miR-16 normalisation, we found few consistent changes in circulating microRNAs after resection, and statistical analyses indicated that this normalisation was not justifiable. However, using data normalised to mean microRNA expression we found a significant bias for levels of individual circulating microRNAs to be reduced after resection. Potential biomarker microRNAs were identified, including let-7b, let-7g and miR-18b, with higher levels associated with tumours. These microRNAs were over-represented within the more highly expressed microRNAs in matched tumours, suggesting that circulating populations are tumour-derived in part. Longitudinal monitoring did not allow early recurrence detection. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that specific circulating microRNAs may act as breast cancer biomarkers but methodological issues are critical.",

Despite the efforts that have been made with kinome analyses, we still lack in-depth insights into the molecular signatures of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are related to pluripotency. Here, we present the first detailed and distinct repertoire of RTK characteristic for hPSC pluripotency by determining both the expression and phosphorylation profiles of RTKs in hESCs and hiPSCs using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers that target conserved tyrosine kinase domains and phospho-RTK array, respectively. Among the RTKs tested, the up-regulation of EPHA1, ERBB2, FGFR4 and VEGFR2 and the down-regulation of AXL, EPHA4, PDGFRB and TYRO3 in terms of both their expression and phosphorylation levels were predominantly related to the maintenance of hPSC pluripotency. Notably, the specific inhibition of AXL was significantly advantageous in maintaining undifferentiated hESCs and hiPSCs and for the overall efficiency and kinetics of hiPSC generation. Additionally, a global phosphoproteomic analysis showed that \u223c30% of the proteins (293 of 970 phosphoproteins) showed differential phosphorylation upon AXL inhibition in undifferentiated hPSCs, revealing the potential contribution of AXL-mediated phosphorylation dynamics to pluripotency-related signaling networks. Our findings provide a novel molecular signature of AXL in pluripotency control that will complement existing pluripotency-kinome networks.",

Using a Ret-kinase-driven Drosophila model of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and kinome-wide drug profiling, here we identify that AD57 rescues oncogenic Ret-induced lethality, whereas related Ret inhibitors imparted reduced efficacy and enhanced toxicity. Drosophila genetics and compound profiling defined three pathways accounting for the mechanistic basis of efficacy and dose-limiting toxicity. Inhibition of Ret plus Raf, Src and S6K was required for optimal animal survival, whereas inhibition of the 'anti-target' Tor led to toxicity owing to release of negative feedback. Rational synthetic tailoring to eliminate Tor binding afforded AD80 and AD81, compounds featuring balanced pathway inhibition, improved efficacy and low toxicity in Drosophila and mammalian multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 models. Combining kinase-focused chemistry, kinome-wide profiling and Drosophila genetics provides a powerful systems pharmacology approach towards developing compounds with a maximal therapeutic index.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in treating disease is identifying molecular states that affect cellular responses to drugs. Here, we focus on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), a key regulator for many of the hallmark behaviors of cancer cells. We alter GSK-3 activity in colon epithelial cells to test its role in modulating drug response. We find that GSK-3 activity broadly affects the cellular sensitivities to a panel of oncology drugs and kinase inhibitors. Specifically, inhibition of GSK-3 activity can strongly desensitize or sensitize cells to kinase inhibitors (for example, mTOR or PLK1 inhibitors, respectively). Additionally, colorectal cancer cell lines, in which GSK-3 function is commonly suppressed, are resistant to mTOR inhibitors and yet highly sensitive to PLK1 inhibitors, and this is further exacerbated by additional GSK-3 inhibition. Finally, by conducting a kinome-wide RNAi screen, we find that GSK-3 modulates the cell proliferative phenotype of a large fraction (\u223c35%) of the kinome, which includes \u223c50% of current, clinically relevant kinase-targeted drugs. Our results highlight an underappreciated interplay of GSK-3 with therapeutically important kinases and suggest strategies for identifying disease-specific molecular profiles that can guide optimal selection of drug treatment.",

The role of anti-cardiolipin (aCL) antibodies and anti-human beta2-glycoprotein I (abeta2GPI) antibodies is less striking. Since the problem of standardization for these tests is far from resolved, we evaluated whether the combination of results (antiphospholipid laboratory profiles) could help to better classify these patients. Over a 6-year period, 618 consecutive subjects (55% of whom had previous documented thrombosis-related events) were referred to our clinic for Antiphospholipid antibody detection. LA was detected according to internationally accepted recommendations. ACL and abeta2GPI antibodies were detected by Enzyme-Linked-Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Patients' records were reviewed for the presence of previous thromboembolic events or obstetric complications according to Sapporo's clinical criteria for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and each patient underwent a physical examination. When individual tests were considered in a multivariate analysis which took into account age, gender, the presence of SLE or other autoimmune diseases and established risk factors for venous and arterial thromboembolism, LA (Odds Ratio 4.4, Confidence Interval 1.5-13.3) and abeta2GPI antibodies (Odds Ratio 2.9, Confidence Interval 1.1-7.5) but not aCL antibodies (Odds Ratio 1.2, Confidence Interval 0.5-2.7) were found to be independent risk factors for thrombosis-related events. When antiphospholipid antibody profiles instead of individual test positivity were analyzed in the above mentioned model, triple positivity resulted a strong independent risk factor (Odds Ratio 33.3, Confidence Interval 7.0-157.6), retaining its significance when the association with venous or arterial thromboembolism was considered. Double positivity with negative LA was close to significance for thrombosis-related events (Odds Ratio 2.2, Confidence Interval 1.0-5.2, p=0.056) and highly significant risk factor for obstetric complications (Odds Ratio 10.8, Confidence Interval 2.9-40.8). Other combinations did not reach statistical significance. The mean level of IgG abeta2GPI antibodies was statistically higher in triple positive profile and might account for positive LA. As compared to a single test, the analysis of a complete antiphospholipid antibody profile can better determine patients at risk.",

We propose a methodology to partition the users tracked by GSM phone calls into pro- files like resident, commuters, in transit and tourists. The methodology analyses the phone calls with a combination of top-down and bottom up techniques where the top-down phase is based on a sequence of queries that identify some behaviors. The bottom-up is a machine learning phase to find groups of similar call behavior, thus refining the pre- vious step. The integration of the two steps results in the partitioning of mobile traces into these four user categories that can be deeper analyzed, for example to understand the tourist movements in city or the traffic effects of commuters. An experiment on the identification of user profiles on a real dataset collecting call records from one month in the city of Pisa illustrates the methodology.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in high throughput technologies have generated an abundance of biological information, such as gene expression, protein-protein interaction, and metabolic data. These various types of data capture different aspects of the cellular response to environmental factors. Integrating data from different measurements enhances the ability of modeling frameworks to predict cellular function more accurately and can lead to a more coherent reconstruction of the underlying regulatory network structure. Different techniques, newly developed and borrowed, have been applied for the purpose of extracting this information from experimental data. In this study, we developed a framework to integrate metabolic and gene expression profiles for a hepatocellular system. Specifically, we applied genetic algorithm and partial least square analysis to identify important genes relevant to a specific cellular function. We identified genes 1) whose expression levels quantitatively predict a metabolic function and 2) that play a part in regulating a hepatocellular function and reconstructed their role in the metabolic network. The framework 1) preprocesses the gene expression data using statistical techniques, 2) selects genes using a genetic algorithm and couples them to a partial least squares analysis to predict cellular function, and 3) reconstructs, with the assistance of a literature search, the pathways that regulate cellular function, namely intracellular triglyceride and urea synthesis. This provides a framework for identifying cellular pathways that are active as a function of the environment and in turn helps to uncover the interplay between gene and metabolic networks.",

Recently we reported the inflammatory mRNA profile in blood leukocytes during human melioidosis. Knowledge of the inflammatory gene expression profile in the pulmonary compartment after infection with B. pseudomallei, however, is highly limited. We therefore aimed to characterize the inflammatory mRNA profile in the pulmonary and systemic compartment during murine melioidosis. By using a newly developed mouse specific Multiplex-Ligation-dependent-Probe-Amplification (MLPA) assay we determined the expression profile of 33 genes encoding inflammatory proteins in lung tissue, leukocytes in bronchoalveolar-lavage-fluid (BALF) and blood leukocytes in mice before and at several time points after intranasal infection with B. pseudomallei. Relative to na??ve mice, mice intranasally infected with B. pseudomallei showed increased transcription of a whole array of genes involved in inflammation, Toll-like receptor-signaling, coagulation, fibrinolysis, cell adhesion, tissue repair and homeostasis in the lung, BALF and blood compartment. Notably, many inflammatory genes were shown to be differentially expressed during the course of infection. These data provide new information on compartmentalized inflammatory gene-expression??profiles after infection with B. pseudomallei, increasing our insights into the extent of inflammation activation in the pulmonary and systemic compartment during melioidosis. ?? 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We use modem theories for many-body effects on diffusion-influenced reactions to derive approximate analytical expressions for the steady-state profile and the Laplace transform of the transient concentration profiles. These show excellent agreement with accurate many-particle Brownian-dynamics simulations for the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The steady-state profile has a hyperbolic dependence on the distance of the substrate from the enzyme, albeit with a prefactor containing the complexity of the many-body effects. These are most conspicuous for the substrate concentration at the surface of the enzyme. It shows an interesting transition as a function of the enzyme turnover rate. When it is high, the contact concentration decays monotonically to steady state. However, for slow turnover it is nonmonotonic, showing a minimum due to reversible substrate binding, then a maximum due to diffusion of new substrate toward the enzyme, and finally decay to steady state. Under certain conditions one can obtain a good estimate for the critical value of the turnover rate constant at the transition.",

Across all 3 samples, being confident was significantly associated with nonsmoking and being happy (Tonga, odds ratio [OR] = 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12-1.73; Vanuatu, OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.02-1.63; Pohnpei, OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.60-3.34). Some cross-country differences in relationships were found in the associations between societal factors (ie, perceived connections with school, teachers, and peers, and perceived community importance and involvement) and nonsmoking and happiness. Findings have implications for developing innovative strategies aimed at preventing smoking uptake and suggest the need for focusing on identifying the determinants of nonsmoking and measuring positive emotions. \u00a9 2011 APJPH.",

Thirteen different protocols for creating and comparing profiles corresponding to the multiple sequence alignments are implemented in the SALIGN command of MODELLER. A test set of 200 pairwise, structure-based alignments with sequence identities below 40% is used to benchmark the 13 protocols as well as a number of previously described sequence alignment methods, including heuristic pairwise sequence alignment by BLAST, pairwise sequence alignment by global dynamic programming with an affine gap penalty function by the ALIGN command of MODELLER, sequence-profile alignment by PSI-BLAST, Hidden Markov Model methods implemented in SAM and LOBSTER, pairwise sequence alignment relying on predicted local structure by SEA, and multiple sequence alignment by CLUSTALW and COMPASS. The alignment accuracies of the best new protocols were significantly better than those of the other tested methods. For example, the fraction of the correctly aligned residues relative to the structure-based alignment by the best protocol is 56%, which can be compared with the accuracies of 26%, 42%, 43%, 48%, 50%, 49%, 43%, and 43% for the other methods, respectively.

This study compared children with two forms of epilepsy: localization-related epilepsy with complex partial seizures (CPS) and childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), to determine whether they display distinct neurocognitive profiles. Methods: Fifty-one children with CPS, 31 children with CAE, and 51 controls underwent neuropsychological testing assessing verbal memory, visual memory, and executive functioning. Groups were compared in these cognitive domains. Within-group analyses were also conducted to examine seizure-related factors that may be related to neuropsychological test performance. Key Findings: When compared to controls, children with CPS showed a mild generalized cognitive deficit, whereas children with CAE did not.When we controlled for intelligent quotient (IQ), both epilepsy groups showed poorer performance relative to controls in the domain of verbal memory.When the epilepsy groups were compared to one another, the CPS group performed significantly poorer than the CAE group on a test of generalized cognitive functioning. However, in the specific domains of executive functioning, verbal memory, and visual memory the epilepsy groups did not differwhen compared to one another. Significance: Neurocognitive deficits present in the context of grossly intact global intellectual functioning highlight the importance of neuropsychological screening in both children with CPS and children with CAE.",

After 40 years ageing, the use of microhardness measurements was investigated as a means of determining the degree of ageing as a function of material thickness. Compression set test pieces were sliced into 1 mm thick sheets and hardness determined. The procedure proved effective for determining hardness profiles. Significant differences were observed between skin and bulk suggesting that differential ageing had taken place. However, only the net effect of scission and crosslinking reactions is detected and differences can be due to differences in cure before exposure to ageing. After consideration of the known macro hardnesses of these materials and differences found at the centres of test pieces from the different exposure sites, it is suggested that the ageing process had not been greatly restricted by the rate of oxygen diffusion.",

The possibility of causing disruption in a relatively slow time scale is pointed out when qmin crosses a rational (especially integral) value. The time scale of the instability is governed by the transit time of the shear flow, which is typically smaller than that of the Alfv\u00e9n velocity.

We report results from two population-based studies: the KORA F4 study from Germany as a discovery cohort, with 1038 female and 1124 male participants (32-81 years), and the TwinsUK study as replication, with 724 female participants. Targeted metabolomics of fasting serum samples quantified 131 metabolites by FIA-MS/MS. Among these, 71/34 metabolites were significantly associated with age in women/men (BMI adjusted). We further identified a set of 13 independent metabolites in women (with P values ranging from 4.6 \u00d7 10(-04) to 7.8 \u00d7 10(-42) , \u03b1(corr) = 0.004). Eleven of these 13 metabolites were replicated in the TwinsUK study, including seven metabolite concentrations that increased with age (C0, C10:1, C12:1, C18:1, SM C16:1, SM C18:1, and PC aa C28:1), while histidine decreased. These results indicate that metabolic profiles are age dependent and might reflect different aging processes, such as incomplete mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.

Patients with incident CKD (eGFR\u226460 ml/min per 1.73 m2) at examination cycles 6, 7, and 8 were age- and sex-matched 1:2 to patients without CKD at baseline (examination 5). CKD risk factors were measured at each examination cycle. Logistic regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and time period, were constructed to compare risk factor profiles at each time point between cases and controls. During follow-up, 441 new cases of CKD were identified and matched to 882 controls (mean age 69.2 years, 52.4% women). Those who ultimately developed CKD were more likely to have hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 2.51), obesity (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.59), and higher triglyceride levels (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83) 30 years before CKD diagnosis, and were more likely to have hypertension (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.79), higher triglyceride levels (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.64), lower HDLc (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.97), and diabetes (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.59 to 5.29) 20 years before CKD diagnosis. These findings demonstrate that risk factors for CKD are identifiable \u226530 years before diagnosis and suggest the importance of early risk factor identification in patients at risk for CKD.",

We found significant differences among breeds in all behavioral traits examined except for \"inappropriate elimination\". In addition, sexual differences were observed in certain behaviors, including \"aggression toward cats\", \"general activity\", \"novelty-seeking\", and \"excitability\". These behaviors were more common in males than females, whereas \"nervousness\" and \"inappropriate elimination\" were rated higher in females. When all breeds were categorized into four groups on the basis of a cluster analysis using the scores of two behavioral trait factors called \"aggressiveness/sensitivity\" and \"vivaciousness\", the group including Abyssinian, Russian Blue, Somali, Siamese, and Chinchilla breeds showed high aggressiveness/sensitivity and low vivaciousness. In contrast, the group including the American Shorthair and Japanese domestic cat displayed low aggressiveness/sensitivity and high vivaciousness, and the Himalayan and Persian group showed mild aggressiveness/sensitivity and very low vivaciousness. Finally, the group containing Maine Coon, Ragdoll, and Scottish Fold breeds displayed very low aggressiveness/sensitivity and low vivaciousness. The present results demonstrate that some feline behavioral traits vary by breed and/or sex.",

Repeated observations over the complete course of the disease are necessary to quantitatively evaluate hypotheses such as the triphasic linear model of Brooks et al. (1993). The goal of this study is to compare the triphasic linear and quadratic models of decline in a group of 12 AD patients confirmed at autopsy with a group of age- and sex-matched normal control subjects. Both groups were taken from the University of Western Ontario Dementia Study, and the Extended Scale for Dementia was used as the outcome measure. The squared multiple correlation as a measure of goodness of fit suggested the superiority of the more parsimonious quadratic model over the triphasic linear model. Quantitative models more accurately reflect the profiles of change in AD and may prove more sensitive in measuring the effects of drugs on these patterns.",

Modern Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, and the advent of ubiquitous computing will further complicate matters. Away from the desktop, the time to select important articles might be even harder to find. Strategies to select relevant information are sorely needed.One such strategy is content-based filtering, coupled with User Profiles. Our prototype uses a Bayesian classifier to select articles of interest to a specific user, according to his profile. The articles are extracted from web pages and displayed in a zoomable interface-based browser on a PDA. Interests may change over time, making it important to keep the profile up to date. The system monitors the users' reading behaviors, from which it infers their interest in particular articles and updates the profile accordingly. Results show that, from the start, most articles are correctly classified. An initial profile opposite to the user's actual interests can be reversed in less than ten days, showing the robustness of our approach. A user's interest in an article is inferred with a high degree of accuracy (over 90%).",

METHODS: Sixty-four participants, aged 6 to 18 years, of both genders, were divided into two groups: the study group (SG), composed of 32 individuals with persistent developmental stuttering, and the control group (CG), composed of 32 fluent individuals. The procedures used were fluency assessment, stuttering severity instrument, and the Child Behavior Checklist inventory. RESULTS: In the behavioral profile of the SG, the mean of the total score and that of the internalizing problems were classified as clinical. The comparison between the groups showed differences in the behavioral profile concerning the total score, and in the internalizing and externalizing problems; and in the social profile, concerning the total score and activity scale. There were no statistically significant differences in the scales among the mild, moderate, and severe stuttering. CONCLUSION: According to the information provided by parents, children who stutter showed peculiar behavior and social competence, with a higher tendency to manifest alterations in this area, in comparison to those who do not stutter. Fear, nervousness/tension, guilt, anxiety, perfectionism, and worry were the most frequent alterations in relation to the behavior, whereas damages in the social field and in the habitual communication situations characterized the social competence of persons who stutter.",

We previously reported that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of PD showed an antinociceptive effect as measured by the tail-flick assay. However, its exact role in the regulation of antinociception in the various types of pain models has not yet been characterized. Thus, we attempted to find antinociceptive profiles of PD in various pain models. PD administered intraperitoneally (i.p.), i.c.v. or intrathecally (i.t.) showed antinociceptive effects in dose-dependent manners as measured by the tail-flick, writhing and formalin tests. In the tail-flick test, PD at the low doses reached the peak after 15 minutes and returned to the control level after 60 minutes. However, higher doses of PD showed a strong antinociception at least for 1 hour. PD administered i.t. showed stronger antinociception than that induced by i.c.v. administration PD in both tail-flick and writhing tests. In the formalin test, PD administered i.p., i.c.v. or i.t. showed antinociceptive effects during both the first (direct nociceptive stimulation) and second (late inflammatory) phases. Pretreatment with naltrexone i.p., i.c.v. or i.t. did not affect PD-induced inhibition of the tail-flick response. Our results suggest that PD shows a strong antinociceptive effect on the tail-flick, writhing and formalin tests, acting on central nervous system. However, PD-induced antinociception may not be mediated by the opioid receptors.",

We sought to distinguish lacunar from nonlacunar causes of SDIs using a gene expression profile.\\n\\nMETHODS: A total of 184 ischemic strokes were analyzed. Lacunar stroke was defined as a lacunar syndrome with infarction <15mm in a region supplied by penetrating arteries. RNA from blood was processed on whole genome microarrays. Genes differentially expressed between lacunar (n = 30) and nonlacunar strokes (n = 86) were identified (false discovery rate \u2264 0.05, fold change >|1.5|) and used to develop a prediction model. The model was evaluated by cross-validation and in a second test cohort (n = 36). The etiology of SDIs of unclear cause (SDIs \u2265 15mm or SDIs with potential embolic source) (n = 32) was predicted using the derived model.\\n\\nRESULTS: A 41-gene profile discriminated lacunar from nonlacunar stroke with >90% sensitivity and specificity. Of the 32 SDIs of unclear cause, 15 were predicted to be lacunar, and 17 were predicted to be nonlacunar. The identified profile represents differences in immune response between lacunar and nonlacunar stroke.\\n\\nINTERPRETATION: Profiles of differentially expressed genes can distinguish lacunar from nonlacunar stroke. SDIs of unclear cause were frequently predicted to be of nonlacunar etiology, suggesting that comprehensive workup of SDIs is important to identify potential cardioembolic and arterial causes. Further study is required to evaluate the gene profile in an independent cohort and determine the clinical and treatment implications of SDIs of predicted nonlacunar etiology.",

In this paper, a new approach for creating and recognizing automatically the behavior profile of a computer user is presented. In this case, a computer user behavior is represented as the sequence of the commands (s)he types during her/his work. This sequence is transformed into a distribution of relevant subsequences of commands in order to find out a profile that defines its behavior. Also, because a user profile is not necessarily fixed but rather it evolves/changes, we propose an evolving method to keep up to date the created profiles using an Evolving Systems approach. In this paper we combine the evolving classifier with a trie-based user profiling to obtain a powerful self-learning on-line scheme. We also develop further the recursive formula of the potential of a data point to become a cluster center using cosine distance, which is provided in the Appendix. The novel approach proposed in this paper can be applicable to any problem of dynamic/evolving user behavior modeling where it can be represented as a sequence of actions or events. It has been evaluated on several real data streams.",

Based on the first four digits of the postal code of the screenees, the data are stratified according to urbanization. Urb 1 corresponds to (semi)rural, which includes villages and small townships with less than 20,000 inhabitants; Urb 2, to towns with between 20,000 and 250,000 inhabitants; and Urb 3, to big cities, in this case, The Hague. From the postal code data of the screenees, the urbanization profiles of the laboratories can be calculated. The urbanization degree proved to have a substantial effect on the cytologic scores in the four laboratories. The number of expected, urbanization-weighted patient cases is calculated. Accordingly, the laboratories could be compared with respect to performance. We conclude that laboratories in our screening program were quite similar in performance for the cytologic diagnosis leading to referral to the hospital, with little difference between the actual and the expected, urbanization-weighted number of cases. It is evident that the equation for calculating the expected scores for S5-S9 is relevant for control of quality of care provided by laboratories and regions, but also for the quality of these assessments.",

However, not many studies have been conducted with regards to the application of teledermatology in India. Aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical profiles of cases referred for teledermatology consultation at our center, and to assess and compare the different modalities of teledermatology consultations done at our center along with the practical issues related to such a service.\\n\\nMETHODS: A retrospective study of teledermatology consultations at our center over a 3-year period was carried out. Store-and-forward (SAF), realtime consults (RTC), and hybrid (combining the two) were included.Two trained dermatologists were involved in carrying out the consultations in the referral center.\\n\\nRESULTS: Of the 120 consultations, 68 male and 52 female patients in the age range of 2-77 years were seen. In more than 90% of the cases, teleconsultation was the first contact for the patient with the dermatologist (for the present condition). In 68% of the cases, the reference was for both diagnosis and management, while in the rest, the reference was mainly related to management issues (appropriate diagnosis having already been made). Certainity of diagnosis was maximum for hybrid, SAF, and RTC.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Teledermatology can prove valuable as a tool to provide healthcare in areas of shortage of specialists. A hybrid system combining SAF and RTC could be the ideal form of teledermatology consultations in the future. Many practical issues need to be addressed before the effectiveness of teledermatology in India can be fully recognized.",

However, it is also known that the systems under investigation are far from spherical symmetry and rather follow a triaxial mass distribution. In this study we present an estimator for the error introduced by spherically averaging an elliptical mass distribution. We systematically investigate the differences arising when using a triaxial density profile under the assumption of spherical symmetry. We show that the variance in the density can be as large as 50% in the outer parts of dark matter halos for extreme (but still credible) axis ratios of 0.55:0.67:1. The inner parts are less affected but still show a scatter at the 16% level for these prolate systems. For more moderate ellipticities, i.e. axis ratios of 0.73:0.87:1, the error is smaller but still as large as 10-20% depending on distance. We further provide a simple formula that allows to estimate this variance as a function of radius for arbitrary axis ratios. We conclude that highly prolate and/or oblate systems are better fit by analytical profiles that take into account the triaxial nature of cosmological objects.",

Children who score higher on Intellect/openness and Energy/extraversion are more likely to play chess while children who score higher on Agreeableness are less likely to be attracted to chess. Boys with higher scores on Agreeableness are less likely to take up chess than boys with lower scores. Considering that girls score higher on Agreeableness, this factor may provide one of the possible reasons why more boys are interested in chess.

Therefore, the purpose of this descriptive analysis was to look at the health profiles and interpersonal relationships of older women survivors of cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study of older women cancer survivors who represented a subset of respondents from a larger mailed study that surveyed long-term cancer survivors treated at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Focusing on breast cancer, the most common antecedent diagnosis, we compared survivors of breast cancer with age-matched survivors of other cancer types. RESULTS: We identified 213 survivors of breast cancer and compared them with 314 age-matched female survivors of other cancers as well as age-matched female representatives of the general population. Few distinctions were found between breast cancer survivors and survivors of other cancers in terms of health effects and both groups reported very good interpersonal relationships. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors report generally similar long-term outcomes with age-matched survivors of other cancers. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Information derived from breast cancer survivor studies may be broadly applicable to survivors of other cancers, at least in the older populations.",

        "abstract": "The lipidome of skeletal muscles is a worthwhile target of research, as it affects a multitude of biological functions, and is, in turn, affected by factors such as diet, physical activity, and development. We present two methods for the analysis of the main lipid classes in skeletal muscles of humans and other animals, that is, triacylglycerols and phospholipids. The methods differ in that the former concerns total phospholipids, while the latter concerns individual phospholipids. In both methods, lipids are extracted from muscle after the addition of internal standards, and they are separated by one-dimensional (1D) thin-layer chromatography (TLC). This is sufficient for the separation of triacylglycerols and total phospholipids. In the first method, the two classes are subsequently subjected to methanolysis to produce methyl esters of fatty acids (and, to a lesser extent, dimethyl acetals of fatty aldehydes derived from plasmalogens), which are analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). Quantitation is achieved on the basis of the internal standards. In the second method, 1D TLC is used for the analysis of triacylglycerols only, whereas individual phospholipids are separated by two-dimensional TLC. This results in the isolation of phosphatidyl choline, lysophosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidyl inositol, cardiolipin, and sphingomyelin. Methanolysis and subsequent analysis by GC results in the determination of the fatty acid and aldehyde profiles of the individual muscle phospholipids.",

        "abstract": "A review. Small, zwitterionic peptides (2-6 residues) are flexible mols. that occur in soln. as an ensemble of conformational forms in dynamic equil. They occur widely in Nature as components of the peptide pool produced by protein hydrolysis. Mol. modeling provides information on the conformations they adopt in aq. soln. Contrary to expectations, they exist in a limited range of conformational forms that arise from particular combinations of backbone torsions. From the computed energies of the conformers, those with similar conformations can be aggregated and a profile of the conformer population displayed using a 3D pseudo-Ramachandran plot. Several different generic peptide transporters have evolved with complementary substrate specificities in response to these varied conformational forms. Mol. recognition templates (MRTs) define the stereo-electronic features of particular conformations that det. peptide recognition and binding by these transporters. The binding and transport of any peptide correlates with the proportion of its conformers that occur in a particular MRT. Specific conformer binding appears generally to involve little or no ligand rearrangement, which minimises conformational entropy loss. Conformational anal. of peptide analogs, evaluation of their similarities to normal peptides and comparison of their conformer profiles with MRTs, allows ests. of their mol. recognition as putative bioactive ligands for such proteins; this is illustrated for a variety of pseudopeptides, isosteres and conformationally-constrained analogs. For peptide therapeutics, such as \u00ce\u00b2-lactam antibiotics, inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, antiviral and chemotherapeutic agents, this approach can be used to evaluate in silico virtual libraries of drug analogs to est. their potential for targeted delivery and oral availability.

Methods. All participants were assessed using the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS). Mean ADL ability and skill item calibrations were compared between the three diagnostic samples.\\n\\nFINDINGS: No clinically significant differences were found in mean ADL ability. The ADL process skill item \"Attends\" was more difficult for those with bipolar disorder mania than for those with bipolar disorder depression. This difference did not disrupt the measurement model.\\n\\nIMPLICATIONS: The findings fail to support the idea that valid predictions of skill performance can be made on the basis of psychiatric diagnosis. Thus, occupational performance must be assessed individually. The findings also provide solid evidence that valid measures of ADL ability are generated when persons with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia complete the AMPS. Intervention strategies are recommended to address limitations in the skill Attends among persons with bipolar disorder manic episode.",

        "abstract": "Empirical domestic energy demand data can be difficult to obtain, due to a combination of monitoring, data access/ownership and cost issues. As a result, it is quite common to see domestic energy assessments based on modelled energy consumption. When looking at quite specific metrics of energy consumption, such as minutely domestic electrical demands, the data that does exist tends to be for a relatively small number of homes. The methods presented here provide a starting point for extrapolating this information so that such data can be used to represent a much larger group of homes, and therefore have wider applications. While limitations still exist for the extent of this extrapolation, issues such as diversity of demand and occupancy variations can be accommodated within an appropriate statistical analysis. The method also demonstrates that, by using the synthesis method to characterise the patterns within a daily domestic demand pattern, informed estimations can be with regards to the type of activity being carried out within the dwelling. Synthesised aggregated datasets (representing a larger group of dwellings) are also compared to real demand profiles from substations, to investigate whether similar patterns are being observed.

Examination of the literature showed similar observations in a small number of older studies in insects; however, reading across multiple disciplines suggests that this is a wider issue that occurs across the Animalia and beyond. The current study shows that the 28S rRNA anomaly goes far beyond insects within the Arthropoda and is widespread within this phylum.

        "abstract": "To be successful in international competitions, judo athletes must achieve an excellent level of physical fitness and physical condition during training. This article reviews the physiological profiles of elite judo athletes from different sex, age and weight categories. Body fat is generally low for these athletes, except for the heavyweight competitors. In general, elite judo athletes presented higher upper body anaerobic power and capacity than non-elite athletes. Lower body dynamic strength seems to provide a distinction between elite and recreational judo players, but not high-level judo players competing for a spot on national teams. Even maximal isometric strength is not a discriminant variable among judo players. However, more studies focusing on isometric strength endurance are warranted. Although aerobic power and capacity are considered relevant to judo performance, the available data do not present differences among judo athletes from different competitive levels. Typical maximal oxygen uptake values are around 50-55\u2009mL/kg/min for male and 40-45\u2009mL/kg/min for female judo athletes. As for other variables, heavyweight competitors presented lower aerobic power values. The typical differences commonly observed between males and females in the general population are also seen in judo athletes when analysing anaerobic power and capacity, aerobic power, and maximal strength and power. However, further research is needed concerning the differences among the seven weight categories in which judo athletes compete.",

Besides the conventional discontinuous elution mode at present in particular the continuous simulated moving bed (SMB) process attracts increasing attention. Another continuous separation process is offered by the concept of annular chromatography (AC). However, this technique still waits for an industrial breakthrough. This is partly due to the restricted quality of the packing in the annulus. However, there is also a lack of accurate description of the development of the concentration profiles in the annulus. In particular, the contribution of band broadening in the circumferential direction was not evaluated in previous studies. In this paper a 2-D-formulation of the mass balance equations of the annular chromatograph is proposed. A numerical algorithm is developed to solve the coupled system of nonlinear convection diffusion equations in an iterative manner. The streamline diffusion method on an adaptively refined mesh is used to discretize the corresponding linear convection diffusion equations. Numerical tests show the robustness of the proposed algorithm over a large range of design parameters. Model and algorithm are used to perform parametric calculations to investigate the influence of several of the model parameters on typical performance criteria of the chromatographic separation process. Special attention is given to the influence of diffusion in the circumferential direction. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Their therapeutic efficacy depends on the formation of antibody complexes resulting in the elimination of a target molecule or the modulation of specific signalling pathways. The physiological effects of antibody therapeutics are known to depend on the structural characteristics of the antibody molecule, specifically on the glycosylation which is the result of posttranslational modifications. Hence, production of therapeutic antibodies with a defined and consistent glycoform profile is needed which still remains a considerable challenge to the biopharmaceutical industry. To provide an insight into the industries capability to control their manufacturing process and to provide antibodies of highest quality, we conducted a market surveillance study and compared major oligosaccharide profiles of a number of monoclonal antibody pharmaceuticals sampled on the Swiss market. Product lot-to-lot variability was found to be generally low, suggesting that a majority of manufacturers have implemented high quality standards in their production processes. However, proportions of G0, G1 and G2 core-fucosylated chains derived from different products varied considerably and showed a bias towards the immature agalactosidated G0 form. Interestingly, differences in glycosylation caused by the production cell type seem to be of less importance compared with process related parameters such as cell growth. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Standard sequence comparison methods use substitution matrices to find the alignment with the best sum of similarity scores between aligned residues. These similarity scores do not take the local sequence context into account. Here, we present an approach that derives context-specific amino acid similarities from short windows centered on each query sequence residue. Our results demonstrate that the sequence context contains much more information about the expected mutations than just the residue itself. By employing our context-specific similarities (CS-BLAST) in combination with NCBI BLAST, we increase the sensitivity more than 2-fold on a difficult benchmark set, without loss of speed. Alignment quality is likewise improved significantly. Furthermore, we demonstrate considerable improvements when applying this paradigm to sequence profiles: Two iterations of CSI-BLAST, our context-specific version of PSI-BLAST, are more sensitive than 5 iterations of PSI-BLAST. The paradigm for biological sequence comparison presented here is very general. It can replace substitution matrices in sequence- and profile-based alignment and search methods for both protein and nucleotide sequences.",

These 7 groups were examined by using a broad array of variables focusing on demographic, self-reported psychosocial, and physical/functional factors. There were 661 patients included from an interdisciplinary treatment program who had been given 1 physical pain diagnosis. Results revealed differences among the 7 groups with regard to self-reported physical/functional limitations. The headache group had less physical/functional impairment than most of the other groups. On the other hand, the lumbar, fibromyalgia, and lower extremity groups had the most physical/functional problems. On self-reported psychosocial measures, the fibromyalgia group had the most difficulties, and the lower extremity and lumbar groups had fewer problems in this area. Overall, though, besides the fibromyalgia group, there was a lack of differences among the other groups on the psychosocial measures. Perspective: Biopsychosocial profiles were examined for different pain diagnostic groups. Seven different pain groups were compared.

The sites of onset were the lower limb, face, trunk, upper limb, genital, hand, labia and scalp in the descending order of frequency. Koebner's phenomenon was observed in 12.74%, diabetes mellitus in 1.18%, leukotrichia in 9.2% and premature graying of hair in 23.11% patients. A family history of vitiligo was present in 21.93% of the patients. Significant increase ( P <0.002) in the LPO levels of the vitiliginous patients was observed compared to the controls. Conclusion: Vitiligo vulgaris was the most common form of the disease which constituted 52.36% of the patients followed by focal vitiligo (28.54%), segmental vitiligo (6.84), acrofacial (7.55%), mucosal (2.83%) and universal vitiligo (1.89%). Systemic oxidative stress may have a pathophysiological role in precipitating all clinical types of vitiligo in Vadodara vitiliginous patients. ",

        "abstract": "Electrowetting is becoming a more and more frequently used tool to manipulate liquids in various microfluidic applications. On the scale of the entire drop, the effect of electrowetting is to reduce the apparent contact angle of partially wetting conductive liquids upon application of an external voltage. Microscopically, however, strong electric fields in the vicinity of the three phase contact line give rise to local deformations of the drop surface. We determined the equilibrium surface profile using a combined numerical, analytical, and experimental approach. We find that the local contact angle in electrowetting is equal to Young's angle independent of the applied voltage. Only on the scale of the thickness of the insulator and beyond does the surface slope assume a value consistent with the voltage-dependent apparent contact angle. This behaviour is verified experimentally by determining equilibrium surface profiles for insulators of various thicknesses between 10 and 250 \u00b5m. Numerically and analytically, we find that the local surface curvature diverges algebraically upon approaching the contact line with an exponent \u22121<\u03bc<0. We discuss the relevance of the local surface properties for dynamic aspects of the contact line motion.",

Sixteen competitive front crawl swimmers (7 females, 9 males) performed 2 \u00d7 200 m, 2 \u00d7 400 m and 2 \u00d7 800 m tests, each test 7 days apart. All 100 m split (ST) and total times (TT) were recorded (additionally 50 m ST for the 200 m bouts). The PP of one RC within a maximum of 8 weeks before or after data acquisition was used for comparison. No difference was observed between test and retest for TT (p<0.16). Coefficients of variation (CV) for all ST during 800 m were between 0.9 and 1.8% (standard error of measurement (SEM)=0.6-2.1 s), except for the last 2 sections (CV=2.5% and 2.9%). During 400 m and 200 m, CV was below 1.7% for each section (SEM=0.4-1.7 s). Mean differences between test and retest ranged from 1.8 s (Cl: 0.1-3.4 s) in the 400 m bouts to 4.1 s (Cl: 1.3-9.5 s) for the 800 m races. Although section times were faster during all sections of RC compared to SC, PP was similar during both trials (p>0.22). However, swimmers were faster in each section during RC. In conclusion, PP seem stable, at least during the first three quarters of the race. Furthermore, simulated trials seem to be an acceptable model to analyse PP in competitive swimming.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: During GT development the urethral folds fuse to form an epithelial seam; subsequently, the epithelial seam disappears, resulting in the normal tubular urethra. Abnormalities in urethral seam formation and remodelling might explain hypospadias, and elucidating the molecular developmental mechanisms underlying normal penile development might provide the basis for understanding hypospadias. Total RNA was isolated from the genital tubercle at embryonic days E14, E15, E16, and E17. Together with reference RNA, sample RNA was labelled with Cy-3 and Cy-5 respectively and hybridized to a 16 000-mouse gene array that included the Incyte GEM2.1 and NIA 7k sets. Candidate genes were analysed by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Using cDNA microarrays, we identified the up-regulation of genes involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and Wnt-Frizzled pathways, and of thrombospondin (TSP) 4, a member of a cell-migration molecule family, all candidates for involvement in urethral tube formation. Immunohistochemistry showed TGFbeta1, TGFbeta receptor III, and Frizzled1 were expressed exclusively in E14-E17 urethral epithelium. TSP4 was expressed in the mesenchymal basal layer underlying E17 GT skin epidermis. CONCLUSIONS: Many signalling pathways are involved in late GT development, and cell migration molecules might have an important role in urethral tube formation.",

Methods: A web-based survey describing 5 LVAD candidate scenarios (table 1) was sent to VAD cardiologists, surgeons, coordinators, and physician extenders via email (n= 772) and ISHLT web link. Frequency of INTERMACS profile assignment for each scenario was recorded. Results: There were 231 survey respondents with 91% (n= 209) from North America. Respondents included 132 (64%) cardiologists, 31 (15%) surgeons, 34 (16%) physician extenders, and 19 (9%) VAD coordinators. The mechanism of institutional INTERMACS profile assignment was variable: 26% (53) assigned by cardiologists, 24% by surgeons, 17% by either surgeon or cardiologist, 9% by VAD coordinators, and the remaining by a mixture of individuals. Only 23% of centers routinely discussed INTERMACS profile assignment to generate care team consensus. Profile assignment based on patient scenarios was also heterogeneous, especially for contiguous INTERMACS categories (table 1). Conclusion: Substantial heterogeneity exits in the process and assignment of INTERMACS Profiles. This heterogeneity could impact mortality estimates used for risk stratification, especially in those on temporary circulatory support (TCS). This suggests a need for educational strategies to promote more uniformity of INTERMACS Profile assignments and studies examining acccuracy of INTERMACS Profile assignment in TCS patients.

The way in which the initially three-dimensional motions transition to the characteristic (and Re- and F-independent) late wakes (where vertical velocities, w<<u,v) is both of great practical interest, and complex, hence somewhat unclear. Here, digital particle imaging velocimetry type measurements on towed-sphere wakes are described, so that the development of anisotropy can be measured by the time development of turbulence profiles in horizontal and vertical centerplanes. The observed anisotropies can be associated with energy transfer to internal wave modes, and suppression of other vertical displacements, that contrasts with sphere wakes at similar Re in a homogeneous fluid. Maximum Reynolds stresses occur at the boundary of a sinuous undulation of the wake, which increases in amplitude up to Nt~60 (N is the buoyancy frequency that characterizes the strength of the stratification). Although an intrinsic wake profile instability cannot be excluded, the observed wake element spacings can be accounted for by known spiral and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in the near wake.",

Feedback was given with video recording in the control, whereas in the experimental group, an additional ECG feedback was provided. Speech performance was evaluated by the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) speech ability test, which determines the 10 different speaking categories. ECG was recorded during rest and speech, together with a video recording of the speech performance. Changes in R-R intervals were used to reflect anxiety profiles. Three trials were performed for 3-week program. Results showed that the subjects with ECG feedback revealed a significant improvement in speech performance and anxiety states, which compared to those in the control group.

The climatology consists of monthly average ozone profiles for 10\ufffd latitude zones covering altitudes from 0 to 60 km (in Z* pressure altitude coordinates). The climatology was formed by combining data from Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II; 1988&#8211;2001) or Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS; 1991&#8211;1999) with data from balloon sondes (1988&#8211;2002). Ozone below 10 km is based on balloon sondes, whereas ozone at 19 km and above is based on SAGE II measurements. When SAGE data are not available (at high latitudes), MLS data are used. The ozone climatology in the southern hemisphere and tropics has been greatly improved in recent years by the addition of a large number of balloon sonde measurements made under the Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesondes program. The new climatology better represents the seasonal behavior of ozone in the troposphere, including the known hemispheric asymmetry, and in the upper stratosphere. A modification of this climatology was used for the TOMS version 8 retrieval that includes total ozone dependence, which is important in the lower stratosphere. Comparisons of TOMS ozone with ground stations show improved accuracy over previous TOMS retrievals due in part to the new climatology.",

To determine whether core hypothermia might contribute to the repetitive long-duration dives of the northern elephant seal Mirounga angustirostris, blood temperature profiles were obtained in translocated juvenile elephant seals equipped with a thermistor and backpack recorder. Representative temperature (the y-intercept of the mean temperature vs. dive duration relationship) was 37.2 degrees C +/- 0.6 degrees C (n=3 seals) in the extradural vein, 38.1 degrees C +/- 0.7 degrees C (n = 4 seals) in the hepatic sinus, and 38.8 degrees +/- 1.6 degrees C (n = 6 deals) in the aorta. Mean temperature was significantly though weakly negatively related to dive duration in all but one seal. Mean venous temperatures of all dives of individual seals ranged between 36 degrees and 38 degrees C, while mean arterial temperatures ranged between 35 degrees and 39 degrees C. Transient decreases in venous and arterial temperatures to as low as 30 degrees -33 degrees C occurred in some dives >30 min (0.1% of dives in the study). The lack of significant core hypothermia during routine dives (10-30 min) and only a weak negative correlation of mean temperature with dive duration do not support the hypothesis that a cold-induced Q(10) effect contributes to metabolic suppression of central tissues during dives. The wide range of arterial temperatures while diving and the transient declines in temperature during long dives suggest that alterations in blood flow patterns and peripheral heat loss contribute to thermoregulation during diving.",

In 1961, Emery proposed a simple method of beach profiling based on the use of two graduated rods, whose alignment and reading of the intersection with the horizon allow for the determination of differences in level along the profile. In spite of some shortcomings, and because of its simplicity and low cost, researchers and volunteers alike use the \u2018\u2018Emery method\u2019\u2019 in monitoring studies of sand dunes and beaches, mainly in the USA. Modern techniques in current usage are expensive and require specialized technicians. An alternative method is presented, based on the physical principle of communicating vessels, that consists of the sequential measurement of differential elevation as read on two graduated rods connected by a hose filled with water. In terms of accuracy, this method compares favorably with standard topographic instruments, having significantly lower costs, higher portability, and greater ease of use and constitutes a valid alternative to the Emery method. It is faster, because the distance between the rods is adjustable to the shape of the beach and to the amount of detail required; does not need a visible horizon, allowing its use in lakes and in situations of limited visibility caused by beach relief or weather conditions; and requires no correction for the Earth\u2019s curvature.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four trainees attended a 2-h lecture, followed by a 15-min demonstration on a volunteer and a 30-min hands-on workshop in a small group setting. Then, they underwent hands-on practice on 50 participants without supervision. The skill acquisitions in terms of signal magnitude, signal quality, and measurement time of the trainees were evaluated through 50 assessments, and were compared with that of a trainer with extensive experience on the use of an ultrasonic cardiac output monitor acting as a 'gold standard'. The learning profile for each individual trainee was analyzed using the cumulative sum graphical method. RESULTS: Four trainees performed ultrasonic cardiac output monitor on 50 participants. All trainees attained proficiency after 18-36 assessments to achieve aortic signal magnitude and quality comparable with the trainer. It requires a minimum of nine assessments to obtain three aortic scans within 5 min with 95% success rates. Only half of the trainees achieved competence in pulmonary scans and the minimum number of assessments required was 36. A minimum of 22 assessments were required for three pulmonary scans within 10 min with 95% success rates. CONCLUSION: A substantial period of learning needs to be undertaken to achieve proficiency on the use of noninvasive transcutaneous Doppler ultrasound.

Conventional monotonic power function or exponential function expressions of beach profile do not correlate well with actual field conditions. An alternative approach, the cubic spline interpolation function, has problems with overfluctuation. The PWPIF expression is both a conceptual and practical beach profile geometric model with a higher degree of approximation to reality in that (i) it correctly expresses the undulated morphology (e.g., bar-trough); (ii) it copes well with the overfluctuation that the cubic spline interpolation curve sustains; (iii) it gives a more realistic representation of beach profiles without missing important morphological information contained in seemingly irregular variation appearances, as it makes full use of all the gathered topographical information in establishing its coefficients; and (iv) it represents a flexible and all-inclusive approach towards expressing multiple beach profile types. The PWPIF expression has been tested against 667 sets of beach profile data measured from actual field as well as laboratory conditions. As a spatial model, it can act as a more-realistic geometric framework in beach analysis, helping to characterise beach morphological elements (beach position, slope, and volume). Temporal analysis of profile changes also benefits from this geometric model.",

It is possible to construct phylogenetic trees, or related data structures, for specific gene families using a wide variety of tools and approaches. Phylogenetic profiling involves the comparison of this data to determine which families have correlated or coupled evolution. The underlying assumption is that in certain cases these couplings may allow us to infer that the two families are functionally related: that is their function in the cell is coupled. Although this technique can be applied to noncoding genes, it is more commonly used to assess the function of protein coding genes. Examples of proteins that are functionally related include subunits of protein complexes, or enzymes that perform consecutive steps along biochemical pathways. We hypothesize the deletion of one of the families from a genome would then indirectly affect the function of the other. Dozens of different implementations of the phylogenetic profiling technique have been developed over the past decade. These range from the first simple approaches that describe phylogenetic profiles as binary vectors to the most complex ones that attempt to model to the coevolution of protein families on a phylogenetic tree. We discuss a set of these implementations and present the software and databases that are available to perform phylogenetic profiling.",

The study includes experimental fatigue test data and analytical results, with a focus on the hot spot stress concentration factors (SCF\n                        hs). A welded aluminium rectangular hollow section T-joint forms the basis of the study covering numerical stress analysis (finite element analysis); 3-D laser profile scanning of the welds; experimental stress analysis (strain gauges); and fatigue testing. Finite element analysis was performed on both idealised and actual (scanned) weld geometries. Values of SCF\n                        hs were computed for three different load configurations and a comparison made of the effects of the idealised and scanned weld geometries. Differences ranging up to 17.5% were found from the variations in weld geometry alone. The dominant effect lay in the choice of standards-based guidance for calculating the hot spot stress - causing variations as high as 38%. An experimental programme of some 40 new fatigue tests was compared with tentative design guidance previously drawn from earlier test results. The published database for RHS joints in aluminium remains small and further expansion of the database would clearly be beneficial. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This study was undertaken to assess the profiles of AIH in Brunei Darussalam. METHODS: Nineteen patients with AIH treated at the hepatology clinic, RIPAS Hospital (up until December 2008) were reviewed. Demographic, laboratory, histologic, clinical, and therapeutic data of the patients were collected. RESULTS: The median age of the 19 patients at diagnosis was 52 years (range 33-70) with a male to female ratio of 1:3.75. All patients were diagnosed with type I AIH. The prevalence rate of the disease was 5.61/100 000 and was higher in the Chinese than in Malays and Indigenous people. Commonly seen presentations were abnormal liver function (52.6%), icteric hepatitis (36.8%), and decompensated liver disease (10.5%). Histologically advanced fibrosis was found in 47.4% and cirrhosis in 21.1% of the patients. Immune-mediated diseases were present in 36.8%. In a follow-up for 31 months (range 0.25-102), three patients died, 2 had progressive liver failure and 1 had lymphoma. Complete biochemical response was seen in 75% of the patients, partial response in 12.5%, and no response in 12.5%. HLA DRB1*03 (DR3) was detected in 18.2% of the patients and DRB1*04 (DR4) in 45.5%. There were significant associations between HLA Cw7 (P=0.038) and DQB1*04 (P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The data of the 19 patients were comparable to those reported in the literature. Most of the patients were found to have abnormal biochemistry. There were significant associations between HLA Cw7 and DQB1*04, but not between DRB1*03 (DR3) and DRB1*04 (DR4).",

        "abstract": "A new protein structure alignment procedure is described. An initial alignment is made by comparing a one-dimensional list of primary, secondary and tertiary structural features (profiles) of two proteins, without explicitly considering the three-dimensional geometry of the structures. The alignment is then iteratively refined in the second step, in which new alignments are found by three-dimensional superposition of the structures based on the current alignment. This new procedure is fast enough to do all-against-all structural comparisons routinely. The procedure sometimes finds an alignment that suggests an evolutionary relationship and which is not normally obtained if only geometry is considered. All pair-wise comparisons were made among 3539 protein structural domains that represent all known protein structures. The resulting 3539 z-scores were used to cluster the proteins. The number of main clusters increased continuously as the z-cutoff was raised, but the number of multiple-member clusters showed a maximum at z-cutoff values of 5.0 and 5.5. When a z-cutoff value of 5.0 was used, the total number of main clusters was 2043, of which only 336 clusters had more than one member.",

Derangements in tissue-specific epigenetic programming of foetal and placental tissues are a suggested underlying mechanism of which DNA methylation is best understood. DNA methylation has been mostly investigated in DNA from white blood cells. To improve baseline understanding of tissue-specific DNA methylation, we examined variation in DNA methylation profiles of the imprinted foetal growth genes IGF2 and H19 in three different tissues from the same newborn obtained at the same time.\\n\\nFINDINGS: We obtained DNA from umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (MNC; CD34+ and CD34-, n = 6), foetal side of the placenta (n = 5) and umbilical cord Wharton jelly (n = 5). DNA methylation of the IGF2 differentially methylated region (DMR) and H19 DMR was measured using quantitative mass spectrometry. Analysis of variance testing showed no statistical difference between total mean methylation of CD34+ and CD34- MNC. Further comparisons were made with the pooled total MNC fraction. Mean IGF2 DMR methylation of Wharton jelly was 1.3 times higher (P = 0.001) than mean methylation of the pooled MNC. Placental mean methylation was 0.8 times lower (P <0.001) and Wharton jelly 0.9 times lower (P <0.001) than the pooled MNC of H19 DMR.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The total MNC fraction is a rather homogeneous cell population for methylation studies of imprinted genes in umbilical cord blood white blood cells, but may not always reflect the methylation levels of IGF2 and H19 in other organs.",

Passing a direct current through five solenoids generated uniform magnetic field. The five solenoids were arranged elaborately to get larger uniform magnetic space than that generated by Helmholtz electromagnet coils. A sensitive optical measuring system, based on detection of light reflected by particles, was used to measure local voidage in both dense and dilute phases.Local voidage was measured as a function of superficial fluidizing air velocity, magnetic field intensity and the position in the bed. At a given magnetic field intensity and at the same position in the bed, the voidage was constant for a low air velocity range (in a fixed bed). The local voidage changed irregularly with increasing air velocity for an intermediate air velocity range (in a magnetically stabilized fluidized bed, MSFB). The local voidage changed linearly with increasing air velocity for a slightly high air velocity range (in a magnetized bubbling fluidized bed, MBFB). A general correlation was developed to predict the local solids fraction at the arbitrary position in the bed: (1-??)=(1-??)c+[(1-??)w-(1-??)c](r/R)B where (1-??), (1-??)c and (1-??)w represent the local solids fraction at arbitrary position in the bed, at the bed center and on the bed wall; and B, (1-??)c and (1-??)w are the function of air velocity, distance from the distributor and magnetic field intensity.

Character profiles (combinations of low and high scores in three character traits: Self-directedness, Cooperativeness, and Self-transcendence) of 439 Swedish adolescents were used to evaluate the linear and non-linear relationship between character traits and self-reported positive and negative affect. Linear analysis showed that all three character traits were associated to positive and negative affect. Non-linear analysis showed that Self-directedness was associated with high positive affect and low negative affect when Cooperativeness was high. No association of higher Cooperativeness with positive and negative affect was found. Higher Self-transcendence was associated with higher negative affect when both Self-directedness and Cooperativeness were high. Although, Self-directedness, Cooperativeness, and Self-transcendence are associated to adolescents' affective experience, these character traits are not associated to positive and negative affect in the same manner or linearly. Self-directedness's positive relationship to high positive affect and low negative affect was present only when Cooperativeness was high. In other words, an autonomous adolescent (i.e., high Self-directedness) might experience more positive and less negative emotions as long as she/he feels as an integral part of society (i.e., high Cooperativeness). \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The genetic basis of these neoplasms is poorly understood. However, they morphologically resemble mixed tumor of the salivary glands (also known as pleomorphic adenoma), a tumor characterized by deregulated expression of PLAG1 or HMGA2. To evaluate a possible genetic relationship between these soft tissue and salivary gland tumors, PLAG1 expression levels and the genomic status of PLAG1 and HMGA2 were investigated in five soft tissue myoepitheliomas and one pleomorphic adenoma. In addition, all tumors were cytogenetically investigated and whole genome DNA copy number imbalances were studied in five of them. The genetic profiles were heterogeneous and the only aberration common to all soft tissue myoepitheliomas was a minimally deleted region of 3.55 Mb in chromosome band 19p13. Recurrent deletion of CDKN2A suggests that inactivation of this tumor suppressor gene is pathogenetically important in a subset. Furthermore, PLAG1 rearrangement was found in a soft tissue tumor from a patient previously treated for a salivary pleomorphic adenoma, indicating either metastasis of the salivary gland lesion or that some soft tissue tumors develop through the same mechanisms as their salivary gland counterparts.",

Estimates from this model are compared with those obtained from the simpler two-phase approach of first clustering the DNA methylation data followed by associating exposure with disease subtype using logistic regression. The two models are fit to data from a study of colorectal adenomas and are compared in a simulation study. Depending on the analytic approach, we obtain different estimates of the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association of RBC folate and DNA methylation subtype in colorectal adenomas (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.08-1.26 from the extended finite mixture model; OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.15-1.28 from the two-phase approach; n = 58 case subjects). Although our results could be a chance occurrence due to fluctuations from small sample size, we did a simulation study using larger samples and found that differences between the two approaches emerge when there is noise in the cluster analysis. In the naive two-phase approach, the estimate of the OR is biased towards the null, and its SE is underestimated when there is error in the cluster assignment. Estimates from the extended mixture model are unbiased and have the correct SE estimate but may require larger sample sizes for convergence. Thus, when the clusters are not identified with certainty, the extended mixture model is preferred for valid estimation of the OR and CI.",

As recommender systems become more central to people's lives, we must start modeling the person, rather than the user.In this paper, we explore how we can build models of people outside of narrow application domains, by capturing the traces they leave on the Web, and inferring their everyday interests from this. In particular, for this work, we harvested 100,000 social network profiles, in which people describe themselves using a rich vocabulary of their passions and interests. By automatically analyzing patterns of correlation between various interests and cultural identities (e.g. ``Raver,'' ``Dog Lover,'' ``Intellectual''), we built InterestMap, a network-style view of the space of intercon-necting interests and identities. Through evaluation and discus-sion, we suggest that recommendations made in this network space are not only accurate, but also highly visually intelligible - each lone interest contextualized by the larger cultural milieu of the network in which it rests.",

There is growing evidence on the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in disease onset, including cancer. Environmental factors seem to induce changes in DNA methylation affecting human health. However, little is known about basal methylation levels in healthy people and about the correlation between environmental factors and different methylation profiles. We investigated the effect of seasonality on basal methylation by testing methylation levels in the long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) and in two cancer-related genes (RASSF1A and MGMT) of 88 healthy male heavy smokers involved in an Italian randomized study; at enrolment the subjects donated a blood sample collected in different months. Methylation analyses were performed by pyrosequencing. Mean methylation percentage was higher in spring and summer for the LINE1, RASSF1A and MGMT genes (68.26%, 2.35%, and 9.52% respectively) compared with autumn and winter (67.43%, 2.17%, and 8.60% respectively). In particular, LINE-1 was significantly hypomethylated (p = 0.04 or 0.05 depending on the CpG island involved) in autumn and winter compared with spring and summer. Seasonality seems to be a modifier of methylation levels and this observation should be taken into account in future analyses.",

However, theoretical models and numerical simulations can also result in a slower equator and faster poles when the overall rotation is slow. Aims: We study the critical rotational influence under which differential rotation flips from solar-like (fast equator, slow poles) to an anti-solar one (slow equator, fast poles). We also estimate the non-diffusive ($\\Lambda$-effect) and diffusive (turbulent viscosity) contributions to the Reynolds stress. Methods: We perform three-dimensional numerical simulations of mildly turbulent convection in spherical wedge geometry. We regulate the convective velocities by varying the amount of heat transported by thermal conduction, turbulent diffusion, and resolved convection. Results: Increasing the efficiency of resolved convection leads to a reduction of the rotational influence on the flow and a sharp transition from solar-like to anti-solar differential rotation for Coriolis numbers around 1.3. We confirm the recent finding of a large-scale flow bistability: contrasted with running the models from an initial condition with unprescribed differential rotation, the initialization of the model with certain kind of rotation profile sustains the solution over a wider parameter range. Conclusions: Our results may have implications for real stars that start their lives as rapid rotators implying solar-like rotation in the early main-sequence evolution. As they slow down, they might be able to retain solar-like rotation for lower Coriolis numbers, i.e. longer in time, before switching to anti-solar rotation. This could partially explain the puzzling findings of anti-solar rotation profiles for models in the solar parameter regime.",

A simple scaling relationship which reduced the stopping profiles onto a single universal curve for that studied material is proposed with only two fitting parameters instead of four parameters previously reported in the literature. This permits accurate profiles for low energy electrons in metals to be obtained in a simple way that does not require any recourse to Monte Carlo calculations in the generation of electron stopping profiles. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Ray tracing simulations of LED lighting systems typically use the smooth angular intensity profiles supplied by the LED manufacturer. However, measurements of a range of 5 min LEDs presented in this paper show bright regions in the LEDs' angular distributions. The intensity patterns and bright regions vary between different LEDs, even when the measured angle for 50% integrated light output (as measured using an integrating sphere) is similar. When non-diffuse or partially diffuse optical elements such as clear light guides are part of a lighting system design, this source profile unevenness is intensified, so that bright caustic rings are formed. We have performed lighting simulations using coloured LEDs coupled into a clear light guide, and compared the light output using smoothed LED profiles with that using actual measured profiles. The simulated light patterns projected from the end of a light guide onto a screen are compared with that obtained by experiment. It is shown that the uniqueness of individual LED beam patterns needs to be taken into account for simulation accuracy. This is particularly important when the lighting system combines the output from several LEDs. It is also shown to be crucial in optimising the amount and type of diffusion required for homogenising the light distribution.",

Although the analysis of profile data has been extensively studied in the literature, the challenges associated with monitoring and diagnosis of multiple functional profiles are yet to be well addressed because it is usually difficult to properly model the inter-relationship of multiple profiles. Motivated by a real-data application in semiconductor industries, we develop a new modelling and monitoring framework for Phase-I analysis of multiple profiles. The proposed framework incorporates the regression-adjustment technique into the functional principal component analysis. In this framework, the multiple profiles are treated as multivariate functional observations and their regression-adjusted residuals are used for monitoring. Simulation results show that the proposed method could describe the major structure of profile variation well and effectively find outlying profiles in a historical dataset due to sufficiently utilizing the information on between-profiles correlation.",

They are the IT governance structure, the processes put in place to make decisions, and the roles of participants involved in setting the interorganizational governance mechanisms. Observed profiles share a continuum where the Contractual profile is at one end, and the Consensual profile is at the other end. Some performance variations among the two profiles exist, yet both profiles contribute to successful interorganizational relationships. These profiles were uncovered from seven case studies conducted in Canadian organizations.

        "abstract": "Rosaceae fruit allergy is the most common food allergy in Europe in patients over 5 years of age. The two fruits most frequently involved are peach and apple. Different clinical phenotypes of peach allergy are observed across Europe in relation to different allergen sensitisation patterns to the peach allergens Pru p1 (Bet v 1 homologue), Pru p 3 (peach lipid transfer protein, LTP), and Pru p 4 (peach profilin). In areas rich in birch trees of Central and Northern Europe peach allergy is linked to birch pollinosis and apple allergy, and the major allergen involved is Pru p 1. These patients present mild oropharyngeal symptoms (oral allergy syndrome, OAS) upon peach ingestion. Profilin co-sensitisation is also found in a minority of patients, but the clinical presentation is similarly OAS. In contrast, in the Mediterranean areas free of birch trees peach allergy may result from a primary sensitisation to Pru p 3, or be linked to pollen allergy with sensitisation to pollen profilin and secondary to Pru p 4, or a combination of both. In patients monosensitised to Pru p 3 the phenotype is severe and the great majority experience systemic reactions including anaphylaxis. In subjects monosensitised to Pru p 4, peach allergy is linked to a pollen allergy, generally to grass pollen, and the phenotype is mild with OAS in all the patients. When sensitisation to Pru p 3 and Pru p 4 are combined systemic reactions are less frequently observed than in patients monosensitised to Pru p3, and OAS is more frequently reported. Sensitisation to Pru p 2, the thaumatin like protein in peach, may be found in combination with Pru p 3 and 4, but its clinical relevance has not yet been established. Peach allergy across Europe is an interesting model food allergy that illustrates how different allergen sensitisation profiles determine the clinical phenotypes of fruit allergy. The reason for the (almost) lack of sensitisation to Pru p 3 in Central and Northern Europe still remains unclear.",

Circulating miRNAs in the serum and plasma are remarkably stable and are suggested to have promise as noninvasive biomarkers for neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. We examined the serum expression profiles of neurologically relevant miRNAs in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple deficits in communication, social interaction and behavior.\\n\\nMETHODS: Total RNA, including miRNA, was extracted from the serum samples of 55 individuals with ASD and 55 age- and sex-matched control subjects, and the mature miRNAs were selectively converted into cDNA. Initially, the expression of 125 mature miRNAs was compared between pooled control and ASD samples. The differential expression of 14 miRNAs was further validated by SYBR Green quantitative PCR of individual samples. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of miRNAs. The target genes and pathways of miRNAs were predicted using DIANA mirPath software.\\n\\nRESULTS: Thirteen miRNAs were differentially expressed in ASD individuals compared to the controls. MiR-151a-3p, miR-181b-5p, miR-320a, miR-328, miR-433, miR-489, miR-572, and miR-663a were downregulated, while miR-101-3p, miR-106b-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-195-5p, and miR-19b-3p were upregulated. Five miRNAs showed good predictive power for distinguishing individuals with ASD. The target genes of these miRNAs were enriched in several crucial neurological pathways.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of serum miRNAs in ASD individuals. The results suggest that a set of serum miRNAs might serve as a possible noninvasive biomarker for ASD.",

We evaluated and compared the circulatory and ventilatory profiles during exercise in patients with COPD without PH, with moderate PH, and with severe PH.\\n\\nMETHODS: Forty-seven patients, GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease)stages II to IV, underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing and right-sided heart catheterization at rest and during exercise. Patients were divided into three groups based on mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) at rest: no PH (mPAP, < 25 mm Hg), moderate PH (mPAP, 25-39 mm Hg),and severe PH (mPAP, \u2265 40 mm Hg). Mixed venous oxygen saturation (S VO 2 ) was used for evaluating the circulatory reserve. Pa CO 2 and the calculated breathing reserve were used for evaluation of the ventilatory reserve.\\n\\nRESULTS: Patients without PH (n = 24) had an end-exercise S VO 2 of 48%\u00b1 9%, an increasing Pa CO 2 with exercise, and a breathing reserve of 22% \u00b1 20%. Patients with moderate PH (n = 14) had an exercise S VO 2 of 40% \u00b1 8%, an increasing Pa CO 2 , and a breathing reserve of 26% \u00b1 15%. Patients with severe PH (n =9) had a significantly lower end-exercise S VO 2 (30% \u00b1 6%), a breathing reserve of 37% \u00b1 11%, and an absence of Pa CO 2 accumulation.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Patients with severe PH showed an exhausted circulatory reserve at the end of exercise.A profile of circulatory reserve in combination with ventilatory impairments was found inpatients with COPD and moderate or no PH.

The aim of the present study was to describe the developmental characteristics of 129 1-4-year-old children (102 boys, 27 girls) referred for clinical assessment (mean age 2.9 years) due to suspicion of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) after community screening at Child Health Care centers. All children were clinically assessed at the Child Neuropsychiatry Clinic (CNC) in Gothenburg by a research team (neurodevelopmental examination, structured interviews and general cognitive and language examinations). Of the 129 children, 100 met diagnostic criteria for ASD (69 with autistic disorder, and 31 with atypical autism/pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified). The remaining 29 children had a variety of developmental disorders, most often attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), language disorder, borderline intellectual functioning, and intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) with (n=. 25) or without (n=. 4) autistic traits (AT). IDD was found in 36% of the 100 children with ASD, and in 4% of the 25 children with AT. Of the children with ASD, 56% had language disorder with no or just a few words at the initial assessment at the CNC, many of whom in combination with IDD. Hyperactivity was found in 37% of those with ASD and in 40% of those with AT. Epilepsy was found in 6% of the total group and in 7% of those with a diagnosis of ASD. Of the latter group 11% had a history of regression, while none of the AT cases had a similar background. When results were compared with a non-screened preschool ASD group of 208 children, referred for ASD intervention at a mean age of 3.4 years, very similar developmental profiles were seen. In conclusion, early community ASD screening appears to systematically identify those children who are in need of intervention and follow-up. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Design: Prospective observational cohort study. Methods: Concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF), interleukin (IL)-1 alpha (1??), 1 beta (1??), 6, 10, 12, and 13, interferon gamma (IFN-??), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-??), and chemokines: IL-8 (CXC); macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1??)

Spearman correlations between tear cytokines and severity of irritation symptoms and ocular surface signs were calculated. Results: Tear concentrations of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-?? were significantly higher in DTS with and without MGD and EGF was significantly reduced in the DTS without MGD group compared with the control group. MIP-1?? was greater in entire DTS and DTS without MGD groups than the control group and RANTES was greater in DTS with MGD than the control and DTS without MGD groups. IL-12 was significantly higher in the DTS with MGD than the DTS without MGD subgroup. Significant correlations were observed between IL-6 and irritation symptoms and between a number of cytokines and chemokines and clinical parameters. Conclusions: As predicted, patients with DTS have higher levels of inflammatory mediators in their tears that show correlation with clinical disease parameters. Furthermore, different tear cytokine/chemokine profiles were observed in DTS patients with and without MGD groups. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

This paper looks at the characteristics of individuals admitted to treatment for primary, secondary, or tertiary problems with club drugs such as ecstasy, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), ketamine, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), methamphetamine, and hallucinogens (e.g., LSD) in programs funded by the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse. Some 38,350 unduplicated records from 1988 through 2003 of persons admitted with problems with club drugs were compared against users of alcohol or other drugs. Club drug users were more impaired on five of six Addiction Severity Index (ASI) indices at admission and they were more likely to use multiple substances more often. They were more likely than users of alcohol or other drugs to complete treatment, but this varied by drug. At follow-up 90 days after discharge, club drug users continued to report more ASI problems. Profiles of these clients show that ecstasy use has spread beyond the club culture, as indicated by the changes in client demographics over time. GHB clients presented a mixed picture of severe problems at admission and good response to treatment. Hallucinogen clients were young and less likely to complete treatment, while Rohypnol users were on the Texas-Mexico border. The methamphetamine epidemic has resulted in increased admissions, and the proportion of \"Ice\" smokers has increased. However, methamphetamine clients were less likely to complete treatment and their higher level of problems at admission and follow-up are of concern. Of special note are the indications of co-occurring problems and the need for both mental health and substance dependence treatment for some clients.",

        "abstract": "Type I diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of insulin-producing \u03b2-cells in the pancreas. Although several islet cell autoantigens are known, the breadth and spectrum of autoantibody targets has not been fully explored. Here the luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) antibody profiling technology was used to study islet and other organ-specific autoantibody responses in parallel. Examination of an initial cohort of 93 controls and 50 T1D subjects revealed that 16% of the diabetic subjects showed anti-gastric ATPase autoantibodies which did not correlate with autoantibodies against GAD65, IA2, or IA2-\u03b2. A more detailed study of a second cohort with 18 potential autoantibody targets revealed marked heterogeneity in autoantibody responses against islet cell autoantigens including two polymorphic variants of ZnT8. A subset of T1D subjects exhibited autoantibodies against several organ-specific targets including gastric ATPase (11%), thyroid peroxidase (14%), and anti-IgA autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase (12%). Although a few T1D subjects showed autoantibodies against a lung-associated protein KCNRG (6%) and S100-\u03b2 (8%), no statistically significant autoantibodies were detected against several cytokines. Analysis of the overall autoantibody profiles using a heatmap revealed two major subgroups of approximately similar numbers, consisting of T1D subjects with and without organ-specific autoantibodies. Within the organ-specific subgroup, there was minimal overlap among anti-gastric ATPase, anti-thyroid peroxidase, and anti-transglutaminase seropositivity, and these autoantibodies did not correlate with islet cell autoantibodies. Examination of a third cohort, comprising prospectively collected longitudinal samples from high-risk individuals, revealed that anti-gastric ATPase autoantibodies were present in several individuals prior to detection of islet autoantibodies and before clinical onset of T1D. Taken together, these results suggest that autoantibody portraits derived from islet and organ-specific targets will likely be useful for enhancing the clinical management of T1D.",

        "abstract": "Connectivity-based parcellation using diffusion MRI has been extensively used to parcellate subcortical areas and the association cortex. Connectivity profiles are vital for connectivity-based parcellation. Two categories of connectivity profiles are generally utilized, including global connectivity profiles, in which the connectivity information is from the seed to the whole brain, and long connectivity profiles, in which the connectivity information is from the seed to other brain regions after excluding the seed. However, whether global or long connectivity profiles should be applied in parcellating the primary cortex utilizing connectivity-based parcellation is unclear. Many sources of evidence have indicated that the primary cerebral cortices are composed of structurally and functionally distinct subregions. Because the primary cerebral cortices are rich in local anatomic hierarchical connections and possess high degree of local functional connectivity profiles, we proposed that local connectivity profiles, that is the connectivity information within a seed region of interest, might be used for parcellating the primary cerebral cortices. In this study, the global, long, and local connectivity profiles were separately used to parcellate the bilateral M1, A1, S1, and V1. We found that results using the three profiles were all quite consistent with reported cytoarchitectonic evidence. More importantly, the results using local connectivity profiles showed less inter-subject variability than the results using the other two, a finding which suggests that local connectivity profiles are superior to global and long connectivity profiles for parcellating the primary cerebral cortices. This also implies that, depending on the characteristics of specific areas of the cerebral cortex, different connectivity profiles may need to be adopted to parcellate different areas.",

METHODOLOGY: Forty-eight human root canals with curvatures ranging between 25 and 45 degrees were instrumented by a standardized method to an apical ISO size 30 and 0.04 taper. They were obturated with vertically condensed gutta-percha. Retreatment was performed with the following techniques: K-Flexofiles with chloroform; Hedstrom files with chloroform; ProFiles 0.04 taper with chloroform; ProFiles 0.04 taper alone. The time for each method was measured. A microfocal macroradiographic technique was used to evaluate the amount of debris remaining within the root canals after the retreatment procedure. Roots were divided into apical, middle and coronal parts and scored on a scale of 0 (no debris) to 3 (> 50% of walls covered with debris) by trained observers on two separate occasions. RESULTS: The scores for debris remaining within root canals for K-Flexofiles with chloroform and ProFiles with chloroform were the lowest and not significantly different at all three levels of the roots examined (P > 0.05), and Hedstrom files with chloroform and ProFiles with chloroform were not significantly different in the apical part. In general, coronal parts were cleaner than apical parts. The difference in scores at the three levels between ProFiles with chloroform and ProFiles alone were each significant (P < 0.01).

CONCLUSION: The results indicated that ProFiles or hand files with chloroform produced similarly clean canals, but that ProFiles were faster.",

Methods: The current sample includes 12,578 high school students from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a nationally representative sample. Four profiles of risk behaviors (sexual activity, general alcohol use, binge-drinking, cigarette use, marijuana use, other illicit drug use, fighting, and suicide) were compared separately by gender for factors in four domains: psychosocial adjustment, daily activities, school, and family. Data were analyzed using ordinary least-squares regression with follow-up contrast statements and multinomial logit regression. Results: Results indicate that profiles are related to factors in the psychosocial adjustment, school, and family domains. Students in the lowest risk profiles reported consistently higher levels of protective factors and lower levels of vulnerability factors than students in any other profiles. Likewise, students in the highest risk profiles reported consistently lower levels of protective factors and higher levels of vulnerability factors than those in any other profiles. Students in profiles of risk distinguished by higher levels of suicidal thoughts and behaviors reported similar levels of vulnerability and protection as the highest risk profiles. Students in profiles consisting of sexually active, substance-using teens reported higher levels of protective factors and lower levels of vulnerability factors than both the highest risk profiles and the profiles distinguished by suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Conclusion: Program staff and policymakers should recognize that different profiles of risk behaviors are related to varying levels of vulnerability and protective factors which have potential implications for preventive interventions. ??

        "abstract": "To elucidate the structural features determining delta-opioid receptor properties of enkephalin analogues containing Cys(O2NH2) in position 2, a series of Cys2-containing derivatives were synthesized and tested for their effectiveness in depressing electrically evoked contractions of the mouse vas deferens (predominantly enkephalin-selective delta-opioid receptors) and the guinea-pig ileum (mu- and kappa-opioid receptors). The peptidase resistance of the compounds was also tested. The ratio IC50 in the guinea-pig ileum/IC50 in the mouse vas deferens, indicating selectivity for delta-opioid receptors, was high for Cys(O2NH2)2-containing analogues and especially for [Cys(O2NH2)2, Leu5]enkephalin, which was about seven times more selective than delta-opioid receptor selective ligand cyclic [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE). The dissociation constant (KA) and relative efficacy (e(rel)) of the compounds in the mouse-isolated vas deferens were determined using explicit formulae derived by fitting of the data points with two-parametric hyperbolic function. The obtained values for KA and e(rel) suggest that: (i) incorporation of Cys(O2NH2)2 in the molecule of [Leu5]enkephalin highly increases the efficacy and does not change significantly the affinity of the respective analogues to delta-opioid receptors; [Cys(O2NH2)2, Leu5]enkephalin has higher affinity than DPDPE, but is less resistant to enzyme degradation; the effect of this modification on the efficacy is decreased when methionine is in position 5; (ii) D-configuration of Cys(O2NH2)2-containing analogues increases their peptidase resistance, but reduces efficacy and affinity of the peptides towards delta-opioid receptors; (iii) the substitution of Cys(O2NH2) with Hcy(O2NH2) reduces the efficacy, affinity and potency of the respective analogues and maintains their sensitivity to endogenous peptidases; (iv) the substitution of the sulfonamide group with benzyl group in the molecule of Cys in position 2 decreases their efficacy and affinity toward delta-opioid receptors, but attaches resistance to enzyme degradation. The results obtained in this study allow: (i) to involve the receptor affinity and agonist efficacy as drug-design consideration for delta-opioid receptor properties of newly synthesized compounds and (ii) to characterize some of the structural features, which set the pattern for their opioid profiles.",

The objective of this study was to use noninvasive impedance cardiography (ICG) to evaluate hemodynamic characteristics of subjects with and without hypertension. Methods: A total of 19 healthy nonhypertensive and 136 hypertensive subjects were retrospectively evaluated. Hemodynamic parameters were measured with ICG and included CI, SVRI, total arterial compliance index (TACI), and thoracic fluid content (TFC); these were compared with subject type, blood pressure value, demographics, and medications. Results: The BP levels of healthy and hypertensive subjects were 117/71 and 154/90 mm Hg, respectively (P <. 0001). Subjects with prehypertension had a lower TACI (0.97 v 1.21, P <. 05) compared with those with a normal BP, ie, <120/80 mm Hg. Hypertensive subjects had significantly lower SI, CI, TACI, and TFC and significantly higher SVRI. Subjects with stage 2 hypertension had higher SVRI (4149 v 3418 dyne??sec2??cm-5??m 2, P <. 01) and lower TACI (0.61 v 0.53 mm Hg/mL/m2, P <. 05) than those with stage 1 hypertension. Compared with subjects with controlled hypertension, normal subjects had significantly lower SVRI (1996 v 2746 dyne??sec2??cm-5??m2, P <. 0001) and significantly higher CI (3.23 v 2.63 L/min/m2, P <. 001), SI (48.2 v 37.4 mL/m2, P <. 0001), TACI (1.08 v 0.85 mm Hg/mL/m2, P <. 01), and TFC (29.1 v 24.1/kOhm, P <. 0001). The parameters of TACI, SVRI, and CI demonstrated modest correlation (-0.75, 0.62, and -0.30), respectively, with SBP. In the 54 subjects with BP <140/90 mm Hg, SVRI values varied significantly, with 32 subjects (39.2%) with SVRI values in the high range (>2483 dyne??sec2??cm -5??m2). Conclusions: Hemodynamic parameters from ICG displayed significantly different hemodynamic profiles between hypertensive and nonhypertensive subjects. However, significant individual variation of hemodynamic status exists. Hemodynamic measurements with ICG characterize hemodynamic status and may be helpful in diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decision making in hypertensive subjects. ?? 2005 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.",

Personality profiles were then used to predict heavy drinking. Five profiles were identified: Reserved, Rigid, Confident, Ordinary, and Resilient. Compared to individuals in the Ordinary profile, those with Reserved and Resilient profiles were at increased risk of frequent heavy drinking. These findings suggest which comprehensive personality profiles may place individuals at risk for problematic alcohol-related outcomes.",

By exploiting correspondences induced by epipolar tangents on the profiles, a successful solution to motion estimation from profiles has been developed in the special case of circular motion. The main drawbacks of using circular motion alone, namely the difficulty in adding new views and part of the object always being invisible, can be overcome by incorporating arbitrary general views of the object and registering its new profiles with the set of profiles resulted from the circular motion. In this paper, we describe a complete and practical system for producing a three-dimensional (3-D) model from uncalibrated images of an arbitrary object using its profiles alone. Experimental results on various objects are presented, demonstrating the quality of the reconstructions using the estimated motion.",

The authors report on a procedure utilizing U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' computerized pharmacy records to efficiently construct comprehensive individual psychiatric resident prescription practice profiles. METHODS: Veterans Affairs information technology provided a methodology to efficiently construct individual and aggregate resident prescription profiles, including cost data. To demonstrate the utility of prescription profiles, individual and aggregate antipsychotic medication prescription profiles were constructed of nine residents working in a Veterans Affairs psychotic disorders clinic. RESULTS: Developing the individual and aggregate prescription profiles required only 5 hours. The profiles revealed that residents had a restricted range of experience prescribing antipsychotic medications, with some residents not having prescribed all five major atypical agents and the majority having prescribed a limited number of typical agents. The profiles highlighted cost differences among the atypical antipsychotic medications and between the typical and atypical antipsychotic medications. CONCLUSION: Prescription profiles facilitate resident education by enabling educators to determine the range of antipsychotic medications residents prescribe. A psychiatric residency program could utilize these prescription profiles to improve resident competency in practice based learning.",

The HRS CAMS includes information on types and amounts of activities. We used factor analysis and latent class analysis to identify activity profiles and regression analyses to assess antecedents and outcomes associated with activity profiles.\\n\\nRESULTS: We identified 5 activity profiles: Low Activity, Moderate Activity, High Activity, Working, and Physically Active. These profiles varied in amount and type of activities. Demographic and health factors were related to profiles. Activity profiles were subsequently associated with self-rated health and depression symptoms.Discussion.The use of a 5-level categorical activity profile variable may allow more complex analyses of activity that capture the \"whole person.\" There is clearly a vulnerable group of low-activity individuals as well as a High Activity group that may represent the \"active ageing\" vision.",

We compare different procedures to obtain a regional ground surface temperature history (GSTH) from an ensemble of borehole temperature depth profiles. We address in particular the question of selecting profiles that are not contaminated by non climatic surface perturbations and we compare the joint inversion of all the profiles with the average of individual inversions. Very few profiles of the Canadian data set meet the selection criteria (e. g. only 13 out of 73 profiles in Manitoba and Saskatchewan were retained). We show that the resolution and the stability of the inversion of selected profiles are much improved over those for a complete data set. When profiles have been selected, the average GSTH of individual inversions and the GSTH of the joint inversion are almost identical. This is not observed when the entire data set is inverted: the average of individual inversions is different from the joint inversion. We also show that the joint inversion of very noisy data sets does not improve the resolution but, on the contrary, causes strong instabilities in the inversion. When the profiles that are affected by noise can not be eliminated, averaging of the individual inversions yields the most stable result, but with very poor resolution.",

Extending this research, the present paper used a person-centered approach to determine whether subgroups with distinct adaptability profiles in terms of concern, control, curiosity and confidence can be identified. We also explored the relationship between the various adaptability profiles and adapting (career planning, career decision-making difficulties, career exploration, and occupational self-efficacy beliefs) and adaptivity (core self-evaluations and proactivity). Using latent profile analysis, we found distinct adaptability profiles among 350 German university students. Students with different profiles differed significantly in their levels of adapting. This finding was confirmed in a second study of 1226 students selected from the same population. In both samples, the adaptability profiles differed mainly in terms of their adaptability levels but not their shape. Moreover, in both samples, the students whose profiles indicated generally higher adaptability showed more adapting compared with the students whose profiles indicated generally lower adaptability. Study 2 also showed that students with higher-adaptability profiles showed significantly higher adaptivity. The results suggest that level effects dominate adaptability profiles, implying the existence of a general adaptability factor within university students that is meaningfully related to adapting and adaptivity.",

We hypothesized that isoform-level expression profiles can better discriminate non-oncogenic and cancer cells than gene-level expression profiles. METHODS: We analyzed 160 Affymetrix exon-array datasets, comprising cell-lines of non-oncogenic or oncogenic tissue origins. We obtained the transcript-level and gene-level expression estimates and used unsupervised and supervised clustering algorithms to study the profile similarity between the samples at both gene and isoform levels. RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering, based on isoform-level expressions, effectively grouped the non-oncogenic and oncogenic cell-lines with a virtually perfect homogeneity grouping rate (97.5%), regardless of the tissue origin of the cell-lines. However, at the gene-level, this rate was much lower and was 75% at best. Statistical analyses between cancer and non-oncogenic samples revealed the existence of numerous genes having differentially expressed isoforms, which otherwise were not significant at the gene-level. We also found that canonical pathways of protein ubiquitination, purine metabolism, and breast cancer regulation by stathmin1 were significantly enriched among genes that show differential expression at the isoform-level but not at gene-level. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, cancer cell-lines regardless of their tissue of origin can be effectively discriminated from non-cancer cell-lines at isoform-level, but not at gene-level. This study suggests the existence of an isoform signature, rather than a gene signature that can be used to identify cancer cells from normal cells.",

In this paper we discuss the psychocentric perspective on language representation and processing, which highlights the centrality of individual experience in psycholinguistic experimentation. We discuss applications to the investigation of lexical processing among multilinguals and explore the advantages of using high-density experiments with multilinguals. High density experiments are designed to co-index measures of lexical perception and production, as well as participant profiles. We discuss the challenges associated with the characterization of participant profiles and present a new data visualization technique, that we term Facial Profiles. This technique is based on Chernoff faces developed over 40 years ago. The Facial Profile technique seeks to overcome some of the challenges associated with the use of Chernoff faces, while maintaining the core insight that recoding multivariate data as facial features can engage the human face recognition system and thus enhance our ability to detect and interpret patterns within multivariate datasets. We demonstrate that Facial Profiles can code participant characteristics in lexical processing studies by recoding variables such as reading ability, speaking ability, and listening ability into iconically-related relative sizes of eye, mouth, and ear, respectively. The balance of ability in bilinguals can be captured by creating composite facial profiles or Janus Facial Profiles.

While many users sign in for personal purposes, it is not uncommon for professionals to connect over SNSs with clients, students, and patients.\\n\\nMETHODS: The present study used an experimental approach to examine how medical doctors' SNS profiles impacted potential patients' impressions of professionalism. Participants (N=250 students) were randomly assigned to view one of six Facebook profiles. Profiles were populated with 1) solely professional material, 2) personal material that was strictly healthy, or 3) personal material that included unhealthy behavior. Profiles portrayed a male or female physician resulting in a total of six experimental conditions. Medical professionalism was measured with the First Impressions of Medical Professionalism (FIMP) scale, specifically developed for this study.\\n\\nRESULTS: There was a large and statistically significant main effect for profile type, F(2, 250)=54.77, p<0.001, \u03b7p(2)=0.31. Post hoc tests indicated that personal profiles that contained healthy behavior were rated as most professional followed by profiles with strictly professional content. Personal unhealthy profiles were rated as least professional. Additionally, female profiles consistently received higher professionalism ratings across all three profile types [F(1, 250)=5.04, p=0.026, \u03b7p(2)=0.02].\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a physician's SNS profile affects a patient's perception of that physician's medical professionalism.

        "abstract": "Since 2 morphological forms (fertilized and unfertilized) of egg can be produced by Ascaris, infected humans can release in their faeces fertilized eggs only (FEO), unfertilized eggs only (UEO) or both fertilized and unfertilized eggs (FUE) (designated herein as the 3 different egg profiles). Epidemiologically, fertilized eggs are of significance as they enable effective transmission of the parasite. This study, for the first time, characterizes the Ascaris egg profiles in human faeces in an endemic region of China, explores possible host- and parasite-factors related to these profiles, and discusses the biological and epidemiological implications of the findings. The 3 egg profiles were recorded throughout the study period of 2 years, and the overall percentages of people with FEO, FUE and UEO profiles were approximately 41-47%, 32-42% and 17-21%, respectively. The overall number of unfertilized eggs for the entire population accounted for approximately 6-9% of all eggs excreted. The different Ascaris egg profiles showed no correlation to host gender, but they did relate to age and worm burden of the host and to the sex ratio and developmental status of the parasite. While an annual universal anthelmintic treatment resulted in some fluctuation in the values of individual egg profiles, the general features of these profiles remained similar throughout the study period. The findings of this study should have significant implications for understanding transmission patterns of Ascaris and for the implementation of control measures against ascariasis in endemic regions.",

Our ensembles include spatial degrees of freedom only, a microstate being a spherically symmetric matter density function. We provide an exact solution for the grand canonical partition functional, and show its equivalence to that of the microcanonical ensemble. We obtain analytically the mean profiles that correspond to an overwhelming majority of microstates. All such profiles have an infinitely deep potential well, with the singular isothermal sphere arising in the infinite temperature limit. Systems with virial radius larger than gravitational radius exhibit a localization of a finite fraction of the energy in the very center. The universal logarithmic inner slope of unity of the NFW haloes is predicted at any mass and energy if an upper bound is set to the maximal depth of the potential well. In this case, the statistically favored mean profiles compare well to the NFW profiles. For very massive haloes the agreement becomes exact.",

For carrying out this study we used data of a nationwide teacher survey (N\u200a=\u200a960) in the Netherlands. The data were collected by an online questionnaire. Through exploratory factor analyses the underlying structure of what is measured by this questionnaire was uncovered as consisting of five factors: Goal centeredness of assessment, Authentic nature of assessment, Perceived usefulness of assessment, Diversity of assessment problem format, and Allocated importance of assessing skills and knowledge. By using a latent class analysis four different assessment profiles of teachers were identified: Enthusiastic assessors, Mainstream assessors, Non-enthusiastic assessors, and Alternative assessors. The findings suggest that teachers with particular assessment profiles have qualitatively different assessment practices. The paper concludes with discussing theoretical implications of these assessment profiles and indications these profiles can offer both for designing material for professional development in classroom assessment and for evaluating changes in teachers' classroom assessment practice.",

We start the procedure using the scattering profiles for an unknown configuration of nanoparticles, either from physical experiments or numerical simulations conducted for different nanoparticles on surfaces. We apply the statistical technique of compound estimation to recover the derivatives of scattering profiles. The L(1) discrepancies with the corresponding curves from known configurations are used to identify the most plausible configuration of particles that could yield the \"experimental\" profiles. We conduct a simulation study to see how often the new procedure correctly recovers the agglomeration level for gold spherical nanoparticles on a thin gold film. The results suggest that first derivatives are much more effective for characterization than undifferentiated profiles and that M(33) is the most useful element for distinguishing among configurations. The proposed compound estimation technique is more effective than typical inverse analyses based on look-up tables and can be used effectively in nanoparticle characterization platforms.",

Participants were asked to report on a wide range of recollected anger episodes. By means of K-spectral centroid clustering, two prototypical shapes of anger intensity profiles were identified: early- and late-blooming episodes. Early-blooming episodes are relatively short and reach their peak immediately. These profiles are associated with low-importance events and adaptive regulation. Late-blooming episodes last longer and reach their peak (relatively) late in the episode. These profiles are related to high-importance events and maladaptive regulation. For both early- and late-blooming profiles, overall amplitude is positively associated with event importance and the use of maladaptive regulation strategies and negatively with the use of adaptive ones.",

This brings new opportunities to location-based services (LBS), especially when knowledge of users' movement behaviour (i.e., mobility profiles) can be extracted from such datasets. For instance, in social networks, friends can be recommended according to similarity scores between user mobility profiles. In this paper, we propose a new approach to construct users' mobility profiles and calculate the mobility similarities between users. We model mobility profiles as traces of places that users frequently visit and use frequent sequential pattern mining technologies to extract them. To compare users' mobility profiles, we first discuss the weakness of a similarity measurement in the literature and then propose our new measurement. We evaluate our work using a real-life dataset published by Microsoft Research Asia and the experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing works on different aspects.

        "abstract": "The temporal evolution of the density profiles at the interface of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a sedimenting suspension is experimentally investigated. It is found that the sand-glycerin density gradients within the interface change with time, and that the evolution of the gradients differs significantly, depending on the location: The density profiles become steeper in the regions where the suspension flows downwards, whereas the profiles become flatter in the regions where the fluid flows upwards. This observation shows that there is a motion of the sand grains relative to the carrier fluid and hence reveals the prevailing granular dynamics in the suspension interface. It shows a behavior of the suspension which is different from the behavior of a homogeneous Newtonian one-component fluid whose density profiles do not change in time. Another interesting result is that the slopes of the profiles differ already at the very beginning (t=0) of the evolution of the instability, indicating that the suspension might have self-structured prior to instability onset.",

        "abstract": "Determining gene functions from genomic sequences is a central goal of bioinformatics. Most purely computational approaches to this problem are based on the detection of genes with similar sequences. With the completion of fully sequenced genomes alternative approaches have become feasible. One such method is that of phylogenetic profiles. In this method a gene is described by its phylogenetic profile, i.e. a string that encodes the presence or absence of a homologous gene in other genomes. This string is then used to search for other genes with similar profiles. In this paper we briefly review the field as well as present an analysis on the performance of the method. We also discuss variations on this theme including inverse phylogenetic profiles and non-exact profiles using phylogenetic trees. In conclusion this indicates that phylogenetic profiles might be useful for some, but not all functional annotations. Functional annotation of genomes remains an important problem in genomics when no close homologs exist.",

An extensive quality control of the radial velocity data and the retrieved wind vectors has been applied. The quality and availability of the obtained wind profiles have been assessed by comparisons with collocated radiosonde observations and numerical weather prediction (NWP) data over a 9-month period. The comparisons reveal that the VVP methods perform better than the VAD methods, and that the simplest implementation of the VVP (VVP1) method performs the best of all. The availability fraction of VVP1 wind vectors is about 0.39 at ground level and drops below 0.16 at a 6-km altitude. The observation minus background statistics of the VVP1 wind profiles against the High Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM) NWP model are at least as good as those of the radiosonde profiles. This result clearly demonstrates the high quality of (quality controlled) weather radar wind profiles.",

Essentially all attempts to calculate the average  profiles of the individual modes have assumed that the modes occur  separately. We have presented evidence, however, that the modes occur  simultaneously. Therefore, we believe that ``mode-separated'' pulse  profiles that have been published to date reveal little about the  polarization properties of the individual modes. Calculating  mode-separated pulse profiles for superposed orthogonal modes is  complicated by the unknown polarization properties of the individual  modes. However, the simplest model of pulsar radio emission that can  explain the wide variety in the emission's polarization is one in which  the individual modes are completely polarized. We argue that the  orthogonal modes in PSR B0525+21 and PSR B2020+28 are highly polarized  and use our simple model to compute the average profiles of their  orthogonal modes. For both pulsars, the total intensity of the two mode  profiles resembles the overall pulse profile, and each profile is highly  linearly polarized.",

To investigate whether close relatedness and/or similar chemical profiles facilitate the co-occurrence of multiple T. collina colonies, we investigated aggressive behavior, genetic relatedness and cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles within and between colonies and nest aggregations. Although 17 out of 19 colonies within aggregations were largely unrelated, intraspecific aggression between different colonies was basically absent both within and among aggregations. This lack of aggression should favor social parasitism and hence the occurrence of unrelated individuals within a colony. However, low within-colony relatedness was found in only five out of 19 colonies where it may be explained by queen turnover or the occurrence of foreign workers. CHC profiles of colonies within and among aggregations were statistically different. However, many workers could chemically not be assigned to their maternal colony, indicating considerable overlap among colonies in odor profiles of workers. Moreover, odor profiles tended to be more similar within than among aggregations, although most colonies were unrelated. Thus, CHC profiles were a poor indicator of relatedness in T. collina. The lack of correlation between relatedness and chemical similarity in T. collina may be explained by the incorporation of resin-derived terpenes in their CHC profiles. The composition of these terpenes was highly similar among colonies, particularly within aggregations, hence potentially decreasing chemical distinctiveness and increasing behavioral tolerance.",

We analyze and discuss possible systematics that may change the observed shapes of the super profiles. After quantifying these effects and selecting a sub-sample of unaffected galaxies, we find that the super profiles are best described by a narrow and a broad Gaussian component, which are evidence of the presence of the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM). The velocity dispersion of the narrow component range from ~3.4 to ~8.6 km/s with an average of 6.5+/-1.5 km/s, whereas that of the broad component range from ~10.1 to ~24.3 km/s with an average of 16.8+/-4.3 km/s. We find that the super profile parameters correlate with star formation indicators such as metallicity, FUV-NUV colors and H_alpha luminosities. The flux ratio between the narrow and broad components tends to be highest for high metallicity, high star formation rate (SFR) galaxies. We show that the narrow component identified in the super profiles is associated with the presence of star formation, and possibly with molecular hydrogen.",

Since thousands of or tens of thousands of gene expression profiles are measured under only one hundred conditions, the profiles naturally show some similar patterns. Therefore, a preprocessing for systematically clustering the profiles is prerequisite to infer the relationship between the genes. For this purpose, a method for automatic determination of cluster boundaries is newly developed without any biological knowledge and any additional analyses. Then, the profiles for each cluster are analyzed by graphical Gaussian modeling to infer the relationship between the clusters. Thus, our system automatically provides a graph between clusters only by input the profile data. The performance of the present system is validated by 2467 profiles from yeast genes.

These unprecedented lifetime profiles (i.e., birth to death) were reconstructed with a 6-mo resolution for a wide range of analytes including cortisol (stress hormone), testosterone (developmental hormone), organic contaminants (e.g., pesticides and flame retardants), and mercury. Cortisol lifetime profiles revealed a doubling of cortisol levels over baseline. Testosterone profiles suggest this male blue whale reached sexual maturity at approximately 10 y of age, which corresponds well with and improves on previous estimates. Early periods of the reconstructed contaminant profiles for pesticides (such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes and chlordanes), polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers demonstrate significant maternal transfer occurred at 0-12 mo. The total lifetime organic contaminant burden measured between the earplug (sum of contaminants in laminae layers) and blubber samples from the same organism were similar. Total mercury profiles revealed reduced maternal transfer and two distinct pulse events compared with organic contaminants. The use of a whale earplug to reconstruct lifetime chemical profiles will allow for a more comprehensive examination of stress, development, and contaminant exposure, as well as improve the assessment of contaminant use/emission, environmental noise, ship traffic, and climate change on these important marine sentinels.",

        "abstract": "A microchamber, PTW Pinpoint 31006, was used to measure transverse beam profiles for an Elekta Gamma Knife, Model B, and compared with profiles measured with film dosimetry. The microchamber sensitive volume has a diameter of 2 mm, which is smaller than the gamma knife beams, and a length of 5 mm. The chamber was mounted in a custom cassette in a spherical plastic phantom, supplied by Elekta, and oriented in a sagittal plane with the 2-mm dimension at right angles to the transverse plane. The phantom was manually moved across the beam, using the gamma knife x-coordinate trunnions, to measure the profiles. Profiles were also measured with V-film placed in a cassette mounted in the spherical plastic phantom. The films were scanned with a Scanditronix film scanner and converted to dose with a density to dose calibration curve. The results were superimposed for comparison. The beam width at the 50% intensity was measured from the film profiles to give the dimensions of the beams in the orthagonal planes. The ion chamber measurements are compared with the film results for the transverse, x profiles. Good agreement between the film and ion chamber transverse profiles is observed.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Immigration from Asian countries to North America and Australia has resulted in more Asian patients treated by white orthodontists. Planning treatment for patients of different ethnicities can be a challenge. The aim of this study was to establish baseline data for the assessment of Asian-Chinese profiles from a white perspective. Methods: Two Asian-Chinese profile images, 1 male and 1 female, were modified to create 7 profiles for each gender. Each profile showed a distinct characteristic: bimaxillary protrusion, protrusive mandible, retrusive mandible, normal profile (Class I incisor with Class I skeletal pattern), retrusive maxilla, protrusive maxilla, and bimaxillary retrusion. The images were viewed and ranked by 142 white examiners in 3 cohorts: 31 orthodontists, 31 dental students, and 80 laypersons from a mixed multi-ethnic metropolitan community. The facial anatomy that played the most important role in their decision making was also noted. Collected data in the form of ranks were statistically analyzed by using repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: All examiners preferred the normal Class I or bimaxillary retrusive profiles in both sexes; the male profile ranked the least attractive was the protrusive mandible, and the female profiles ranked the least attractive were the protrusive mandible and the retrusive mandible. Orthodontists, dental students, and laypersons demonstrated similar trends in ranking the profiles. The preferred profiles diverged from bimaxillary protrusive and Class III profiles (maxillary retrusion and mandibular protrusion), which are the usual norms for ethnic Asian-Chinese. The upper lip, the lower lip, and the chin had the most emphasis when the examiners were ranking the profiles. This finding was also common in all 3 groups. Conclusions: This study demonstrated strong cohesive trends in establishing ideal facial esthetics of Asian-Chinese profiles evaluated by white persons in a multi-ethnic metropolitan community. ?? 2008 American Association of Orthodontists.",

These profiles are extracted from the complete evolution of progenitor stars, evolved through the main sequence and the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages, and from time-dependent element diffusion during white dwarf evolution. We discuss the importance of the initial-final mass relationship for the white dwarf carbon-oxygen composition. In particular, we find that the central oxygen abundance may be underestimated by about 15% if the white dwarf mass is assumed to be the hydrogen-free core mass before the first thermal pulse. We also discuss the importance for the chemical profiles expected in the outermost layers of ZZ Ceti stars of the computation of the thermally pulsing AGB phase and of the phase in which element diffusion is relevant. We find a strong dependence of the outer layer chemical stratification on the stellar mass. In particular, in the less massive models, the double-layered structure in the helium layer built up during the thermally pulsing AGB phase is not removed by diffusion by the time the ZZ Ceti stage is reached. Finally, we perform adiabatic pulsation calculations and discuss the implications of our new chemical profiles for the pulsational properties of ZZ Ceti stars. We find that the whole g-mode period spectrum and the mode-trapping properties of these pulsating white dwarfs as derived from our new chemical profiles are substantially different from those based on chemical profiles widely used in existing asteroseismological studies. Thus, we expect the asteroseismological models derived from our chemical profiles to be significantly different from those found thus far.",

        "abstract": "Research Findings: The aim of the present study was to examine classroom quality profiles of kindergarten classrooms using a person-centered approach and to analyze these patterns in regard to teacher and classroom characteristics. Observations of the domains of Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support were conducted in 49 Finnish kindergarten classrooms utilizing the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (R. C. Pianta, K. M. LaParo, & B. K. Hamre, 2008). In addition, questionnaire data on classroom and teacher characteristics, as well as Early Childhood Classroom Observation Measure (D. Stipek & P. Byler, 2004) observational ratings, were used in the analyses. Latent profiling analysis was utilized to identify different profiles of classroom quality. Four latent profiles of classroom quality were identified that differed from one another most clearly in the domain of Emotional Support. Profile 1 represented a generally high level and Profile 4 a generally low level of classroom quality compared to the other profiles, whereas the medium-quality Profiles 2 and 3 showed varying levels of support in the assessed dimensions of quality. Only a few differences emerged among the profiles in classroom and teacher characteristics: The teachers in Profile 4 provided the least literacy instruction and had the least amount of work experience of all of the teachers. The findings using the Early Childhood Classroom Observation Measure indicated that child-centered practices were predominant among the profiles of higher classroom quality. Practice or Policy: The results of this study can be used to recognize kindergarten teachers' professional strengths and weaknesses and to support teachers' professional development with the aid of pedagogical interventions.

However, data from longitudinal data are limited. This study examined 17-year changes in energy and macronutrient intake across eating occasions in the 1946 British birth cohort. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Data were obtained from the 1946 British birth cohort. Cohort members completed 5d-estimated diaries at ages 36 (1982), 43 (1989) and 53 years (1999). Data from subjects who provided dietary data at all three time points were analysed (n = 1253). Repeated-measures analysis of variance with post hoc Bonferroni's adjustment was used to examine changes in energy and macronutrient at breakfast, mid-morning, lunch, mid-afternoon, evening and extra meal slots between 1982 and 1999. Analyses were stratified by sex and social class. RESULTS: The proportion of energy and macronutrients consumed at lunch declined between 1982 and 1999, which was compensated by a greater intake in the mid-afternoon and evening. This trend was seen across sex and social class, although women and adults with a non-manual occupation reported greater energy, carbohydrate and non-starch polysaccharide intake at breakfast in 1982 and had a higher protein intake in the evening compared with men and adults with a manual occupation. CONCLUSIONS: The timing of energy and nutrient intake has shifted slightly over time, with a greater proportion of intake later in the day. The association between the observed sex and occupational social class differences in eating profiles and chronic disease warrants investigation.",

Cytokine/chemokine levels were compared between these two groups and within LS patients, focusing on validated clinical outcome measures of disease activity and damage in LS.\\n\\nRESULTS: Plasma levels of IP-10, MCP-1, IL-17a, IL-12p70, GM-CSF, PDGF-bb, IFN-\u03b12, and IFN-\u03b3 were significantly higher in LS subjects compared to healthy controls. Analysis within the LS group demonstrated IP-10, TNF-\u03b1, and GM-CSF correlated with clinical measures of disease activity. Several cytokines/chemokines correlated with anti-histone antibody, while only a few correlated with positive ANA and single-stranded DNA antibody.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This is the first time that multiple cytokines and chemokines have been examined simultaneously in LS. In general, a TH1 (IFN-\u03b3) and TH17 (IL-17a) predominance was demonstrated in LS compared to healthy controls. There is also an IFN-\u03b3 signature with elevated IP-10, MCP-1, and IFN-\u03b3, which has been previously demonstrated in systemic sclerosis, suggesting a shared pathophysiology. Within the LS patients, those with active disease demonstrated IP-10, TNF-\u03b1, and GM-CSF, which may potentially serve as biomarkers of disease activity in the clinical setting.",

Experiments were performed to examine the effect of entrance shapes on the critical submergence. Seven entrance shapes were devised and tested, including a square-edged, a bell-mouthed, three symmetrical conical and two conical profiles with eccentricity. The focus of the study was on a range of Froude numbers from 0.25 to 0.65. The square-edged shape appeared to show the highest local head-loss compared to other shapes. Steady counter-clockwise vortices characterize all the intake profiles except in a narrow water tank. The experiments show both discrepancy and similarity between the intake profiles. The critical submergence of the bell-mouthed intake is lower when compared to the square-edged shape. For the other profiles, it is proportional to the Froude number. A closer sidewall may lead to larger critical submergence in the case of weak circulations. The results demonstrate that the intake-entrance profile has an important effect on the critical submergence.",

For the case of common milling tools such as fillet-end, ball-end and flat-end, which are derived from the generalized cutter definition, the swept profiles are also formulated. Considering the complexity of five-axis tool motions, an analysis of the solutions and a determination of special cases are necessary to effectively enhance the robustness of the derived formulations and the proposed algorithms.

The valence profiles for both samples measured at low temperature are above the high-temperature ones at momentum pz\u2248pF, the Fermi momentum, and below at pz=0a.u., which corresponds to a narrowing of the valence Compton profiles with increasing temperature. This fundamental temperature dependence can be attributed to the variation of the lattice constant and thus the variation of the Fermi momentum with temperature when the experimental results are compared with jellium calculations of the valence Compton profiles utilizing a correlation corrected occupation number density. In addition the Li experiment shows a significant temperature dependence even for pz>pF, which is assigned to the diminished contribution of higher momentum components to the valence Compton profile with increasing temperature. The Li results are in good agreement with calculations using an empirical temperature-dependent local pseudopotential.",

Their main function is in billing of consumers who have deviated from their contracted schedules. Moreover, a simple and straightforward method for assigning a TLP to a particular eligible consumer also needs to be established. In this paper, a methodology for allocating consumers' load profiles using probabilistic neural network (PNN) is presented.

To achieve this goal we conduct two complementary analyses focused on the metabolic response to stress. First, we investigate the general size of any relationship between metabolic network gene expression and metabolite profiles. We find that strongly correlated transcript-metabolite profiles are sustained over surprisingly long network distances away from any target metabolite. Secondly, we employ a novel pathway mining method to investigate the structure of this transcript-metabolite relationship. The objective of this method is to identify a minimum set of metabolites which are the target of significantly correlated gene expression pathways. The results reveal that in general, a global regulation signature targeting a small number of metabolites is responsible for a large scale metabolic response.

        "abstract": "This study analyzes sexual-preference profiles in a sample of 420 sexual aggressors who exhibited a valid profile during their initial phallometric assessment. The sexual stimuli used in the process were audiotapes describing sexual-offending scenarios. Two types of sexual stimuli sets were used: one developed for sexual aggressors against women and a second developed for sexual aggressors against children. Penile responses were recorded during stimulus presentation using a mercury-in-rubber strain gauge. Classification analyses (hierarchical and K-means clustering combination) were conducted separately for three groups of sexual aggressors: (a) sexual aggressors against children (n = 253), (b) sexual aggressors against women (n = 138), and (c) mixed sexual aggressors (n = 29). The sexual aggressors against children exhibited four penile-response profiles, the sexual aggressors against women two penile-response profiles, and the mixed sexual aggressors only one penile-response profile. In addition, analyses carried out on randomly split subsamples established that the generated profiles for sexual aggressors against children and sexual aggressors against women were stable.",

The issue is that in practice semantics of profiles are mainly specified in prose. In this form it cannot be processed by tools enabling model execution. Although latest developments advocate for a standard way to formalize semantics of profiles, no such approach could be found in the literature. This paper addresses this issue with a systematic approach based on fUML to formalize the execution semantics of UML profiles. This approach is validated by formalizing the execution semantics of a subset of the MARTE profile. The proposal is compatible with any tool implementing UML and clearly identifies the mapping between stereotypes and semantic definitions.",

There exist UML profiles for modeling the logical design of SQL databases. The profiles allow developers to create model elements that correspond to SQL language elements. In case of many integrity constraints, developers have to manually specify the implementation of the constraint in a model. It complicates the creation of the models and the use of the models to generate final code that does not need elaboration. In this paper, we propose to extend UML SQL database design profiles with stereotypes that correspond to domain-independent database design patterns about integrity constraints to raise the abstraction level of models and facilitate generation of code that implements integrity constraints. We also present the results of an experiment about extending a UML SQL database design profile. \u00a9 2012 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.",

Two studies explored how the three components combine to create distinct \"profiles\" of commitment and the implications of different profiles. In Study 1, six clusters were identified using k-means cluster analysis. These were labeled as the Highly committed, Non-committed, Neutral, Affective dominant, Continuance dominant and the Affective-Normative dominant profiles. Analysis of variance results indicated that the Highly committed, Affective-Normative dominant and the Affective dominant profiles demonstrated the most desirable job behaviors. The Non-committed profile showed the least desirable outcomes, followed by the Continuance dominant profile. Study 2 largely replicated these findings. The results suggest that affective commitment is the primary driver of positive outcomes, especially when combined with low levels of continuance commitment. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The As and B profiles before and after annealing were measured by secondary ion mass spectroscopy, the carrier profiles were evaluated by spreading resistance measurement, and some of the structures were observed by transmission electron microscopy. Arsenic atoms piled up at the top-Si/BOX interface in each SOI substrate. The amount piled-up depended strongly on the quality of the Si/BOX interface. No significant pile-up was observed at the interface in the B profiles; however, the height of the B subpeak near the depth of the end-of-range defects strongly depended on the SOI fabrication technique. It is proposed that the quality of the SOI crystal and the Si/BOX interface, which varied with the fabrication technique, affected the dopant profiles. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In applying a chemical biology approach to better understand the mechanism of eukaryotic protein synthesis, we used these resources to search for novel inhibitors of translation. The cytotoxicity profiles of 31 known protein synthesis inhibitors were used to identify compounds from the NCI database with similar activity profiles. Using this approach, two natural products, phyllanthoside and nagilactone C, were identified and characterized as novel protein synthesis inhibitors. Both compounds are specific for the eukaryotic translation apparatus, function in vivo and in vitro, and interfere with translation elongation.

Experiments were run showing that the underlying folding mechanism of sandwich profiles is very different from that of solid-section thin-walled structures. In particular, the shear behavior of the core material was found to strongly influence the mechanics of energy absorption. The analysis focuses on the crushing behavior of double-cell profiles that are made of soft-core hybrid stainless steel assembly (HSSA) sheets. Both material and structural tests were performed. It is demonstrated that the shear strength of the HSSA fiber core is small as compared to the face sheet properties. When subjected to bending, the core deformed in the shear mode, whereas the facings bent independently. Based on this mechanism, a new shear-folding model for sandwich profiles is derived, incorporating the \"shear crushing\" of the sandwich core material. Theoretical predictions of the mean crushing force based on the present model compared very well with the experimental data. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The main aim of this work is the experimental verification of the concentration and potential profiles predicted by the model. In this work two techniques for direct observation of spatial concentration and potential profiles in the electrolyte diode are presented. Two different methods were used: (i) visualization of the acid-base boundary using acid-base indicators and (ii) direct measurements of electric potential profiles using the array of microelectrodes. As the presence of an indicator changes the properties of the system, there is a good agreement between modelling and experimental results only at relatively low values of external potential difference. Results of the other method confirm the model predictions in broad range of external potential difference values. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Umkehr ozone profiles (quarter of Umkehr layer) from 1978 to 2011 are investigated at two locations: Boulder (USA) and Arosa (Switzerland). The study consists of two statistical stages. First we approximate ozone profiles employing an appropri- ate basis. To capture primary modes of ozone variations with- out losing essential information, a functional principal com- ponent analysis is performed. It penalizes roughness of the function and smooths excessive variations in the shape of the ozone profiles. As a result, data-driven basis functions (em- pirical basis functions) are obtained. The coefficients (prin- cipal component scores) corresponding to the empirical ba- sis functions represent dominant temporal evolution in the shape of ozone profiles. We use those time series coeffi- cients in the second statistical step to reveal the important sources of the patterns and variations in the profiles. We es- timate the effects of covariates \u2013 month, year (trend), quasi- biennial oscillation, the solar cycle, the Arctic oscillation, the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation cycle and the Eliassen\u2013Palm flux \u2013 on the principal component scores of ozone profiles using additive mixed effects models. The effects are repre- sented as smooth functions and the smooth functions are es- timated by penalized regression splines. We also impose a heteroscedastic error structure that reflects the observed sea- sonality in the errors. The more complex error structure en- ables us to provide more accurate estimates of influences and trends, together with enhanced uncertainty quantifica- tion. Also, we are able to capture fine variations in the time evolution of the profiles, such as the semi-annual oscillation. We conclude by showing the trends by altitude over Boulder and Arosa, as well as for total column ozone. There are great variations in the trends across altitudes, which highlights the benefits of modeling ozone profiles.",

This analogy provides an additional length scale-the vorticity thickness-upon which the profiles depend and a set of criteria that allows a reduction in the empiricism associated with earlier forms in the literature.

        "abstract": "[ 1] A mathematical model, based on the kinematic wave (KW) theory, is developed for describing the evolution and movement of bed profiles in alluvial channels. The model employs a functional relation between sediment transport rate and concentration, a relation between flow velocity and depth and Velikanov's formula relating suspended sediment concentration to flow variables. Laboratory flume and field data are used to test the model. Transient bed profiles in alluvial channels are also simulated for several hypothetical cases involving different water flow and sediment concentration characteristics. The model-simulated bed profiles are found to be in good agreement with what is observed in the laboratory, and they seem theoretically reasonable for hypothetical cases. The model results reveal that the mean particle velocity and maximum concentration ( maximum bed form elevation) strongly affect transient bed profiles.",

        "abstract": "In this brief, we evaluated phosphorus (P) and boron (B) ion implantation profiles in molybdenum (Mo) gates using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and showed that the P and B profiles have significant channeling tails. We expressed the SIMS profiles using an analytical model and established a corresponding database. We also studied the structure of the Mo layer using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The Mo layer had a polycrystalline structure with (110),(211),and (200) dominant orientations. The average grain size of the Mo layer was 53 nm, growing cylindrically from the SiO2/Mo interface to the Mo surface. Therefore, the significant channeling was due to the crystalline structure of as-deposited Mo gates. We also showed that this significant channeling of P and B could be suppressed by high tilt angle ion implantation or by using a multideposited Mo gate, and we proposed empirical models for the corresponding profiles.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the current study was to obtain information from students in higher education on different motivational profiles that resulted from the combination of three academic goals (i.e. learning goals (LG), performance-approach goals and performance-avoidance goals). Moreover, information related to the relevance of each goal within each motivational profile was explored to explain conditions closely related to the academic engagement. The sample consisted of 2556 students from five Spanish universities. Motivational profiles were obtained by using cluster analysis followed by a relevance analysis of each goal within each motivational profile. The results support the hypothesis concerning motivational profiles, and further suggest for motivational profiles with a predominance of LG to be more adaptive. According to our findings, high level of LG in one's motivational profile appear to be a powerful protective factor in maintaining high interest in academic work, as well as high control beliefs and self-efficacy. \u00a9 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

        "abstract": "The amplitudes and the excitation profiles of coherent resonant Raman scattering (coherent anti-Stokes and Stokes Raman scattering (CARS and CSRS)) by impurity centers in crystals and/or molecules in solutions are studied, taking into account the coherence of the excitedmode and the inhomogeneity of the environment. The CARS and CSRS excitation profiles can directly be related to one-photon absorption when using the transform theory known from spontaneous resonant Raman scattering. The enlargement of the amplitude of the active mode reveals itself in an enhancement of the vibrational overtones. At large amplitudes, a splitting in the profiles caused by the contribution of two turning points of a strong coherent vibration is observed. The inhomogeneous broadening is different in the excitation profiles of CARS and CSRS. The overlapping contributions to spectrally narrow and broad transitions lead to Fano peculiarities. The effects are illustrated by model calculations. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

This approach focuses on Ne altitude profiles from the height of the ionospheric Ne maximum to ???3000 km as deduced from ISIS (International Satellites for Ionospheric Studies) topside-sounder data. These data, obtained over a two-decade time interval, can be used to investigate secular changes in the topside Ne profiles, which reflect altitude changes in plasma temperature and ion composition, over more than a solar cycle. The approach is to determine the locations of mid-latitude O+/H+ transition altitudes deduced by fitting the topside Ne profiles to modeled H+ and O+ profiles using the base electron temperatures and constant temperature gradients as variables. ?? 2005 COSPAR.",
