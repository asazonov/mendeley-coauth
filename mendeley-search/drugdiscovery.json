        "abstract": "Chagas disease is an infectious disease with the highest impact in Latin America and a growing worldwide problem. Chagas disease is the result of long-term, persistent infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The current therapies for treating T. cruzi infection and thus preventing Chagas disease often have adverse effects, unpredictable efficacy and require long courses of treatment. Development of new therapies has been very limited, in part due to lack of interest but also as a result of poor support and inappropriate models for discovering and evaluating candidate drugs. The Chagas Drug Discovery Consortium (CDDC) was created with funding from the US National Institutes of Health to help address some of these issues. The goals of the CDDC are to discover and evaluate new candidate drugs and develop rigorous assays of drug efficacy. This report summarizes the second meeting of the CDDC in November 2010.",

The leading causes of irreversible blindness in the elderly--age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma--will continue to effect more individuals as the worldwide population continues to age. Although there are therapies for treating glaucoma, as well as ongoing clinical trials of treatments for age-related macular degeneration, there still is a great need for more efficacious treatments that halt or even reverse ocular diseases. The eye has special attributes that allow local drug delivery and non-invasive clinical assessment of disease, but it is also a highly complex and unique organ, which makes understanding disease pathogenesis and ocular drug discovery challenging. As we learn more about the cellular mechanisms involved in age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, potentially, new drug targets will emerge.

        "abstract": "This chapter presents a brief overview of how new drug discovery projects begin, some of the science and business decisions that go into them, what types of projects researchers can expect to see, and how targets are identified and validated. Projects tend to have some commonalities that allow most of them to be divided up into several bins, if the bins are made large enough.. The term target validation can mean different things to different people. To a chemist proposing a new project it might refer to affirmative evidence from a mouse knockout or even just an RNA interference experiment in cells. To a clinician it probably means no less than proven statistically significant efficacy by a drug in large-scale, controlled human trials. Target validation, that is, systematically building up evidence that the interaction of a proposed target with an agent like a small molecule or a monoclonal antibody (mAB) can have a therapeutic effect in a human disease state, is often far from trivial. It represents an ongoing, labor-intensive process that can be rate-limiting, but is necessary to avoid disastrous losses in time, money, and manpower that occur when a clinical drug fails to work because its target is not at all crucial to disease progression or symptoms. Target identification, in this case the process whereby a new target is first proposed based on some minimal evidence, is less cumbersome but still requires devoted resources. The beauty of working on a project based upon an already established target is that both of these steps can be skipped.",

Traditional tissue analysis in a slide-by-slide manner is slow, expensive and difficult to standardize. In addition, precious specimens, such as tissue samples from clinical studies, are usually exhausted after a few analyses.

We are in a new era of drug discovery. This review provides an overview of the current status of academic drug discovery groups, their achievements and the challenges they face, together with perspectives on ways to achieve improved outcomes. Academic groups have made important contributions to drug discovery, from its earliest days and continue to do so today. However, modern drug discovery and development is exceedingly complex, and has high failure rates, principally because human biol. is complex and poorly understood. Academic drug discovery groups need to play to their strengths and not just copy what has gone before. However, there are lessons to be learnt from the experiences of the industrial drug discoverers and four areas are highlighted for attention: i) increased validation of targets; ii) elimination of false hits from high throughput screening (HTS); iii) increasing the quality of mol. probes; and iv) investing in a high-quality informatics infrastructure.

The FDA has thus initiated the Critical Path Initiative project investigating better approaches. We review the current strategies in drug discovery and focus on the advantages of the maximum entropy method being introduced in this area. The maximum entropy principle is derived from statistical thermodynamics and has been demonstrated to be an inductive inference tool. We propose a unified method to drug discovery that hinges on robust information processing using entropic inductive inference. Increasingly, applications of maximum entropy in drug discovery employ this unified approach and demonstrate the usefulness of the concept in the area of pharmaceutical sciences.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Advances in genomics technologies are providing a very large amount of data on genome-wide gene expression profiles, protein molecules and their interactions with other macromolecules and metabolites. Molecular interaction networks provide a useful way to capture this complex data and comprehend it. Networks are beginning to be used in drug discovery, in many steps of the modern discovery pipeline, with large-scale molecular networks being particularly useful for the understanding of the molecular basis of the disease.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: The authors discuss network approaches used for drug target discovery and lead identification in the drug discovery pipeline. By reconstructing networks of targets, drugs and drug candidates as well as gene expression profiles under normal and disease conditions, the paper illustrates how it is possible to find relationships between different diseases, find biomarkers, explore drug repurposing and study emergence of drug resistance. Furthermore, the authors also look at networks which address particular important aspects such as off-target effects, combination-targets, mechanism of drug action and drug safety.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The network approach represents another paradigm shift in drug discovery science. A network approach provides a fresh perspective of understanding important proteins in the context of their cellular environments, providing a rational basis for deriving useful strategies in drug design. Besides drug target identification and inferring mechanism of action, networks enable us to address new ideas that could prove to be extremely useful for new drug discovery, such as drug repositioning, drug synergy, polypharmacology and personalized medicine.",

What the reader will gain: The aim is to provide an overview of the relevant literature in an attempt to summarise where the optimum region of lipophilicity lies and to highlight which particular issues and risks might be expected when operating outside this region.

Although the last 60 years has seen improvements in cancer diagnostics, treatment strategies against most of the complex malignancies have not lived up to the mark. In the drug discovery area, the attrition rates have spiraled out of control, indicating that there is certainly something amiss employing the current research approaches against cancer. Advances in computational biology have revealed that cancer is a disease arising from aberrations in complex biological networks and its understanding requires more information than that obtained from the reductionist strategies. Similarly, magic bullet drugs that are designed against a single pathway may not impact these highly intertwined and robust cancer networks. In order to rein in cancer, one has to revamp the concepts in understanding the mechanism of cancer and drastically reform the present approaches to drug discovery. The idea behind this review is to enlighten the readers about the emerging concept of 'Network Pharmacology' in drug discovery. Network technologies have allowed not only in the rational targeting of aberrant signaling in cancer but also helped in understanding secondary drug effects. Concepts in network methods that are helping hit identification, lead selection, optimizing drug efficacy, as well as minimizing side-effects are discussed. Finally, some of the successful network-based drug development strategies are shown through the examples cancer.",

This provided support for analogous efforts for drugs that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, the development of these drugs, such as cetuximab (Erbitux; Bristol-Myers Squibb/Lilly) and gefitinib (Iressa; AstraZeneca), has revealed that EGFR expression is an insufficient and unreliable biomarker to select patients for EGFR-targeted therapies in both lung and colon cancer. Indeed, evidence on patient populations that are likely to respond to such therapies, on the basis of specific mutations in proteins of the targeted pathway, has only recently been clinically validated and incorporated into some of the drug labels.

Docking small mols. to a rigid biol. receptor is fast but could produce many false negatives and identify less diverse compds. Flexible receptor docking has alleviated this problem. This article focuses on reviewing ensemble docking as an approx. but inexpensive method to incorporate receptor flexibility in mol. docking. It outlines key features and recent advances of this method and points out problem areas that need to be addressed to make it even more useful in drug discovery. Among the different methods introduced for flexible receptor docking, ensemble docking represents one of the most popular approaches, esp. for high-throughput virtual screening. One can generate structural ensembles by using exptl. structures, by structural modeling and by various types of mol. simulations. In building a structural ensemble, a judicious choice of the structures to be included can improve performance. Furthermore, reducing the size of the structural ensemble can cut computational costs, and removing the structures that can bind few ligands well could enrich the no. of true actives identified by ensemble docking. The ability of ensemble docking to identify more true positives at the top of a rank-ordered list also depends on the choice of the methods to score and rank compds., an area that needs further research.

The development of the first automated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesizer and other methods to assemble defined oligosaccharides rapidly has fundamentally altered this situation. This review describes how quick access to oligosaccharides has not only contributed to biological, biochemical and biophysical investigations, but also to drug discovery. Particular focus will be placed on the development of carbohydrate-based vaccines, defined heparin oligosaccharides and aminoglycosides that have recently begun to affect drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "With a few notable exceptions, heart failure (HF) drug development has faced substantial attrition while translating preclinical discoveries into clinical efficacy. The high attrition has prompted a reconsideration of the target selection process of drug discovery. The industry standard of selecting drug targets based upon guidance from the published scientific literature has proven of limited reliability and has prompted a resurgent interest in phenotypic drug discovery (PDD). PDD, which has been reported to have an improved drug development success rate, offers an experimental route to drug target selection. In PDD, the drug targets, the disease relevant biological mechanisms and the drugs themselves are all selected by the phenotypic screen. For HF, with highly reproducible pathologic cellular phenotypes and recently developed human cell lines, the infrastructure necessary for PDD programs is well established. Despite an urgent necessity to improve drug discovery strategies, the challenges posed by PDD to both the capabilities and culture of the pharmaceutical industry are formidable. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Importance of the field: Metabolomics is increasingly becoming an important field in the pharmaceutical industry to support the discovery and development of therapeutic agents. It allows the comprehensive and simultaneous profiling of hundreds of discrete biologically important molecules, including amino acids, sugars, lipids and exogenous substances from biological fluids and tissues. Metabolomics is the 'omics' field that most represents the interplay of internal biological regulation and external environmental influences on disease, thereby being of particular importance to disease mitigation and management. Areas covered in this review: Technological advances in the experimental work flow, analytical detection strategies and bioinformatics tools have enabled metabolomics studies to become increasingly comprehensive, robust and informative for the understanding of disease, drug action and the development of biomarkers. This review will focus on the practical aspects of metabolomics studies as they have been applied to the study of mammalian biological systems, specifically targeted to the steps of experimental design with regard to sample preparation, sample analysis and data analysis of both polar and non-polar metabolites. What the reader will gain: The reader will gain an overview of the field of metabolomics as it applies to drug development and the practical issues involved with experimental design. We will discuss the various methods of sample preparation and analysis as they apply to different classes of metabolites and highlight recent advances in the field that illustrate these methods. Take home message: The field of metabolomics is a rapidly expanding discipline that is being applied to various aspects of drug development. The large diversity of metabolites found in nature dictates that different methods be developed for the investigation of different classes of metabolites. As the field of metabolomics continues to mature, it is likely that it will play an increasingly important role in the characterization of disease and the future development of biomarkers to assess drug efficacy and safety. \u00a9 2010 Informa UK Ltd.",

Stem-cell technology has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery, making models available for primary screens, secondary pharmacology, safety pharmacology, metabolic profiling and toxicity evaluation. Models of differentiated cells that are derived from mouse ESCs are already in use in drug discovery, and are beginning to find uses in high-throughput screens. Before analogous human models can be obtained in adequate numbers, reliable methods for the expansion of human ESC cultures will be needed. For applications in drug discovery, involving either species, protocols for directed differentiation will need to be robust and affordable.

Each step in the process, such as target identification and validation and medicinal chemistry, can be managed by scientific teams within a 'virtual' company. Pharmaceutical companies to biotechnology start-ups have been quick in adopting this new research and development business strategy in order to gain flexibility, access the best technologies and technical expertise, and decrease product developmental costs.

Given that oncology is currently the most active therapeutic area, and also one in which target-focused approaches have been particularly prominent in the past two decades, we investigated the contribution of phenotypic assays to oncology drug discovery by analysing the origins of all new small-molecule cancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the past 15 years and those currently in clinical development. Although the majority of these drugs originated from target-based discovery, we identified a significant number whose discovery depended on phenotypic screening approaches. We postulate that the contribution of phenotypic screening to cancer drug discovery has been hampered by a reliance on 'classical' nonspecific drug effects such as cytotoxicity and mitotic arrest, exacerbated by a paucity of mechanistically defined cellular models for therapeutically translatable cancer phenotypes. However, technical and biological advances that enable such mechanistically informed phenotypic models have the potential to empower phenotypic drug discovery in oncology.",

Presently, structure-based methodologies influence many aspects of the drug discovery process from lead discovery to the final preclinical characterization. However, critical biological issues along the path to the market have diminished the impact and power of this methodology. The physicochemical properties of the novel chemical entities designed and guided by structural methods have become the subject of intense scrutiny from lead discovery to drug candidate. The idea of ligand efficiency (binding energy/non-hydrogen atoms) has recently emerged as a useful guide to optimize fragment and lead selection in the discovery process. More generalized concepts of ligand efficiency, related to efficiency per dalton and per unit of polar surface area, have also been introduced and will be discussed in the broader context. Preliminary results and trends obtained using ligand efficiencies as guides are reviewed and their future application to guide drug discovery will be discussed, as well as their integration into the structure-based drug design methods to make them more effective and numerically robust.",

Therefore, there is a high demand for new, non-toxic and efficient antimicrobial agents. Research with the microscopic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can address this high demand for the discovery of new antimicrobial compounds. In particular, C. elegans can be used as a model host for in vivo drug discovery through high-throughput screens of chemical libraries. AREAS COVERED: This review introduces the use of substitute model hosts and especially C. elegans in the study of microbial pathogenesis. The authors also highlight recently published literature on the role of C. elegans in drug discovery and outline its use as a promising host with unique advantages in the discovery of new antimicrobial drugs. EXPERT OPINION: C. elegans can be used, as a model host, to research many diseases, including fungal infections and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, high-throughput techniques, for screening chemical libraries, can also be facilitated. Nevertheless, C. elegans and mammals have significant differences that both limit the use of the nematode in research and the degree by which results can be interpreted. That being said, the use of C. elegans in drug discovery still holds promise and the field continues to grow, with attempts to improve the methodology already underway.",

The availability of effective drugs used in combination (diethylcarbamazine, albendazole and ivermectin) has paved the way for the implementation of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaigns. Considerable progress in the implementation of MDA programmes had led to significant reductions in transmission and morbidity. However, new drugs are needed to overcome the threat of resistance to existing microfilaricides as well as to identify new macrofilaricides. This paper discusses the existing screening tools available for antifilarial drug discovery and efforts towards optimising their use through the Helminth Drug Initiative.",

Areas covered in this review: Significant advances in terms of LC platforms achieved in the last 5 years are highlighted in this review. Special attention is paid to novel LC strategies used in the discovery of new bioactive molecules and the determination of lipophilicity, pK(a) values, passive drug permeability and in vitro metabolism of new chemical entities. What the reader will gain: Many improvements were achieved in terms of LC instrumentation, columns technology and analytes detection to attain ultra-fast and/or high-resolution chromatographic separations. These advances are particularly beneficial to face the complexity and high number of samples studied in the early phases of the discovery process. Advantages and drawbacks of each strategy are discussed. Take home message: LC and ultra high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection constitute the most promising strategies to achieve high-throughput and/or high-resolution analyses in a drug discovery environment.",

Many biologic agents have come down the pipeline and are being studied in phase II trials for recurrent disease.

Other novel drugs include oral platinum compounds as well as those that antagonize the tumor proliferation genes in the Hedgehog pathway, and that target folic acid receptors which are expressed by ovarian cancer cells. In addition, studies are underway with oral agents that inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity associated with two oncogenes (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER-2/neu). Finally, emerging technologies in clinical trials include nanotechnology to enhance delivery of chemotherapy to ovarian tumors, drug resistance/sensitivity assays to guide therapy, and agents that mobilize and induce proliferation of hematopoetic progenitor cells to aid in red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet recovery following chemotherapy.

Given that different cell death modalities may be dysregulated in different diseases, it is becoming increasingly clear that such assays need to not only quantify the extent of cell death, but they must also be able to distinguish between the various pathways.

MSCs have been used therapeutically in clinical trials and subsequently in practice to treat graft-versus-host disease following bone marrow transplantation. Reports of successful immune modulation suggest efficacy in a wide range of autoimmune conditions, such as demyelinating neurological disease (multiple sclerosis), systemic lupus erythematosus, and Crohn's disease, among others. This review provides background information about hMSCs and also describes their putative mechanisms of action in inflammation.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: X-ray crystallography plays an important role in structure-based drug design (SBDD), and accurate analysis of crystal structures of target macromolecules and macromolecule-ligand complexes is critical at all stages. However, whereas there has been significant progress in improving methods of structural biology, particularly in X-ray crystallography, corresponding progress in the development of computational methods (such as in silico high-throughput screening) is still on the horizon. Crystal structures can be overinterpreted and thus bias hypotheses and follow-up experiments. As in any experimental science, the models of macromolecular structures derived from X-ray diffraction data have their limitations, which need to be critically evaluated and well understood for structure-based drug discovery. AREAS COVERED: This review describes how the validity, accuracy and precision of a protein or nucleic acid structure determined by X-ray crystallography can be evaluated from three different perspectives: i) the nature of the diffraction experiment; ii) the interpretation of an electron density map; and iii) the interpretation of the structural model in terms of function and mechanism. The strategies to optimally exploit a macromolecular structure are also discussed in the context of 'Big Data' analysis, biochemical experimental design and structure-based drug discovery. EXPERT OPINION: Although X-ray crystallography is one of the most detailed 'microscopes' available today for examining macromolecular structures, the authors would like to re-emphasize that such structures are only simplified models of the target macromolecules. The authors also wish to reinforce the idea that a structure should not be thought of as a set of precise coordinates but rather as a framework for generating hypotheses to be explored. Numerous biochemical and biophysical experiments, including new diffraction experiments, can and should be performed to verify or falsify these hypotheses. X-ray crystallography will find its future application in drug discovery by the development of specific tools that would allow realistic interpretation of the outcome coordinates and/or support testing of these hypotheses.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The success of antidepressant research has long been challenged by a limited mechanistic understanding of depression pathogenesis and antidepressant treatment response. Progress in this field has thereby consistently been hindered by a lack of novel conceptual approaches and sophisticated experimental techniques to dissect the highly intricate neurobiology of depression. Using fresh approaches to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying depression will thus be vital for discovery of novel antidepressant targets. AREAS COVERED: This article provides an overview of some fundamental problems that depression research is currently facing and critically evaluates how these issues could be addressed by future research. It also discusses novel conceptual and technological advances in the field of neuroscience, particularly in regard to how they may help in providing unprecedented insight into the molecular mechanisms of depression pathogenesis. EXPERT OPINION: Although progress in antidepressant drug discovery has been limited over recent years, modern innovations in neuroscience, molecular biology, genetics and bioinformatics are just beginning to revolutionize depression research and to reveal novel and promising treatment targets. Integrating findings from a range of relevant experimental models and using the most advanced technology will be vital for the future success of antidepressant drug discovery.",

Genome mining has identified hundreds of potential targets that have been distilled to a relatively small number of broad-spectrum targets ('low-hanging fruit') using the genetics tools of modern microbiology.

Antidepressants and serotonin receptor modulators are used to treat IBS, but rare serious adverse events highlight the safety hurdle. Newer drugs with secretory and motility effects via local gut mechanisms have been successfully approved for IBS, often by registering first in a related, non-IBS condition to optimize dosing, formulation and therapeutic window.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review looks at approaches for novel IBS drug discovery. The underlying pathologies can be tackled locally from the 'outside-in' (intestinal lumen, mucosa and neuromuscular) to identify therapeutic targets. The article discusses the mechanisms associated with bile acid malabsorption, microbial dysbiosis, decreased intestinal barrier function, immune dysregulation, motility and visceral hypersensitivity.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Challenges for new drug discovery are the unknown mechanisms underlying IBS, making it difficult to predict clinically efficacious molecular targets, limited options for translational research and disease progression biomarkers. Drugs acting locally via multiple targets (e.g., eluxadoline [The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Viberzi (eluxadoline) for IBS-D on May 27th 2015], crofelemer) to validated mechanisms are proving successful with tolerable safety margins. Novel mechanisms, identified and optimized based on the emerging role of nutrient signaling, probiotics or microbial products, are promising.

A large repertoire of IDPs/IDPRs has been implicated in numerous diseases, making them potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in exptl. methods and computational approaches have enabled detection and characterization of these highly dynamic proteins at atomistic detail, thus facilitating disorder/dynamic-based drug discovery. This article presents an overview of the functional relevance and pathol. implications of IDPs/IDPRs in cells. The authors outline the currently available exptl. methods employed for structural characterization of these proteins. They also exemplify the practical limitations encountered during such characterization and ways to overcome them. Taken together, the article discusses the plausibility of exploiting protein disorder for drug targeting. Disorder-based drug targeting is gearing up in the realm of novel drug discovery approaches. Tools for probing the mol. features of IDPs and IDPRs are rapidly improving and start to provide accurate descriptions of the complex ensembles populated by IDPs/IDPRs. They thus pave the way for the development of drug mols., which specifically target disease-assocd. disorder. [on SciFinder(R)]",

More can be done during the drug discovery phase to optimize efficacy-testing in animal models by expending resources to explore the congruence of the animal model with the human disease. Historically, relatively little attention has been paid to validation of these models, but access to molecular mRNA and genetic profiling offers a new lens through which the similarity of these disease models to human diseases can be examined and their utility for exploring therapeutic efficacy can be optimized.

Progress in the field also suggests that many key physiological mechanisms are remarkably dependent on the circadian clock. It has also become clear that a number of diseases with important unmet medical need display marked circadian variation in their symptoms and severity.

The ligands span five orders of magnitude in affinity and the resulting structures are made available to be of use, for example, for development of computational methods.

Presently available drugs are ineffective in controlling such pain in most patients and abolish the pain in only few. Why do they fail?

However, glia have recently been recognized as powerful modulators of nociception, and could hold the key to the control of clinical pain and present a new target for drug discovery. This review examines the evidence for glial regulation of nociception and pharmacological approaches that might successfully control glially driven clinical pain syndromes.",

With much of the focus on overcoming insulin resistance, investigation has focused on finding ways to restore activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase pathway, which is diminished in many patients with type 2 diabetes. Here we review the evidence that lipid phosphatases, specifically PTEN and SHIP2, attenuate this important insulin signalling pathway. Both in vivo and in vitro studies indicate their role in regulating whole-body energy metabolism, and possibly weight gain as well.

Within a decade, it is plausible to envision the availability of draft or complete genomes from 100 nematode and platyhelminth species. Helminth genome sequencing offers substantial challenges to assembly and annotation because of size, repeat and gene structure and sequence polymorphisms. Research programmes in parasitology will need to adapt to effectively make use of these genomes and to identify the most promising opportunities for the application of genomic information to the development of control strategies, including anthelmintics.

Some have been used to dissect the pathogenesis of dystonia for the identification of molecular targets for intervention. Others have been used for the empirical identification of candidate drugs.

Ironically, it might be argued that the recent pressure put on universities and basic research organisations to protect and exploit their intellectual property has, in many ways, created a less conducive environment to successful commercialisation than existed 30\u00a0years ago. This movement has been concurrent with the drift of the Pharmaceutical industry towards a more risk-averse R&D strategy in which it has increasingly concentrated its resources on a reductionist drug discovery process and later stage clinical development. In effect, these two strategies have created a discontinuity between academic scientific output and industry at a time when academia as a source of innovation is perhaps more important to industry than ever.",

The authors discuss the methodologies and strategies for early efficacy testing that aim to narrow down the portfolio of promising compounds.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The increased efforts in the discovery and development of new antimalarial compounds have led to the recognition of new promising hits. However, there is still major roadblock of selecting the most promising compounds and then further testing them in early clinical trials, especially in the current restricted economy. Controlled human malaria infection has much potential for speeding-up the early development process of many drug candidates including those which target the pre-erythrocytic stages.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Influenza antiviral high-throughput screens have been extensive, and yet no approved influenza antivirals have been identified through high-throughput screening. This underscores the idea that development of successful screens should focus on the exploitation of the underrepresented viral targets and novel, therapeutic host targets. AREAS COVERED: The authors review conventional screening applications and emerging technologies with the potential to enhance influenza antiviral discovery. Real-world examples from the authors' work in biocontained environments are also provided. Future innovations are discussed, including the use of targeted libraries, multiplexed assays, proximity-based endpoint methods, non-laboratory-adapted virus strains, and primary cells, for immediate physiological relevance and translational applications. EXPERT OPINION: The lack of successful anti-influenza drug discovery using high-throughput screening should not deter future efforts. Increased understanding of the functions of viral targets and host-pathogen interactions has broadened the target reservoir. Future screening efforts should focus on identifying new drugs against unexploited viral and host targets using currently developed assays, and on the development of novel, innovative assays to discover new drugs with novel mechanisms. Innovative screens must be designed to identify compounds that specifically inhibit protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions or other virus/host factor interactions that are crucial for viral replication. Finally, the use of recent viral isolates, increased biocontainment (for highly-pathogenic strains), primary cell lines, and targeted compound libraries must converge in efficient high-throughput primary screens to generate high-content, physiologically-relevant data on compounds with robust antiviral activity.",

One such approach is known as synthetic lethality screening, which involves searching for genetic interactions of two mutations whereby the presence of either mutation alone has no effect on cell viability but the combination of the two mutations results in cell death. The presence of one of these mutations in cancer cells but not in normal cells can therefore create opportunities to selectively kill cancer cells by mimicking the effect of the second genetic mutation with targeted therapy. Here, we summarize strategies that can be used to identify synthetic lethal interactions for anticancer drug discovery, describe examples of such interactions that are currently being investigated in preclinical and clinical studies of targeted anticancer therapies, and discuss the challenges of realizing the full potential of such therapies.",

Recently, novel bioluminescence techniques that differ from typical approaches were developed for the detection of transcriptional regulation or direct protein-protein interactions. Objective: As each method has its own characteristics, this review summarizes the latest bioluminescence methods that are applicable to the field of drug discovery research. Methods: Considering the diversity of related techniques, this review covers several aspects that have been divided into the following classes: variation of reporter gene assays, secretion properties, protein-protein interaction assays in living cells and bioluminescence imaging of living cells. Results/conclusions: The practical application of several luciferins and/or luciferases and the generation of novel applications by incorporating fluorescent molecules into bioluminescence techniques will become increasingly important because bioluminescence technology has a significant potential depending on how we use it.",

        "abstract": "Importance of the field: Bimolecular recognition is the basis for almost all processes in biological systems. The geometrical and chemical complementarity of small molecule ligands and their macromolecular biological targets, matching paired interacting parts, can result in binding that will eventually yield a biological response. Areas covered in this review: The topics covered include the integration of molecular interaction fields and chemometrics, via the GRID/CPCA (consensus principal component analysis) method that is actively contributing to the optimization of potency and selectivity of ligands towards a chosen target. Key applications that hallmark the usefulness of the method are critically presented. By comparison of the GRID/CPCA and GRID/PCA, the breakthroughs and challenges are highlighted. What the reader will gain: Molecular recognition studies support the development of pharmacophore-based descriptors, which provide the means to identify new ligand templates ('scaffold-hopping'). The GRID/CPCA approach can simultaneously reveal common trends in more than one block of data for more than two target proteins, with several three-dimensional structures per protein. It offers the benefit of improving the weighting between different interaction energy probes within the GRID parameterization. An important consequence is that hydrophobic interactions can be assessed for selectivity between proteins. Take home message: Molecular-field-based methods along with CPCA analysis are extremely powerful to understand bimolecular interactions. Because drug discovery and development is a costly, time consuming and high-risk activity and GRID/CPCA is at the forefront of the computer-aided design, it should be used as early as possible for discovering new drugs.",

BD is associated with a number of negative outcomes including premature death, reduced quality of life and can also lead to other complications including impaired cognitive function. Unfortunately, the currently available pharmacological treatments for BD are insufficient for many with the condition. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on known therapeutic targets of mood stabilizing drugs including: the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), the phosphoinositide pathway and protein kinase C (PKC), the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and histone deacetylases (HDACs). This article also presents new promising therapeutic targets including: the glutamatergic pathway, mitochondrial modulators, neuropeptide-converting endopeptidases, the insulin transduction pathway, the purinergic system and the melatoninergic system. EXPERT OPINION: Challenges in improving methods and tools to generate, integrate and analyze high-dimensional data are required to allow opening novel routes to BD drug discovery. Through the application of systems biology approaches and the use of bioinformatical tools to integrate all omics data, it will be possible in the near future to gain deeper insights into pathophysiology of BD. This will in turn lead to the identification and exploitation of new potential therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": "The rising rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the lack of effective medications to treat its core symptoms have led to an increased sense of urgency to identify therapies for this group of neurodevelopmental conditions. Developing drugs for ASD, however, has been challenging because of a limited understanding of its pathophysiology, difficulties in modelling the disease in vitro and in vivo, the heterogeneity of symptoms, and the dearth of prior experience in clinical development. In the past few years these challenges have been mitigated by considerable advances in our understanding of forms of ASD caused by single-gene alterations, such as fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. In these cases we have gained insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions. In addition, they have aided in the development of animal models and compounds with the potential for disease modification in clinical development. Moreover, genetic studies are illuminating the molecular pathophysiology of ASD, and new tools such as induced pluripotent stem cells offer novel possibilities for drug screening and disease diagnostics. Finally, large-scale collaborations between academia and industry are starting to address some of the key barriers to developing drugs for ASD. Here, we propose a conceptual framework for drug discovery in ASD encompassing target identification, drug profiling and considerations for clinical trials in this novel area.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The history of epilepsy dates back to 2000 BC. Yet, it was not until 1912 that the activity of the first antiepileptic, phenobarbital was discovered by accident. After this discovery, the next antiepileptic drugs to be discovered (phenytoin and primidone) were based on the phenobarbital's structure. Then, in 1960, carbamazepine was developed empirically, while in 1962, valproate demonstrated anticonvulsant activity against experimental seizures. The next antiepileptic drugs synthesized were either modifications of the existing drugs (such as oxcarbazepine and pregabalin) or completely novel chemical structures (lacosamide, perampanel and retigabine). AREAS COVERED: The present paper briefly refers to the history of epilepsy and development of antiepileptic drugs. Further, the paper provides a discussion on the antiepileptogenic effects of antiepileptic drugs in terms of the constant percentage of epileptic patients with refractory seizures. The authors also review the likely factors involved in the false refractoriness (such as through the use of caffeine-containing beverages and smoking). Finally, the authors consider future directions in the search of novel antiepileptic drugs. EXPERT OPINION: In spite of the considerable number of newer antiepileptic drugs, the number of drug-resistant epileptic patients remains unchanged. This may be rather an indication of the suitability of the currently available discovery procedures for effective antiepileptic drugs in the whole population of epileptic patients. The authors, however, believe that it is likely that models of mimic chronic epilepsy will help bridge the gaps and aid in the discovery of novel antiepileptic drugs - ones that can effectively modify the course of the disease.",

        "abstract": "Despite the introduction of over 15 third-generation anti-epileptic drugs, current medications fail to control seizures in 20-30% of patients. However, our understanding of the mechanisms mediating the development of epilepsy and the causes of drug resistance has grown substantially over the past decade, providing opportunities for the discovery and development of more efficacious anti-epileptic and anti-epileptogenic drugs. In this Review we discuss how previous preclinical models and clinical trial designs may have hampered the discovery of better treatments. We propose that future anti-epileptic drug development may be improved through a new joint endeavour between academia and the industry, through the identification and application of tools for new target-driven approaches, and through comparative preclinical proof-of-concept studies and innovative clinical trials designs. \u00a9 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder, characterized by a disrupted nocturnal sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and symptoms of dissociated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These symptoms are often disabling, confining the patients to a life-long pharmacologic symptomatic treatment. Nowadays, it is well known that narcolepsy results from alterations in the genes involved in the physiology of the orexin ligand or its receptor.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review recapitulates on the current approaches for treating narcolepsy with cataplexy and the use of narcolepsy models in order to address different aspects of the disease.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Animal models are required for the study of human diseases when it is impractical or unethical to use humans; these models are useful for studying the underlying causes of a disease and are a common research tool for identifying potential drug targets. Current treatment for human narcolepsy is symptomatically based; interestingly, the existing approaches do not target the orexinergic circuit. The discovery of novel drug targets for treating narcolepsy remains the primary focus of study in sleep medicine research. New therapies will arise through the discovery of new animal models of narcolepsy, which will offer new insights into the understanding of its physiopathology.",

        "abstract": "A large number of drugs and drug candidates in clinical development contain halogen substituents. For a long time, only the steric and lipophilic contributions of halogens were considered when trying to exploit their effects on ligand binding. However, the ability of halogens to form stabilizing interactions, such as halogen bonding, hydrogen bonding and multipolar interactions, in biomolecular systems was revealed recently. Halogen bonding, the non-covalent interaction in which covalently bound halogens interact with Lewis bases, has now been utilized in the context of rational drug design. AREAS COVERED: The purpose of this review is to show how halogen bonding could be used in drug design, and in particular, to stimulate researchers to apply halogen bonding in lead optimization. This review article covers the recent advances relevant to halogen bonding in drug discovery and biological design over the past decade, including database survey of this interaction in protein-ligand complexes, molecular mechanical investigations of halogen bonding in drug discovery and applications of this interaction in the development of halogenated ligands as inhibitors and drugs for protein kinases, serine protease factor Xa, HIV reverse transcriptase and so on. EXPERT OPINION: Halogen bonding should intentionally be used as a powerful tool, comparable with hydrogen bonding, to enhance the binding affinity and also influence the binding selectivity. Rational design of new and potent inhibitors against therapeutic targets through halogen bonding continues to be an exciting area, which will be further elucidated with the combination of various experimental techniques and theoretical calculations in the forthcoming years.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug discovery is a complex and unpredictable endeavor with a high failure rate. Current trends in the pharmaceutical industry have exasperated these challenges and are contributing to the dramatic decline in productivity observed over the last decade. The industrialization of science by forcing the drug discovery process to adhere to assembly-line protocols is imposing unnecessary restrictions, such as short project time-lines. Recent advances in nuclear magnetic resonance are responding to these self-imposed limitations and are providing opportunities to increase the success rate of drug discovery. OBJECTIVE/METHOD: A review of recent advancements in NMR technology that have the potential of significantly impacting and benefiting the drug discovery process will be presented. These include fast NMR data collection protocols and high-throughput protein structure determination, rapid protein-ligand co-structure determination, lead discovery using fragment-based NMR affinity screens, NMR metabolomics to monitor in vivo efficacy and toxicity for lead compounds, and the identification of new therapeutic targets through the functional annotation of proteins by FAST-NMR. CONCLUSION: NMR is a critical component of the drug discovery process, where the versatility of the technique enables it to continually expand and evolve its role. NMR is expected to maintain this growth over the next decade with advancements in automation, speed of structure calculation, in-cell imaging techniques, and the expansion of NMR amenable targets.",

SNPs can also significantly influence responses to pharmacotherapy and whether drugs will produce adverse reactions. The development of new drugs can be made far cheaper and more rapid by selecting participants in drug trials based on their genetically determined response to drugs. Technology that can rapidly and inexpensively genotype thousands of samples for thousands of SNPs at a time is therefore in high demand. With the completion of the human genome project, about 12 million true SNPs have been identified to date. However, most have not yet been associated with disease susceptibility or drug response. Testing for the appropriate drug response SNPs in a patient requiring treatment would enable individualised therapy with the right drug and dose administered correctly the first time. Many pharmaceutical companies are also interested in identifying SNPs associated with polygenic traits so novel therapeutic targets can be discovered. This review focuses on technologies that can be used for genotyping known SNPs as well as for the discovery of novel SNPs associated with drug response.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The apparent productivity crisis in the pharmaceutical industry and the economic and political rise of China have contributed to renewed interest in the application of Chinese medicine for drug discovery. AREAS COVERED: The author presents an overview of the historical development and basic principles of theory and practice of Chinese herbal medicine, its materia medica and prescription formulas, and discusses the motivation for and rationale of its application to drug discovery. Furthermore, the author distinguishes the five main approaches to drug discovery from Chinese herbal medicine, based on the decreasing amount and detail of historical and clinical Chinese medicine knowledge that informed the research effort. EXPERT OPINION: Many compounds that have been isolated from the Chinese materia medica exhibit pharmacological activities comparable to pharmaceutical drugs. With the exception of the antimalarial drug artemisinin, however, this knowledge has not led to the successful development of new drugs outside of China. The chance of success in a Chinese medicine-based drug discovery effort will be increased by consideration of the empirical knowledge that has been documented over many centuries in the historical materia medica and prescription literature. Most Chinese medicine-derived compounds affect more than one target and do not correspond to the one compound/one-target drug discovery paradigm. A new frontier is opening up with the development of drugs consisting of combinations of multiple compounds acting on multiple targets under the paradigm of network pharmacology. The ancient practice of combining multiple drugs in prescription formulas can serve as inspirational analogy and a practical guide.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The apparent productivity crisis in the pharmaceutical industry and the economic and political rise of China have contributed to renewed interest in the application of Chinese medicine for drug discovery. Areas covered: The author presents an overview of the historical development and basic principles of theory and practice of Chinese herbal medicine, its materia medica and prescription formulas, and discusses the motivation for and rationale of its application to drug discovery. Furthermore, the author distinguishes the five main approaches to drug discovery from Chinese herbal medicine, based on the decreasing amount and detail of historical and clinical Chinese medicine knowledge that informed the research effort. Expert opinion: Many compounds that have been isolated from the Chinese materia medica exhibit pharmacological activities comparable to pharmaceutical drugs. With the exception of the antimalarial drug artemisinin, however, this knowledge has not led to the successful development of new drugs outside of China. The chance of success in a Chinese medicine-based drug discovery effort will be increased by consideration of the empirical knowledge that has been documented over many centuries in the historical materia medica and prescription literature. Most Chinese medicine-derived compounds affect more than one target and do not correspond to the one compound/one-target drug discovery paradigm. A new frontier is opening up with the development of drugs consisting of combinations of multiple compounds acting on multiple targets under the paradigm of network pharmacology. The ancient practice of combining multiple drugs in prescription formulas can serve as inspirational analogy and a practical guide.",

The successful identification of hundreds of GPCRs represents the single greatest opportunity for novel drug development today.

It is especially powerful in the absence of 3D structures of specific drug targets. QSAR methods have been shown to draw public attention since they were first introduced.Areas covered: In this review, the authors provide a brief discussion of the basic principles of QSAR, model development and model validation. They also highlight the current applications of QSAR in different fields, particularly in virtual screening, rational drug design and multi-target QSAR. Finally, in view of recent controversies, the authors detail the challenges faced by QSAR modeling and the relevant solutions. The aim of this review is to show how QSAR modeling can be applied in novel drug discovery, design and lead optimization.Expert opinion: QSAR should intentionally be used as a powerful tool for fragment-based drug design platforms in the field of drug discovery and design. Although there have been an increasing number of experimentally determined protein structures in recent years, a great number of protein structures cannot be easily obtained (i.e., membrane transport proteins and G-protein coupled receptors). Fragment-based drug discovery, such as QSAR, could be applied further and have a significant role in dealing with these problems. Moreover, along with the development of computer software and hardware, it is believed that QSAR will be increasingly important.",

We conclude that previous serendipitous approaches should be replaced with rational strategies for drug discovery in integrated preclinical and clinical programmes.

Areas to be covered: Current drug discovery strategies involving natural products are described in three sections: developments from traditionally used medicines, random testing of natural compounds on biological assays and use of virtual screening techniques with structures of natural products. What the reader will gain: The reader will gain an insight into the potential for natural products in current drug discovery paradigms, particularly in the value of using natural products in virtual screening approaches.

        "abstract": "Introduction: MS is a heterogeneous disorder that requires the development of better diagnostics to identify disease subtypes enabling appropriate therapeutic intervention at an early stage of the disease. Accumulating evidence indicates that members of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS by reducing the apoptotic elimination of autoreactive immune cells. Areas covered: The authors describe improved animal modeling strategies to identify compounds that have immunomodulatory, neurorestorative and neuroprotective properties. In addition, the authors propose new approaches to better model cognitive dysfunction in MS, which will aid the development of novel therapeutics for this complex disorder. The paper provides the reader with an appreciation for the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of apoptosis-related proteins for MS. Expert opinion: Recent evidence suggests that increased resistance of autoreactive immune cells to apoptotic elimination is a contributing factor to both disease susceptibility and progression in MS. This occurs, at least in part, because of elevated levels of the IAP family of anti-apoptotic genes that display distinct expression profiles associated with different subtypes of MS. The authors believe that the detection and targeting of members of the IAP family can provide better drugs for MS. Particularly, the authors feel that the overexpression of IAPs in animal models can provide novel insights into MS for both its pathogenesis and the discovery of new lead compounds.",

Several preclinical drug trials of HDACis for the treatment of BD have been conducted.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: HDACis have shown promising results in preclinical studies of BD. However, the currently available HDACis suffer from acting non-specifically on HDAC isozymes. More isozyme-specific HDACis are likely to have greater efficacy and less toxicity than the current HDACis. It is suggested that efforts should be made to develop such HDACis. Once such HDACis with adequate ability to cross the blood-brain barrier become available, investigators could consider proceeding to clinical trials of HDACis for the treatment of BD.",

However, which strategy is the best for natural-product-based drug discovery? Two well established but relatively time consuming approaches are the screening of crude extracts and pre-fractionated extracts. This case study describes a third, pure-compound-screening approach, and discusses its benefits and pitfalls.",

However, so far, computer drug design methods have been applied to inhibit the function of individual proteins, and there is little available data on the use of these computational techniques to target protein-protein interactions. Objective: To establish a strategy for the use of current computational tools in drug discovery targeting protein-protein interactions. Method: Individual techniques applied to specific cases could be studied to derive a general strategy for targeting protein-protein interactions. Conclusion: Protein docking, interface prediction and hot-spot identification can contribute to the discovery of small molecule inhibitors targeting protein interactions of therapeutic interest, especially when little structural information is available.",

        "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges to discovering more efficacious medications for pain control has been the heterogeneity of the chronic pain condition in humans. It is now appreciated that distinct mechanisms contribute to normal physiological pain, pain arising from tissue damage and pain arising from injury to the nervous system. To study pain transmission, identify new pain targets and characterise the potential analgesic profile of novel compounds, an array of experimental animal pain models has been developed (mainly in rodents) attempting to replicate the many human pain conditions, including inflammatory, neuropathic, visceral and cancer pain states. The authors review commonly used rodent models of acute and chronic pain that have been used in an attempt to identify novel analgesic drugs. Although these animal models have helped to better understand pain physio-pharmacology mechanisms, one should remember that even for patients labelled under the same 'pain condition', the pain experience is unique, increasing the difficulty of modelling such painful states in animals. Looking back at decades of pain research, it is clear that the transition from preclinical findings to clinical applications in the treatment of pain has been difficult and that more predictive models need to be developed to facilitate the discovery and development of novel pain medications. For these reasons, particular attention has been given in this review to the more recently developed models of visceral, osteoarthritic and bone cancer pain.",

The four serotypes of dengue infect 50-100 million people each year, yet the only clinical treatment is supportive care to reduce symptoms. Drugs that employ novel inhibition mechanisms and targets are urgently needed to combat the growing incidence of dengue worldwide. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss recently discovered flavivirus inhibitors with a focus on antivirals targeting non-enzymatic proteins of the dengue virus lifecycle. Specifically, the authors discuss the flaviviruses, the need for novel inhibitors and the criteria for successful antiviral drug development. Current literature describing new advances in antiviral therapy at each stage of the flavivirus lifecycle (entry, endosomal escape, viral RNA processing and replication, assembly and immune evasion) are evaluated and summarized. EXPERT OPINION: Overall, the prognosis of flavivirus antiviral drug development is positive: new effective compounds have been discovered and studied. However, repurposing existing compounds and a greater translation to the clinical setting are recommended in order to combat the growing threat of flaviviruses.",

Large-scale studies that have analyzed the transcriptional and translational expression patterns of glioma have found that the majority of these tumors can be categorized based on specific genomic anomalies. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) that represent the molecular subgroups of the human disease harbor a variety of molecular alterations that have been proven to drive gliomagenesis. These models provide an opportunity to assess the effects of novel therapies in the presence of specific molecular defects. Research using GEMMs, which are associated with these subclasses, allow researchers to assess drug efficacy by subclass. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss the histological and molecular characteristics of malignant gliomas, the therapies used to treat them and the animal models that closely recapitulate them. Expert opinion: It is likely that GEMMs that recapitulate the molecular character of human tumors will provide a more accurate prediction of individuals who may be more or less likely to benefit from specific therapies. This knowledge can be then used to drive clinical trial design and this, in turn, could lead to better therapeutic outcomes.",

Here, the authors review recently published papers in this area and summarise the genetic and pharmacological approaches that have shown efficacy in reducing tau-associated neurodegeneration. These include the use of agents to prevent abnormal tau processing and increase tau clearance, therapies targeting the immune system, and the manipulation of tau pre-mRNA to modify tau isoform expression.

Polypharmacology for complex diseases is likely to involve multiple drugs acting on distinct targets that are part of a network regulating physiological responses. This review discusses the current state of the systems-level understanding of diseases and both the therapeutic and adverse mechanisms of drug actions.

These difficult-to-treat patients currently represent about 3 - 5% of people with gout in Europe and the United States, which highlights the need for emerging treatments to effectively lower urate levels.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors describe the putative pharmacological targets to lower urate levels. Furthermore, the authors discuss various strategies used to discover novel molecules or to improve available drugs used to treat gout.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Major advances in our understanding of urate renal transport from in vitro, animal and genetic studies could lead to the development of novel uricosuric drugs. Targeting one or several urate transporters such as urate transporter 1, organic anion transporter 4 and 10 and glucose transporter 9 is promising. Moreover, design of small molecules capable of blocking the site activity of enzymes other than xanthine oxidase and involved in the purine pathway could generate novel hypouricemic drugs. Finally, polyethylene glycol (PEGylation) can significantly extend the biological half-life of drugs and reduce antigenicity and immunogenicity of proteins. The technology has been successfully applied to an uricase (pegloticase), but the drug was immunogenic in some patients. Strategies to decrease the immunogenicity of a PEG-uricase are important for developing next-generation uricase.",

Molecular docking is a rational structural approach employed to predict thermodynamic parameters based on molecular recognition between two or more molecules. In addition, docking studies have become very important for therapeutic applications in modern structure-based drug design because this computational tool uses few economic resources. However, they omit many biological conditions that critically influence small and macromolecular structural motions. To mimic physiological conditions, it is necessary to consider other environmental factors, such as the presence of water molecules and the flexibility of ligands and side chain residues of proteins. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations have been coupled with docking procedures to expand the boundaries and obtain more reliable information.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: In this article, we review current advances in protein-small molecule docking and possible future directions.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Docking studies include many conformations to predict binding free energies (scoring functions) and to search (scoring sampling) for the most representative binding conformations. Therefore, several biological properties, from side chain residues to complete protein motions, have been included in docking studies to improve theoretical predictions.",

Taking into consideration the novel concepts of collateral efficacy and permissive antagonism in the search for synthetic agonists and antagonists, respectively, will be essential in the search for drugs with unique therapeutic profiles. Here, the design of drugs against HIV is used as an example of how these concepts might be taken into consideration for GPCR-targeted drugs in general.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: There is an immediate need for functional and molecular studies to decipher differences between disease and 'normal' settings to identify large quantities of validated targets with the highest therapeutic utilities. Furthermore, drug mechanism of action and biomarkers to predict drug efficacy and safety need to be identified for effective design of clinical trials, decreasing attrition rates, regulatory agency approval process and drug repositioning. By expanding the power of genetics and pharmacogenetics studies, next-generation nucleic acid sequencing technologies have started to play an important role in all stages of drug discovery. Areas covered: This article reviews the first- and second-generation sequencing technologies (SGSTs) and challenges they pose to biomedicine. The article then focuses on the emerging third-generation sequencing technologies (TGSTs), their technological foundations and potential contributions to drug discovery. Expert opinion: Despite the scientific and commercial success of SGSTs, the goal of rapid, comprehensive and unbiased sequencing of nucleic acids has not been achieved. TGSTs promise to increase sequencing throughput and read lengths, decrease costs, run times and error rates, eliminate biases inherent in SGSTs and offer capabilities beyond nucleic acid sequencing. Such changes will have positive impact on all sequencing applications to drug discovery. \u00a9 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.",

However, several recent examples show that inhibiting host-cell proteins can prevent viral infection. The human genome sequence should, therefore, contain many more genes that are essential for viral propagation than viral genomes, A systematic approach to find these potential cellular antiviral targets is global host gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays. Several recent studies reveal both unique and common strategies by which viruses change the gene expression profile of the host cell. Moreover, work in progress shows that some of the host pathways discovered by expression profiling are important for viral replication. Thus, human genomics tools have the potential to deliver novel antiviral drugs.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Pharmaceutical research looks to discover and develop new compounds which influence the function of disease-associated proteins or respective protein-protein interactions. Various scientific methods are available to discover those compounds, such as high-throughput screening of a library comprising chemical or natural compounds and computational rational drug design. The goal of these methods is to identify the seed compounds of future pharmaceuticals through the use of these technologies and laborious experiments. For every drug discovery effort made, the possession of accurate functional and structural information of the disease-associated proteins helps to assist drug development. Therefore, the investigation of the tertiary structure of disease-associated proteins and respective protein-protein interactions at the atomic level are of crucial importance for successful drug discovery. Areas covered: In this review article, the authors broadly outline current techniques utilized for recombinant protein production. In particular, the authors focus on bacterial expression systems using Escherichia coli as the living bioreactor. Expert opinion: The recently developed pCold-glutathione S-transferase (GST) system is one of the best systems for soluble protein expression in E. coli. Where the pCold-GST system does not succeed, it is preferable to change the host from E. coli to higher organisms such as yeast expression systems like Pichia pastoris and Kluyveromyces lactis. The selection of an appropriate expression system for each desired protein and the optimization of experimental conditions significantly contribute toward the successful outcome of any drug discovery study.",

Such examples include: the analgesic ziconotide and the anti cancer compound trabectedin. However, in light of the pressing need for new drugs, particularly those with anti-infective and anticancer properties, there is strong justification for increased exploration of marine organisms as sources of novel compounds. This article considers approaches that might enhance our chances of delivering new medicines from marine-based drug discovery efforts. Consideration is given to the organisms and habitats deserving of more attention and how we might make best use of these marine genetic resources. In particular, the opportunities offered by synthetic biology are highlighted because these methods allow drug discoverers to explore pathways in 'non-culturable' species and turn on natural product biosynthesis genes that are difficult to activate under laboratory conditions (so-called 'silent' gene clusters).",

        "abstract": "The discovery of CNS-active drugs has, to a major extent, resulted from clinical serendipity. Once targets for such compounds were identified, conventional mechanism-based approaches were used to identify new chemical entities for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Most of these have, however, failed to display any greater efficacy than existing psychotherapeutics and may, in fact, be less efficacious because of side effect liabilities. Among the reasons for this lack of success in drug discovery include a lack of fundamental knowledge regarding the causes of CNS disorders, the absence of biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring these conditions, a paucity of animal models that are congruent with the human disease state and the increasing likelihood that CNS conditions are multifactorial in their etiology. These challenges force the inclusion of a Phase IIa proof of concept trial as a component of the drug discovery program. Unlike other therapeutic areas, serendipity is a major factor in the CNS translational medicine interface requiring a close collaboration between preclinical and clinical scientists trained to appreciate unusual behavioral phenotypes. When combined with conventional target-based drug discovery technologies, this increases the likelihood of identifying truly novel drugs for the treatment of CNS disorders.",

Accepting that the combination of internal and external ideas can improve innovation, ways to access external innovation, that is, opening projects to external contributions, have recently been sought. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors look at a number of external innovation opportunities. These include increased interactions with academia via academic centers of excellence/innovation centers, better communication on projects using crowdsourcing or social media and new models centered on external providers such as built-to-buy startups or virtual pharmaceutical companies. EXPERT OPINION: The buzz for accessing external innovation relies on the pharmaceutical industry's major challenge to improve R&D productivity, a conjuncture favorable to increase interactions with academia and new business models supporting access to external innovation. So far, access to external innovation has mostly been considered during early stages of drug development, and there is room for enhancement. First outcomes suggest that external innovation should become part of drug development in the long term. However, the balance between internal and external developments in drug discovery can vary largely depending on the company strategies.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The interpretation of high-throughput profiling data depends on the pathway analysis database. Currently, pathway analysis often has to rely on a set of interactions and pathways measured in every possible human tissue, due to insufficient knowledge about interactions and pathways in the context of the profiling experiment. However, a recent global scale analysis of human tissue proteomes and interactomes reveals significant differences among tissues, suggesting that interaction and pathway data that are used out of biological context are the major source of inaccuracies and noise in the analysis of profiling data. Areas covered: In this review, the major classes of biological context used for experimental detection of molecular interactions and pathways in molecular biology are described. Furthermore, the author reviews methods for predicting biological interactions in order to evaluate the applicability of various contextual interaction data in pathway analysis. Using the results from recent publications that study large-scale tissue composition, the article provides an estimation of the gain in pathway analysis accuracy if only the interactions predicted for the context of a molecular profiling experiment are used, relative to the analysis performed with a context-independent knowledge base. Expert opinion: It is of the author's opinion that the major source of inaccuracy in pathway analysis is the lack of knowledge about tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. It is therefore suggested that the accuracy of the analysis can be substantially improved if only context-specific interactions and pathways are used for interpretation.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Since ancient times, the opium poppy has been used in a variety of settings, including pain management. Natural and synthetic derivatives of opium are commonly used in medicine today and include drugs, such as morphine, codeine, hydromorphone and oxycodone. Although excellent at inhibiting pain, these narcotics often produce a state of euphoria leading to misuse and abuse by the general population, particularly in young adults. The misuse of prescription opiates has continually increased over the past 10 years despite associated negative outcomes, resulting in opiate psychological dependence, withdrawal and relapse. Areas covered: This paper briefly refers to the history of opiate use and the modern challenges associated with chronic exposure. The authors present the prevalence of addiction and misuse of prescription opiates and discuss some of the opiate-associated effects. This includes activation of reward circuitry and compensatory receptor mechanisms. Finally, the authors provide a review on neuroadaptive changes that manifest during opiate dependence, withdrawal and relapse in animal models. Expert opinion: In spite of the various methods available to treat opiate addiction, there is still a huge unmet need for its management, including the creative design of novel, non-addictive pain medications. The authors believe that multifunctional compounds or combinations of compounds that inhibit pain pathways, whereas not activating the reward pathways, will begin to subdue the opiate addiction endemic.",

While emerging therapies such as EGFR inhibitors are improving treatment regimens, recent findings elucidating the role of cancer stem cells provide insights into opportunities for novel therapeutic intervention. Areas covered: This review provides a background on CRC statistics, colon anatomy and CRC pathobiology, CRC genetics and current and emerging therapies. Furthermore, the article discusses the role of developmental signaling pathways governing self-renewal biology as potential points for therapeutic intervention.

Developmental pathways such as Notch and Wnt provide opportunities to address this urgent need, and preclinical evidence supports targeting these pathways in CRC. Progress has been made toward this end, and while challenges persist, an increasing number of preclinical findings show promise.",

These computer-generated models enable the interactive large-scale analysis of structure-activity relationships (SARs) and complement traditional approaches to study SARs of individual compound series in a qualitative or quantitative manner. A variety of AL designs have been reported.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: The concept of activity landscapes is introduced and different methodologies to represent 2D or 3D AL representations of large compound data sets are described on the basis of original literature references. Several AL variants and extensions have been generated for special applications in medicinal chemistry. These include, for example, AL views of evolving data sets with constant topology, selectivity landscapes and multi-target ALs, or molecular mechanism and multi-property maps. Furthermore, the applicability domain of the AL concept is discussed including specific requirements for practical utility in medicinal chemistry opportunities for further developments.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: AL modeling has substantially extended conventional ways to study SARs. The AL concept is inseparable from the notion of activity cliffs that are of high interest in SAR analysis. AL design is an area of active research at the interface between chemoinformatics and medicinal chemistry with potential for further growth.

Retrospective analysis of recently marketed oral drugs shows that they frequently have highly optimized ligand efficiency values for their targets. Optimizing ligand efficiency metrics based on both molecular mass and lipophilicity, when set in the context of the specific target, has the potential to ameliorate the inflation of these properties that has been observed in current medicinal chemistry practice, and to increase the quality of drug candidates.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Outcome for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain tumor among adults, remains poor. However, two key treatment options have recently generated meaningful improvements in outcome for GBM patients. The addition of temozolomide (a methylating chemotherapeutic agent) to surgical resection and radiation therapy increases survival and is the first evidence that systemic chemotherapy can benefit GBM patients. Also, bevacizumab (a humanized mAb against VEGF) has significant antitumor activity among recurrent GBM patients. Additional areas of ongoing research are generating more therapeutic options that offer exciting potential to build on these results and further improve the outcome for malignant glioma patients. Areas covered: This review describes three foci of advanced clinical research aimed at improving the outcome of GBM patients: protracted temozolomide dosing, VEGF-inhibiting agents and integrin inhibitors. This review also discusses potential clinical trial strategies to evaluate irreversible EGFR inhibitors as well as therapeutics targeting PI3K and the hedgehog signaling pathway. Expert opinion: Several factors limit the efficacy of therapeutics targeting GBM. However, significant advances from basic science laboratories have recently generated important insights into the pathophysiology and molecular genetic abnormalities of these tumors. Efforts to translate these findings into innovative treatment strategies offer substantial promise to overcome therapeutic hurdles and treat individual patients more effectively. Improved understanding of malignant glioma biology and factors associated with treatment response will probably lead to improved therapeutic options and a better patient outcome.",

Histopathological hallmarks are represented by aggregates of beta-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) in senile plaques and deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Rare forms of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease are due to gene mutations. This has prompted researchers to develop genetically modified animals that could recapitulate the main features of the disease. The use of these models is complemented by non-genetically modified animals.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the characteristics of the most used transgenic (Tg) and non-Tg models of AD. The authors have focused on models mainly used in their laboratories including amyloid precursor protein (APP) Tg2576, APP/presenilin 1, 3xAD, single h-Tau, non-Tg mice treated with acute injections of A\u03b2 or tau, and models of physiological aging.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Animal models of disease might be very useful for studying the pathophysiology of the disease and for testing new therapeutics in preclinical studies but they do not reproduce the entire clinical features of human AD. When selecting a model, researchers should consider the various factors that might influence the phenotype. They should also consider the timing of testing/treating animals since the age at which each model develops certain aspects of the AD pathology varies.",

Furthermore, there are no drugs approved that treat the core symptoms of ASD. And while many drugs have had good outcomes in preclinical animal models, they have been met with very little success in human clinical trials. There are several factors likely contributing to this problem starting with the heterogeneity within the ASD phenotype. It is therefore important that researchers develop their knowledge about the neurobiological basis of ASD as well as possible subgroups within the disorder, based on either specific behavioral profiles or biological pathways. Furthermore, the development of valid biological markers will allow researchers to use more than parent or teacher reports to determine if a treatment is effective.

Some of these drugs have been shown to be beneficial and to increase SMN2 protein levels in SMA patients. The clear proof given by placebo-controlled clinical trials is still pending.

Conclusion: During embryogenesis, zebrafish start to coil their body by contracting trunk muscles 17 h postfertilization, indicating that a motor circuit and skeletal muscle are functionally developed at early stages. Mutagenesis screens in zebrafish have identified many motility mutants that display morphological or functional defects in the CNS, clustering defects of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junctions or pathological defects of muscles. Most of the muscular mutants are useful as animal models of human muscle disease such as muscle dystrophy. As zebrafish live in water, pharmacological drugs are easily assayable during development, and thus zebrafish may be used to determine novel drugs that mitigate muscle disease.",

The development of drugs that can discriminate between tumor cells and non-malignant cells would improve efficacy and reduce general side effects. Phage display allows identification of specific supramolecular complexes that can target therapeutic compounds or imaging agents, both in vitro and in vivo. The use of phage display to identify molecules expressed on the surface of human cancer cells without bias, as well as to provide initial steps toward identification of a ligand/receptor-based map of the human microvasculature, has broad implications for drug discovery in general, especially for cancer therapy. Objective/method: In this review, we discuss the use of phage display technology as a ligand-directed targeting strategy and its applications to drug discovery. Conclusion: Compared to other existing drug discovery platforms, phage display technology has the advantage to provide valuable clues pointing to target proteins in an unbiased biological context. The result from various display library screenings indicates that in many cases the selected peptide motifs mimic biological ligands. Analysis of peptide motifs targeting a receptor provides a basis for rational drug design of targeted peptidomimetics.",

Since these compounds are clearly safe for human consumption and ubiquitous in the food supply, they are highly attractive as lead compounds for drug discovery programs. However, as drugs, they are far from optimum. They are relatively unstable, poorly absorbed, and readily undergo a number of metabolic transformations by intestinal microbiota and human enzymes. Further, since these compounds target a wide array of biological systems, in-vivo testing is rather difficult since effects on alternative pathways need to be carefully eliminated.

        "abstract": "Bayesian statistical methods are being used increasingly in clinical research because the Bayesian approach is ideally suited to adapting to information that accrues during a trial, potentially allowing for smaller more informative trials and for patients to receive better treatment. Accumulating results can be assessed at any time, including continually, with the possibility of modifying the design of the trial, for example, by slowing (or stopping) or expanding accrual, imbalancing randomization to favour better-performing therapies, dropping or adding treatment arms, and changing the trial population to focus on patient subsets that are responding better to the experimental therapies. Bayesian analyses use available patient-outcome information, including biomarkers that accumulating data indicate might be related to clinical outcome. They also allow for the use of historical information and for synthesizing results of relevant trials. Here, I explain the rationale underlying Bayesian clinical trials, and discuss the potential of such trials to improve the effectiveness of drug development.",

In addition to efficacy targets, the characterization of epistatic proteins influencing compound activity often facilitates the elucidation of the underlying mechanism of action; and, further, early determination of off-targets that cause potentially unwanted secondary phenotypes helps in assessing potential liabilities. This short review discusses the most important technologies currently available for characterizing the direct and indirect target space of bioactive compounds following phenotypic screening. We present a comprehensive strategy employing complementary approaches to balance individual technology strengths and weaknesses.",

        "abstract": "As technology advances to the point at which various behaviours of seven-transmembrane (7TM) receptors (also known as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)) can be observed individually, it is clear that, rather than being 'on-off' switches, 7TM receptors are more akin to 'microprocessors' of information. This has introduced the phenomenon of functional selectivity, whereby certain ligands initiate only portions of the signalling mechanisms mediated by a given receptor, which has opened new horizons for drug discovery. The need to discover new 7TM receptor-ligand behaviours and quantify the effect of the drug on these complex systems, to guide medicinal chemistry, puts the pharmacological assay into the spotlight. This Perspective outlines the return to whole-system assays from reductionist recombinant systems, and discusses how the efficacy of a drug is linked to the particular assay used to observe its effects. It also highlights how these new assays are adding value to the drug discovery process.",

A major cause for this low efficiency is the failure of drug candidates in late-stage development owing to safety issues or previously undiscovered side-effects. We analyzed to what extent gene expression data can help to de-risk drug development in early phases by detecting the biological effects of compounds across disease areas, targets and scaffolds. For eight drug discovery projects within a global pharmaceutical company, gene expression data were informative and able to support go/no-go decisions. Our studies show that gene expression profiling can detect adverse effects of compounds, and is a valuable tool in early-stage drug discovery decision making.",

Although a direct link between QT interval prolongation and arrhythmogenesis is still unclear, QT prolongation is now the subject of increased regulatory review and is considered a significant risk factor for predicting human safety of New Chemical Entities. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies are striving to improve the drug discovery and development process to identify, as early as possible, the risk of novel agents, or their metabolites, of causing QT interval prolongation and to make appropriate go/no-go decisions or modify their development programme accordingly.",

The current suite of antibiotics used to treat TB faces two main difficulties: (i) the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of M. tuberculosis, and (ii) the persistent state of the bacterium, which is less susceptible to antibiotics and causes very long antibiotic treatment regimes. The complete genome sequences of a laboratory strain (H37Rv) and a clinical strain (CDC1551) of M. tuberculosis and the concurrent identification of all the open reading frames that encode proteins within this organism, present structural biologists with a wide array of protein targets for structure determination. Comparative genomics of the species that make up the M. tuberculosis complex has also added an array of genomic information to our understanding of these organisms. In response to this, structural genomics consortia have been established for targeting proteins from M. tuberculosis. This review looks at the progress of these major initiatives and the potential impact of large scale structure determination efforts on the development of inhibitors to many proteins. Increasing sophistication in structure-based drug design approaches, in combination with increasing numbers of protein structures and inhibitors for TB proteins, will have a significant impact on the downstream development of TB antibiotics.",

Structural information has paved the way for structure-guided drug discovery and laid the foundations for structural bioinformatics.

This review describes how structural knowledge gained from X-ray crystallog. has been used to advance other biophys. methods for structure detn. (and vice versa).

X-ray crystallog. has been, and will continue to serve as, the central source of exptl. structural biol. data used in the discovery of new drugs. However, other structural biol. techniques are useful not only to overcome the major limitation of X-ray crystallog., but also to provide complementary structural data that is useful in drug discovery. The use of recent advancements in biochem., spectroscopy and bioinformatics methods may revolutionize drug discovery, albeit only when these data are combined and analyzed with effective data management systems.

This approach offers several attractive properties for screening applications in drug discovery compared with other strategies, including the small quantities of target and ligands required, and the capacity to study ligands or targets without having to label them.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The need to improve drug research and development productivity continues to drive innovation in pharmacological assays. Technologies that can leverage the advantages of both molecular and phenotypic assays would hold great promise for discovery of new medicines. AREAS COVERED: This article briefly reviews current label-free platforms for cell-based assays and is primarily focused on fundamental aspects of these assays using dynamic mass redistribution technology as an example. The article also presents strategies for relating label-free profiles to molecular modes of actions of drugs. EXPERT OPINION: Emerging evidence suggests that label-free cellular assays are phenotypic in nature, yet permit molecular mechanistic deconvolution. Together with unique competency in throughput, sensitivity and pathway coverages, label-free cellular assays allow users to screen drugs against endogenous receptors in native cells (including disease relevant primary cells) and determine the molecular modes of action of drug molecules. However, there are challenges for label-free in both basic research and drug discovery: the deconvolution of the cellular and molecular mechanisms for the biosensor signatures of receptor-drug interactions, new methodologies for data analysis and the development of new biosensor technologies. These challenges will need to be met for the wide adoption of these assays in drug discovery.",

The most basic way for analyzing molecular graphs is using structural fragments, so-called subgraphs in graph theory. The mainstream technique in graph mining is frequent subgraph mining, by which we can retrieve essential subgraphs in given molecular graphs. In this article we explain the idea and procedure of mining frequent subgraphs from given molecular graphs, raising some real applications, and we describe the recent advances of graph mining.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Drug discovery and development is a typical multi-objective problem and its successes or failures depend on the simultaneous control of numerous, often conflicting, molecular and pharmacological properties. Multi-objective optimization strategies represent a new approach to capture the occurrence of varying optimal solutions based on trade-offs among the objectives taken into account. In view of this, multi-objective optimization aims to discover a set of satisfactory compromises that may in turn be used to find the global optimal solution by optimizing numerous dependent properties simultaneously. Areas covered: The authors review the potential of multi-objective strategies in a number of fields including: drug library design; substructure mining; the derivation of quantitative structure-activity relationship models; ranking of docking poses. The authors also discuss the potential of multi-objective strategies in controlling competing properties for absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination/toxicity optimization. Expert opinion: It is very clear to those who work in drug discovery and development that the success of rational drug design is largely dependent on the control of a number of, often conflicting, objectives. Therefore, multi-objective optimization methods, which have recently been introduced to the field of molecular discovery, represent the ultimate frontier in chemoinformatics. The widespread use of these multi-objective techniques has provided new opportunities in medicinal chemistry as seen through its use in a number of applications for chemoinformatics both within academia and the pharmaceutical industry.",

The goal is discovering high-quality leads in the initial stages of the development cycle, to minimize the costs associated with failures at later ones. Objective: Thus, there is a great amount of interest in further developing and optimizing high-throughput screening and in silico screening, the two methods responsible for generating most of the lead compounds. Although high-throughput screening is the predominant starting point for discovery programs, in silico methods have gradually made inroads by their more rational approach, to expedite the drug discovery and devel- opment process. Conclusion: Modern drug discovery strategies include both methods in tandem or in an iterative way. This review primarily provides a succinct overview and comparison of experimental and in silico screening techniques, selected case studies where both methods were used in concert to investigate their performance and complementary nature and a statement on the developments in experimental and in silico approaches in the near future.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The greatest advantage of using microfluidics as a platform for the assessment of cardiovascular drug action is its ability to finely regulate fluid flow conditions, including flow rate, shear stress and pulsatile flow. At the same time, microfluidics provide means for modifying the vessel geometry (bifurcations, stenoses, complex networks), the type of surface of the vessel walls, and for patterning cells in 3D tissue-like architecture, including generation of lumen walls lined with cells and heart-on-a-chip structures for mimicking ventricular cardiomyocyte physiology. In addition, owing to the small volume of required specimens, microfluidics is ideally suited to clinical situations whereby monitoring of drug dosing or efficacy needs to be coupled with minimal phlebotomy-related drug loss. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors highlight potential applications for the currently existing and emerging technologies and offer several suggestions on how to close the development cycle of microfluidic devices for cardiovascular drug discovery. EXPERT OPINION: The ultimate goal in microfluidics research for drug discovery is to develop 'human-on-a-chip' systems, whereby several organ cultures, including the vasculature and the heart, can mimic complex interactions between the organs and body systems. This would provide in vivo-like pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for drug ADMET assessment. At present, however, the great variety of available designs does not go hand in hand with their use by the pharmaceutical community",

This review analyzes ten years of SHAPES screens, in which potent leads were found for 70 - 80% of the targets screened, and discusses lessons learned about how best to apply fragment-based lead discovery in the pharmaceutical environment. Detailed examples of lead discovery and optimization for the kinases REDK and MK2 are given.

The authors also look at a number of other parameters including: early drug product formulations with method selection based on the biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS); in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) and different formulation strategies to enhance solubility; dissolution rate and permeability; bioavailability evaluation and quality by design as an opportunity to develop 'safe space' regions, where bioavailability is unaffected by pharmaceutical variations.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The biopharmaceutical requirements for absorption are solubility and permeability. Both are influenced by lipophilicity, but in the opposite way. The genomic methodology, coupled with combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening, structure-based design and in silico ADMET would yield parameters as a starting point for the biopharmaceutical properties determination in further preclinical and clinical studies. Consecutive stages in drug discovery and development are irreplaceable, but pharmacokinetics is the critical step. Selection of drug formulations based on the BCS, IVIVC are the principal aspects to enhance the solubility and dissolution rate, while a rationale management of pharmaceutical and technological factors will enhance the bioavailability.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Physiochemical drug properties, such as aqueous solubility are considered to be a major factor in determining the ultimate success or failure of experimental agents. Solubility is important because it determines the maximum dose which can be taken up. As the size and hydrophobicity of drug candidates has increased over the years, poor solubility has become a more prevalent issue. Recent examples from the literature show that an improved understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and solubility allows this issue to be approached using rational design. AREAS COVERED: This review provides selected examples from the recent drug discovery literature that demonstrate various tactics, which have been applied successfully towards improving drug solubility. The examples that were selected demonstrate the underlying principles behind aqueous solubility, such as hydrophobicity and crystalline stability. EXPERT OPINION: From a strategic point of view, improving the solubility of a compound should be straightforward because it can be accomplished by simply reducing hydrophobicity or crystalline stability. However, the structural elements and physical properties which control solubility also influence potency, pharmacokinetics and toxicity. Furthermore, there are practical aspects such as the quantity and quality of solubility-related data, which hamper the development of structure-solubility relationships. Given that poor aqueous solubility remains a primary issue in drug discovery, there is a continuous need for novel methods to overcome it.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Natural products (NPs) are evolutionarily designed and contain more complex and challenging structures than synthetic compounds. Since the 1980s, the pharmaceutical industry has gradually shifted to a strategy of developing targeted agents by screening libraries of synthetic compounds. However, NPs have recently received renewed focus as a rich repository for drug discovery. Irinotecan was developed as a derivative of camptothecin and was applied in standard regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) worldwide. Additionally, polysaccharide K is approved for CRC in Japan and Taiwan in combination with cytotoxic agents. However, after the approval of irinotecan in 1996, no anti-cancer agents derived from NPs have been approved for CRC. Areas covered: This review discusses NPs that are currently under investigation for the treatment of CRC. In addition, other NPs derived as purified ingredients and crude extracts are listed and also discussed. Expert opinion: The use of NPs for the discovery of anti-cancer agents has not been fully investigated. New technologies that are currently applied for synthetic compounds may be utilized for anti-cancer drug discovery including NPs for CRC.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: For well over a decade, significant effort has been devoted to the search for inhibitors of the human protein kinase family. This is increasingly translating into success in the clinic, with five new kinase inhibitor drugs approved since 2011. However, despite encouraging signs in other areas, success has been largely restricted to oncology.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This article reviews the prospects for kinase inhibitor drug discovery in oncology and other therapeutic areas. Major topics include the application of kinome profiling and lessons learned from kinase system-based research. With these fields nearing maturity, the validation of kinases as targets or their classification as liabilities is becoming increasingly pertinent. Other topics include a discussion of the properties required of good small molecule kinase probes.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The tractability of protein kinases to small molecule discovery through system-based research is excellent, and adequate selectivity can often be achieved. With advances in screening methodology now enabling compound profiling across most of the kinome, researchers involved in drug discovery must decide what inhibition profiles are desirable. However, this assessment must be made on the basis of incomplete understanding of the disease biology of most kinases, and as a result there is a significant risk that drugs entering clinical trials will lack efficacy. Because of this, as well as greater effort to determine which kinases are therapeutically relevant for particular diseases, opportunities for quality pre-candidate compounds developed for specific indications to find alternative uses should be maximised by early screening through panels of phenotypic assays.",

With discovery now driven primarily by chemistry and high-throughput screening, the biological effects and, in particular, the toxicity of new compounds are largely not appreciated until a compound enters development. Arguably, this paradigm has produced more failures rather than delivering more successes--with more chemicals to examine, much less is known about any single agent before costly development studies are initiated.

Therefore, IPK studies can provide a bridge between in vitro findings and in vivo disposition. This review paper begins with a detailed overview of IPK methodology (system components, surgical procedure, study design). Various applications of the IPK are then presented. These applications include characterizing renal excretion mechanisms, screening for clinically significant drug interactions, studying renal drug metabolism, and correlating renal drug disposition with drug-induced changes in kidney function. Lastly, the role of IPK studies in drug development is discussed. Demonstrated correlations between IPK data and clinical outcomes make the IPK model a potentially useful tool for drug discovery and evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Bacterial riboswitches are structured RNA domains usually residing at the 5\u2032 untranslated region of messenger RNAs that can directly bind specific metabolites. They serve as logic gates regulating gene expression. As a result, riboswitches enable mRNAs to regulate their own expression without the need for any regulatory proteins. The first riboswitches were found just 10 years ago. Over the last decade, more than dozen different riboswitch classes were identified in many bacterial species, and their number is still growing. These findings indicate that bacteria widely use RNA switches to sense changes in cell physiology and to regulate metabolic pathways. Areas covered: The authors discuss the main mechanisms for riboswitch control of gene expression in bacteria. Various riboswitch classes were found in human bacterial pathogens to control the synthesis of essential cell metabolites as discussed in this review. Some riboswitches can be used as novel targets for antibacterial drug discovery. This review presents the current and possible future high-throughput screening approaches for targeting riboswitches in the process of drug development. Expert opinion: Bacterial riboswitches of 17 different classes are discovered in 36 human bacterial pathogens that can be targeted for addressing the ever-growing need for new antibiotics. In this regard, the adaptation of various in silico, in vitro, and in vivo high-throughput screening methods for probing specific RNA switches are crucial for the success of antibacterial drug discovery process. \u00a9 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Importance of the field: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of predominantly elderly individuals worldwide. Despite intensive efforts devoted to drug discovery, the disease remains incurable. Compounding this problem is the current lack of a truly representative mammalian model of PD. However, a number of non-mammalian models of PD have been created in recent years that hold tremendous promise to accelerate our understanding of the disease as well as to transform the drug discovery process. Areas covered in this review: This review provides an overview of the various Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila genetic models of PD that have been generated to date and discusses the utility of these model systems in the identification of molecules of potential therapeutic value for the PD patient. What the reader will gain: Readers will appreciate the strengths (and limitations) of C. elegans and Drosophila in modeling salient features of the disease as well as their usefulness in uncovering novel gene-gene interaction and pathways relevant to PD pathogenesis. Readers will also appreciate how technological advancements have allowed the direct evaluation of novel compounds in these living models of PD in a virtually high-throughput manner. Take home message: Non-mammalian models of PD provide a valuable in vivo platform for drug screening. Unlike cell-based systems, these living models with an intact nervous system allow for a more meaningful evaluation of the neuroprotective properties of genetic and chemical modifiers to be conducted.",

SOI allows the growth and metastatic potential of the transplanted tumors to be expressed and reflects clinical cancer of all types. Effective drugs can be discovered and evaluated in the SOI models utilizing human tumor cell lines and patient tumors.

Tumors and metastases in the SOI models that express fluorescent proteins can be visualized noninvasively in intact animals, greatly facilitating drug discovery.

In the authors' previous studies, it was demonstrated that the distribution of the corresponding activity and solubility data followed Benford's law distribution. It was also shown that too intense a selection of training data sets of regression model can disrupt Benford's law.

They also suggest that Benford's law could also be applied to model building and reliability for structure-activity relationship study.

Indeed, the line between basic and applied science is constantly being eroded, not least because of the increasing sophistication of therapeutic procedures and the complexity of the diseases that they aim to treat. Here, we look at the new technologies that are being explored as a way of reducing drug attrition rates and the development of chemical drugs and biotherapeutics. Specifically, we will consider the ways in which genomics and related disciplines, engineered cell-based and microfluidics systems, and nanotechnologies are being developed and used alongside in silico platforms during early drug pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies. The way in which information from such systems biology-oriented approaches can be integrated with information from animal based preclinical safety, toxicological and pharmacological studies on investigative medicinal products is considered, in view of its current and possible impact on clinical trial design. 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Drug transporters are transmembrane proteins that facilitate the transfer of substances in and out of cells and play a substantial role in drug absorption, distribution and elimination. During the drug discovery and development phases, in vitro assays are important tools to identify substrates and inhibitors of transporters. This article provides an overview of in vitro transporter assays, discussing their advantages, limitations, and sources of variability. Membrane-based assays take advantage of the location of efflux transporters for measurements of drug interactions. Cell-based systems are functional transporter assays that measure the passage of drugs across cell membranes and transporter proteins. Use of optimized and validated in vitro transporter assays during drug discovery and development leads to a greater confidence in their results in detg. whether a new compd. is a substrate or inhibitor. The concept of transporter method suitability provides a general scheme to improve predictability and reduce variability of the in vitro assays by incorporating assay validation, acceptance criteria, and probe substrates and inhibitors. Such a scheme can potentially improve assay reproducibility and allow in vitro transporter assays to aid in defining a test compd. as a substrate or inhibitor of efflux and uptake transporters.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Mycobacterium tuberculosis kills more people than any other bacterial pathogen. New drugs are required to shorten the treatment time and provide a viable therapy for drug-resistant and latent forms of tuberculosis. The tuberculosis field has advanced considerably since the publication of the M. tuberculosis genome sequence. Today, researchers can build a high definition map of the pathogen's traits and behavior and select individual targets for chemical disruption. Areas covered: This review examines the discovery of current clinical and candidate tuberculosis drugs. It outlines recent developments in the selection of molecular targets for the discovery of new anti-mycobacterial agents. It appraises techniques that incorporate target knowledge into the screening protocol. These techniques include in silico, in vitro enzyme-based, differential antisense sensitivity and gene expression screening systems. The review also looks ahead to further techniques that may be applied in tuberculosis drug discovery. Expert opinion: The adoption of an 'either/or' approach to targeted or random tuberculosis drug screening is not expected. The historical success of random screening in providing the tuberculosis drugs currently in clinical use is likely to ensure that non-targeted protocols retain an important role in drug screening. However, a number of M. tuberculosis inhibitors in lead optimization and preclinical development have been discovered using targeted methods. Realization of the first clinically-approved tuberculosis drugs derived from targeted screening and continued refinements in targeted screening technologies are likely to increase the adoption of targeted approaches in the future.",

Using case studies, we describe how this approach has rapidly identified candidate medications suitable for clinical trials in disorders such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Molecular topology (MT) has emerged in recent years as a powerful approach for the in silico generation of new drugs. One key part of MT is that, in the process of drug design/discovery, there is no need for an explicit knowledge of a drug's mechanism of action unlike other drug discovery methods.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors introduce the topic by explaining briefly the most common methodology used today in drug design/discovery and address the most important concepts of MT and the methodology followed (QSAR equations, LDA, etc.). Furthermore, the significant results achieved, from this approach, are outlined and discussed.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The results outlined herein can be explained by considering that MT represents a new paradigm in the field of drug design. This means that it is not only an alternative method to the conventional methods, but it is also independent, that is, it represents a pathway to connect directly molecular structure with the experimental properties of the compounds (particularly drugs). Moreover, the process can be realized also in the reverse pathway, that is, designing new molecules from their topological pattern, what opens almost limitless expectations in new drugs development, given that the virtual universe of molecules is much greater than that of the existing ones.",

All the antidepressant drugs now in use--the forerunner of which was discovered serendipitously 50 years ago--modulate monoamine neurotransmission, and take six to eight weeks to exert their effects, but each drug is efficacious in only 60-70% of patients. A conceptually novel antidepressant that acted rapidly and safely in a high proportion of patients would almost certainly become the world's bestselling drug. Yet such a drug is not on the horizon. Here, we cover the different phases of antidepressant drug discovery in the past, present and future, and comment on the challenges and opportunities for antidepressant research.",

Disease models derived from iPSCs that manifest cellular disease phenotypes have been established for several monogenic diseases, but iPSCs can likewise be used for phenotype-based drug screens in complex diseases for which the underlying genetic mechanism is unknown. Here, we highlight recent advances as well as limitations in the use of iPSC technology for modelling a 'disease in a dish' and for testing compounds against human disease phenotypes in vitro. We discuss how iPSCs are being exploited to illuminate disease pathophysiology, identify novel drug targets and enhance the probability of clinical success of new drugs.",

        "abstract": "The pharmaceutical industry continues to struggle to bring new and innovative medicines to the market. Possible reasons for these challenges are the paradigms currently used during drug discovery and development. Over the last 15 years, our ability to study the pathology of human disease has increased tremendously. For example, the advent of human embryonic stem cells, and later the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells, now make it possible to access large quantities of human specialized cells, address the issue of genetic diversity and to create disease models in a culture dish. Recently, the potential of pluripotent stem-cell technologies in the pursuit of new medicines has been demonstrated through the in vitro recreation of many human diseases, and the subsequent use of these models in proof-of-concept drug screens. Ultimately, this can, together with the unlimited access to relevant human cells, aid in reducing both cost and attrition rate of new drug candidates. The field is now open for large-scale application of stem-cell-derived cells for both drug screening and safety assessment.",

However, their complex pathophysiology is only partially reflected in classical rodent models, limiting their predictivity, and new compounds frequently fail in clinical trials. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more predictive and reliable animal models. Humanised mouse models seem to combine the convenience of small animal models with good correlation to the situation in patients and, thus, promise to be a valuable technique for translational medicine. Here, the authors summarise how mice can be humanised and which humanised models for inflammatory skin diseases exist. Application of these models in drug discovery and their advantages and limitations are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the clinical management of depression has been revolutionized by the introduction of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and serotonin/noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors. However, despite this progress, several unmet medical needs remain. These challenges, which collectively represent the next frontier for antidepressant drug discovery, range from improving efficacy in treatment-resistant patients, to accelerating onset of therapeutic activity, to reducing deleterious side effects such as emesis or sexual dysfunction. The present review addresses some of the innovative approaches designed to create novel therapies that improve in one or more of these areas. Additionally, the authors propose that to discover truly novel disease-modifying agents we must improve our appreciation of disease etiology, pathophysiology and genetics. Therefore, while it is still very early in the characterization of these strategies - as well as our general understanding of disease progression - the next several years should allow sufficient time for one (or more) of these approaches to differentiate themselves from current therapies. \u00a9 2007 Informa UK Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Background: Fiber-optic nanosensors are fabricated by heating and pulling optical fibers to yield sub-micron diameter tips and have been used for in vitro analysis of individual living mammalian cells. immobilization of bioreceptors (e.g., antibodies, peptides, DNA) selective to targeting analyte molecules of interest provides molecular specificity. Excitation light can be launched into the fiber, and the resulting evanescent field at the tip of the nanofiber can be used to excite target molecules bound to the bioreceptor molecules. The fluorescence or surface-enhanced Raman scattering produced by the analyte molecules is detected using an ultra-sensitive photodetector. Objective: This article provides an overview of the development and application of fiber-optic nanosensors for drug discovery. Conclusions: The nanosensors provide minimally invasive tools to probe subcellular compartments inside single living cells for health effect studies (e.g., detection of benzopyrene adducts) and medical applications (e.g., monitoring of apoptosis in cells treated with anticancer drugs).",

A macrocycle provides diverse functionality and stereochemical complexity in a conformationally pre-organized ring structure. This can result in high affinity and selectivity for protein targets, while preserving sufficient bioavailability to reach intracellular locations. Despite these valuable characteristics, and the proven success of more than 100 marketed macrocycle drugs derived from natural products, this structural class has been poorly explored within drug discovery. This is in part due to concerns about synthetic intractability and non-drug-like properties. This Review describes the growing body of data in favour of macrocyclic therapeutics, and demonstrates that this class of compounds can be both fully drug-like in its properties and readily prepared owing to recent advances in synthetic medicinal chemistry.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Over the past three decades, the predominant paradigm in drug discovery was designing selective ligands for a specific target to avoid unwanted side effects. However, in the last 5 years, the aim has shifted to take into account the biological network in which they interact. Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology (QSP) is a new paradigm that aims to understand how drugs modulate cellular networks in space and time, in order to predict drug targets and their role in human pathophysiology. Areas covered: This review discusses existing computational and experimental QSP approaches such as polypharmacology techniques combined with systems biology information and considers the use of new tools and ideas in a wider 'systems-level' context in order to design new drugs with improved efficacy and fewer unwanted off-target effects. Expert opinion: The use of network biology produces valuable information such as new indications for approved drugs, drug-drug interactions, proteins-drug side effects and pathways-gene associations. However, we are still far from the aim of QSP, both because of the huge effort needed to model precisely biological network models and the limited accuracy that we are able to reach with those. Hence, moving from 'one molecule for one target to give one therapeutic effect' to the 'big systems-based picture' seems obvious moving forward although whether our current tools are sufficient for such a step is still under debate.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Although the Cannabis sativa herb has been known for its therapeutic benefit for centuries, the interest in the clinical potential of cannabinoid-based drugs escalated after the discovery of the endocannabinoid system. The understanding of their actions at the molecular level indicates that the therapeutic applications of cannabinoids (plant-derived or synthetic) may be diverse. Several drugs containing cannabinoids are currently used in the therapy of emesis, pain and spasticity. Areas covered: This drug discovery case history reviews the preclinical and clinical development of Sativex ('delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol'; nabiximols). Sativex is the first licensed phytocannabinoid-based drug approved, or in the process of approval, as therapy for indications such as MS-associated spasticity or chronic pain. Sativex contains a combination of two cannabinoids in approximately equal quantities (\u03b4-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol) and is administered via an oromucosal pump spray, aiming at minimising psychotropic side effects and first pass effect. Pivotal clinical safety and efficacy data that led to Sativex's approval are discussed, as well as issues that have arisen with its clinical usage. Expert opinion: Although pleiotrophic effects of cannabinoids may raise complex issues beyond their symptomatic effects, standardised pharmaceutical cannabinoids may constitute a useful addition to the pharmacotherapeutic armamentarium in chronic conditions insufficiently alleviated by existing drugs. \u00a9 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.",

The emerging field of nanotechnology has revolutionised the way cancer therapy and diagnosis is achieved primarily due to the recent advances in material engineering and drug availability. Further, the recognition of the crucial role played by anti-apoptotic proteins such as survivin, has initiated the development of therapeutics that can target this protein as an attempt to develop alternative cancer therapies. However, a key challenge faced in drug development is the efficient delivery of survivin-targeted molecules to specific areas in the body.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review primarily focuses on the different strategies employing nanotechnology for targeting survivin expressed in human cancers. Different nanomaterials incorporating nucleic molecules or drugs targeted at survivin are discussed and the results obtained from studies are highlighted.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: There are extensive studies reporting different treatment regimens for cancer, however, they still result in systemic toxicity, reduced bioavailability and ineffective delivery. Novel approaches involve the use of biocompatible nanomaterials together with gene or drug molecules to target proteins such as survivin, which is overexpressed in cancerous cells. These nanoformulations allow the benefits of protecting easily degradable molecules, allow controlled release, and enhance targeted delivery and effectiveness. Hence, nanotherapy utilizing survivin targeting can be considered to play a key role in the development of personalized nanomedicine for cancer.",

        "abstract": "Changes in technology can often affect society and models of industry. The broad expectations for 'genomics' that were highly publicized during the previous decade have not materialized at the rate predicted. However, with the completion of the human genome, it is now possible to identify individual subject DNA profiles using platforms that measure thousands of genetic variants simultaneously and at a diminishing cost. Genome-wide screening affects two important components for success of the pharmaceutical industry. The first is drug discovery with the identification and selection of the right target for a disease or medical indication. The second involves crucial decisions required during drug development, related to proof of efficacy sufficient enough to support the enormous cost commitment for drug development. Using Alzheimer's disease as an example, the combined application of genome-wide screening, candidate gene analyses and efficacy pharmacogenetics is presented. The drivers for the industry for an evolution of present drug development come from the economic and regulatory environments, each of which are changing. The anticipated successes are effective and safe medicines for unmet medical needs, with a framework for sustaining drug pipelines. \u00a9 2007 Informa UK Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The design of target-specific covalent inhibitors is conceptually attractive because of increased biochemical efficiency through covalency and increased duration of action that outlasts the pharmacokinetics of the agent. Although many covalent inhibitors have been approved or are in advanced clinical trials to treat indications such as cancer and hepatitis C, there is a general tendency to avoid them as drug candidates because of concerns regarding immune-mediated toxicity that can arise from indiscriminate reactivity with off-target proteins. Areas covered: The review examines potential reason(s) for the excellent safety record of marketed covalent agents and advanced clinical candidates for emerging therapeutic targets. A significant emphasis is placed on proteomic techniques and chemical/biochemical reactivity assays that aim to provide a systematic rank ordering of pharmacologic selectivity relative to off-target protein reactivity of covalent inhibitors. Expert opinion: While tactics to examine selective covalent modification of the pharmacologic target are broadly applicable in drug discovery, it is unclear whether the output from such studies can prospectively predict idiosyncratic immune-mediated drug toxicity. Opinions regarding an acceptable threshold of protein reactivity/body burden for a toxic electrophile and a non-toxic electrophilic covalent drug have not been defined. Increasing confidence in proteomic and chemical/biochemical reactivity screens will require a retrospective side-by-side profiling of marketed covalent drugs and electrophiles known to cause deleterious toxic effects via non-selective covalent binding.",

They provide information about disease pathophysiology--and equally importantly, healthy function; confirmation (or refutation) of potential drug targets; validation (or otherwise) of other models employed; and functional models for assessing drugs' effects, whether beneficial or undesirable, in the most appropriate environment that can be replicated outside the human body. While human tissues have long been prized by pathologists in furthering our understanding of disease processes, there is a growing appreciation of their value at the late pre-clinical stage of drug discovery. Human tissues' potential to contribute to earlier phases of the process, before significant resources have been expended, is also now gaining recognition. Mounting concern over high rates of clinical stage drug failures mandates exploration of avenues for improving efficiency. Human tissue-based assays could play a key role in improving the translation process, as well as in moving towards stratified or personalised medicines. This editorial highlights some of the potential benefits of introducing human biosamples at each stage of the research process as a drug moves from concept to clinic. Some of the challenges with respect to obtaining tissues, minimising variability and gaining acceptance are also discussed.",

It allows the improvement of the stability; oral absorption; membrane permeability; and absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of drug candidate, while retaining their biological properties. The term 'bioisostere' is derived from 'isostere', whose physical and chemical properties, such as steric size, hydrophobicity, and electronegativity, are similar to those of a functional or atomic group, and is considered to possess biological properties. Here, the authors highlight the recent applications of bioisosteres in drug design, mainly based on our drug discovery studies. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the application of bioisosteres for novel drug discovery with focus on the authors' drug discovery studies such as renin, HIV-protease, and \u03b2-secretase inhibitors. The authors highlight that some bioisosteres can form the scaffolding for drug candidates, namely substrate transition state, amide/ester, and carboxylic acid bioisosteres. Moreover, the authors propose the new terms 'electron-donor bioisostere' and 'conformational bioisostere' for drug discovery. EXPERT OPINION: The authors discuss the importance of bioisostere's design concept based on specific interaction with the corresponding biomolecule. In addition, some strategies for drug discovery based on the bioisostere concept are introduced. Many bioisosteres, which are recognized by corresponding target biomolecules as exhibiting similar biological properties, have been reported to date; most of the recently developed bioisosteres were designed by cheminformatics approaches. Some molecular design softwares and databases are introduced.",

It is becoming a growing health-economic problem worldwide. Over the past two decades, there has been considerable progress in the availability of compounds with antiresorptive or anabolic activity on bone. However, existing therapeutic strategies still have limitations. Areas covered: In this review, the authors summarize past and current approaches for the development of antiresorptive and anabolic agents for osteoporosis together with their mechanisms of action. They also provide discussion on the application of new technologies for novel osteoporosis drug discovery. Expert opinion: Thanks to the recent advances in molecular biology over the past few years, novel therapeutic targets for antiresorptive or anabolic compounds have been discovered and several promising new drugs are in preclinical and clinical development. Despite these advances, the current understanding of the mechanisms regulating bone remodeling is far from complete, leaving significant drawbacks to the discovery and the clinical development of novel therapeutic agents. Hopefully, improvements in functional genomics and bioinformatics, along with new technological approaches such as RNA silencing, quantitative proteomics, metabolomics, and the use of mesenchymal stem cells, will address these issues and widen our options for treating several disorders of bone metabolism, including osteoporosis.",

Recent developments in RNA interference (RNAi) technology in in vivo models promise to further improve upon the static and irreversible features of gene knockouts. Chemical genetic approaches create novel functional alleles of targets and allow fine modulation of protein function in vivo by small molecules, providing the most pharmacologically relevant target validation. Using these advanced models, one can not only ask whether the function of the target is critical for the initiation and maintenance of the disease, but also whether therapies designed to alter the function of the target would be safe and efficacious. In this review, we describe various in vivo tools for target validation in mouse models, discuss advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and give examples of their impact on drug discovery.",

Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) databases covering almost a century's worth of journal articles and patent documents are among the best known and widely used for searching information on compounds. Today's research presents a new challenge, however, as the boundaries of chemistry and biological sciences overlap increasingly. This trend is especially true in the drug discovery field where published findings relating to both chemical and biological entities and their interactions are examined. CAS has expanded its resources to meet the requirements of the new, interdisciplinary challenges faced by today's researchers. This is evident both in the content of CAS databases, which have been expanded to include more biology-related information, and in the technology of the search tools now available to researchers on their desktop. It is the integration of content and search-and-retrieval technology that enables new insights to be made in the vast body of accumulated information.

        "abstract": "Neuropathic pain can be described as pain associated with damage or permanent alteration of the peripheral or central nervous system. In contrast to acute nociceptive pain, the cascade of events that arise following peripheral nerve injury leads to a maintained abnormality in the sensory system, resulting in an abnormal pain phenomenon that can be grossly debilitating. At present, there are very few effective and well-tolerated therapies for neuropathic pain. The development of animal models and constant progress in the understanding of the basic pathophysiology of neuropathic pain has led to multifarious drug targets and treatment options. The most effective agents are use-dependent inhibitors of Na+ channels, namely phenytoin, lamotrigine and carbamazepine. Owing to an effect of increase in the serotonin and various other biogenic amine levels on the pain modulating system, various classes of antidepressants including selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors are being used clinically. Modulation of Ca2+ channels is another useful approach for the treatment of neuropathic pain. In particular, the modulation of N-type Ca2+ channels, which are expressed primarily in central and peripheral nervous tissues, has been the subject of greatest interest. In view of the above, this review discusses the various strategies and approaches to novel drug discovery and pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain syndromes. (copyright) 2007 Informa UK Ltd.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chagas disease is the highest impact human infectious disease in Latin America, and the leading worldwide cause of myocarditis. Despite the availability of several compounds that have demonstrated efficacy in limiting the effects of T. cruzi, these compounds are rarely used due to their variable efficacy, substantial side effects and the lack of methodologies for confirming their effectiveness. Furthermore, the development of more efficacious compounds is challenged by limitations of systems for assessing drug efficacy in vitro and in vivo. AREAS COVERED: Herein, the authors review the development of Chagas disease drug discovery methodology, focusing on recent developments in high throughput screening, in vivo testing methods and assessments of efficacy in humans. Particularly, this review documents the significant progress that has taken place over the last 5 years that have paved the way for both target-focused and high-throughput screens of compound libraries. EXPERT OPINION: The tools for in vitro and in vivo screening of anti-T. cruzi compounds have improved dramatically in the last few years and there are now a number of excellent in vivo testing models available; this somewhat alleviates the bottleneck issue of quickly and definitively demonstrating in vivo efficacy in a relevant host animal system. These advances emphasize the potential for additional progress resulting in new treatments for Chagas disease in the coming years. That being said, national and international agencies must improve the coordination of research and development efforts in addition to cultivating the funding sources for the development of these new treatments.",

In this perspective article, we propose that the true limiting factor for molecular dynamics is rather the high hardware and electrical power costs, which constrain not only the length of runs but also the number that can be performed concurrently. As a result of innovation in accelerator processors and high-throughput protocols, the cost of molecular dynamics sampling has been dramatically reduced and we argue that molecular dynamics simulation is now placed to become a key technology for in silico drug discovery in terms of binding pathways, poses, kinetics and affinities.",

Recently, several in vitro tissue-like microsystems, also known as 'organs-on-a-chip', have emerged to provide new tools for better evaluating the effects of various chemicals on human tissue. Areas covered: The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the organs-on-a-chip systems that have been recently developed. First, the authors introduce single-organ platforms, focusing on the most studied organs such as liver, heart, blood vessels and lung. Later, the authors briefly describe tumor-on-a-chip platforms and highlight their application for testing anti-cancer drugs. Finally, the article reports a few examples of other organs integrated in microfluidic chips along with preliminary multiple-organs-on-a-chip examples. The article also highlights key fabrication points as well as the main application areas of these devices. Expert opinion: This field is still at an early stage and major challenges need to be addressed prior to the embracement of these technologies by the pharmaceutical industry. To produce predictive drug screening platforms, several organs have to be integrated into a single microfluidic system representative of a humanoid. The routine production of metabolic biomarkers of the organ constructs, as well as their physical environment, have to be monitored prior to and during the delivery of compounds of interest to be able to translate the findings into useful discoveries.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome associated with underlying illness and characterized by loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass. Systemic inflammation plays a central role in its pathophysiology. As millions of patients are in a cachectic state of chronic disease, cachexia is one of the major causes of death worldwide. Difficulties in the recruitment and follow-up of clinical trials mean that well-characterized animal models are of great importance in developing cachexia therapies. However, some of the widely used animal models have limitations in procedural reproducibility or in recapitulating in the cachectic phenotype, which has warranted the development of novel models for cachexia. Areas covered: This review focuses on some of the currently developing rodent models designed to mimic each co-morbidity in cachexia. Expert opinion: Through developing cancer models, researchers have been seeking more targets for intervention. In cardiac cachexia, technical issues have been overcome by transgenic models. Furthermore, the development of new animal models has enabled the elucidation of the roles of inflammation, anabolism/catabolism in muscle/fat tissue and anorexia on cachexia. As metabolic and inflammatory pathways in cachexia may compromise cardiac muscle, the analysis of cardiac function/tissue in non-cardiac cachexia may be a useful component of cachexia assessment common to different underlying diseases and pave the way for novel drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) constitute one of the most important signaling pathways, playing a vital role in cellular differentiation and proliferation with a key function in cellular receptor triggered signal transduction downstream of tyrosine kinase receptors and/or G-protein coupled receptors. PI3K promotes cell survival proliferation, protein synthesis and glucose metabolism by generating secondary messengers phospholipid phosphatidyl 3,4,5-triphosphate and signaling via AKT/mTOR regulation. Deregulation of PI3K pathways have been observed in cancer, diabetes, neurological and inflammatory diseases and is an attractive target for pharmaceutical industries. Areas covered: In this review, the authors explain different PI3K assay methodologies. Furthermore, the authors summarize the techno-scientific principles and their utility in profiling novel chemical entities against PI3Ks. Specifically, the authors compare different PI3K assay formats explaining their mode of detection as well as their advantages and limitations for drug discovery efforts. Expert opinion: Developing lipid (PI3K) kinase assays involves significant effort and a rational understanding is needed due to the intrinsic lipidic nature of phospholipid phosphatidyl 4,5-biphosphate, which is used as an in vitro substrate for assays with PI3K isoforms. The assay of choice should be versatile, homogenous and definitely adaptable for high-throughput screening campaigns. Additionally, these assays are expected to dissect the mechanism of action of novel compounds (inhibitor characterization) against PI3K. Existing methods provide the versatility to medicinal chemists such that they can choose one or more assay platform to progress their compounds while profiling and/or inhibitor characterization.",

Conversely, impaired biosynthesis of H2S is associated with important diseases. This paves the way to exciting pharmacological perspectives for drugs acting on the \"H2S system\". Areas covered: This paper attempts to overview the most representative compounds acting as sources of exogenous H2S and are promising drugs for a number of serious disorders: hypertension, heart diseases, asthma, neurodegenerations, etc. Fewest H2S-releasing drugs have been evaluated in models of human diseases, with truly exciting results. Natural H2S-donors are also present in edible plants and the release of H2S accounts for the beneficial effects on the human health. A limited number of other compounds showing heterogeneous H2S-releasing moieties have been reported, but poorly characterized by pharmacological point of view. Expert opinion: The rate of H2S generation, the physicochemical characteristics and the bioavailability greatly affect the overall pharmacological profile of each H2S-releasing compound.

This has come about both through the concerted effort of the research community and through the development of technologies essential to the area. The importance of the epigenetic control of the immune system is becoming increasingly clear, and therefore epigenetics presents itself as an attractive, and potentially ground-breaking, entry point to tackle immune-mediated conditions. The advances in our understanding are in part due to the development of next generation sequencing technologies and chromatin immunoprecipitation. When combined, these approaches have allowed studies at the chromatin level to understand cellular responses to cell-external cues on a genome scale. This has contributed significantly to improved understanding of chromatin, its regulation through histone post-translational modification (PTM), and the enzymes and proteins involved in \u2018writing\u2019, \u2018reading\u2019 and \u2018erasing\u2019 these histone PTMs. In this review we focus specifically on the progress made in understanding the mechanisms involved in modulating histone methylation in the context of immunity and discuss the potential, and the challenges, presented by this exciting area for drug discovery.",

Given that these predictions are based on enzyme kinetic parameters observed from in vitro experiments, the miscalculation of the inhibitory potency of a compound can lead to an inaccurate prediction of an in vivo drug interaction, potentially precluding a safe drug from advancing in development or allowing a potent inhibitor to 'slip' into the patient population. Here, we describe the principles underlying the generation of in vitro drug metabolism data and highlight commonly encountered uncertainties and sources of bias and error that can affect extrapolation of drug-drug interaction information to the clinical setting.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The ultimate objective of optimizing adsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) parameters in drug discovery is to maximize the unbound concentration at the site of action for a given dose level. This has the added benefit of minimizing the efficacious dose, reducing the potential for attrition related to drug burden and direct organ toxicity. The concept of drug efficiency was formulated as a tool to obtain a balanced profile between target affinity and ADME properties during lead optimization. Areas covered: The authors discuss how it is possible to maximize the in vivo pharmacological potential addressing whether drug efficiency adds value to the decision-making process and whether it is possible to introduce a single optimization parameter, the drug efficiency index (DEI), linking target affinity and ADME properties, as a marker of in vivo efficacy. Expert opinion: In the absence of a clear hypothesis-driven approach at the beginning of the program (i.e., pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic link), the objective to select molecules with a low therapeutic dose is still a major hurdle in drug discovery. The authors believe that a greater strategic focus on mechanistically relevant measures of the determinants of receptor occupancy would help the optimization and selection process. In this respect, the introduction of the DEI, which can be seen as a correction of target affinity by the in vivo pharmacokinetic potential, may help drug discovery to select and promote those molecules with the highest probability to interact with the biological target and with the best balance between target affinity and ADME properties.",

The selective overexpression of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) in tumor cells induces the metabolism of benzothiazole and aminoflavone compounds to their reactive species, which are responsible for DNA adduct formation and cell death. This review encompasses the novelty of CYP1A1 as an anticancer drug target and explores the possible in silico strategies that would be applicable in the discovery and development of future antitumor compounds.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review highlights the various ligand-based and target-based in silico methodologies that were efficiently used in exploration of CYP1A1 as a novel antitumor target. These methodologies include electronic structure analysis, CoMFA studies, homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics analysis, pharmacophore mapping and quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies. It also focuses on the various approaches used in the development of the lysyl amide prodrug of 5F-203 (NSC710305) and dimethanesulfonate salt of 5-aminoflavone (NSC710464) as clinical candidates from their less potent analogues.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Selective overexpression of CYP1A1 in cancer cells offers tumor-specific drug design to ameliorate the current adverse effects associated with existing antitumor agents. Medicinal chemistry and in vitro driven approaches, in combination with knowledge-based drug design and by using the currently available tools of in silico methodologies, would certainly make it possible to design and develop novel anticancer compounds targeting CYP1A1.",

However, pathways needed to make sure that biomarker data are accepted by regulatory agencies may be considered an unnecessary burden on the critical path for drug development. There is the need to consider early in discovery and development that these pathways for biomarker acceptance or qualification not only are necessary, but may also enhance the success of novel therapies through regulatory review and clinical use. There also needs to be a focus on the challenge in the application of biomarkers as these approach regulatory evaluation. Regulatory guidance is needed on how a patient population may be defined by the molecular phenotype classification associated with specific mutations in patient genomes. Enzyme replacement therapies have been implicitly approved in the past assuming a molecular phenotype of a defective enzyme, but these and other precedents have not yet been translated into regulatory guidance. A second regulatory pathway for biomarkers is a biomarker qualification process. Biomarker data may be submitted, in the context of a specific NDA, but the biomarker qualification process has added a path through which efficacy and safety biomarkers useful in product development across multiple companies may be qualified through pre-competitive collaboration between these companies.",

Effective inhibition inside the bacterial cell of any of the 'essential' enzymes of the DNA replication pathway should be detrimental to cell survival. Areas covered: This review covers DNA replication enzymes that have been shown to have a potential for delivering antibacterial compounds or drug candidates including: type II topoisomerases, a clinically validated target family, and DNA ligase, which has yielded inhibitors with in vivo efficacy. A few of the 'replisome' enzymes that are structurally and functionally well characterized and have been subjects of antibacterial discovery efforts are also discussed. Expert opinion: Identification of several essential genes in the bacterial replication pathway raised hopes that targeting these gene products would lead to novel antibacterials. However, none of these novel, single gene targets have delivered antibacterial drug candidates into clinical trials. This lack of productivity may be due to the target properties and inhibitor identification approaches employed. For DNA primase, DNA helicase and other replisome targets, with the exception of DNA ligase, the exploitation of structure for lead generation has not been tested to the same extent that it has for DNA gyrase. Utilization of structural information should be considered to augment HTS efforts and initiate fragment-based lead generation. The complex protein-protein interactions involved in regulation of replication may explain why biochemical approaches have been less productive for some replisome targets than more independently functioning targets such as DNA ligase or DNA gyrase.",

Systems pharmacology has emerged as a new discipline to tackle the current challenges in drug discovery. The goal of systems pharmacology is to transform huge, heterogeneous, and dynamic biological and clinical data into interpretable and actionable mechanistic models for decision making in drug discovery and patient treatment. Thus, big data technology and data science will play an essential role in systems pharmacology. Areas covered: This paper critically reviews the impact of three fundamental concepts of data science on systems pharmacology: similarity inference, overfitting avoidance, and disentangling causality from correlation. The authors then discuss recent advances and future directions in applying the three concepts of data science to drug discovery, with a focus on proteome-wide context-specific quantitative drug target deconvolution and personalized adverse drug reaction prediction. Expert opinion: Data science will facilitate reducing the complexity of systems pharmacology modeling, detecting hidden correlations between complex data sets, and distinguishing causation from correlation. The power of data science can only be fully realized when integrated with mechanism-based multi-scale modeling that explicitly takes into account the hierarchical organization of biological systems from nucleic acid to proteins, to molecular interaction networks, to cells, to tissues, to patients, and to populations.",

Technological advances in 3D-cell culture models bridge the gap between 2D and in vivo models to improve upon the current success rates of cancer drug discovery.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS), particularly how this model can be utilized for HTS drug discovery. We discuss the current technologies for uniform culture of MCTS suitable for HTS and detection methods utilized for assay development and drug screening.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Substantial hurdles remain before we reach the ultimate goal of robust HTS of large compound libraries with MCTS models. Specifically, we can group these challenges into three categories: MCTS growth, data collection, and data analysis. The MCTS model should be utilized with fluorescent readouts and high-content imaging with a systems biology approach to model human tumors in vitro. Such models will be more predictive of in vivo efficacy, improving on the current success rates of cancer drug discovery from bench to bedside.",

Areas covered: The author reviews the progress of label-free cell phenotypic and computational approaches in early drug discovery since 2004 and pro- poses a novel paradigm, which combines both approaches. Expert opinion: Label-free cell phenotypic profiling techniques offer an unprecedented and integrated approach to comprehend drug--target inter- actions in their native environments. However, these approaches have disad- vantages associated with the lack of molecular details. Computational approaches, including ligand-, structure- and phenotype-based virtual screens, have become versatile tools in the early drug discovery process. However, these approaches mostly predict the binding of drug molecules to targets of interest and are limited to targets that are either well annotated for ligands or that are structurally resolved. Thus, combining label-free cell phenotypic profiling with computational approaches can provide a potential paradigm to accelerate novel drug discovery by taking advantages of the best of both approaches.

A plethora of diseases occur as a result of the dysregulation of apoptosis and inflammation, and caspases have been targeted as a therapeutic strategy to halt the progression of such diseases. Hundreds of peptide and peptidomimetic inhibitors have been designed and tested, but only a few have advanced to clinical trials because of poor drug-like properties and pharmacological constraints. Although much effort has been focused on inhibiting caspases, there are many diseases that result from a decrease in apoptosis, thus activating procaspases could also be a viable therapeutic strategy.

Of the NRs that regulate expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters and alter cellular processes, the most important are pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor and aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Screening for the activation of these receptors can be achieved during drug discovery by using various high-throughput analyses including ligand binding and transactivation assays.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the importance of screening for NR activation during drug discovery and includes a discussion of the various assays to evaluate activation of NRs by xenobiotics. It also describes screening for species-specific NR activation to attenuate the use of animals in toxicology studies and to identify complications associated with drug metabolism and clearance that may occur during pharmacokinetic analyses.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Given the potential for adverse drug effects and DDIs during all phases of drug elimination, NR screening should occur early in drug discovery. Such screening could be used in structure-activity relationship studies to guide chemists in altering compound structures to eliminate the NR-binding and activation properties on priority compounds. Early screening can also reduce the risk of adverse drug effects, identify novel therapeutic agents and decrease the number of animals used in drug development. Overall, performing these types of assays described here could decrease drug development costs, alleviate the liability associated with drugs that activate NR and prevent unsafe drugs from entering the marketplace.",

The high costs of drug discovery necessitate early decisions to ensure the best molecules and hypotheses are tested in expensive late stage clinical trials. The discovery of brain imaging biomarkers that can bridge preclinical to clinical CNS drug discovery and provide a 'language of translation' affords the opportunity to improve the objectivity of decision-making.  AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the benefits, challenges and potential issues of using a science based biomarker strategy to change the paradigm of CNS drug development and increase success rates in the discovery of new medicines. The authors have summarized PubMed and Google Scholar based publication searches to identify recent advances in functional, structural and chemical brain imaging and have discussed how these techniques may be useful in defining CNS disease state and drug effects during drug development.  EXPERT OPINION: The use of novel brain imaging biomarkers holds the bold promise of making neuroscience drug discovery smarter by increasing the objectivity of decision making thereby improving the probability of success of identifying useful drugs to treat CNS diseases. Functional imaging holds the promise to: (1) define pharmacodynamic markers as an index of target engagement (2) improve translational medicine paradigms to predict efficacy; (3) evaluate CNS efficacy and safety based on brain activation; (4) determine brain activity drug dose-response relationships and (5) provide an objective evaluation of symptom response and disease modification.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The search for additional drugs to treat HIV infection is a continuing effort due to the emergence and spread of HIV strains resistant to nearly all current drugs. The recent literature reveals that fragment-based drug design/discovery (FBDD) has become an effective alternative to conventional high-throughput screening strategies for drug discovery. AREAS COVERED: In this critical review, the authors describe the state of the art in FBDD strategies for the discovery of anti-HIV drug-like compounds. The article focuses on fragment screening techniques, direct fragment-based design and early hit-to-lead progress. EXPERT OPINION: Rapid progress in biophysical detection and in silico techniques has greatly aided the application of FBDD to discover candidate agents directed at a variety of anti-HIV targets. Growing evidence suggests that structural insights on key proteins in the HIV life cycle can be applied in the early phase of drug discovery campaigns, providing valuable information on the binding modes and efficiently prompting fragment hit-to-lead progression. The combination of structural insights with improved methodologies for FBDD, including the privileged fragment-based reconstruction approach, fragment hybridization based on crystallographic overlays, fragment growth exploiting dynamic combinatorial chemistry, and high-speed fragment assembly via diversity-oriented synthesis followed by in situ screening, offers the possibility of more efficient and rapid discovery of novel drugs for HIV-1 prevention or treatment. Though the use of FBDD in anti-HIV drug discovery is still in its infancy, it is anticipated that anti-HIV agents developed via fragment-based strategies will be introduced into the clinic in the future.",

Structural investigations on GABA(A) are currently precluded in the absence of experimentally resolved structure. Pharmacophore modeling circumvents such issues and proves to be a powerful and successful method in drug discovery. Areas covered in this review: The present reviews encompass pharmacophoric models available in the literature for the orthosteric GABA and the allosteric benzodiazepine binding site. Success stories from these simplistic pharmacophore models in scaffold hopping and strategic lead optimization have been highlighted. Recent advances in pharmacophore modeling that can leverage CNS drug discovery programs and deliver astounding results have been reviewed. What the reader will gain: Readers are bound to gain a comprehensive insight on different computational techniques used by different groups to arrive at simple, yet sophisticated pharmacophore models. In the absence of experimentally unresolved active site geometry of GABA(A), these models will provide the reader an opportunity to translate these pharmacophoric features to the microscopic phenomenon of supramolecular ligand interaction. Take home message: Pharmacophore modeling has now evolved as a mainstay approach for lead generation and optimization in drug discovery programs. Of late, many advances in pharmacophore perception have emerged. Such advancements should be used to confront activity profiling and early stage risk assessment in a high-throughput fashion. Extending such technologies has the potential not only to reduce time and cost, but also to prevent late stage attrition in drug discovery.",

It is essential that this problem is addressed throughout the whole drug development process to improve efficiency which will ultimately result in increased patient benefit with more profitable drugs. The approach to reduce cancer drug attrition rates must be based on three pillars. The first of these is that there is a need for new pre-clinical models which can act as better predictors of success in clinical trials. Furthermore, clinical trials driven by tumour biology with the incorporation of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers would be beneficial in drug development. Finally, there is a need for increased collaboration to combine the unique strengths between industry, academia and regulators to ensure that the needs of all stakeholders are met.",

Various statistical, informatics and filtering methods have recently been introduced to foster the integration of experimental and in silico screening and maximize their output in drug discovery. Although many of these ideas and efforts have not yet proceeded much beyond the conceptual level, there are several success stories and good indications that early-stage drug discovery will benefit greatly from a more unified and knowledge-based approach to biological screening, despite the many technical advances towards even higher throughput that are made in the screening arena.",

Their wide functional repertoire; the ability to participate in multiple interactions; the capability to fold at binding in a template-dependent manner and their common involvement in the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases suggest that these proteins should be seriously considered as novel drug targets. Areas covered: This article describes the major classes of ordered proteins traditionally used as drug targets and introduces the molecular mechanisms of drugs targeting ordered proteins. Furthermore, it illustrates basic ways of rational drug design for these proteins, and shows why these approaches cannot be directly used for intrinsic disorder-based drug design. Some of the new approaches utilized for finding drugs targeting IDPs/IDPRs are introduced. Expert opinion: There is a continuing progress in the design of small molecules for IDPs/IDPRs and several small molecules are found that specifically inhibit the disorder-based interaction of IDPs with their numerous partners. It is expected that the initial studies will be extended and novel intrinsic disorder-based drug design approaches will be developed. Furthermore, putative new targets will be identified, and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying modulation of promiscuous IDP binding will be achieved.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is increasing evidence encouraging the development of drugs that positively modulate the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptor for combating addiction. Compounds that target GABA(B) receptors are unique as anti-abuse therapies because of their impact against multiple addictive drugs. AREAS COVERED: The authors present the basic information concerning the drug actions of GABA and GABA(B) receptor orthosteric agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAM). Furthermore, they discuss several recent excellent reviews and newer results pertaining to GABA(B) receptor drug effects on responses to and self-administration of: alcohol (ethanol), nicotine, cocaine, (meth)amphetamine, and opioids. Preclinical and clinical data are considered. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical data exist only for baclofen and mostly for alcohol use disorders. Additional trials are needed, but effects are promising. Whether PAMs, given alone or in combination with a direct GABA(B) receptor agonist, will be clinically effective and have fewer side effects requires investigation. The sedative effects of baclofen, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug, become less severe over time. Based on existing data, baclofen is well-tolerated. However, genetic and physiological differences are likely to contribute to individual responses to different therapeutic agents. The more immediate development of baclofen as a therapeutic for alcohol use disorders may be of significant benefit to some individuals.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are validated targets for oncology drug discovery and several RTK antagonists have been approved for the treatment of human malignancies. Nonetheless, the discovery and development of RTK antagonists has lagged behind the discovery and development of agents that target G-protein coupled receptors. In part, this is because it has been difficult to discover analogs of naturally-occurring RTK agonists that function as antagonists. AREAS COVERED: Here we describe ligands of ErbB receptors that function as partial agonists for these receptors, thereby enabling these ligands to antagonize the activity of full agonists for these receptors. We provide insights into the mechanisms by which these ligands function as antagonists. We discuss how information concerning these mechanisms can be translated into screens for novel small molecule- and antibody-based antagonists of ErbB receptors and how such antagonists hold great potential as targeted cancer chemotherapeutics. EXPERT OPINION: While there have been a number of important key findings into this field, the identification of the structural basis of ligand functional specificity is still of the greatest importance. While it is true that, with some notable exceptions, peptide hormones and growth factors have not proven to be good platforms for oncology drug discovery; addressing the fundamental issues of antagonistic partial agonists for receptor tyrosine kinases has the potential to steer oncology drug discovery in new directions. Mechanism based approaches are now emerging to enable the discovery of RTK partial agonists that may antagonize both agonist-dependent and -independent RTK signaling and may hold tremendous promise as targeted cancer chemotherapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: To date, several anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs, including reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, have been developed and used clinically for the treatment of patients infected with HIV. Recently, novel drugs have been discovered which have different mechanisms of action from those of the above inhibitors, including entry inhibitors and integrase (IN) inhibitors; the clinical use of three of these inhibitors has been approved. Other inhibitors are still in development. Areas covered: This review article summarizes the history of the development of anti-HIV drugs and also focuses on successes in the development of these entry and IN inhibitors, along with looking at exploratory approaches for the development of other inhibitors. Expert opinion: Currently used highly active antiretroviral therapy can be subject to a loss of efficacy, due to the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains; a change of regimens of the drug combination is required to combat this, along with careful monitoring of the virus and CD4 in the blood, by methods such as cellular tropism testing. In such a situation, entry inhibitors such as CCR5/CXCR4 antagonists, CD4 mimics, fusion inhibitors and IN inhibitors might be optional agents for an expansion of the drug repertoire available to patients at all stages of HIV infection.",

Due to the distressing nature of many dermatological diseases, and the enormous consumer demand for products to reverse the effects of skin photodamage, aging, and hair loss, this is a very active field. AREAS COVERED: In this paper, we will cover the use of animal models that have been reported to recapitulate to a greater or lesser extent the features of human dermatological disease. There has been a remarkable increase in the number and variety of transgenic mouse models in recent years, and the basic strategy for constructing them is outlined. EXPERT OPINION: Inflammatory and autoimmune skin diseases are all represented by a range of mouse models both transgenic and normal. Skin cancer is mainly studied in mice and fish. Wound healing is studied in a wider range of animal species, and skin infections such as acne and leprosy also have been studied in animal models. Moving to the more consumer-oriented area of dermatology, there are models for studying the harmful effect of sunlight on the skin, and testing of sunscreens, and several different animal models of hair loss or alopecia.",

Here we review recent innovative applications of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). New approaches to human target validation exploring MRI or PET biomarker changes related to allelic variation at candidate target loci can contribute to human target validation. PET molecular imaging can define molecule biodistribution directly and, if an appropriate, target-specific radioligand is available, be employed in small experimental medicine studies to provide plasma pharmacokinetic-target occupancy data to guide dose selection. An enlarging range of imaging biomarkers for pharmacodynamic studies is enabling imaging experimental medicine studies to assess the potential efficacy of new therapeutic molecules. Integration of these approaches promises improvements in therapeutic molecule differentiation and may contribute in ways that would improve the value proposition for use of a new drug through patient stratification.",

Preclinical efficacy studies performed according to regulatory guidelines are large, long and expensive, and there is a need for guidance and recommendations on how to perform preliminary studies prior to the regulatory studies. Areas covered in this review: We review research models that can be used for preclinical efficacy testing of new drug candidates for osteoporosis. Our focus is on testing compounds targeted to directly decrease osteoclastic bone resorption or increase osteoblastic bone formation. What the reader will gain: We provide an overview of in vitro bone cell culture systems and osteoporosis animal models useful for preclinical efficacy studies and a step-by-step approach on how the most interesting compound can be selected from thousands of drug candidates. Different approaches for testing anti-catabolic and anabolic compounds are provided. Take home message: Efficacy of new osteoporosis drug candidates can be first proven conveniently using in vitro bone cell cultures and then confirmed in short-term animal studies, followed by more extensive animal studies, and finally a regulatory study performed according to the guidelines of regulatory authorities.",

The identification of drugs that modulate the susceptibility to hair cell loss or spur their regeneration is often hampered by the difficulties of assaying for such complex phenomena in mammalian models. The zebrafish has emerged as a powerful animal model for chemical screening in many contexts. Several characteristics of the zebrafish, such as its small size and external location of sensory hair cells, uniquely position it as an ideal model organism for the study of hair cell toxicity, protection, and regeneration. We have used this model to screen for drugs that affect each of these aspects of hair cell biology and have identified compounds that affect each of these processes. The identification of such drugs and drug-like compounds holds promise in the future ability to stem hearing loss in the human population. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Therapeutics or strategies designed to restore normal NO homeostasis will likely have broad application and utility in human health. This highly complex and multi-step pathway for NO production and subsequent target activation provides many steps in the endogenous pathway that may be useful targets for drug development. Important therapeutic areas for NO-based therapies are inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular diseases, erectile dysfunction and metabolic disorders. Areas covered: The following review will discuss the endogenous NO pathway, highlight the current market and indications for NO-based therapeutics, as well as identify pathway targets currently under drug development. Each step along the NO pathway will be discussed including exogenous sources of NO, use of precursors to promote NO production and downstream pathways affected by NO production with advantages and disadvantages highlighted for each. Expert opinion: Development of NO-based therapeutics is and will continue to be a major focus of biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Understanding and utilizing dietary and nutritional strategies to restore NO homeostasis could allow for safer, quicker marketing of products that may be just as efficacious as drugs designed against specific targets.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Clostridium difficile is the etiologic agent of nosocomial and community-acquired diarrhea associated with exposure to antibiotics that disrupt the normal colonic flora. As antibacterials currently used for primary C. difficile infections favor recurrences, new agents able to neutralize the bacterium without affecting the gut microbiota are badly needed. AREAS COVERED: This article investigates the most promising strategies aimed at developing therapies with minimal or no effect on intestinal flora. These therapies include new narrow-spectrum antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides, bacteriophages and phage lysins, virulence-targeting factors such as riboswitch ligands and quorum sensing-interfering factors. It also reviews bacteriotherapy based on probiotics, fecal transplants, and toxin-targeting molecules. EXPERT OPINION: Beyond the development of new antibiotics, virulence-targeting factors or phage cocktails seem promising strategies, which could replace antibiotics avoiding the emergence of resistant strains and the onset of C. difficile infection (CDI). Until broad-spectrum antimicrobials will be in use, C. difficile-specific lytic phages could help to prevent CDI by eliminating C. difficile in patients and in the hospital staff, and for the prevention and treatment of recurrences. Phage therapy is not currently available in Western countries, but, in our opinion, it should have a new chance. Fecal therapy is emerging as a very effective and readily available treatment for recurrences. The shift is from a standardized, drug-based antibacterial therapy toward the forthcoming less expensive and nonpatentable procedures of a more personalized medicine. This will imply profound changes affecting both patient-physician interactions and the current profit-oriented approach to the pharmacologic therapy of infections.",

The need for appropriate models to promote research has led to the development of many elaborate surrogate animal models. Areas covered: This review looks at the history of animal models for HIV research. Although natural animal lentivirus infections and chimeric viruses such as chimera between HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus and simian-tropic HIV are briefly discussed, the main focus is on small animal models, including the complex design of the 'humanized' mouse. The review also traces the historic evolution and milestones as well as depicting current models and future prospects for HIV research. Expert opinion: HIV research is a complex and challenging task that is highly manpower-, money- and time-consuming. Besides factors such as hypervariability and latency, the lack of appropriate animal models that exhibit and recapitulate the entire infectious process of HIV, is one of the reasons behind the failure to eliminate the lentivirus from the human population. This obstacle has led to the exploitation and further development of many sophisticated surrogate animal models for HIV research. While there is no animal model that perfectly mirrors and mimics HIV infections in humans, there are a variety of host species and viruses that complement each other. Combining the insights from each model, and critically comparing the results obtained with data from human clinical trials should help expand our understanding of HIV pathogenesis and drive future drug development.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of age-related pathologies, such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease and diabetes type II, has increased dramatically with the rising average age of populations. Antiaging molecules and appropriate animal models need to be developed to prevent and or delay alterations that occur during aging and are manifested as age-associated illnesses. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the main experimental models used in aging research, from invertebrates up to nonhuman primates. The authors discuss studies of the biochemical pathways involved in dietary restriction, which has been associated with life span extension. The authors also describe the implications of sirtuin 1, insulin growth factor, mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin) and AMPK activation, which are well-characterized antiaging pathways. All these pathways are highly conserved from invertebrates to nonhuman primates. Although some invertebrate models are used to study the antiaging properties of drugs, mice models and nonhuman primates are more suitable, as the study of changes in memory loss is critical. The review highlights the conservation of the aging pathways between species. EXPERT OPINION: Further studies on aging should focus on two ways: i) improving animal models, for example, the genetically heterogeneous mice and ii) drug research. It is almost impossible to evaluate clinically the efficacy of antiaging drugs. Moreover, caloric restriction currently constitutes the most effective antiaging pathway. Thus, the strategy is to study drugs for aging-associated diseases, such as diabetes, that also have antiaging effects.",

To assess the use of this knowledge in reducing the likelihood of compound-related attrition, the molecular properties of compounds acting at specific drug targets described in patents from leading pharmaceutical companies during the 2000-2010 period were analysed. Over the past decade, there has been little overall change in properties that influence ADMET outcomes, but there are marked differences in molecular properties between organizations, which are maintained when the targets pursued are taken into account. The target-unbiased molecular property differences, which are attributable to divergent corporate drug design strategies, are comparable to the differences between the major drug target classes. On the basis of our analysis, we conclude that a substantial sector of the pharmaceutical industry has not modified its drug design practices and is still producing compounds with suboptimal physicochemical profiles.",

The full integration of in vitro and/or in vivo data with in silico tools across the entire process would be beneficial to R&D productivity by developing effective selection criteria and drug-design optimization strategies. AREAS COVERED This review focuses on understanding the impact and extent in the past 5 years of in silico tools on the various stage gates of the target-based drug discovery approach. EXPERT OPINION There are a large number of in silico tools available for establishing selection criteria and drug-design optimization strategies in the target-based approach. However, the inconsistent use of in vitro and/or in vivo data integrated with predictive in silico multiparameter models throughout the process is contributing to R&D productivity issues. In particular, the lack of reliable in silico tools at the H2L stage gate is contributing to the suboptimal selection of viable lead compounds. It is suggested that further development of in silico multiparameter models and organizing biologists, medicinal and computational chemists into one team with a single accountable objective to expand the utilization of in silico tools in all phases of drug discovery would improve R&D productivity.",

The growing burden of COPD is due to continuous tobacco use, which is the most important risk factor of the disease, indoor fumes, occupational exposures and also aging of the world's population. Epigenetic mechanisms significantly contribute to COPD pathophysiology. Areas covered: This review focuses on disease-relevant changes in DNA modification, histone modification and non-coding RNA expression in COPD, and provides insight into novel therapeutic approaches modulating epigenetic mechanisms. Recent findings revealed, among others, globally changed DNA methylation patterns, decreased levels of histone deacetylases and reduced microRNAs levels in COPD. The authors also discuss a potential role of the chromatin silencing Polycomb group of proteins in COPD. Expert opinion: COPD is a highly complex disease and therapy development is complicated by the fact that many smokers develop both COPD and lung cancer. Of interest, combination therapies involving DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and anti-inflammatory drugs provide a promising approach, as they might be therapeutic for both COPD and cancer. Although the field of epigenetic research has virtually exploded over the last 10 years, particular efforts are required to enhance our knowledge of the COPD epigenome in order to successfully establish epigenetic-based therapies for this widespread disease.",

In the field of high-throughput screening the failure of many common transient gene delivery methods in reproducibility and cell survival has caused investigators to routinely apply stable cell lines in support of cell-based assays. The ease of use, versatility, safety and economics of the BacMam system makes transient gene delivery a viable option in the high-throughput screening setting and in most instances circumvents many of the limitations of stable cell lines. Although a few pharmaceutical companies have embraced the technology, its use is poised to become more widespread with increased familiarity and the emergence of enabling products based on the BacMam system.",

Several approaches to interfere with Rho GTPase signaling have been explored and show promise as new ways for tackling cancer cells.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the recent progress in targeting the signaling activities of three prototypical Rho GTPases, that is, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42.

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases occur when neuronal cells in the brain or spinal cord progressively lose function and eventually die. Pathological analysis of these tissues reveals changes that include the loss of synapses, tangles of misfolded protein and immune cell activation, even during very early stages of disease well before debilitating clinical signs are apparent. This suggests that if neurodegeneration is treated early enough, drugs designed to delay the progress of these diseases by either repairing the early damage and loss of neurons, or protecting neuron functionality from further insult, may be efficacious. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that can post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. They are particularly numerous within neurons where many are expressed with high specificity, which suggests that they have important roles in the healthy brain. Indeed, miRNAs are essential for the post-mitotic survival of neurons, implying a crucial role in survival and neuroprotection. This has focused attention on exploring the use of miRNA-based drugs as a means to correct cellular abnormalities and maintain neuronal function in neurodegenerative diseases. These efforts are spurred on by the rapid progress to clinical trials for a number of miRNA-based therapies for other diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, fibrosis and cancer.",

Using both human genetic approaches, as well as forward and reverse genetic strategies in animal models, significant progress has been made to unravel the genetic and molecular etiology of human cardiovascular disease that is crucial to define novel therapeutic targets. In this context, the zebrafish has emerged as an important in vivo vertebrate animal system to study and to model human cardiovascular diseases as well as for in vivo cardiovascular drug discovery. AREAS COVERED: This review describes the rationale for using the in vivo model system zebrafish in whole-organism-based drug discovery strategies. It also highlights recent developments in the fields of drug target identification, disease modeling, and automation of high-throughput small compound screening. EXPERT OPINION: Novel genome-editing techniques such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technologies allow highly efficient and reliable disease modeling in the in vivo system zebrafish. The ambition of developing personalized therapeutic options will clearly be fostered by the establishment of animal disease models that accurately simulate the patient's situation and the use of these disease models in 'next-generation' high-throughput small compound screens to define treatment options tailored to individual needs.

A major new interest in inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis is their proapoptotic effect observed in cancerous cells. Areas covered: In this review, the authors focus on the screening methods of antilipogenic inhibitors targeting the synthesis of malonylCoA (carbonic anhydrase, acetylCoA carboxylase), palmitylCoA (fatty acid synthase condensing and thioesterase subunits) and monounsaturated fatty acids (\u03949-desaturase). The consequences of inhibition depend on how the pathway deviates above the blockade: accelerated mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation following the decreased malonylCoA level, accumulation of ketone bodies and increased cholesterol synthesis following the increased acetylCoA level. Side effects such as anorexia and skin defects may critically decrease therapeutic indices in the long term. The authors emphasize the need for assessment of toxicity in short-term treatments inducing proapoptotic effects observed in aggressive hormone-dependent malignancies. Expert opinion: The activity of lipogenesis inhibitors can be recognised in lipid profiles established by a combination of MS-based measurements and multivariate analysis processing hundreds of lipid molecular species. Because the method can be automated, it is suitable for screening large chemical libraries, with particular focus on anticancer activities.",

The article also proposes potential theoretical criterion for use in virtual screening of molecular libraries for candidate Ebola drugs. Expert opinion: In the absence of approved therapeutics for EVD, experimental drugs have had to be used. The repurposing of approved drugs for the treatment of EVD, as an alternative therapeutic strategy, has also been suggested.

Three drivers encouraging the use of the open source strategy include: upstream knowledge-based complexities associated with complementary assets, technological complexities given the scale of research and interdependencies between disciplines and downstream commercialization complexities. While literature currently discusses the need for open source strategies and their outcomes, we have reached a critical stage for a framework to cohesively understand how the drivers affect the open source models chosen as well as the governance strategies to ensure a successful outcome both in terms of knowledge access and product development. In this paper, an initial framework is designed with a focus on the type of participant as impacting the motivation to participate in an open source initiative, the objective of any open source strategy as impacting the structural model adopted and the structure of knowledge produced as impacting its management. It is anticipated that this framework should then provide an opportunity to develop governance rules for open source drug discovery initiatives.",

Protein methyltransferases are one of the target classes which have gained attention as potential therapeutic targets after promising results of inhibitors for EZH2 and DOT1L in clinical trials. There are many technologies developed in order to find small molecule inhibitors for protein methyltransferases. However, in contrast to high throughput screening, profiling against different methyltransferases is challenging since each enzyme has a different substrate preference so that it is hard to profile in one assay format. Here, different technologies for methyltransferase assays will be overviewed, and the advantages and disadvantages of each will be discussed.",

        "abstract": "Unlike the genomics revolution, which was largely enabled by a single technological advance (high throughput sequencing), rapid advancement in proteomics will require a broader effort to increase the throughput of a number of key tools for functional analysis of different types of proteins. In the case of ion channels -a class of (membrane) proteins of great physiological importance and potential as drug targets- the lack of adequate assay technologies is felt particularly strongly. The available, indirect, high throughput screening methods for ion channels clearly generate insufficient information. The best technology to study ion channel function and screen for compound interaction is the patch clamp technique, but patch clamping suffers from low throughput, which is not acceptable for drug screening. A first step towards a solution is presented here. The nano patch clamp technology, which is based on a planar, microstructured glass chip, enables automatic whole cell patch clamp measurements. The Port-a-Patch is an automated electrophysiology workstation, which uses planar patch clamp chips. This approach enables high quality and high content ion channel and compound evaluation on a one-cell-at-a-time basis. The presented automation of the patch process and its scalability to an array format are the prerequisites for any higher throughput electrophysiology instruments.",

However, lack of consistent manufacturing practices and quality standards, fear of adulteration, and perceived deficiencies in scientific validation of efficacy and safety impede worldwide acceptance of TCM. In addition, Western pharmaceutical industries and regulatory agencies are partial toward single ingredient drugs based on synthetic molecules, and skeptical of natural product mixtures. This review concentrates on three examples of TCM-derived pharmaceuticals and functional foods that have, despite these usual obstacles, risen to wide acceptance in the West based on their remarkable performance in recent scientific investigations. They are: Sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua), the source of artemisinin, which is the currently preferred single compound anti-malarial drug widely used in combination therapies and recently approved by US FDA; Thunder god vine (Tripterygium wilfordii) which is being developed as a botanical drug for rheumatoid arthritis; and green tea (Camellia sinensis) which is used as a functional beverage and a component of dietary supplements.",

Over the past decade, great efforts have been made in developing platforms for patch clamp-based high-quality screening of ion channels in discovering new drug candidates as well for evaluating their safety profiles. Indeed, the automated patch clamp (APC) has recently reached the data throughput requirements of high-throughput screening (HTS) allowing for new screening strategies with ion channel active compounds. Areas covered: This editorial article comments on the past and present developments of APC-based drug screening. Furthermore, it also looks at the implications of APC technology meeting HTS-standards as well as its use in compound safety evaluation. Expert opinion: In the imminent future, we will see a paradigm shift in ion channel drug screening toward using APC-based platforms for primary drug library screens. This way, the redundancy of the drug discovery process and the risk of false-negatives could be drastically reduced. Furthermore, cardiac safety can be addressed early, avoiding late-phase withdrawals with promising drug candidates. It is our firm belief that APC-based ion channel HTS will facilitate the discovery of candidates, which otherwise would have not been found, and shorten the drug development cycle, saving time and cost.",

Moreover, none of the currently available drugs for asthma are really disease-modifying or curative. Although murine models of asthma, based on transgenic and knockout animals, may offer an integrated pathophysiological system for studying the characteristics of airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, these alterations are noteworthily different compared with those observed in asthmatic patients. Since a clear functional and inflammatory relationship between the nasal mucosa and bronchial tissue in patients suffering from asthma and allergic rhinitis has been recognized, using preclinical models based on human nasal cells sampling might support a prompt and effective anti-inflammatory drug discovery in asthma. Areas covered: The authors provide a review, which discusses the potential role of nasal cell sampling and its application in advanced drug discovery for asthma. The contents range from the similarities and differences between asthma and allergic rhinitis up to artificial airway models based on sophisticated human lung-on-a-chip devices. Expert opinion: Nasal cell sampling and processing have reached a great potential in asthma drug discovery. The authors believe that models of asthma, which are based on human nasal cells, can provide valuable indications of proof of pharmacological and potential therapeutic efficacy in both preclinical and early clinical settings.",

AREAS COVERED: The authors review the structural information that has emerged for ligand-mediated 7TM proteins, including the class A, B, C, and F receptors, focusing on the 7TM domains for the multi-domain proteins. The authors describe the key regions associated with ligand binding as well as features responsible for function such as activation versus inhibition and biased signaling. Furthermore, the authors summarize the effectiveness of computational studies to help clarify the structure-function information and their use for drug discovery. EXPERT OPINION: There is now a significant amount of structural information covering a range of 7TM protein classes (A, B, C, and F) and activation states. For these and closely related proteins, structure-based drug discovery has proven to be a powerful tool. More structural information is needed with respect to dimerization, 7TM proteins with \u03b2-arrestin to help in understanding the control of biased signaling, and full-protein structure determinations for non-class A proteins to help in understanding and controlling their functioning. Finally, the use of the existing structural information to target new sites on these proteins needs further exploration.",

The World Health Organization recommended multidrug therapy (MDT) which is extremely effective and halts the progress of the disease. Even though the objective of eliminating leprosy as a public health problem has been achieved successfully, leprosy is not yet eradicated. Furthermore, the long-term use of MDT results in single- and multidrug resistance. Therefore, there is still a need for new drug discovery for leprosy.; Areas Covered: The authors explain the importance of discovery of new drug to leprosy and the significance of homology modeling to drug discovery. This review highlights the principle steps, applications, and the resources of homology modeling. Finally, the authors emphasize the application of different structure-based drug design (SBDD) approaches to design novel therapeutics for leprosy.; Expert Opinion: MDT has proved to be effective in controlling infection, with prevalence of leprosy now predominantly isolated to the developing countries. The emergence of single- and multidrug-resistant strains of M. leprae has, however, provided some concern with the need for newer antibacterial agents. Drug resistance can be overcome by multi-targeted therapy. SBDD approaches, which reported many successful drugs, depend predominantly on the three-dimensional (3D) structure of drug targets. As of 2013, only very few experimental structures are available for M. leprae proteins. Hence, SBDD, in leprosy research, relies heavily on homology modeling to predict the 3D structure of drug targets and to design better therapeutics.; ",

The discovery of safe, effective medications depends critically upon experimental approaches capable of providing high-impact information on the biological effects of drug candidates early in the discovery pipeline. This information can enable reliable lead identification, pharmacological compound differentiation and successful translation of research output into clinically useful therapeutics. The shallow preclinical profiling of candidate compounds promulgates a minimalistic understanding of their biological effects and undermines the level of value creation necessary for finding quality leads worth moving forward within the development pipeline with efficiency and prognostic reliability sufficient to help remediate the current pharma-industry productivity drought. Three specific technologies discussed herein, in addition to experimental areas intimately associated with contemporary drug discovery, appear to hold particular promise for strengthening the preclinical valuation of drug candidates by deepening lead characterization. These are: i) hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry for characterizing structural and ligand-interaction dynamics of disease-relevant proteins; ii) activity-based chemoproteomics for profiling the functional diversity of mammalian proteomes; and iii) nuclease-mediated precision gene editing for developing more translatable cellular and in vivo models of human diseases.

Different approaches have been developed and validated to understand the interactions between drugs and transporters, and the in vivo role of drug transporters. These tools are helping to understand the impact of transporters on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of drugs and assess the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in drug discovery and development. AREAS COVERED This article provides an overview of different approaches to evaluate the drug transporters involved in intestinal absorption, hepatic and renal clearance, and brain penetration. Specifically, it provides the best practices to evaluate the major uptake and efflux transporters in drug discovery. It also discusses the challenges and gaps in understanding the clinical relevance of drug transporters. EXPERT OPINION Quantitative prediction of transporter-mediated clearance, tissue exposure, as well as DDIs is still limited. The current challenge is to develop in vitro-in vivo correlations, extrapolate and integrate data from in vitro transporter assays, and preclinical species into humans to quantitatively predict the impact of transporters on drug absorption, disposition, elimination and DDIs. With the development of a variety of novel tools, the ultimate goal is to use high quality in vitro and in vivo data to establish physiologically based PK models, which will improve the capability to predict PK, tissue exposure and DDIs in humans.",

Traditionally, optimizing the interaction of lead molecules with the binding site for the endogenous agonist (orthosteric site) has been viewed as the best means of achieving selectivity of action. However, recent developments have highlighted the fact that drugs can interact with binding sites on the receptor molecule that are distinct from the orthosteric site, known as allosteric sites. Allosteric modulators could offer several advantages over orthosteric ligands, including greater selectivity and saturability of their effect.",

Areas covered: With this article, the author provides the reader with a description of the zebrafish animal model, which has been employed to identify and study pharmacological approaches to muscle disease. In particular, the author focuses on how both large-scale chemical screens and targeted drug treatment studies have established zebrafish as an important model for muscle disease drug discovery. Expert opinion: There are a number of opportunities arising for the use of zebrafish models for further developing pharmacological approaches to muscle diseases, including studying drug combination therapies and utilizing genome editing to engineer zebrafish muscle disease models. It is the author's particular belief that the availability of a wide range of zebrafish transgenic strains for labeling immune cell types, combined with live imaging and drug treatment of muscle disease models, should allow for new elegant studies demonstrating how pharmacological approaches might influence inflammation and the immune response in muscle disease.",

        "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of cell surface receptors in humans. They convey extracellular signals into the cell interior by activating intracellular processes such as heterotrimeric G protein-dependent signaling pathways. They are widely distributed in the nervous system, and mediate key physiological processes including cognition, mood, appetite, pain and synaptic transmission. With at least 30% of marketed drugs being GPCR modulators, they are a major therapeutic target in the pharmaceutical industry's drug discovery programs. This review will survey recently patented ligands for GPCRs implicated in CNS disorders, in particular the metabotropic glutamate, adenosine and cannabinoid receptors. Metabotropic glutamate receptors regulate signaling by glutamate, the major excitatory brain neurotransmitter, while adenosine is a ubiquitous neuromodulater mediating diverse physiological effects. Recent patents for ligands of these receptors include mGluR5 antagonists and adenosine A1 receptor agonists. Cannabinoid receptors remain one of the most important GPCR drug discovery target due to the intense interest in CB1 receptor antagonists for treating obesity and metabolic syndrome. Such small molecule ligands are the outcome of the continuing focus of many pharmaceutical companies to identify novel GPCR agonist, antagonist or allosteric modulators useful for CNS disorders, for which more effective drugs are eagerly awaited. \u00a9 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

Chemogenomics has a strong conceptional link to modern drug discovery research, whereas chemical biology focuses more on the use of small molecules as probes for exploring biological functions, rather than drug candidates. However, the boundaries between these areas are fluid, as they should be, given their strong interdisciplinary orientation. Objective : Recently, computational approaches have been introduced for the analysis of research topics that are of considerable relevance for these disciplines including, for example, the systematic study of ligand\u2013target interactions or mapping of pharmacologically relevant chemical space. This contribution introduces key investigations in computational chemical biology and chemogenomics and critically evaluates their current and future potential to impact drug discovery. Conclusions : Computational methods of high relevance for chemogenomics and chemical biology either derive knowledge from large-scale analysis of available drug and target data or interface experimental programs with predictive methods. Approaches for drug target prediction and the systematic analysis of polypharmacology substantially impact research in this area.",

Exhibiting binding characteristics comparable to or even better than monoclonal antibodies, these ligands can be used as detection probes, highly efficient inhibitors of protein function or specific competitors in high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. Thus, aptamer technology can be exploited to address the growing demand for multi-parallel analysis of proteomes, functional prioritization of potential drug targets and accelerated small molecule lead identification. The unique advantages of this technology are the rapid automated generation of sophisticated ligands against almost any target molecule and the convenient structural or chemical modification of the nucleic acid probes. Depending on the strategy, an RNA aptamer can be expressed transgenically to investigate and inactivate an endogenous protein in an animal model, or it can be designed to function as a highly sensitive nucleic acid biosensor. More recently, the technology has been extended to directly link functional target validation with HTS, accelerating the process of drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Background: Adenovirus, retrovirus and lentivirus-based vectors, originally engineered and optimized for in vivo and ex vivo gene therapy, have become increasingly useful for viral-mediated gene delivery to support in vitro cell-based assays. Viral vectors underpin functional genomics screening of cDNA, shRNA and aptamer libraries, are used for a variety of target validation studies and importantly, for high-throughput cell-based drug discovery and compound profiling assays. The baculovirus/insect cell expression system had gained prevalence as a tool for recombinant protein production when it was observed that recombinant baculovirus vectors too could serve as efficient gene delivery vehicles for a wide range of mammalian cells. Although the use of baculovirus vectors in vivo has lagged behind retroviral, adenoviral and lentiviral vectors, they have gained prominence for development of in vitro cell-based assays due to the ease of generation, broad host range and excellent biosafety profile. There is an increasing emphasis on cell-based assays in high-throughput automated drug discovery laboratories and a variety of commercially available viral-vectors can be used for supporting these assays. Objective: We compare and contrast the current viral-mediated gene delivery vector systems and highlight their suitability for cell-based drug discovery assays. Conclusion: Viral-mediated gene delivery is increasingly being used in support of genome scale target validation studies and cell-based assay development for specific drug target genes such as ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors and intracellular enzymes. The choice of a delivery system over another for a particular application is largely dictated by the cell types and cell lines in use, virus cellular tropism, assay throughput, safety requirements and ease/cost of reagent generation.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) applications in drug discovery are classified into two categories: ligand-based methods and protein-based methods. The latter is based on the observation of the (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra of a protein with and without lead compounds. However, in order to take this strategy, isotopic labeling is an absolute necessity. Given that each (1)H-(15)N HSQC signal corresponds to a residue of the target protein, signal changes provide specific information on whether a compound will fit into a pocket. Thus, this protein-based method is particularly suitable for fragment-based approaches, such as \"SAR-by-NMR\" and \"fragment-growing.\" Alternatively, the information from a protein interface may be used to develop inhibitors for protein-protein interactions.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review discusses at the experimental procedures for preparing isotopically labeled protein and introduces selected topics on atom-specific and residue-selective isotope labeling, which may facilitate the development of PPI/PA inhibitors. Furthermore, the author reviews the recent applications of \"in-cell\" NMR spectroscopy, which is now considered as an important tool in drug delivery research.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Many recent advances in labeling methods have succeeded in expanding NMR's potential for drug discovery. In addition to those methods, another new technique called \"in-cell NMR\" allows the observation of protein-ligand interactions inside living cells. In other words, \"in-cell NMR\" may become a pharmaceutical NMR technique for drug delivery.",

The response of the cell to genetic injury and its ability to maintain genomic stability by means of a variety of DNA repair mechanisms are therefore essential in preventing tumor initiation and progression. From the same viewpoint, the relative role of DNA repair as a biomarker for prognosis, predicator of drug and therapy responses, or indeed as target for novel gene therapy is recently patented and very promising.

To discover new potential drugs, computational chemistry incorporates automatization for obtaining biological data such as adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET), as well as drug mechanisms of action. Areas covered: This editorial looks at examples of these computational tools, including docking, molecular dynamics simulation, virtual screening, quantum chemistry, quantitative structural activity relationship, principal component analysis and drug screening workflow systems. The authors then provide their perspectives on the importance of these techniques for drug discovery. Expert opinion: Computational tools help researchers to design and discover new drugs for the treatment of several human diseases without side effects, thus allowing for the evaluation of millions of compounds with a reduced cost in both time and economic resources. The problem is that operating each program is difficult; one is required to use several programs and understand each of the properties being tested. In the future, it is possible that a single computer and software program will be capable of evaluating the complete properties (mechanisms of action and ADMET properties) of ligands. It is also possible that after submitting one target, this computer-software will be capable of suggesting potential compounds along with ways to synthesize them, and presenting biological models for testing.",

'Lead patients', namely those patients who are proactive with respect to their health, possess knowledge of their disease and resulting symptoms. They are also well informed about the conventional as well as non-conventional treatments for disease management; and so can provide a nuanced perspective to drug design. Understanding how patients view the management of their diseases and how they view the use of conventional versus non-conventional interventions is of imperative importance to researchers. Indeed, this can provide insight into how conventional treatments might be designed from the outset to encourage compliance and positive health outcomes. Consequently, a continuum of lead patient engagement is employed that focuses on drug discovery processes ranging from participative, informative to collaborative engagement. This article looks at a variety of open innovation models that are currently employed across this engagement spectrum. It is no longer sufficient for industry stakeholders to consider conventional therapies as the only mechanisms being sought after by patients. Without patient engagement, the industry risks being re-prioritized in terms of its role in the patient journey towards not only recovery of health, but also sustained health and wellness before disease onset.",

The unique challenges presented to drug discovery and development including biological, chemical and economic are particularly salient for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), warranting new networks and models of open collaboration between scientists from the public and private sectors. AREAS COVERED: The goal of this paper is to progress beyond the review of open source strategies NTDs to a discussion of an assessment of these strategies. The authors discuss the notion of evolving openness across the pharmaceutical value chain and discuss and develop a framework for assessing the value and outcomes of open source drug discovery for NTDs, based on the available literature. EXPERT OPINION: Collectively, open source programs for NTDs, beyond the actual deposits themselves, should foster linkages between experts in key disease arenas, encourage collaborations through such linkages and most urgently enable human capacity development. Quantifying their value in absolute terms is not an easy task since exchange markets do not always exist for deposited and shared assets. From the perspective of capacity development, the potential and benefits certainly exist for program development involving NTD initiatives, institutions and students in disease-endemic countries. Here, stakeholders such as public grant agencies and private sector sponsors can play a role in encouraging initiatives that link open and broad knowledge dissemination to the development of local human and technological capacity in NTD-endemic countries.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Cardiac arrhythmias remain a major challenge for modern drug discovery. Clinical events are paroxysmal, often rare and may be asymptomatic until a highly morbid complication. Target selection is often based on limited information and though highly specific agents are identified in screening, the final efficacy is often compromised by unanticipated systemic responses, a narrow therapeutic index and substantial toxicities. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Our understanding of complexity of arrhythmogenesis has grown dramatically over the last two decades, and the range of potential disease mechanisms now includes pathways previously thought only tangentially involved in arrhythmia. This review surveys the literature on arrhythmia mechanisms from 1965 to the present day, outlines the complex biology underlying potentially each and every rhythm disturbance, and highlights the problems for rational target identification. The rationale for in vivo screening is described and the utility of the zebrafish for this approach and for complementary work in functional genomics is discussed. Current limitations of the model in this setting and the need for careful validation in new disease areas are also described. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: An overview of the complex mechanisms underlying most clinical arrhythmias, and insight into the limits of ion channel conductances as drug targets. An introduction to the zebrafish as a model organism, in particular for cardiovascular biology. Potential approaches to overcoming the hurdles to drug discovery in the face of complex biology including in vivo screening of zebrafish genetic disease models. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: In vivo screening in faithful disease models allows the effects of drugs on integrative physiology and disease biology to be captured during the screening process, in a manner agnostic to potential drug target or targets. This systematic strategy bypasses current gaps in our understanding of disease biology, but emphasizes the importance of the rigor of the disease model.",

        "abstract": "Microbial natural products are the origin of most of the antibiotics on the market today. However, research in antibiotics and natural products has declined significantly during the last decade as a consequence of diverse factors, among which the lack of interest of industry in the field and the strong competition from collections of synthetic compounds as source of drug leads. As a consequence, there is an alarming scarcity of new antibiotic classes in the pipelines of the pharmaceutical industry. Still, microbial natural products remain the most promising source of novel antibiotics, although new approaches are required to improve the efficiency of the discovery process. The impact of microbial biodiversity, the influence of growth conditions on the production of secondary metabolites, the choice of the best approach at the screening step and the challenges faced during the isolation and identification of the active compounds are examined in this review as the critical factors contributing to success in the effort of antibiotic discovery from microbial natural products.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lantibiotics are post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria from diverse environments that exhibit an activity against pathogenic bacteria comparable to that of medically used antibiotics. The actual need for new antimicrobials in therapeutics has placed them in the pipeline of antibiotic research, due not only to their high antimicrobial activity but also to the fact that they are directed to novel targets.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review covers the different approaches traditionally used in bacteriocin discovery, based on the isolation of bacteria from different habitats and determining their inhibitory spectrum against a set of relevant strains. It also elaborates on more recent approaches covering organic synthesis and semi-synthesis of lantibiotics, genomic and proteomic approaches and the application of Synthetic Biology to the field of antimicrobial drug discovery.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Lantibiotics show a great potential in fulfilling the requirements for new antimicrobials. Culture-dependent techniques are still applied to lantibiotic discovery producing successful results that can be furthered by employing high-throughput screening techniques and peptidogenomics. The necessity of culturing bacteria and growing them in specific conditions for lantibiotic expression, can hamper the discovery rate, especially in exotic or unculturable bacteria. Thus, a combination of genome mining procedures, to detect novel lantibiotic-related sequences, with heterologous production systems and high-throughput screening, offers a promising strategy. Furthermore, the characterization of the mechanism of action of many lantibiotics, and the development of \"plug and play\" peptide biosynthesis systems, offers the possibility of initiating the rational design of non-natural lantibiotics based on structure-activity relationships.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The emergence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus and the recent global circulation of H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus in 2009 have highlighted the need for new anti-influenza therapies. This has been made all the more important with the emergence of antiviral-resistant strains. Recent progress in achieving three-dimensional (3D) crystal structures of influenza viral proteins and efficient tools available for pharmacophore-based virtual screening are aiding us in the discovery and design of new antiviral compounds.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review discusses pharmacophore modeling as a potential cost-effective and time-saving technology for new drug discovery as an alternative to high-throughput screening. Based on this technical platform, the authors discuss current progress and future prospects for developing novel influenza antivirals against pre-existing or emerging novel targets.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Although it might be at an infant stage of development, the availability of the 3D crystal structures of influenza viral proteins is expected to accelerate the application of structure-based drug design (SBDD) and pharmacophore modeling. Furthermore, the neuraminidase inhibitor, one of the most successful examples of a SBDD, still receives great attention because of its superb antiviral activities and the resistance of influenza strains to oseltamivir. However, despite much success, pharmacophore-based virtual screening exhibits limited predictive power in hit identification. Further improvements in pharmacophore detection algorithms, proper combinations of in silico methods as well as judicious choosing of compounds are expected to improve the hit rate. With the help of these technologies, the discovery of anti-influenza agents will be accelerated.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug resistance capacity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis demands urgent need for developing new antitubercular drugs. The present work is on M. tuberculosis-MbtA, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of siderophores, having a critical role in bacterial growth and virulence. The molecular models of both holo and apo forms of M. tuberculosis-MbtA have been constructed and validated. A docking study with a series of 42 5'-O-[N-(salicyl) sulfamoyl] adenosine derivatives, using GOLD software, revealed significant correlation (R(2) = 0.8611) between Goldscore and the reported binding affinity data. Further, binding energies of the docked poses were calculated and compared with the observed binding affinities (R(2) = 0.901). All-atom molecular dynamics simulation was performed for apo form, holo form without ligand and holo form with ligands. The holo form without ligand on molecular dynamics simulation for 20 ns converged to the apo form and the apo form upon induced fit docking of the natural substrate, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid-adenylate, yielded the holo structure. The molecular dynamics simulation of the holo form with ligands across the time period of 20 ns provided with the insights into ligand-receptor interactions for inhibition of the enzyme. A thorough study involving interaction energy calculation between the ligands and the active site residues of MbtA model identified the key residues implicated in ligand binding. The holo model was capable to differentiate active compounds from decoys. In the absence of experimental structure of MbtA, the homology models together with the insights gained from this study will promote the rational design of potent and selective MbtA inhibitors as antitubercular therapeutics.

        "abstract": "'Dysfunctional pain', a type of chronic pain, is associated with a broad range of clinical disorders, including fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis. It is emerging as a serious issue due to the negative impact of inexplicable pain on quality of life, lack of effective therapies and health care cost. Although drug discovery efforts in pain research have so far focused primarily on inflammatory and neuropathic pain, this editorial attracts attention to dysfunctional pain research and discusses a possible fundamental framework for tackling this difficult issue. While dysfunctional pain is characterized by chronic widespread or regional pain symptoms and occurrence of pain amplification, underlying pathophysiologies remain to be identified. Thus, a pivotal step in future research would be the exploration of pathophysiological pathways, such as relevant molecular networks, which are responsible for dysfunctional pain. Utilization of developing technologies paves the way for the identification of underlying pathophysiologies and the development of effective drugs which would eventually solve the clinical issues associated with dysfunctional pain.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Animal behavioral models have become an indispensable tool for studying anxiety disorders and testing anxiety-modulating drugs. However, significant methodological and conceptual challenges affect the translational validity and accurate behavioral dissection in such models. They are also often limited to individual behavioral domains and fail to target the disorder's real clinical picture (its spectrum or overlap with other disorders), which hinder screening and development of novel anxiolytic drugs. Areas covered: In this article, the authors discuss and emphasize the importance of high-throughput multi-domain neurophenotyping based on the latest developments in video-tracking and bioinformatics. Additionally, the authors also explain how bioinformatics can provide new insight into the neural substrates of brain disorders and its benefit for drug discovery. Expert opinion: The throughput and utility of animal models of anxiety and other brain disorders can be markedly increased by a number of ways: i) analyzing systems of several domains and their interplay in a wider spectrum of model species; ii) using a larger number of end points generated by video-tracking tools; iii) correlating behavioral data with genomic, proteomic and other physiologically relevant markers using online databases and iv) creating molecular network-based models of anxiety to identify new targets for drug design and discovery. Experimental models utilizing bioinformatics tools and online databases will not only improve our understanding of both gene-behavior interactions and complex trait interconnectivity but also highlight new targets for novel anxiolytic drugs.",

This annual workshop facilitates innovation and progress in neurodegenerative disease drug discovery by convening stakeholders from charitable foundations, government, academia and industry who introduce scientists to the drug development and approval process. New to the 2012 workshop were candid discussions about re-visiting the {CNS} therapeutic development process. The continuing challenge is partly due to the poor forecasting potential of models of {CNS} diseases, as well as the lack of reproducibility of published studies, and greater need to increase focus on pharmacodynamic end points. Significant discussion centered on how to improve discovery approaches using examples of recent successes in the field. For example, the idea of combining reductionist, single-target strategies with functional-approach logic was suggested by several speakers, and widely discussed in the workshop. The didactic aspects of the workshop highlighted underlying concepts, best practices and trends that have characterized successful campaigns. The technical and scientific guidance was complemented by discussions of practical ways to approach the major funding gaps required for translation of projects from basic science to clinical investigations.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: High-resolution microscopy using fluorescent probes is a powerful tool to investigate individual cell structure and function, cell subpopulations and mechanisms underlying cellular responses to drugs. Additionally, responses to drugs more closely resemble those seen in vivo when cells are physically connected in three-dimensional (3D) systems (either 3D cell cultures or whole organisms), as opposed to traditional monolayer cultures. Combined, the use of imaging-based 3D models in the early stages of drug development has the potential to generate biologically relevant data that will increase the likelihood of success for drug candidates in human studies. Areas covered: The authors discuss current methods for the culturing of cells in 3D as well as approaches for the imaging of whole-animal models and 3D cultures that are amenable to high-throughput settings and could be implemented to support drug discovery campaigns. Furthermore, they provide critical considerations when discussing imaging these 3D systems for high-throughput chemical screenings. Expert opinion: Despite widespread understanding of the limitations imposed by the two-dimensional versus the 3D cellular paradigm, imaging-based drug screening of 3D cellular models is still limited, with only a few screens found in the literature. Image acquisition in high throughput, accurate interpretation of fluorescent signal, and uptake of staining reagents can be challenging, as the samples are in essence large aggregates of cells. The authors recognize these shortcomings that need to be overcome before the field can accelerate the utilization of these technologies in large-scale chemical screens.",

To date, classical QSAR models are able to predict only one type of biological effect (activity, toxicity, etc.) against only one type of generic target. AREAS COVERED: The present review discusses innovative and evolved QSAR models, which are focused on multitasking quantitative structure-biological effect relationships (mtk-QSBER). Such models can integrate multiple kinds of chemical and biological data, allowing the simultaneous prediction of pharmacological activities, toxicities and/or other safety profiles. EXPERT OPINION: The authors strongly believe, given the potential of mtk-QSBER models to simultaneously predict the dissimilar biological effects of chemicals, that they have much value as in silico tools for drug discovery. Indeed, these models can speed up the search for efficacious drugs in a number of areas, including fragment-based drug discovery and drug repurposing.",

Such solutions must streamline in silico drug and therapy development by integrating all types of data into one knowledge base and also by enabling continuous analysis workflows uninterrupted by manual restructuring of inputs and outputs from workflow components. They must provide a collaborative environment for data sharing between multiple users and allow importing of all types of experimental data for subsequent analysis. Areas covered: The reader is provided with a review of disparate software applications currently used in drug development and a discussion of existing organizational challenges for development of holistic software solutions. The reader is also provided with a proposed conceptual framework for integration of software components and some details for its implementation are suggested. Expert opinion: Holistic solutions can undoubtedly affect the speed, quality and cost of drug development and personalized therapy. However, it must be constantly evolved to rapidly adopt new experimental and statistical methods, incorporate advances in software technologies and allow perpetual optimization of its components. Perpetual improvements in data structure, data quality, statistical algorithms and other mathematical approaches for computer modeling can gradually shift financial and cultural emphasis in the pharmaceutical industry away from traditional experimental approaches and towards computational approaches.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: G-quadruplexes (G4s) are targets of great interest because of their roles in crucial biological processes, such as aging and cancer. G4s are based on the formation of G-quartets, stabilised by Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds and by interaction with cations between the tetrads. These biologically relevant conformations were first discovered in eukaryotic chromosomal telomeric DNA, but have also been found in the proximal location of promoters in a number of human genes. Therefore, the extensive analysis of an intriguing target could move towards the rational drug design of new selective anticancer agents. Areas covered: The authors review G4 structural characterisation, with detailed insight related to the polymorphism issue. The authors describe the topologically distinct G4 structural forms and the factors involved in their interconversion mechanisms, such as the sequence of the oligonucleotides, the strand stoichiometry and orientation, the syn-anti conformation of the guanine glycosidic bonds and the G4 loop types and the environmental factors. Furthermore, the authors report several studies related to folding and unfolding kinetic profiles in order to understand the conformational view of monomolecular G4 formations. Expert opinion: G4 unimolecular nucleic acids can be considered as valid targets for the rational drug development of novel anticancer agents. Structural biology represents an essential link between the biology and medicinal chemistry knowledge in this field. In silico methods have already been demonstrated to be useful, especially if well integrated with biophysical tests. If this proves successful, the G4-targeting paradigm could also be extended to drug discovery beyond neoplastic pathologies.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases represents a substantial unmet medical need, but the development of novel, effective and safe drugs is proving difficult. While substantial improvement over existing pharmacological agents is expected from new molecular targets emerging in the genomic era, the validation and exploitation of novel mechanisms of action is a lengthy and costly process. The use of neuroimaging techniques, and more specifically of functional and pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been advocated as a powerful approach to this problem, providing translational biomarkers for the objective assessment of drug activity on brain function, and possibly surrogate markers of clinical response. AREAS COVERED: The authors review the recent application of functional and pharmacological MRI (phMRI) in the study of novel treatments of psychosis based on glutamatergic mechanisms. Furthermore, they review contribution of functional imaging in the target validation and early assessment of drugs exploiting glutamatergic mechanisms as an example of potentially impactful exploitation of neuroimaging methods in drug discovery. EXPERT OPINION: While functional neuroimaging methods may provide useful markers of drug activity and response to treatment, their translational potential, that is, their use to bridge animal and human investigations is seldom exploited. The application of phMRI in the study of novel antipsychotics based on glutamatergic mechanisms represents an example of functional neuroimaging as a powerful means to link preclinical and clinical research, thus providing a paradigm that may help expedite progression into the clinical phase of novel mechanisms for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Contemporary biological psychiatry uses experimental (animal) models to increase our understanding of affective disorder pathogenesis. Despite the well-recognized spectrum nature of affective disorders, modern anxiolytic drug discovery mainly targets specific pathways and molecular determinants within a single phenotypic domain. However, greater understanding of the integrative mechanisms and pathogenesis is essential in order to develop new effective therapies. Areas covered: In this review, the authors emphasize the importance of a 'domain interplay-oriented' approach to experimental affective research. They also highlight the need to expand the scope of anxiolytic drug targets to better understand the pathogenesis of anxiety-spectrum disorders. Expert opinion: There is the potential to markedly improve the utility of animal models for affective disorders. First, the authors suggest that one such way would be by analyzing the systems of several domains and their interplay to better understand disease pathogenesis. Further, it could also be improved by expanding the range of model species and by extending the spectrum of anxiolytic drug targets; this would help to focus on emerging and unconventional systems to better develop new therapies.",

This is a direct outcome of the increasing knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved during an ischemic insult of the myocardium. Even then there is still a major unmet need for better strategies or drug therapies to reduce ventricular remodeling and improve post-ischemic myocardial function. The ex-vivo isolated working heart model and the in vivo myocardial infarction model are the best known techniques to elucidate the contribution of a drug therapy to confer cardioprotection in the event of an ischemic insult/reperfusion. Our review aims to provide an insight into the state of the art techniques that lay the foundations for cardiovascular drug discovery and present the prospects for further development from a preclinical perspective. The first section of the review provides an overview of the rat/mouse ex-vivo and in vivo models of myocardial ischemia. The following section will then present various applications of these clinically relevant models in characterizing cardiac functions, screening for drugs and identifying the drug induced changes in cardiac functions. Finally the role of these models in drug development is discussed with respect to functional relevance of drug treatment on heart rate, aortic flow, coronary flow, infarct size and the mechanisms by which these drugs promote myocardial protection. This review may serve as a basic knowledge for researchers who intend to study the efficacy of a drug in the treatment of ischemic heart diseases.",

The side effects of known drugs and the deficiency of long-term safety data, in addition to the already determined adverse effects for the current preclinical drugs against T2DM, have largely called upon the urgent exploration of novel therapeutic and preventative strategies against this disease. Areas covered: The authors highlight the potential approaches for anti-T2DM drug discovery by focusing on: the restoration of pancreatic \u03b2-cell mass, the promotion of insulin secretion, the regulation of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the modulation of autophagy. Expert opinion: T2DM is based on the gradual development of insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell dysfunction. Thus, the restoration of \u03b2-cell function is considered as one of the promising therapeutic strategies against T2DM. The stress factors, such as oxidative stress, ER stress and autophagy, play potent roles in the regulation of \u03b2-cell apoptosis, insulin secretion and sensitivity in the development of T2DM involving complicated cross-talks. Based on multiplex stress-involved regulatory networks, more and more novel potential targets have been discovered and the multi-targeted drug leads are expected to help develop more effective clinical agents for the treatment of T2DM.",

The number of deaths due to T2DM highlights the insufficiency of the currently available drugs for controlling the disease and its complications and more needs to be done. Areas covered: This paper reviews the updated pathobiology of T2DM that should be targeted in drug discovery. Further, the article provides discussion on the mechanism of action, side effects and structure of the currently available synthetic drugs. The authors specifically evaluate two newer classes of anti-diabetic agents: dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) and sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT2). They also present information on newer synthetic compounds. The article also highlights the key interactions between synthetic compounds and DPP-4 active site residues for rational drug design. Expert opinion: Numerous anti-hyperglycaemic drugs are currently available but many are limited by their adverse effects. The identification of the 3D structure of DPP-4 has opened new avenues for design, thus aiming to produce drugs that directly exploit the structural characteristics of this binding site. Further, structural- and ligand-based screening techniques have been developed for designing novel DPP-4 and SGLT2 inhibitors. There has also been progress with the design and development of novel T2DM therapeutics including: PPAR\u03b1/ dual agonists, Sirtuin 1 activators, glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitors. Finding new targets and synthesis methods is still essential but it is becoming accepted that no diabetic therapy is 'best suited' with each patient responding differently.",

Areas covered: The authors review the known biology of NSCs, their normal function in development, the adult brain, and in vitro culture systems. The authors also discuss the scientific and technological progress which will aid wider applications of NSCs for drug screening/development purposes. The authors base this article on literature searches performed through PubMed and Google Scholar. Expert opinion: NSC systems present unique opportunities that are starting to be successfully explored for genetic and chemical screening. These systems provide the possibility of identifying and optimizing molecules/drugs that could lead to the tighter control in self-renewal and lineage specification of NSCs as well as their functional maturation. This could be crucial in moving forward NSC-based therapies. It is expected that recent advances in the method of producing NSCs from patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and in the technologies to grow them in vitro, while preserving their full developmental potential, will allow a full exploitation of NSCs both in drug discovery programs and in predictive toxicology studies.",

Therefore, huge sums of money are committed based on the outcome of crystallography experiments and their interpretation. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses how to evaluate the correctness of an X-ray structure, focusing on the validation of small molecule-protein complexes. Various types of inaccuracies found within the PDB are identified and the ramifications of these errors are discussed. The reader will gain an understanding of the key parameters that need to be inspected before a structure can be used in drug discovery efforts, as well as an appreciation of the difficulties of correctly interpreting electron density for small molecules. The reader will also be introduced to methods for validating small molecules within the context of a macromolecular structure. EXPERT OPINION: One of the reasons that ligand identification and positioning, within a macromolecular crystal structure, is so difficult is that the quality of small molecules widely varies in the PDB. For this reason, the PDB can not always be considered a reliable repository of structural information pertaining to small molecules, and this makes the derivation of general principles that govern small molecule-protein interactions more difficult.",

This complex and costly innovation-to-commercialization failure, the formidable associated costs, and the relevance of various core competencies endemic to universities, the pharmaceutical industry, and government have been major drivers for establishing preclinical drug-discovery alliances involving these constituencies. Such cross-sector alliances have the potential to help restore at least some of the industry's former health by militating risk, enhancing productivity, and improving the quantity/quality of development candidates. This Editorial will highlight certain characteristics of pharma-industry and non-industrial settings that can jeopardize the effectiveness of these sectors for unified preclinical discovery campaigns capable of generating well-characterized drug candidates that merit human testing. Based on decades of research and development (R&D) and business experience spanning international big-pharma, biotechnology, and academic spheres, the author opines that a synergistic lingua franca is required among involved constituencies in order for such cross-sector discovery alliances to emerge as robust drug-discovery engines fueled by joint intellectual effort.

All of these viruses are Risk Group 4 biosafety pathogens. MACV causes human disease outbreak with high case-fatality rates. To date, at least 1,200 cases with \u2248200 fatalities have been recorded.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review summarizes available systems and technologies for the identification of antivirals against MACV. Furthermore, the article summarizes animal models that have been used for the in vivo evaluation of novel inhibitors. The article highlights present treatments for arenaviral diseases and provides an overview of efficacious small molecules and other therapeutics reported to date. Finally, the article summarizes strategies to identify novel inhibitors for anti-arenaviral therapy.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: New high-throughput approaches to quantitate infection rates of arenaviruses, as well as viruses modified to carry reporter genes, will accelerate compound screens and drug discovery efforts. RNAi, gene expression profiling and proteomics studies will identify host targets for therapeutic intervention. New discoveries in the cell entry mechanism of MACV and other arenaviruses as well as extensive structural studies of arenaviral L and NP could facilitate the rational design of antivirals effective against all pathogenic New World arenaviruses.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Urinary bladder cancer is a major human malignancy that afflicts millions of people worldwide every year. Urinary bladder cancer is usually superficial at presentation in 70 - 80% of patients. In these cases, a simple transurethral resection is adequate for removing the tumor. However, some patients experience recurrence or even tumor progression. In another 20 - 30% of patients, muscle-invasive carcinoma is diagnosed. Despite all the developments in this area, even today, the options for treatment of urinary bladder cancer remain inadequate. The search for the mechanisms involved in human urinary bladder cancer and for new and improved treatment methods has led to the development of many experimental models using laboratory animals over the past 40 years.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors provide a concise overview of the animal models used to study urinary bladder cancer. Furthermore, the authors discuss their advantages and disadvantages with regard to the search for new therapeutic approaches.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The use of urinary bladder cancer models for understanding the mechanisms involved in tumors' response to new treatments is an important step in the drug discovery process. However, the authors believe that it will be necessary to develop our knowledge and understanding of the molecular processes underlying urothelial chemical carcinogenesis for us to better evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Background: The number of drugs in active clinical development or on the market that target the unactivated conformational states of protein kinases is growing and represents a significant portion of kinase research at biopharmaceutical companies. These non-classical kinase inhibitors have a mode of action which may overcome some of the liabilities of classical ATP-site inhibitors that substantially overlap the space that ATP occupies in the activated kinase. Objective: This review will discuss state-of-the-art methods of inhibiting protein kinases by targeting the unactivated conformations of the enzyme with small molecules directed to the ATP binding region. Methods: Biochemical and structural biology publications and public domain crystal structures were evaluated to identify key concepts in drug discovery for unactivated protein kinase inhibitors that target the ATP binding region. Conclusion: The potential for enhanced selectivity, potency and duration of pharmacological action may allow non-classical kinase therapeutics to be used for chronic dosing in non-life-threatening indications. Moreover, by targeting additional conformational space on the kinase protein it is possible that new chemical matter will be discovered such that current intellectual property limitations on traditional ATP-site chemical scaffolds may be circumvented.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although intensive efforts have been made, effective treatments for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases have not been yet discovered. Possible reasons for this include the lack of appropriate disease models of human neurons and a limited understanding of the etiological and neurobiological mechanisms. Recent advances in pluripotent stem cell (PSC) research have now opened the path to the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) starting from somatic cells, thus offering an unlimited source of patient-specific disease-relevant neuronal cells.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors focus on the use of human PSC-derived cells in modeling neurological disorders and discovering of new drugs and provide their expert perspectives on the field.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The advent of human iPSC-based disease models has fuelled renewed enthusiasm and enormous expectations for insights of disease mechanisms and identification of more disease-relevant and novel molecular targets. Human PSCs offer a unique tool that is being profitably exploited for high-throughput screening (HTS) platforms. This process can lead to the identification and optimization of molecules/drugs and thus move forward new pharmacological therapies for a wide range of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions. It is predicted that improvements in the production of mature neuronal subtypes, from patient-specific human-induced pluripotent stem cells and their adaptation to culture, to HTS platforms will allow the increased exploitation of human pluripotent stem cells in drug discovery programs.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the acute loss of kidney function. AKI is increasingly frequent and is associated with impaired survival and chronic kidney disease progression. Experimental AKI models have contributed to a better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms but they have not yet resulted in routine clinical application of novel therapeutic approaches. Areas covered: The authors present the advances in experimental AKI models over the last decade. Furthermore, the authors review their current and expected impact on novel drug discovery. Expert opinion: New AKI models have been developed in rodents and nonrodents. Non-rodents allow the evaluation of specific aspects of AKI in both bigger animals and simpler organisms such as drosophila and zebrafish. New rodent models have recently reproduced described clinical entities, such as aristolochic and warfarin nephropathies, and have also provided better models for old entities such as thrombotic microangiopathy-induced AKI. Several therapies identified in animal models are now undergoing clinical trials in human AKI, including p53 RNAi and bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells. It is conceivable that further refinement of animal models in combination with ongoing trials and novel trials based on already identified potential targets will eventually yield effective therapies for clinical AKI.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: G protein-coupled receptors represent the largest class of druggable targets and are known to be modulated by both orthosteric agonists and positive/negative allosteric modulators (PAMs/NAMs). Proper experimental design and data analysis for the dose matrix between an agonist and PAM or NAM are critical to elucidate the key parameters for understanding molecular mechanism and structure-activity relationship (SAR) in drug discovery. Areas covered: The authors provide an overview and best practice recommendations on the quantitative analysis of receptor allosterism. The authors propose a simple classification system for receptor modulators on the basis of their efficacy and affinity modifiers. The authors also outline the optimal assay designs for both fixed dose screening and dose matrix study of receptor modulators. Expert opinion: The authors recommend the global curve fitting approach to reliably yield system- and modulator-specific parameters for SAR ranking. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the uncertainty in maximal system response has insignificant impact on SAR ranking. The authors anticipate that systems pharmacology models integrating both binding kinetics and functional allosterism will be needed to address the inherent limitations of current allosterism models.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The physiological importance of GPCR/ligand pathways is highlighted by the fact that numerous pathologies are attributed to their signaling dysfunction. Over 50% of the pharmaceutical drugs currently used to treat human disease are based on compounds that interact with GPCRs. Apelin/APJ constitutes a novel endogenous peptide/GPCR system proposed to be involved in a wide range of physiological functions. Early evidence suggests that apelin/APJ may hold promise as a target for development of novel therapeutic agents which may counteract a number of pathologies including cardiovascular disease. Despite advances in treatment of cardiovascular disease, incidence, prevalence, morbidity and economic costs remain high necessitating the development of new treatment paradigms.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review summarizes apelin/APJ structure, distribution and regulation; presents evidence for a role of apelin in pressure/volume homeostasis and in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease; summarizes data on beneficial effects of apelin in preclinical, animal models of cardiovascular disease and measurement of plasma levels of apelin across the full spectrum of cardiovascular disease in humans; and notes the first studies describing bioactivity of apelin peptides in human healthy volunteers and patients with heart failure.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: More clarity is needed on the precise physiological/pathophysiological role of the apelin/APJ system in human health and disease. Nonetheless, preclinical studies and initial studies in humans show that APJ antagonism may represent a novel therapeutic target for patients with cardiovascular disease. Development of appropriately validated assays for apelin will clarify circulating levels of the peptide in health and disease. Development of suitable agonists/antagonists will pave the way for much needed future studies essential for advancing this promising field of drug discovery.",

Previous studies indicated rather negative impacts of consolidation on research and development, suggesting that they do not necessarily lead to long-term reinforcement of research capabilities, although they may enrich the drug pipeline in the short term. However, recent studies have implied a positive side in terms of knowledge-base transfer. Further micro-organizational studies suggested that scientists learned new knowledge and approaches from partner scientists and improved their performance and innovation. These findings imply that measures for the scientist-level integration after M&As would reinforce fundamental research capabilities in the long term.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides a review of natural Chinese drug products, including phytochemic compounds, medicinal herbs and multi-component herbal formulae, that have been reported to possess hypoglycemic activity with mechanisms for antidiabetic action. Along with a great number of combination formulae, - 187 different Chinese medicinal herbs are clinically applied to treat diabetes mellitus and its complications in China, most of which have achieved reasonably good clinical outcomes. These valuable data and practical experience provide a promising opportunity for the discovery and development of drug candidates with good therapeutic efficacy and low toxicity. The concept of treating complex, multifactorial metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, using multi-component therapeutics, including single-herb formulae and combination herbal formulae, shall be regarded as a concerted pharmacologic intervention of multiple compounds interacting with multiple targets and possessing interdependent activities that are required for a synergistic or optimal effect. The conventional approach for the discovery and development of antidiabetic drug products from natural products involving a high-throughput, bioactivity guided drug screening of single compounds obtained from thousands of herbs has proven to be a costly and non-productive effort. Hence, an alternative way of developing new drug candidates, as suggested in this review, is to reduce and simplify a well-established combination herbal formula, along with the pharmacologic evaluation of a small group of phytochemic compounds, which are therapeutically effective as the original formula and have known chemical structures, compositions and mechanisms of action that are similar to chemical drugs.

        "abstract": "Background: Because cancer is a complex disease, it is unlikely that a single mono functional 'targeted' drug will be effective for treating this most advanced disease. Combined drugs that impact multiple targets simultaneously are better at controlling complex disease systems, are less prone to drug resistance and are the standard of care in cancer treatment. In order to improve the efficiency of using a two-drug cocktail, one approach involves the use of the so-called hybrid drugs, which comprises the incorporation of two drugs in a single molecule with the intention of exerting dual drug action. Objective: In the present article, we discuss the design, synthesis and various applications of anticancer hybrid agents and the developments in this field during the last few decades. Additionally, we describe different types of linkers and their role in contributing towards biological effects and the in vivo mechanism of drug release. We also depict some challenges from scientific and regulatory perspectives in the hybrid drug development process. Conclusion: In the era of increasing drug resistance in cancer patients, the discovery of hybrid drugs could provide an effective strategy to create chemical entities likely to be more efficacious and less prone to resistance. However, some technical and regulatory challenges will have to be surmounted before hybrid drugs succeed in the clinical settings and justify the considerable promise of this novel concept.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Attrition in the drug industry due to safety findings remains high and requires a shift in the current safety testing paradigm. Many companies are now positioning safety assessment at each stage of the drug development process, including discovery, where an early perspective on potential safety issues is sought, often at chemical scaffold level, using a variety of emerging technologies. Given the lengthy development time frames of drugs in the pharmaceutical industry, the authors believe that the impact of new technologies on attrition is best measured as a function of the quality and timeliness of candidate compounds entering development.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: The authors provide an overview of in silico and in vitro models, as well as more complex approaches such as 'omics,' and where they are best positioned within the drug discovery process.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: It is important to take away that not all technologies should be applied to all projects. Technologies vary widely in their validation state, throughput and cost. A thoughtful combination of validated and emerging technologies is crucial in identifying the most promising candidates to move to proof-of-concept testing in humans. In spite of the challenges inherent in applying new technologies to drug discovery, the successes and recognition that we cannot continue to rely on safety assessment practices used for decades have led to rather dramatic strategy shifts and fostered partnerships across government agencies and industry. We are optimistic that these efforts will ultimately benefit patients by delivering effective and safe medications in a timely fashion.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Drug discovery for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has experienced a surge in clinical studies and remarkable preclinical milestones utilizing a variety of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 model systems. Of the drugs that were tested and showed positive preclinical effects, none demonstrated therapeutic benefits to ALS patients in clinical settings. Areas covered: This review discusses the advances made in drug discovery for ALS and highlights why drug development is proving to be so difficult. It also discusses how a closer look at both preclinical and clinical studies could uncover the reasons why these preclinical successes have yet to result in the availability of an effective drug for clinical use. Expert opinion: Valuable lessons from the numerous preclinical and clinical studies supply the biggest advantage in the monumental task of finding a cure for ALS. Obviously, a single design type for ALS clinical trials has not yielded success. The authors suggest a two-pronged approach that may prove essential to achieve clinical efficacy in the identification of novel targets and preclinical testing in multiple models to identify biomarkers that can function in diagnostic, predictive and prognostic roles, and changes to clinical trial design and patient recruitment criteria. The advancement of technology and invention of more powerful tools will further enhance the above. This will give rise to more sophisticated clinical trials with consideration of a range of criteria from: optimum dose, route of delivery, specific biomarkers, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicology to biomarkers, timing for trial and patients clinical status.",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) - particularly with concurrent obesity ('diabesity') - is an intensifying global public-health problem. Medical needs and market opportunities in the T2D space have propelled discovery efforts aimed at inventing new synthetic T2D drugs differentiable by improved safety and efficacy and/or the ability to modulate emerging T2D targets. Particularly for moderately and severely obese individuals, weight-loss (bariatric) surgery offers an effective means of reducing obesity-driven T2D that is superior in many respects to medical T2D management. Yet, not all overweight or obese individuals with T2D qualify for bariatric surgery, and current healthcare resources are inadequate for applying surgical T2D control to more than a very small segment of qualified patients. Bariatric surgery is no guarantee of 'curative' T2D abrogation, significant rates of T2D non-remission or re-emergence having been observed in diabesity patients following bariatric procedures. Preoperative glucose control by oral hypoglycemic drugs reduces the chance of T2D recurrence post-surgery, and diabesity patients in whom glycemic indices have been improved by bariatric surgery may still require some level of T2D pharmacotherapy. Laboratory and clinical data indicate that synthetic T2D drugs can improve T2D-related outcomes following bariatric procedures, and current T2D drug-discovery efforts are being informed by the metabolic advantages associated with bariatric surgery. These circumstances intensify the need for and extend the impact of T2D drug discovery by demonstrating multiple levels of interplay between medical and surgical approaches to improve the health of individuals with diabesity and, perhaps, approach the overarching goal of decreasing long-term cardiovascular mortality.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During the early 1970s, Danish physicians Jorn Dyerberg and colleagues observed that Greenland Eskimos consuming fatty fishes exhibited low incidences of heart disease. Fish oil is now one of the most commonly consumed dietary supplements. In 2004, concentrated fish oil was approved as a drug by the FDA for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Fish oil contains two major omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). With advancements in lipid concentration and purification techniques, EPA- or DHA-enriched products are now commercially available, and the availability of these components in isolation allows their individual effects to be examined. Newly synthesized derivatives and endogenously discovered metabolites of DHA exhibit therapeutic utility for obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes our current knowledge on the distinct effects of EPA and DHA to prevent metabolic syndrome and reduce cardiotoxicity risk. Since EPA is an integral component of fish oil, we will briefly review EPA effects, but our main theme will be to summarize effects of the DHA derivatives that are available today. We focus on using nutrition-based drug discovery to explore the potential of DHA derivatives for the treatment of obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. EXPERT OPINION: The safety and efficacy evaluation of DHA derivatives will provide novel biomolecules for the drug discovery arsenal. Novel nutritional-based drug discoveries of DHA derivatives or metabolites may provide realistic and alternative strategies for the treatment of metabolic and cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "A major new trend in drugs targeted at protein kinases is the discovery of allosteric modulators. These compounds differ from ATP-centric drugs in that they do not compete with ATP for binding to the catalytic domain, generally acting by inducing conformational changes to modulate activity. They could provide a number of advantages over more classical protein kinase drugs. For example, they are likely to be more selective, since they bind to unique regions of the kinase and may be useful in overcoming resistance that has developed to drugs that compete with ATP. They offer the ability of activating the kinases either by removing factors that inhibit kinase activity or by simply producing changes to enzyme to foster catalytic activity. Furthermore, they provide more subtle modulation of kinase activity than simply blocking ATP access to inhibit activity. One hurdle to overcome in discovering these compounds is that allosteric modulators may need to inhibit protein-protein interactions; generally difficult to accomplish with small molecules. Despites the technical problems of identifying allosteric modulators, major gains have been made is identifying allosteric inhibitors and activators of growth factor receptors as well as soluble tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases and some of these drugs are now in various stages of clinical trials. This review will focus on discovery of novel allosteric modulators of protein kinases and drug discovery approaches that have been employed to identify such compounds.",

Sarcomas in adults may follow a more indolent course, but aggressive tumors are also common. Sarcomas that are metastatic at diagnosis, or recurrent following therapy, remain refractory to current treatment options with dismal overall survival rates. A major focus of clinical trials, for patients with sarcoma, is to identify novel and more effective therapeutic strategies targeted to genomic or proteomic aberrations specific to the malignant cells.

However, the role of specific subtypes remains poorly understood due to the lack of selective nAChR probes. During the last decade, drug design strategies have been powered by a wide variety of natural compounds with diverse chemical structures, and by the structural characterization of several nAChRs structural homologs. Areas covered: In this review, the authors present a short overview of nAChRs, and some natural sources of bioactive molecules targeting these receptors. The authors provide an emphasis on \u03b1-conotoxins from Conus venoms, which provide the most diverse selective antagonists of nAChRs known to date, as well briefly discussing macrocyclic imine toxins. The authors, furthermore, review valuable radioactive and non-radioactive methods used for discovering novel ligands targeting nAChRs and highlight high-throughput developments in receptor-binding and electrophysiological assays. Finally, the authors review the molecular modeling approaches used in the last few years with an aim to provide an overview of their potential to identify and optimize selective nAChR ligands. Expert opinion: Recent years have provided new valuable techniques for the detection and identification of new nAChRs ligands, along with an increasing use of different molecular modeling tools. This furthering of knowledge has had an impact on the design and discovery of more potent and selective nAChRs ligands. There is still however a lack of high-resolution structural information that will require new developments.",

Specifically, this article provides a review of the literature on anti-VEGF agents and other angiogenesis inhibitors used in pre-clinical and clinical trials for cancer treatment.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Future anti-angiogenic drug design centres on multiple protein targets and combinations including: growth factors, hypoxia-inducible factor and tumour endothelial cell markers unique to the tumour vasculature. Furthermore, treatment dosing, scheduling and combination with radiation and chemotherapy require further investigation, as does the potential of treating early disease, and the development of biomarkers which accurately predict response to therapy. These are essential for the future development of these drugs with individualised therapy likely to be the ultimate goal.",

The hydrolase function of this enzyme specifically catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the conversion of LTA(4) to LTB(4), one of the most potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils. The wealth of in vitro and in vivo data favors in support of LTA(4)H as an appealing target for the discovery and development of anti-inflammatory drugs.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: The authors provide an overview of the recent advances on LTA(4)H inhibitors since 2000. The review details the medicinal chemistry efforts leading to the generation of novel inhibitor chemotypes with desirable drug-like properties as well as the advantages and disadvantages of LTA(4)H as a desirable therapeutic target.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Most of the LTA(4)H inhibitors block pro-inflammatory LTB(4) biosynthesis by concomitant inhibition of both the hydrolase and aminopeptidase activities of LTA(4)H. However, the degradation of another endogenous chemoattractant substrate (PGP) by aminopeptidase function of LTA(4)H was shown, introducing a new anti-inflammatory mission for this pro-inflammatory enzyme. LTA(4)H inhibitors were also shown to maintain anti-inflammatory lipoxin formation. Hence, the data on new LTA(4)H inhibitors should be cautiously interpreted with regard to potential repercussions of preventing PGP degradation as well as for the clinical benefits of concomitant lipoxin formation.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The extensive comorbidity among psychiatric disorders underscores the need for a fundamental change in the way psychopathology is classified. An alternative 'dimensional' system classifies disorders based on relationships with respect to heritability patterns and comorbidity. It is from this 'dimensional view' that mouse modeling of neuropsychiatric disorders is presently discussed.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review describes three proposed dimensions of psychopathology: internalizing (disorders of negative emotions), externalizing (disorders of impulsivity) and schizophrenic. The article, furthermore, presents and explains the concept of endophenotype and discusses the possible endophenotypes relevant to each of these dimensions. Finally, the article also describes mouse behavioral tests that are used for quantifying these endophenotypes and presents examples of recent studies that have used these tests.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Considering animal models within the context of endophenotypes associated with psychopathological 'dimensions', rather than focusing on modeling specific disorders, might facilitate the discovery of new pharmacotherapies. Mouse models will be powerful tools for exploring how environmental factors interact with genetic vulnerability to cause psychopathology, possibly leading to novel preventative treatment strategies. Future pharmacotherapies for neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression might comprise drugs or drug combinations that target key components of multiple systems, including neurotransmitter systems, cytokine production, oxidative stress and the HPA axis.",

        "abstract": "This paper responds to the fact that over 200 Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug candidates have failed to date and draws on searches of the literature for studies of error effects in drug developments and the authors' published works. In the same period, basic knowledge of AD pathology has greatly expanded providing both potential therapeutic targets and rationales for modifications in strategies for testing AD drug candidates. Current opinion generally holds that AD drug candidates have failed because they address pathology that is already too advanced. Less attention is paid to numerous reported methodological weaknesses capable of biasing AD clinical trials and drug developments and thus invalidating conclusions to be reached about the drugs being tested. The costs of quality controls possibly needed to better insure validity in AD drug developments raises concerns that progress toward success in AD drug development may be hindered by the costs of intervening against current methodological barriers to the successful completions of AD drug developments.",

The John Langley (1905) concept of 'receptive substances' initiated a cascade of cardinal discoveries for pharmacology. During the following 100 years, receptors achieved the status of well-defined multifunctional cellular proteins mediating all drug effects. The G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were discussed in relation to multiple targets they represent for clinically used or new medicines. The development of inbred and transgenic animal strains is a fundamental twentieth century achievement for biological research activities. Progress in treating CNS disorders still awaits breakthrough treatments. Drug development remains a risky and expensive venture; improvements are expected from emerging biomarker and translational medicine technologies. Future clinical research has to document the benefits that new medications provide to concerned stakeholders.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We wish ASPET a new century of great achievements and acknowledge the dedication of several generations of colleagues, many of whom are our 'unsung heroes'.

        "abstract": "Contemporary drug target discovery relies on a continuum of genetic and chemical-based screening technologies. These approaches conflate pharmaceutical and genetic principles, providing a conceptual platform that links dominant genetics with drug action. Thus, phenotypic genetic screens using vector-expressed dominant genetic effectors - trans-acting molecules that modulate gene function, such as peptides or RNA interference triggers - can reveal genes whose inhibition engenders a therapeutic effect. The correlation of this genetic inhibition with a specific protein activity defines a drug target candidate. Retroviruses provide a unique opportunity to stably deliver a variety of dominant genetic effectors to mammalian cells in a flexible predetermined fashion and are a favoured system for phenotypic screening. Here, the authors review recent innovations and approaches to therapeutic target discovery using retroviral vectors.",

The implication of low GABA levels in a number of common CNS disease states and/or common medical disorders has stimulated intensive interest in preparing GABA analogs, which have superior pharmaceutical properties in comparison to GABA.

        "abstract": "Background: There are many daunting challenges for companies who wish to bring novel drugs to market. The information complexity around potential drug targets has increased greatly with the introduction of microarrays, high-throughput screening and other technological advances over the past decade, but has not yet fundamentally increased our understanding of how to modify a disease with pharmaceuticals. Further, the bar has been raised in getting a successful drug to market as just being new is no longer enough: the drug must demonstrate improved performance compared with the ever increasing generic pharmacopeia to gain support from payers and government authorities. In addition, partly as a consequence of a climate of concern regarding the safety of drugs, regulatory authorities have approved fewer new molecular entities compared to historical norms over the past few years. Objective: To overcome these challenges, the pharmaceutical industry must fully embrace information technology to bring better understood compounds to market. An important first step in addressing an unmet medical need is in understanding the disease and identifying the physiological target(s) to be modulated by the drug. Deciding which targets to pursue for a given disease requires a multidisciplinary effort that integrates heterogeneous data from many sources, including genetic variations of populations, changes in gene expression and biochemical assays. Method: The Life Science Grid was developed to provide a flexible framework to integrate such diverse biological, chemical and disease information to help scientists make better-informed decisions. Results/conclusion: The Life Science Grid has been used to rapidly and effectively integrate scientific information in the pharmaceutical industry and has been placed in the open source community to foster collaboration in the life sciences community.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The enhancement in pediatric cancer survival achieved in the past few decades has been confined to low-and moderate-risk cancers, whereas no notable improvement in survival was observed in high-risk and advanced-stage childhood cancers. High attrition rate of candidate drugs in clinical trials is a major hurdle in the development of effective therapies for pediatric solid tumors. In order to reduce the failure rate of candidate drugs in clinical trials, more effective strategies are needed to enhance the predictability of preclinical testing. Areas covered: The authors have described the current trends in preclinical drug development for treating pediatric solid tumors. Furthermore, the authors review their limitations and the available remedies, with regards to choice of models, pharmacokinetic considerations and the criteria for assessing the long-term efficacy of a candidate drug. Expert opinion: In many solid tumors, common differences between pediatric and adult cancers have been observed, and therefore, clinical trials for pediatric solid tumors must be conducted on the basis of preclinical observations in pediatric solid tumor models. There is a need to invest in extensive preclinical testing on pediatric solid tumor models. None of the preclinical models can fully recapitulate the human cancers. Therefore, these limitations must be considered while conducting a preclinical trial. The dose and schedule of drugs used for preclinical testing must be clinically relevant. While testing the efficacy of drugs, the markers of apoptosis, drug resistance, hypoxia and tumor-initiating cells can inform us about the long-term therapeutic response of a cancer. \u00a9 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cancer is a leading cause of death in childhood. Encouraging progress has been made in the treatment of childhood malignancies, but there is an unmet need for new drugs to improve survival and reduce treatment-associated toxicities. Drug development in paediatric oncology has specific requirements with regard to the patient population and the regulatory background and presents several unique challenges that need addressing.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review discusses the current framework of paediatric oncology drug development and some of the specific challenges in pre-clinical and clinical research. The authors discuss the recent developments in the targeting of various signalling pathways. These pathways represent a selection of targets that have been identified by pre-clinical and clinical investigators to be highly relevant in paediatric malignancies.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The development of targeted agents in paediatric oncology must be driven by knowledge of tumour biology. Predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers should be incorporated within paediatric early clinical trials wherever possible. Faster dose-escalation, limited numbers of cohorts and novel adaptive designs can help to make paediatric early clinical trials more efficient. Close collaboration between academic/clinical researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, regulatory bodies and parent groups are crucial in overcoming the challenges associated with paediatric oncology drug development.",

AOXs have broad substrate specificity and are present in the liver of humans and many experimental animals. These enzymes play an important role in Phase I metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics of toxicological interest.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: Preclinical studies on the AOX-dependent metabolism of new drug candidates are problematic. Furthermore, there is a general lack of reliable in silico methodologies to predict whether a new organic molecule is an AOX substrate. In vitro systems, for the design of high- or medium-throughput screening tests, to identify AOX substrates have many limitations. In vivo studies on AOX-dependent metabolism in animal models, on the other hand, are difficult because the complement of liver AOXs in humans and popular experimental animals is different. The authors discuss the possible ways to overcome all these problems.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The significance of AOXs as drug-metabolizing enzymes is increasing, as the current strategies of organic synthesis designed to avoid cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-dependent metabolism tend to enrich for new chemical structures efficiently oxidized by these enzymes. There is need for reliable methods to screen for, predict, and validate AOX-dependent metabolism of new drug candidates.",

Targeting the eCB system appears to represent an attractive and novel approach to the treatment of depression and other mood disorders.

Additionally, the review provides discussion on compounds and drugs that target this system and might prove to be successful for the treatment of mood-related psychiatric disorders.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The discovery of increasingly selective modulators of CB receptors should enable the identification of optimal therapeutic strategies.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Estrogen replacement is traditionally seen as the gold standard for preventing osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women as well as for the management of menopausal symptoms. However, estrogen may lead to an increased risk of breast and, when unopposed by progestins, endometrial cancers. Alternative therapies include bisphosphonates and raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). While the former have been associated with suboptimal adherence, the latter is considerably less potent than estrogen and its effect in the prevention of nonvertebral fractures remains uncertain. Hence, there is a need for additional effective medications to prevent fractures in postmenopausal women that provide additional benefits. Areas covered: This article reviews lasofoxifene, a new SERM for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and urogenital atrophy. The medical literature is reviewed for articles containing the terms 'lasofoxifene' and 'SERMs'. The manuscript reviews the discovery strategies and preclinical development of lasofoxifene as well as its clinical development. Expert opinion: Recent evidence suggests that the ideal SERM profile for one patient may be far from ideal for another. Thus, it could be favorable that different SERMs may be available in the future, each with a somewhat different profile that may be rationally applied to various patients with a spectrum of needs. In this context, lasofoxifene, while retaining some of the adverse effects of other SERMs (i.e., hot flushes and risk of venous thromboembolic events), may offer an improved skeletal efficacy over raloxifene, addressing other postmenopausal conditions, including reduction in breast cancer risk and treatment of vaginal atrophy. \u00a9 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.",

Therapy of neurological diseases is limited due to restricted penetration of pharmacons across the BBB. Models for screening the brain penetration of drug candidates are needed early in drug discovery. Culture-based models are useful tools for both basic research on BBB, and testing the permeability of new therapeutical molecules. This review focuses on patented in vitro BBB models and their potential application in CNS drug discovery. Cell culture models using primary and immortalized brain endothelial cells of non-human and human origin, in co-culture or mono-culture setting, in static or dynamic conditions are discussed, as well as methods to induce BBB properties in such in vitro models. The aim of these models is to reproduce as many aspects as possible of the in vivo BBB. All models should show some elements of general endothelial and specific BBB properties, like physiologically realistic cell architecture, restrictive paracellular pathway, and functional expression of transport mechanisms. Though no \"ideal in vitro BBB model\" has been constructed yet, the currently available models provide valuable information on BBB permeability and are useful tools in CNS drug discovery.",

Areas covered: This review summarizes the core preclinical data that frequently contribute to building an understanding of abuse potential for a new molecular entity, in addition to highlighting models that can provide increased resolution regarding the level of risk. Second, an important distinction between abuse potential and addiction potential is drawn, with comments on how preclinical models can inform on each. Expert opinion: While the currently adopted preclinical models possess strong predictive validity, there are areas for future refinement and research. These areas include a more refined use of self-administration models to assess relative reinforcement; and the need for open innovation in pursuing improvements. There is also the need for careful scientifically driven application of models rather than a standardization of methodologies, and the need to explore the opportunities that may exist for enhancing the value of physical dependence and withdrawal studies by focusing on withdrawal-induced drug seeking, rather than broad symptomology.",

Current therapies are directed at symptomatic control because no effective regenerative treatment exists. Primary challenge is that mechanisms that lead to distal axonal degeneration, a common feature of all peripheral neuropathies, are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE/METHODS: To address the role and specific characteristics of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) derived sensory neuron culture system as a useful model in evaluating the pathogenic mechanisms of peripheral neuropathies and examination and validation of potential therapeutic compounds. A thorough review of the recent literature was completed and select examples of the use of DRG neurons in different peripheral neuropathy models were chosen to highlight the utility of these cultures. CONCLUSION: Many useful models of different peripheral neuropathies have been developed using DRG neuronal culture and potential therapeutic targets have been examined, but so far none of the potential therapeutic compounds have succeeded in clinical trials. In recent years, focus has changed to evaluation of axon degeneration as the primary outcome measure advocating a drug development strategy starting with phenotypic drug screening, followed by validation in primary complex co-cultures and animal models.",

Furthermore, the article provides details of their synthesis and occurrence in compound libraries through high-throughput screening (HTS) and virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS). Additionally, the authors provide the reader with possible mechanisms of non-specific target modulation, analysis of the crystal structures of enzyme-rhodanine complexes and a comparison of rhodanine and thiazolidine-2,4-dione moieties. EXPERT OPINION: The biological activity of compounds possessing a rhodanine moiety should be considered very critically despite the convincing data obtained in biological assays. In addition to the lack of selectivity, unusual structure-activity relationship profiles and safety and specificity problems mean that rhodanines are generally not optimizable.",

        "abstract": "Many existing pharmaceuticals are rendered ineffective in the treatment of cerebral diseases due to a permeability barrier well known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Such barrier between the blood within brain capillaries and the extracellular fluid in brain tissue has motivated several approaches aimed at delivering therapeutics to the brain. These approaches rely on strategies that can be classified as molecular modifications, the use of BBB bypassing pathways, and BBB disruptions. Although several of these approaches that have been investigated so far show promising results, none has addressed the optimization of the ratio of the dose of the drug molecules that contributes to the therapeutic effects. As such, the extensive research efforts, such as prioritizing the enhancement of the BBB permeability alone is likely to fail to provide the best therapeutic effects for a given dose if prior systemic circulation is not avoided while enhancing the spatial targeting only to regions of the brain that need treatment. Hence, new therapeutics for the brain could be synthesized to take advantage of recent technologies for non-systemic delivery and spatially targeted brain uptake.",

Plk1 is a marker of cellular proliferation and has prognostic potential in different types of human tumors. In a series of preclinical studies, Plk1 has been validated as a cancer target. This prompted many pharmaceutical companies to develop small-molecule inhibitors targeting the classical ATP-binding site of Plk1 for anticancer drug development. Recently, FDA has granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation to the Plk inhibitor BI 6727 (volasertib), which provided a survival benefit for patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia. Remarkably, a new generation of Plk1 inhibitors that target the second druggable domain of Plk1, the Polo-box domain, is currently being tested preclinically. Since various ATP-competitive compounds of Plk1 inhibit also the activities of Plk2 and Plk3, which act as tumor suppressors, the roles of closely related Plk-family members in cancer cells need to be considered carefully. In this article, the authors highlight recent insights into the biology of Plks in cancer cells and discuss the progress in the development of small-molecule Plk1 inhibitors. The authors believe that the greatest therapeutic benefit might come through leukemic cells that are in direct contact with the inhibitor in the blood stream. The identification of biomarkers and studies that document Plk activities in treated patients would also be beneficial to better understand the role of Plk inhibition in tumor development and anticancer therapy.",

Activation of mGluR4 with orthosteric agonists, allosteric agonists or pure positive allosteric modulators (PAM) has been postulated to be of broad therapeutic use. AREAS COVERED: The authors address past and current drug discovery efforts, insights and achievements in the field toward the identification of therapeutically promising and emerging class of mGluR4 activators, over the 2005 - 2011 period. Chemical structures, properties and in vivo pharmacological results discussed in the present review were retrieved from public literature including PubMed searches, Thomson Pharma and SciFinder databases searches, conferences, proceedings and posters. EXPERT OPINION: Developing a subtype-selective, orally bioavailable brain penetrant mGluR4 orthosteric agonist remains challenging. Lack of subtype selectivity and low brain penetration has been a common limitation of the first generation of mGluR4 agonist and potentiators. However, significant progress has recently been made with the identification of several double- to single-digit nanomolar mGluR4 PAM having reasonable pharmacokinetic properties, oral bioavailability and brain penetration. The use of such compounds in research has led to advancement in understanding the central role of mGluR4 in multiple neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Our understanding of the potential application of mGluR4 as therapeutic target is expected to grow as these compounds advance into preclinical and clinical development.",

In this article, we discuss how a biomedical knowledge compilation strategy focused around disease can provide a framework to enhance productivity within the pharmaceutical industry. The aim is to systematically structure multidisciplinary data in a pathophysiologically-relevant context in order to maximize its therapeutic potential. We predict that in this way the industry should finally be able to leverage on a return on investment from the -omics fields and high-throughput technologies that have failed to live up to its expectations in recent years.

Inhibitors of these enzymes, which act through trapping the active site cysteine with an electrophilic warhead, hold huge potential as therapeutic agents but the promise of these has yet to be realized in clinical studies. The article addresses aspects that ought to be considered in order to develop orally active CP inhibitors that are safe and effective therapies for trypanosomiasis. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews learnings from CP research in the trypanosomal field and recent advances in developing cysteine protease inhibitors (CPIs) of human cathepsin K, a related enzyme. Considerations such as intra- and extracellular localization of the CPs, off-target activities against human cathepsin enzymes, basic versus neutral and potential pro-drug inhibitors are reviewed. A description of odanacatib, a cathepsin K inhibitor currently in late stage development, is made to illustrate the attributes of a clinically viable CPI. EXPERT OPINION: The emerging role of CPs in a wide array of parasitic diseases is highlighted with the vision that CP inhibitors could become the '\u03b2-lactams' of anti-parasitic treatments in the coming decades. New CPI research will see the optimization of intra- and extracellular enzyme targeting, reduction of off-target activities and better understanding of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions which will all lead to compounds with much improved efficacy and viability as clinical therapies.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Targeting pathogenetic mechanisms, rather than essential processes, represents a very attractive alternative for the development of new antibiotics. This may be particularly important in the case of antimycotics, due to the urgent need for novel antifungal drugs and the paucity of selective fungal targets. The opportunistic pathogenic fungus Candida albicans is the main etiological agent of candidiasis, the most common human fungal infection. These infections carry unacceptably high mortality rates, a clear reflection of the many shortcomings of current antifungal therapy, including the limited armamentarium of antifungal agents, their toxicity and the emergence of resistance. Moreover, the antifungal pipeline is mostly dry. Areas covered: This review covers some of the most recent progress toward understanding C. albicans pathogenetic processes and how to harness this information for the development of anti-virulence agents. The two principal areas covered are filamentation and biofilm formation, as C. albicans pathogenicity is intimately linked to its ability to undergo morphogenetic conversions between yeast and filamentous morphologies and to its ability to form biofilms. Expert opinion: Filamentation and biofilm formation represent high value targets, yet are clinically unexploited, for the development of novel anti-virulence approaches against candidiasis. Although this has proved a difficult task despite increasing understanding at the molecular level of C. albicans virulence, there are some opportunities and prospects for antifungal drug development targeting these two important biological processes.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Schizophrenia is a major psychiatric disorder that afflicts about 1% of the world's population, falling into the top 10 medical disorders causing disability. Existing therapeutic strategies have had limited success; they have poor effects on core cognitive impairment and long-term disability. They are also burdened by relevant side effects. Although new antipsychotic medications have been launched in the past decades, there has been a general lack of significant innovation over the past 60 years. This lack of significant progress in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia is a reflection of the complexity and heterogeneity of its etiopathogenetic mechanisms. Areas covered: In this article, the authors briefly review genetic models of schizophrenia, focusing on examples of how new therapeutic strategies have been developed from them. They report on the evidence of epigenetic alterations in schizophrenia and their relevance to pharmacological studies. Further, they describe the implications of epigenetic mechanisms in the etiopathogenesis of the disease and the effects of current antipsychotic drugs on epigenetic processes. Finally, they provide their perspective of using epigenetic drugs for treating schizophrenia. Expert opinion: Current genetic and epigenetic studies are finally shedding light on the biomolecular mechanisms linked to the core pathogenetic alterations in schizophrenia, rather than just their symptoms. These advancements in the understanding of the physiopathology of schizophrenia provide exciting new perspectives for treatments. Indeed, the possibility of looking directly at the biomolecular level allows us to bypass the age-old issues of animal studies pertaining to their questionable validity as behavioral models.",

These strategies in common are designed to identify drugs/small molecules that can activate the utrophin promoter and would allow the functional substitution of dystrophin by upregulating utrophin expression in dystrophic muscle. The authors provide an overview of utrophin biology with a focus on regulation of the utrophin promoter and discuss current attempts in identifying utrophin promoter-activating molecules using high-throughput screening (HTS).\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The characterisation of utrophin promoter regulatory mechanisms coupled with advances in HTS have allowed researchers to undertake screens and identify a number of promising lead compounds that may prove useful for DMD. In principle, these pharmacological compounds offer significant advantages from a translational viewpoint for developing DMD therapeutics.",

Recently, human engineered cardiac tissues (hECT) have been created using cardiomyocytes (CM) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). Although a healthy adult phenotype remains elusive, such hECT display structural and functional properties that recapitulate key aspects of natural human myocardium, including dose related responses to compounds with known chronotropic, inotropic and arrhythmogenic effects.

However, a significant residual risk remains in statin-treated patients. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a strong, independent and inverse predictor of cardiovascular risk in many epidemiologic studies and has, therefore, emerged as a potential novel therapeutic target for addressing this substantial residual risk. Nevertheless, the failure of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors and niacin in clinical trials has generated considerable speculation about the beneficial effects of HDL. Experimental studies have identified several HDL cardioprotective functions, including enhancement of macrophage reverse cholesterol transport and endothelial function and its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties. Furthermore, HDL is highly heterogeneous and the atheroprotective functions of the different HDL subpopulations are not completely understood. Current available data indicate that increased HDL-C levels do not always correlate with enhanced HDL functions and, therefore, should not be considered a biomarker of HDL functionality. The clinical application of the novel HDL-based therapeutic approaches requires the development of validated and reproducible measures of key HDL functions.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Screening assays have traditionally utilized reporter labels to quantify biological responses relevant to the disease state of interest. However, there are limitations associated with the use of labels that may be overcome with temporal measurements possible with label-free. AREAS COVERED: This review comprises general and system-specific information from literature searches using PubMed, published books and the authors' personal experience. This review highlights the label-free approaches in the context of various applications. The authors also note technical issues relevant to the development of label-free assays and their application to HTS. EXPERT OPINION: The limitations associated with the use of transfected cell lines and the use of label-based assays are gradually being realized. As such, greater emphasis is being placed on label-free biophysical techniques using native cell lines. The introduction of 96- and 384-well plate label-free systems is helping to broker a wider acceptance of these approaches in high-throughput screening. However, potential users of the technologies remain skeptical, primarily because the physical basis of the signals generated, and their contextual relevance to cell biology and signal transduction, has not been fully elucidated.

        "abstract": "Importance of the field: The shift in focus from ligand based design approaches to target based discovery over the last two to three decades has been a major milestone in drug discovery research. Currently, it is witnessing another major paradigm shift by leaning towards the holistic systems based approaches rather the reductionist single molecule based methods. The effect of this new trend is likely to be felt strongly in terms of new strategies for therapeutic intervention, new targets individually and in combinations, and design of specific and safer drugs. Computational modeling and simulation form important constituents of new-age biology because they are essential to comprehend the large-scale data generated by high-throughput experiments and to generate hypotheses, which are typically iterated with experimental validation. Areas covered in this review: This review focuses on the repertoire of systems-level computational approaches currently available for target identification. The review starts with a discussion on levels of abstraction of biological systems and describes different modeling methodologies that are available for this purpose. The review then focuses on how such modeling and simulations can be applied for drug target discovery. Finally, it discusses methods for studying other important issues such as understanding targetability, identifying target combinations and predicting drug resistance, and considering them during the target identification stage itself. What the reader will gain: The reader will get an account of the various approaches for target discovery and the need for systems approaches, followed by an overview of the different modeling and simulation approaches that have been developed. An idea of the promise and limitations of the various approaches and perspectives for future development will also be obtained. Take home message: Systems thinking has now come of age enabling a 'bird's eye view' of the biological systems under study, at the same time allowing us to 'zoom in', where necessary, for a detailed description of individual components. A number of different methods available for computational modeling and simulation of biological systems can be used effectively for drug target discovery.",

        "abstract": "New chemical entities (NCEs) are abandoned in development primarily because of insufficient efficacy, safety issues and for economic reasons. Since efficacy and safety deficiencies are related in part to pharmacokinetics (PK), uncovering PK defects as early in drug discovery as possible would be highly valuable in reducing NCE failures in preclinical and clinical development. In this review, a strategy is put forth to integrate drug metabolism/pharmacokinetics and toxicology functions into drug discovery. Compound optimization in early- and late-phase drug discovery is covered, emphasizing physicochemical properties, in vitro absorption, metabolism and in vivo animal PK methodologies, primarily from the period 1998 to 1999. The present study also illustrates the idea of sorting oral bioavailability data into high/intermediate/low categories based on combining high/low rank-ordered information from physicochemical properties and in vitro absorption, metabolism and serum binding assays. It is shown that by combining the results from solubility, stability, absorption and metabolism assays, the high/intermediate/low human oral bioavailability for a series of beta- blockers can be approximately predicted. This method has a high sample throughput and should be useful in rank-ordering the predicted oral bioavailability of large collections of compounds at the lead optimization step of drug discovery. These results are useful for selecting compounds for future in vitro/in vivo correlation modeling or in vivo animal testing. This type of approach will improve the decision making process of compound selection in drug discovery.",

Because of the lack of a high-resolution structure, the heptahelical transmembrane bundle within the N-terminal extracellular and C-terminal intracellular region of these receptors has initially been modeled based on the high-resolution structure of bacterial retinal-binding protein, bacteriorhodopsin. However, the low-resolution structure of rhodopsin, a prototypical GPCR, revealed that there is a minor relationship between GPCRs and bacteriorhodopsins. The high-resolution crystal structure of the rhodopsin ground state and further refinements of the model provide the first structural information about the entire organization of the polypeptide chain and post-translational moieties. These studies provide a structural template for Family 1 GPCRs that has the potential to significantly improve structure-based approaches to GPCR drug discovery.",

Systems biology visualization tools can help researchers extract hidden patterns from complex and large Omics data sets, model disease molecular mechanisms, and identify drug targets and drugs with good pharmacological and toxicological profiles. Areas covered in this review: This review covers basic concepts in developing and applying information visualization tools to systems biology. We describe a framework and basic data representation schemes for visual data analysis in systems biology. We review major application areas of these visualization tools within drug discovery by focusing on early-stage drug discovery tasks such as disease biology modeling, target identifications and lead identification. We also show case studies and summarize our experience using visualization tools as lessons to our readers. What the reader will gain: The reader will understand what visualization tools are available for diverse types of systems biology studies in drug discovery and understand how these tools can help advance drug development.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Historically, small-molecule drug discovery projects have largely focused on the G-protein-coupled receptor, ion-channel and enzyme target classes. More recently, there have been successes demonstrating that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) can be targeted by small-molecules and that this strategy has the potential to provide appropriate specificity and selectivity. However, a disadvantage is that compounds that modulate PPIs are often associated with relatively weak affinities as the targeted interaction surfaces are often relatively large. Moreover, from a small-molecule screening perspective, a large proportion of the initial screening Hits are often false positives and these need to be identified and excluded in order to focus on genuine modulators of the PPI being investigated.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: The authors review previous efforts on PPI modulator drug discovery. Furthermore, they review assays that can be employed in small-molecule screening and/or Hit validation. The PPI assays are categorized as: i) low-throughput target-based biochemical assays, which are primarily employed for Hit validation at the post-screening stage; ii) high-throughput target-based biochemical assays that are suitable for screening campaigns; and iii) cell-based assays, which are suitable for high-throughput screening campaigns and/or Hit validation.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Modulating the interaction of PPIs offers the potential to develop novel drugs to treat a wide range of diseases. New assay technologies are continually being developed and it is anticipated that these will be able to be directly used for small-molecule screening campaigns in the future.",

Medical applications of the approach include the following: understanding the threshold effect in the manifestation of metabolic diseases; investigating the gene dose effect of aneuploidy in inducing phenotypic transformation in cancer; correlating the contributions of individual genes and phenotypic characteristics in metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes); identifying candidate enzymes in pathways suitable as targets for cancer therapy; and elucidating the function of \"silent\" genes by identifying metabolic features shared with genes of known pathways. MCA complements current studies of genomics and proteomics, providing a link between biochemistry and functional genomics that relates the expression of genes and gene products to cellular biochemical and physiological events. Thus, it is an important tool for the study of genotype-phenotype correlations. It allows genes to be ranked according to their importance in controlling and regulating cellular metabolic networks. We can expect that MCA will have an increasing impact on the choice of targets for intervention in drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disease broadly includes many different diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's, dementias with Lewy bodies, post-traumatic brain injury, and stroke. Although few common physiopathological changes have been discovered among these conditions, the semiology (if known), the triggered molecular pathways that lead to the observed pathologies, and the symptomatology are essentially different. These differences entail that the treatments, both current and future, have disease-specific indications. This idea led us to believe than it would be quite impossible to comprehensively review the progress made in drug discovery for all the neurodegenerative diseases and, therefore, we focused our attention in this review on the cutting-edge patents that pertain to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Basic science discoveries have identified new targets/leads that have led the scientific community to develop new research initiatives in order to develop novel therapeutics entities and approaches. The purpose of this review is to discuss, through cutting-edge patents, the emergence of potential future treatments of AD. We hope to provide the reader with a broader and better understanding of what could be new therapies for AD during the next decade. (copyright) 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

Multiplexed protein micropatterning has tremendous potential for drug discovery providing versatile means for high throughput assays required for target and lead identification as well as diagnostics and functional screening for personalized medicine. However, ensuring the functional integrity of proteins on surfaces has remained challenging, in particular in the case of membrane proteins, the most important class of drug targets. Yet, generic strategies to control functional organization of proteins into micropatterns are emerging. Areas covered: This review includes an overview introducing the most common approaches for surface modification and functional protein immobilization. The authors present the key photo and soft lithography techniques with respect to compatibility with functional protein micropatterning and multiplexing capabilities. In the second part, the authors present the key applications of protein micropatterning techniques in drug discovery with a focus on membrane protein interactions and cellular signaling. Expert opinion: With the growing importance of target discovery as well as protein-based therapeutics and personalized medicine, the application of protein arrays can play a fundamental role in drug discovery. Yet, important technical breakthroughs are still required for broad application of these approaches, which will include in vitro \"copying\" of proteins from cDNA arrays into micropatterns, direct protein capturing from single cells as well as protein microarrays in living cells.",

Novel therapeutic strategies have included the use of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies that are promising but still have limitations. In several disease models, it has become apparent that MSCs do not necessarily replace diseased tissues but rather exert complex paracrine effects that are mediated by their extracellular-secreted products.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors highlight the data on MSC treatment of SLE and related mechanisms of actions. This data includes the recent evidence that MSC-secreted factors such as extracellular microvesicles (MVs) are important mediators of MSC therapy. Among MVs, the authors delineate the role of exosomes as triggers of regenerative effects in target cells, mediated by transfer of proteins, mRNAs or microRNAs. The authors also outline some of the biological and regulatory restraints encountered by MSC therapy, in contrast to the potential advantages of MSC-derived exosomes as new therapeutic tools in SLE.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: There is concern about reproducible data on the use of MSC therapy in rheumatic diseases and specifically SLE. Although most experts consider MSCs to be safe, there are still worries over donor variability, immune-mediated rejection, culture-induced senescence, loss of functional properties and genetic instability or eventual malignant transformation. MSC-released factors could avoid most limiting factors associated with cell therapy and are therefore expected to provide a new and safe therapeutic option at an affordable cost.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Uterine leiomyoma is the most common benign tumor in women during the reproductive years. Menorrhagia is the common symptom and accounts for the most frequent indication for hysterectomy. Thus, development of a novel drug for non-surgical treatment of uterine leiomyoma is needed for the betterment of women's health. Area covered: This review introduces a translational research initiated by use of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) for contraceptive purposes. During follow-up, a patient informed that heavy menstrual bleeding caused by uterine myoma was strikingly reduced after the insertion of device. The patient's unexpected comment led the authors to perform clinical trials of LNG-IUS for the management of menorrhagia in women with uterine myomas and striking reduction in menorrhagia was obtained by the use of LNG-IUS. MRI examination, however, revealed that the volume of myomas decreased in some, but increased in the other instances. This unexpected finding with MRI directed the authors to characterize the effects of progesterone (P4) and progesterone receptor modulators (PRMs) on uterineleiomyoma cell growth in vitro. Expert opinion: In consistence with the in vitro data obtained, randomized controlled clinical trials of PRMs in patients with uterine leiomyomas at several institutions have demonstrated that oral administration of PRMs (asoprisnil and ulipristal) for 3 months reduced leiomyoma volume, resulting in a significant improvement of the associated symptoms. However, a novel pattern of PRM-associated endometrial changes was recognized in the endometrial pathology, demonstrating unusual epithelial types not seen in the normal menstrual cycle of a premenstrual woman. Thus, follow-up studies to determine whether the novel endometrial changes remain, disappear or progress to something else are needed for the possible long-term use of PRMs for the treatment of uterine leiomyoma.",

Altered lipid metabolism plays a major role in the etiology of CVD. A second common complication observed in RA patients is anemia. Both conditions are serious, reduce quality of life and are undertreated.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: The authors postulate that there is a specific niche for nonhuman primate models of inflammatory arthritis to address these systemic complications that occur in RA. Furthermore, the authors postulate that these nonhuman primate models are a useful platform to unveil the mechanisms underlying dyslipidemia and anemia, which are responsible for the manifestation of these complications.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The presence of currently untreated systemic complications of RA, such as dyslipidemia and anemia, provides interesting opportunities to include these in the preclinical evaluation of new therapies. In the selection of relevant models for the evaluation of new treatments for RA or the identification of new targets for therapy, we postulate that nonhuman primates should be considered as a valid preclinical model. Because of their closer immunological and physiological proximity to humans, these models in nonhuman primates can be valuable for studying disease-related aspects that cannot be addressed in rodent models.",

Elucidation of the effects of fingolimod--mediated by the modulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors--has indicated that its therapeutic activity could be due to regulation of the migration of selected lymphocyte subsets into the central nervous system and direct effects on neural cells, particularly astrocytes. An improved understanding of the biology of S1P receptors has also been gained. This article describes the discovery and development of fingolimod, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 2010 as a first-line treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, thereby becoming the first oral disease-modifying therapy to be approved for multiple sclerosis in the United States.",

        "abstract": "Within the past few years, the high-throughput screening (HTS) of compounds targeting cardiac ion channels has been primarily focused on the testing of the HERG channel, which is involved in the termination of cardiac action potential. Interaction of drugs with this channel may induce QT interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmia. These undesirable side effects have forced several pharmaceutical companies to terminate drug discovery and development projects. The screening of compounds for HERG-mediated activity early in the drug development process may thus help reduce the number of compounds that are withdrawn from late preclinical or early clinical trials due to cardiovascular side effects. However, early screening implies the ability to test large numbers of compounds. Therefore, tests have to be performed rapidly, combining high-throughput and low costs, and allow the use of small amounts of compounds. In this review, the HTS systems currently available to investigate the potential effects of compounds on the activity of the cardiac HERG ion channel will be described and compared.",

The conservation of genome structure and physiology among organisms poses unexpected peculiarities, and the redundancy in certain gene families or the presence of polymorphisms that can slightly alter gene expression can, in certain instances, bring invertebrate systems, such as Drosophila, closer to humans than mice and vice versa. This necessitates the analysis of disease pathways in multiple model organisms.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: The author highlights findings from Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases that have occurred in the past few years. She also highlights and discusses various molecular, genetic and genomic tools used in flies, as well as methods for generating disease models. Finally, the author describes Drosophila models of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's tri-nucleotide repeat diseases, and Fragile X syndrome and summarizes insights in disease mechanisms that have been discovered directly in fly models.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Full genome genetic screens in Drosophila can lead to the rapid identification of drug target candidates that can be subsequently validated in a vertebrate system. In addition, the Drosophila models of neurodegeneration may often show disease phenotypes that are absent in equivalent mouse models. The author believes that the extensive contribution of Drosophila to both new disease drug target discovery, in addition to target validation, makes them indispensible to drug discovery and development.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Reviews of the development of drug discovery through the 20(th) century recognised the importance of chemistry and increasingly bioinformatics, but had relatively little to say about the importance of computing and networked computing in particular. However, the design and discovery of new drugs is arguably the most significant single application of bioinformatics and cheminformatics to have benefitted from the increases in the range and power of the computational techniques since the emergence of the World Wide Web, commonly now referred to as simply 'the Web'. Web services have enabled researchers to access shared resources and to deploy standardized calculations in their search for new drugs. AREAS COVERED: This article first considers the fundamental principles of Web services and workflows, and then explores the facilities and resources that have evolved to meet the specific needs of chem- and bio-informatics. This strategy leads to a more detailed examination of the basic components that characterise molecules and the essential predictive techniques, followed by a discussion of the emerging networked services that transcend the basic provisions, and the growing trend towards embracing modern techniques, in particular the Semantic Web. EXPERT OPINION: In the opinion of the authors, the issues that require community action are: increasing the amount of chemical data available for open access; validating the data as provided; and developing more efficient links between the worlds of cheminformatics and bioinformatics. The goal is to create ever better drug design services.",

Targeting these interactions with small molecule inhibitors is of increased interest both in academia as well as in the pharmaceutical industry, both for therapeutic purposes and in the search for chemical tools for basic science. Although the number of well-characterised examples is still relatively modest, it is becoming apparent that many different kinds of interactions can be inhibited using drug-like small molecules. Compared to active site targeting, PPI inhibition suffers from the particular problem of more exposed and less defined binding sites, and this imposes significant experimental challenges to the development of PPI inhibitors. PPI interfaces are large, up to thousands of square angstroms, and there is still debate as to what part of the interface one should target. We will review recent developments in the field of PPI inhibition, with emphasis on fragment-based methods, and discuss various factors one should take into account when developing small molecule inhibitors targeted at PPI interfaces.",

This reduction has been primarily driven by an increased understanding of the physicochemical properties required in order for a compound to exhibit an appropriate human pharmacokinetic profile. Human pharmacokinetic predictions based on preclinical data are often used to select compounds for further progression. However, the level of prediction accuracy of this approach suggests that the state of the art in human pharmacokinetic prediction will not drive a further reduction in human pharmacokinetic attrition rates. An overall success rate of 60 to 80% of compounds being retrospectively predicted within +/- 2-fold of actual human parameters is insufficient to discriminate closely related analogs within a series. In addition, the post genomic era has led to an explosion in pharmacological targets requiring physicochemistry for interaction with the target that is outside that required for desirable ADME properties. Such targets drive selection decisions into a space where actual human pharmacokinetics are complex and the results from human pharmacokinetic prediction methods are therefore at their most variable. Consequently, the most effective way to operate in these more complicated situations is to devise a rapid and low-cost strategy to complete low-dose human pharmacokinetic studies.",

Although a tremendous amount of basic research has been done on CNTs during the past decade, little of this is nearing translation into human applications. No CNT-based medicine has reached clinical trials. Nevertheless, CNT conjugation with other molecules has extended the horizons for their potential therapeutic applications.

Areas covered: This review summarizes findings related to the 3D structure, conformational mobility, function, antigenicity and immunogenicity of the HIV-1 V3 loop. Particular consideration is given to the V3 loop core sequence Gly-Pro-Gly-Arg/Gln-Ala-Phe, which forms the HIV-1 gp120 immunogenic tip, the role of which has not been completely determined in the virus pathogenesis. New computer-aided approaches for designing potential HIV-1 entry inhibitors are illustrated by a series of examples in which promising basic structures for the V3-based anti-AIDS drug researches have been constructed. Special focus is given to recent studies aimed at defining the structurally conservative V3 sites that may present the HIV-1 weak points most suitable for therapeutic intervention. Finally, the article also discusses how this information can be used to develop novel, potent and broad anti-AIDS agents. Expert opinion: Data on the structure and function of the HIV-1 V3 loop prove convincingly that, in spite of disappointing progress > 20 years, this mysterious site of gp120 (comprising at least three structural motifs recurring in various viral isolates) still remains one of the most attractive targets for the anti-AIDS drug development.",

Despite dramatic advances in imaging technology, surgical techniques, and adjuvant radio- and chemotherapy, the overall prognosis of this disease remains dismal. In light of this, there is an urgent need for the development of more effective therapies that can target residual disseminated tumor burden. Given the heterogeneity of tumors in general, no one strategy is likely to provide a satisfactory treatment regimen. Until the middle of the 20th century, medical treatments were limited to options like drugs, surgery, antibiotics, and radiation, but in the last years stem cells, due to their pathotropism, have become particularly attractive candidates not only to replace damaged tissue in degenerative pathologies, but also to deliver therapeutic molecules in patients with disseminated metastatic cancer. Worldwide there have been over 2000 patent applications involving human and non-human stem cells, of which one quarter refer to embryonic stem cells. Over one third of all stem cell applications and one quarter of all embryonic stem cell applications have been granted. The aim of this review is primarily to focus on the recent development of stem cell patents in cancer treatments.",

        "abstract": "Cancers of the brain are intrinsically more complicated to treat than systemic malignancies due to the unique anatomical features of the brain. The blood-brain barrier prevents chemotherapeutic agents from reaching brain neoplasms, and angiogenesis occurs as the metabolic needs of the tumour increase, thus further complicating treatment. The newly formed blood vessels form the blood-tumour barrier and are distinct from the blood-brain barrier in that they are more permeable. Being more permeable, these abnormal blood vessels lead to the formation of peri-tumoural edema, which is the cause of much morbidity and mortality associated with central nervous system neoplasms. While the cause of the increased permeability is unclear, kinins have been implicated in regulating the permeability of normal vasculature. Kinins are also known to exert many inflammatory actions affecting both normal and angiogenic blood vessels, as well as tumour cells. The vasodilatory and vascular permeabilizing effects of kinins, and particularly bradykinin and substance P, have been investigated with regard to delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to neoplastic brain tissue through both vascular barriers. In contrast, kinin receptor antagonists have been found to exert effects on tumour cells that result in decreased angiogenesis, tumour cell motility and growth. Thus, many recent patents describe kinin activity on brain vasculature, which may play an integral role in the development of treatments for malignancies in the central nervous system through amelioration of angiogenesis. In conjunction, patents that discuss the ability of kinins to decrease tumour cell migration and proliferation demonstrate that kinins may offer novel approaches to brain tumour therapy in the future.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, one of the major advances in terms of our understanding of the pathology underlying many neurological conditions has been the realisation that inflammation may play a major role in many acute and chronic conditions. Inflammation is not only involved in acute CNS conditions, such as stroke and traumatic injury, but it is also a central factor in chronic and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. There are some key differences between inflammatory processes within the CNS (neuroinflammation) and peripheral inflammation, partly due to the natural compartmentation of the brain by the blood-brain barrier. As a result of these differences, the classical anti-inflammatory agents (steroids and NSAIDs) have not played a major role in the management of CNS inflammatory conditions. In order to address this clinical need, there is significant interest in developing novel anti-inflammatory agents that may help prevent or ameliorate CNS inflammation. In this review, the authors focus on disclosures from the patent literature to give a broad overview of the different approaches that are being taken to try and develop more effective and selective anti-inflammatory agents to manage acute and chronic inflammation in the CNS. A variety of approaches are discussed including modulating the activity of various inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines and kinins, targeting toll-like receptors as a possible therapeutic intervention, and novel approaches to managing the actions of eicosanoids in neuroinflammation.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Much has been presented and debated on the topic of drug abuse and its multidimensional nature, including the role of society and its customs and laws, economical factors, and the magnitude and nature of the burden. Given the complex nature of the receptors and pathways implicated in regulation of the cognitive and behavioral processes associated with addiction, a large number of molecular targets have been interrogated during recent years to discover starting points for development of small-molecule interventions. AREAS COVERED: This review describes recent developments in the field of early drug discovery for drug abuse interventions with an emphasis on the advances published during the 2012 - 2014 period. EXPERT OPINION: Technologically, the processes/platforms utilized in drug abuse drug discovery are nearly identical to those used in the other disease areas. A key complicating factor in drug abuse research is the enormous biological complexity surrounding the brain processes involved and the associated difficulty in finding 'good' targets and achieving exquisite selectivity of treatment agents. While tremendous progress has been made during recent years to use the power of high-throughput technologies to discover proof-of-principle molecules for many new targets, next-generation models will be especially important in this field. Examples include: seeking advantageous drug-drug combinations, the use of automated whole-animal behavioral screening systems, advancing our understanding of the role of epigenetics in drug addiction and the employment of organoid-level 3D test platforms (also referred to as tissue-chip or organs-on-chip).",

By analysing the physicochemical properties of a large database of hits and corresponding leads identified in the past decade, we show that this undesirable phenomenon can be traced back to the nature of high-throughput screening hits and hit-to-lead optimization practices. Conceptual and organizational adjustments may be required to enable a smooth lead-evolution process that reduces the chance of high compound-related attrition in clinical trials.",

Natural products continue to be of great utility as biological tools as well as therapeutic agents in this context, and the diversity of natural structures continues to impress and inspire medicinal chemistry. New therapies in oncology are increasingly moving away from pure cytotoxic or cytostatic agents to enzyme inhibitors targeting signaling pathways, and agents that are preferentially absorbed by cancer cells or influence vascularization and tissue adhesion or penetration. Interestingly, natural products continue to be of great utility as biological tools as well as therapeutic agents in this context, and, as this chapter demonstrates, the diversity of natural structures continues to impress and inspire medicinal chemistry. In many cases, synthetic modifications of natural products are necessary to gain insight into structure\u2013 activity relationships, and to improve on physico-chemical features as well as biological effects. While these adjustments require dedication and talent, they are at least as likely to lead to new drugs as high-throughput screens of small-molecule libraries and traditional medicinal chemistry optimizations of unnatural lead compounds.",

        "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by a parasite Schistosoma mansoni and affects over 200 million annually. There is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic options to control the disease with the recent emergence of drug resistance. The multifunctional protein, thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR), an essential enzyme for the survival of the pathogen in the redox environment has been actively explored as a potential drug target. The recent availability of small-molecule screening datasets against this target provides a unique opportunity to learn molecular properties and apply computational models for discovery of activities in large molecular libraries. Such a prioritisation approach could have the potential to reduce the cost of failures in lead discovery. A supervised learning approach was employed to develop a cost sensitive classification model to evaluate the biological activity of the molecules. Random forest was identified to be the best classifier among all the classifiers with an accuracy of around 80 percent. Independent analysis using a maximally occurring substructure analysis revealed 10 highly enriched scaffolds in the actives dataset and their docking against was also performed. We show that a combined approach of machine learning and other cheminformatics approaches such as substructure comparison and molecular docking is efficient to prioritise molecules from large molecular datasets.",

With high specificity and affinity, oligonucleotide therapeutic agents are being developed as novel treatments for various diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and infectious diseases. These drugs can be used alone or in combination with current treatment strategies including chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mice provide us with an excellent preclinical model of human prostate cancer. They have expanded our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in prostate carcinogenesis as well as allowing us to explore both novel and traditional treatment regimes based on the molecular profile of these lesions. Continuing refinement of the transgenic prostate models has proven challenging since no one model seems to represent the entire continuum of the disease, thus currently limiting its applicability to the human condition. This platform may potentially have major impact in validation of drug targeting specific biological process of prostate carcinogenesis, supplementing (or even replacing) many of the current in vitro and in vivo assays with the in vivo environment that transgenic prostate models provide.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE/METHOD: This review focuses primarily on the current state of murine model systems as a preclinical therapeutic platform for the treatment of prostate cancer, as well as hope for the future of the field.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Much of the work in the drug discovery field has been done with the PTEN(-/-) and TRAMP models of prostate cancer. Despite their limitations they have contributed much to our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. There is, however, a need for transgenic models that better reflect the stepwise progression found in the human condition. We feel that they will prove to be invaluable as a preclinical platform regarding efficacy and tolerability of various anticancer agents, which ultimately allows us to translate these findings to the clinical setting to prognosticate and ultimately render cancer patients disease-free.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of drug-resistant pathogens such as staphylococci and enterococci in the hospital setting has long being recognized as a serious clinical problem. Staphylococcus aureus is the causative agent of many nosocomial infections from minor skin abscesses to serious, potentially life threatening diseases such as bone and soft tissue intra-surgical infections, sepsis and invasive endocarditis, while enterococci are responsible for nosocomial bacteraemia, surgical wound infections and endocarditis. The most infamous drug-resistant forms of these include MRSA (methicillin resistant S. aureus), VISA (vancomycin insensitive S. aureus), hVISA (heterogenous vancomycin insensitive S. aureus) and VRE (vancomycin resistant S. aureus). While enhanced hygiene awareness is essential to any solution, the identification of effective novel antimicrobial compounds remains a major goal in eradicating these and other infections caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens. In recent years a class of antimicrobial peptides, the Lantibiotics, have been the focus of an ever increasing level of attention. This interest has been prompted by an enhanced appreciation of the mode of action of these peptides (including, in many cases, the ability to bind lipid II) and their frequently high levels of antimicrobial activity. Here we review lantibiotic-related issues in drug discovery, outline the strategies that have been employed to identify these peptides and summarize the use of bioengineering to generate enhanced forms of these peptides as well as the application of the associated biological machinery to generate novel forms of existing pharmaceutical compounds. In so doing we highlight how some, or all, of these approaches have the potential to result in the development of clinically important drugs.",

Chloride-channel modulators have potential applications in the treatment of some of these disorders, as well as in secretory diarrhoeas, polycystic kidney disease, osteoporosis and hypertension.

At present no vaccine or antiviral drugs are available to treat a dengue infection, which leaves supportive care in hospitals as the only available treatment option. Since dengue epidemics often put great strain on healthcare systems, there is an urgent need for novel strategies to combat this disease. The development of vaccines for dengue is complicated by the presence of four different serotypes, which has increased the importance of antiviral drug discovery. In the past 10 years, dengue has changed from a disease that was basically unknown to drug discovery scientists into a vibrant field of research for both biologists and chemists. In this chapter, we will review the different drug targets that have been identified for dengue and critically assess the progress that has been made in antiviral drug discovery. While these efforts have not yet resulted in a clinical development candidate, the progress has been impressive, considering the limited resources.

What was possible by simple inspection in the past, nowadays cannot be effectively achieved without the aid of informatics techniques.

Advances in the field of substructure analysis have expanded the applicability of substructural analysis in multiple fronts in early lead discovery and optimization. It can be applied beyond the management of information, including compound library design and virtual screening to structure activity relationships. The relationships between chemical substructures and drug-like properties also aid in developing more robust rationales for fragment-based approaches for lead discovery, predictive toxicology, and elucidation of pharmacokinetic properties.A review of recent developments in substructure analysis in a broad range of areas in drug discovery is presented. The focus is on the application of substructural analysis in computational chemistry for drug design and the methods used to identify substructures in a chemical database, as well as their relation to fragment-based drug discovery.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dyslipidemia is increased fasting level of total cholesterol (TC),  LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), along with decreased levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). Owing to effect on the cardiovascular system and increased chances of metabolic diseases, it is needed to review novel under development drugs and new approaches in drug discovery for dyslipidemia. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews all phases I to IV clinical trials and preclinical trials with results associated with novel treatment of dyslipidemia. Drug discovery for dyslipidemia, toward newer targets has been addressed. FINDINGS: Statins are, currently available, best choice of drugs for treating dyslipidemia and coronary diseases. In addition to this, lipid lowering drugs support treatment to a great extent, either as monotherapy or in combinations with other groups. Pravastatin used in combination with cholesteryl ester, transfers protein inhibitors (CETP) to produce efficient results. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists (PPAR) like muraglitazar, aleglitazar and tesaglitazar are PPAR alpha/gamma receptor agonist, dual in action performs better in phase 3 clinical study and reduces renal and cardiovascular events. By targeting both receptors, a better treatment for cardiovascular and diabetic problems can be achieved. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors like humanized monoclonal antibodies, are newly discovered inhibitors that reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. During the past few years, nucleic acid-based therapies targeting lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, such as microsomal TG transfer protein (MTP) may be a promising therapeutic approach to treat vascular diseases. Gene regulating transcription factors involved in bile acids and cholesterol metabolism can be controlled by FXR agonists in dyslipidemia. To overcome these drawbacks, many thyroid hormone analogues have been developed to lower down cholesterol level by targeting specifically thyroid hormone beta receptors abundantly present in the liver without severe side effects. Virtual screening, an important tool in screening databases of the lead compounds, provides a good platform to access new compounds. In this review, examples of novel FXR modulators, thyromimetic agents, cholesterol absorption inhibitors and other new anti hyperlipidemia scaffolds have been addressed.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small endogenously transcribed regulatory RNA which modulates gene expression at a post transcriptional level. These small RNAs have now been shown to be critical regulators in a number of biological processes in the cell including pathophysiology of diseases like cancers. The increasingly evident roles of microRNA in disease processes have also motivated attempts to target them therapeutically. Recently there has been immense interest in understanding small molecule mediated regulation of RNA, including microRNA. RESULTS: We have used publicly available datasets of high throughput screens on small molecules with potential to inhibit microRNA. We employed computational methods based on chemical descriptors and machine learning to create predictive computational models for biological activity of small molecules. We further used a substructure based approach to understand common substructures potentially contributing to the activity. CONCLUSION: We generated computational models based on Naive Bayes and Random Forest towards mining small RNA binding molecules from large molecular datasets. We complement this with substructure based approach to identify and understand potentially enriched substructures in the active dataset. We use this approach to identify miRNA binding potential of a set of approved drugs, suggesting a probable novel mechanism of off-target activity of these drugs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and most comprehensive computational analysis towards understanding RNA binding activities of small molecules and predictive modeling of these activities.",

This review outlines recent methodical advances in homology modelling, with a focus on those techniques that necessitate consideration of ligand binding. In this context, model quality estimation deserves special attention because the accuracy and reliability of different structure prediction techniques vary considerably, and the quality of a model ultimately determines its usefulness for structure-based drug discovery.

Most antibiotics were originally isolated by screening soil-derived actinomycetes during the golden era of antibiotic discovery in the 1940s to 1960s. However, diminishing returns from this discovery platform led to its collapse, and efforts to create a new platform based on target-focused screening of large libraries of synthetic compounds failed, in part owing to the lack of penetration of such compounds through the bacterial envelope. This article considers strategies to re-establish viable platforms for antibiotic discovery. These include investigating untapped natural product sources such as uncultured bacteria, establishing rules of compound penetration to enable the development of synthetic antibiotics, developing species-specific antibiotics and identifying prodrugs that have the potential to eradicate dormant persisters, which are often responsible for hard-to-treat infections.",

In addition, of 33 drugs identified in the absence of a target hypothesis, 25 were found through a chemocentric approach in which compounds with known pharmacology served as the starting point, with only eight coming from what we define here as phenotypic screening: testing a large number of compounds in a target-agnostic assay that monitors phenotypic changes. We also discuss the implications for drug discovery strategies, including viewing phenotypic screening as a novel discipline rather than as a neoclassical approach.",

Here, we summarize the technologies that are currently in use for phenotypic profiling--including mRNA-, protein- and imaging-based multi-parameter profiling--in the drug discovery context. We think that an earlier integration of phenotypic profiling technologies, combined with effective experimental and in silico target identification approaches, can improve success rates of lead selection and optimization in the drug discovery process.",

The first section is a general overview of what we understand by pharmacokinetics and the different LADMET aspects: Liberation, Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity. The second section highlights the different computational or in silico approaches to estimate/predict one or several aspects of the pharmacokinetic profile of a discovery lead compound. The third section discusses the most commonly used in vitro methodologies. The fourth and last section examines the various approaches employed towards the pharmacokinetic assessment of discovery molecules; including all the LADME processes, discussing the different mathematical methodologies available to establish the PK profile of a test compound; what the main differences are and what should be the criteria for using one or another mathematical approach. The major conclusion of this review is that the use of the appropriate preclinical assays has a key role in the long-term viability of a pharmaceutical company since applying the right tools early in discovery will play a key role in determining the company's ability to discover novel safe and effective therapeutics to patients as quickly as possible. \u00a9 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.",

        "abstract": "Preclinical Research Cellular proteins are the mediators of multiple organism functions being involved in physiological mechanisms and disease. By discovering lead compounds that affect the function of target proteins, the target diseases or physiological mechanisms can be modulated. Based on knowledge of the ligand-receptor interaction, the chemical structures of leads can be modified to improve efficacy, selectivity and reduce side effects. One rational drug design technology, which enables drug discovery based on knowledge of target structures, functional properties and mechanisms, is computer-aided drug design (CADD). The application of CADD can be cost-effective using experiments to compare predicted and actual drug activity, the results from which can used iteratively to improve compound properties. The two major CADD-based approaches are structure-based drug design, where protein structures are required, and ligand-based drug design, where ligand and ligand activities can be used to design compounds interacting with the protein structure. Approaches in structure-based drug design include docking, de novo design, fragment-based drug discovery and structure-based pharmacophore modeling. Approaches in ligand-based drug design include quantitative structure-affinity relationship and pharmacophore modeling based on ligand properties. Based on whether the structure of the receptor and its interaction with the ligand are known, different design strategies can be seed. After lead compounds are generated, the rule of five can be used to assess whether these have drug-like properties. Several quality validation methods, such as cost function analysis, Fisher's cross-validation analysis and goodness of hit test, can be used to estimate the metrics of different drug design strategies. To further improve CADD performance, multi-computers and graphics processing units may be applied to reduce costs. 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Chemogenomics is a new strategy in drug discovery which, in principle, searches for all molecules that are capable of interacting with any biological target. Because of the almost infinite number of drug-like organic molecules, this is an impossible task. Therefore chemogenomics has been defined as the investigation of classes of compounds (libraries) against families of functionally related proteins. In this definition, chemogenomics deals with the systematic analysis of chemical-biological interactions. Congeneric series of chemical analogs are probes to investigate their action on specific target classes, e.g., GPCRs, kinases, phosphodiesterases, ion channels, serine proteases, and others. Whereas such a strategy developed in pharmaceutical industry almost 20 years ago, it is now more systematically applied in the search for target- and subtype-specific ligands. The term \"privileged structures\" has been defined for scaffolds, such as the benzodiazepines, which very often produce biologically active analogs in a target family, in this case in the class of G-protein-coupled receptors. The SOSA approach is a strategy to modify the selectivity of biologically active compounds, generating new drug candidates from the side activities of therapeutically used drugs.",

New techniques in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) promise to be part of a sequence that could transform drug development for disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) by examining brain systems and their functional activation dynamically. The brain is complex and multiple transmitters and intersecting brain circuits are implicated in many CNS disorders. CNS therapeutics are designed against specific CNS targets, many of which are unprecedented. The challenge is to reveal the functional consequences of these interactions to assess therapeutic potential. fMRI can help optimize CNS drug discovery by providing a key metric that can increase confidence in early decision-making, thereby improving success rates and reducing risk, development times and costs of drug development.",

Here, we present an assessment of the current approaches used for the evaluation of chemically reactive metabolites. We also describe how these approaches are being used within the pharmaceutical industry to assess and minimize the potential of drug candidates to cause toxicity. At early stages of drug discovery, iteration between medicinal chemistry and drug metabolism can eliminate perceived reactive metabolite-mediated chemical liabilities without compromising pharmacological activity or the need for extensive safety evaluation beyond standard practices. In the future, reactive metabolite evaluation may also be useful during clinical development for improving clinical risk assessment and risk management. Currently, there remains a huge gap in our understanding of the basic mechanisms that underlie chemical stress-mediated adverse reactions in humans.

Fragment-based drug discovery is an alternative approach to the conventional strategy and has proven its efficiency on several enzyme targets. Based on developments in biophysical screening techniques, receptor stabilization and in vitro assays, virtual and experimental fragment screening and fragment-based lead discovery recently became applicable for GPCR targets.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This article provides a review of the biophysical as well as biological detection techniques suitable to study GPCRs together with their applications to screen fragment libraries and identify fragment-size ligands of cell surface receptors. The article presents several recent examples including both virtual and experimental protocols for fragment hit discovery and early hit to lead progress.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: With the recent progress in biophysical detection techniques, the advantages of fragment-based drug discovery could be exploited for GPCR targets. Structural information on GPCRs will be more abundantly available for early stages of drug discovery projects, providing information on the binding process and efficiently supporting the progression of fragment hit to lead. In silico approaches in combination with biological assays can be used to address structurally challenging GPCRs and confirm biological relevance of interaction early in the drug discovery project.",

RGS proteins contain a conserved RGS-box, which is often accompanied by other signalling regulatory elements. RGS proteins accelerate the deactivation of G proteins to reduce GPCR signalling; however, some also have an effector function and transmit signals. Combining GPCR agonists with RGS inhibitors should potentiate responses, and could markedly increase the agonist's regional specificity. The diversity of RGS proteins with highly localized and dynamically regulated distributions in brain makes them attractive targets for pharmacotherapy of central nervous system disorders.",

Computational techniques, when used in combination with traditional drug discovery methodology, greatly increase the chance of drug discovery in a sustainable and economical fashion.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review aims to provide the most recent and important advances of in silico IBD drug discovery. While this review is mainly focused on QSAR methods, especially those based on molecular topology (MT), additional topics, such as docking or comparative field analysis are also addressed.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: IBD is a worldwide growing health concern that can only be currently treated in symptomatic and palliative way; thus, the search for new drugs is imperative. Computer-aided methods, which focus on the drug-receptor interaction, are essential tool in this regard. It is noted, however that a major problem is that although there are many known receptors associated with IBD, none of these have yet been found essential. The use of other approaches, including QSAR methodology, is certainly a complementary and attractive alternative; especially QSAR methods based on MT, which has proven successful in other drug discovery.",

However, even with vast improvements in automation, classic antibody generation and analysis systems are severely limited in the number of molecules that can be interrogated during a typical discovery campaign. When one considers more complex target systems, along with the desire to isolate antibodies with very unique characteristics, the chances are very low that these systems will be successful. Next generation sequencing technologies (also referred to as \"deep sequencing\") allow for the analysis of single molecules in millions in a very short period of time. By applying these deep sequencing technologies to antibody discovery, we now have the ability to look for very specific molecules with very unique properties and activities, further our understanding of species and strain specific repertoires, and can now begin to use sequence information to identify function. The application of these technologies is opening the door to the discovery of next generation antibody therapeutics.",

The X-ray structure of FBPase complexed with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-monophosphate (ZMP) provided structural information used for subsequent analogue design and free energy calculations. The FEP protocol was validated by calculating the free energy differences for the mutation of ZMP (1) to AMP (2). The calculated results showed a net gain of 1.7 kcal/mol, which agreed with the experimental result of 1.3 kcal/mol. FEP calculations were performed for 18 other AMP analogues. Inhibition constants were determined for over half of these analogues, usually after completion of the calculation, and were consistent with the predictions. Solvation free energy differences between AMP and various AMP analogues proved to be an important factor in binding free energies, suggesting that increased desolvation costs associated with the addition of polar groups to an inhibitor must be overcome by stronger ligand-protein interactions if the structural modification is to enhance inhibitor potency. The results indicate that FEP calculations predict relative binding affinities with high accuracy and provide valuable insight into the factors that influence inhibitor binding and therefore should greatly aid efforts to optimize initial lead compounds and reduce the time required for the discovery of new drug candidates.",

Although fundamental to the initiation and progression of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis and malaria, in many cases their precise role remains unknown. Activity-based chemical proteomics-an emerging field involving a combination of organic synthesis, biochemistry, cell biology, biophysics and bioinformatics-allows the detection, visualisation and activity quantification of whole families or selected sub-sets of proteases based upon their substrate specificity. This approach can be applied for drug target/lead identification and validation, the fundamentals of drug discovery. The activity-based probes discussed in this review contain three key features; a 'warhead' (binds irreversibly but selectively to the active site), a 'tag' (allowing enzyme 'handling', with a combination of fluorescent, affinity and/or radio labels), and a linker region between warhead and tag. From the design and synthesis of the linker arise some of the latest developments discussed here; not only can the physical properties (e.g., solubility, localisation) of the probe be tuned, but the inclusion of a cleavable moiety allows selective removal of tagged enzyme from affinity beads etc. The design and synthesis of recently reported probes is discussed, including modular assembly of highly versatile probes via solid phase synthesis. Recent applications of activity-based protein profiling to specific proteases (serine, threonine, cysteine and metalloproteases) are reviewed as are demonstrations of their use in the study of disease function in cancer and malaria.",

They also describe structure- and computational-based drug discovery strategies and reflect on the differences between these two approaches.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Looking to the future, success in drug discovery is likely to depend on the intelligent deployment of multiple hit identification techniques, appropriate to the drug target, to identify and optimise novel drug leads. The authors' opinion is that there is no clear winner, but that each platform has its own particular strengths and different targets may be more amenable to one platform over another.

In this work, we provide an overview of selected advances in computational algorithms for the rational selection of molecule libraries for the synthesis, with emphasis on structure-based approaches.

        "abstract": "Efforts to develop an effective malarial vaccine are yet to be successful and thus chemotherapy remains the mainstay of malaria control strategy. Unfortunately, Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes about 90% of all global malaria cases is increasingly becoming resistant to classical antimalarials, necessitating a search for new chemotherapeutics preferably with novel modes of action. Today, rational drug discovery strategy is gaining new impetus as knowledge of malaria parasite biology expands, aided by the parasite genome database and improved bioinformatics tools. Drug development is a laborious, time consuming and costly process, and thus the \"useful therapeutic lives\" (UTLs) of new drugs should be commensurate with the resources invested in their development. Historical evidence on development and evolution of resistance to classical antimalarial drugs shows that the mode of action of a drug influences its UTL. Drugs that target single and specific targets such as antimalarial antifolates and atovaquone (ATQ) are rendered ineffective within a short time of their clinical use, unlike drugs with pleiotropic action such as chloroquine (CQ) and artemisinins (ART) with long UTLs. Unfortunately, almost all new targets currently being explored for development of novel drugs belong to the \"specific target\" other than the \"multiple target\" category, and is plausible that such drugs will have short UTLs. This review relates the pleiotropic action of CQ and ART with their long UTLs, and discusses their relevance in rational drug development strategies. Novel targets with potential to yield drugs with long UTLs are also explored.",

Published evidence based medicine (EBM) surveys, which generally conclude the opposite, are seriously flawed and do a disservice to the field of drug discovery.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This article presents MRS and how it has guided several hundreds of practical human 'drug discovery' endeavors since its development. Specifically, the author looks at the process of 'reverse-translation' and its influence in the expansion of the number of preclinical drug discoveries from in vivo MRS. The author also provides a structured approach of eight criteria, including EBM acceptance, which could potentially re-open the field of MRS for productive exploration of existing and repurposed drugs and cost-effective drug-discovery.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: MRS-guided drug discovery is poised for future expansion. The cost of clinical trials has escalated and the use of biomarkers has become increasingly useful in improving patient selection for drug trials. Clinical MRS has uncovered a treasure-trove of novel biomarkers and clinical MRS itself has become better standardized and more widely available on 'routine' clinical MRI scanners. When combined with available new MRI sequences, MRS can provide a 'one stop shop' with multiple potential outcome measures for the disease and the drug in question.",

Appropriately genetically-engineered mice act as robust engines for the generation of diverse repertoires of affinity- matured fully human variable regions with intrinsic properties necessary for successful antibody drug development including high potency, specificity, manufacturability, solubility and low risk of immunogenicity. A broad range of mAb drug targets are addressable in these mice, comprising both secreted and transmembrane targets, including membrane multi-spanning targets, as well as human target antigens that share high sequence identity with their mouse orthologue. Transgenic mice can routinely yield antibodies with sub-nanomolar binding affinity for their antigen, with lead candidate mAbs frequently possessing affinities for binding to their target of less than 100 picomolar, without requiring any ex vivo affinity optimization. While the originator transgenic mice platforms are no longer broadly available, a new generation of transgenic platforms is in development for discovery of the next wave of human therapeutic antibodies.",

        "abstract": "Importance of the field: As an integral part of lead generation and optimization, scaffold discovery has broad implications in drug discovery. Currently available chemical scaffolds might be inadequate to provide drug-like ligands for new targets such as phosphatases and protein-protein interactions and therapeutically useful chemical space needs to be continuously explored. New scaffolds are often desired to overcome major hurdles (e.g., potency plateau, selectivity, pharmacokinetics, etc.) in lead generation and optimization. Timely discovery of proof-of-concept compounds facilitates target validation, diversifies clinical candidates and improves the overall success rate of drug discovery. Areas covered in this review: This analysis discusses the strategies involved in finding new scaffolds (i.e., fragment-, ligand- and structure-based design) and their applications (e.g., improve potency/selectivity, multiple ligand design, protein-protein interactions, etc.) in drug discovery. What the reader will gain: The readers will learn the strategies involved in scaffold design and the problems that they solve. They will also gain the understanding of the circumstances suitable for using scaffold design. Take home message: Scaffold is defined by the authors as a biological target dependent concept. Therapeutically useful scaffolds are limited and the identification of new scaffolds is sometimes required to overcome major optimization hurdles. However, depending on the promiscuity of the binding pocket of the target and the validity of the optimization protocol, finding better scaffolds can be a challenging task. Several strategies in scaffold discovery have emerged or matured owing to recent trends such as pursuit of targets from new proteomic families, lack of validated targets, advances in synthesis and biological assays and adoption of in vitro activity-driven screening paradigms.",

        "abstract": "While the installation and removal of epigenetic post-translational modifications or 'marks' on both DNA and histone proteins are the tangible outcome of enzymatically catalyzed processes, the role of the epigenetic reader proteins looks, at first, less obvious. As they do not catalyze a chemical transformation or process as such, their role is not enzymatic. However, this does not preclude them from being potential targets for drug discovery as their function is clearly correlated to transcriptional activity and as a class of proteins, they appear to have binding sites of sufficient definition and size to be inhibited by small molecules. This suggests that this third class of epigenetic proteins that are involved in the interpretation of post-translational marks (as opposed to the creation or deletion of marks) may represent attractive targets for drug discovery efforts. This review mainly summarizes selected publications, patent literature and company disclosures on these non-enzymatic epigenetic reader proteins from 2009 to the present. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Using this antibody, a competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) was developed to detect \u03949-THCA in the range of 1 to 100 mg/ml. Various cannabinoids including \u03949-THC (\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid), \u03948-THCA (\u03948-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid), \u03948-THC (\u03948-tetrahydrocannabinol), CBD (cannabidiol), and CBN (cannabinol) were recognized by MAb-4A4, and their cross-reactivities were 55-1600% compared with \u03949-THCA (100%). This novel characteristic of this MAb enabled detection of marijuana residues in biological samples by detection of residual cannabinoids. The ELISA using MAb-4A4 was found to be applicable even for withered samples which contained only trace amounts of \u03949-THCA and \u03949-THC. In addition, this method using MAb-4A4 could be useful in forensic analysis since the MAb-4A4 also shows cross-reactivities against cannabinoid metabolites in body fluids. As well as forensic applications using this MAb, an investigation of new drug candidates focusing on cannabinoid metabolites arising from biotransformation in plant tissue was performed using immunochemical screening. The resulting new drug candidates were cannabinoid glycosides biotransformed by Pinellia ternata whose bioactivity is as yet unidentified. Our results indicate the utility of the application of ELISA using MAb-4A4 for further experiments involving marijuana and cannabinoids not only in the forensic field but also in the context of drug discovery.",

Here we review the informatics approaches required to build a complete catalogue of known drug targets. Objective: Using Pfizer's internal target database as a narrative, we review the steps involved in the construction of an integrated, enterprise target-informatics system. We consider how compiling the drug target universe requires integration across several resources such as competitor intelligence and pharmacological activity databases, as well as input from techniques such as text-mining. In particular, we address data standards and the complexities of representing targets in a structured ontology as well as opportunities for future development. Conclusion: Drug target-orientated databases address important areas of drug discovery such as chemogenomics, drug/candidate repurposing and business intelligence. As research in industry and academia drives continued expansion of the druggable genome, it is crucial that such systems be maintained to provide an accurate picture of the landscape.

At present, a number of studies have showed the effect of nutrition on gene expression in health and disease. For instance, weight loss and as importantly weight keeping has been demonstrated to be efficiently achieved in obesity treatment through personalized diet planning. Likewise, intensive dietary interventions have showed a significant effect on the expression pattern on cancer-related genes in prostate cancer patients.

        "abstract": "Importance of the field: Despite the advances in the understanding of biological processes, significant challenges still face those engaged in small molecule drug discovery. To complicate matters further, researchers are often overwhelmed with a range of off-the-shelf as well as bespoke assay formats to choose from when initiating a drug discovery programme. Although fluorescence intensity based assays have traditionally been adopted in drug discovery programmes for a wide range of target classes, it is essential to fully validate the chosen readouts to confirm that they accurately reflect the underlying biological mechanism under investigation. Areas covered in this review: This review exemplifies the challenges that are often encountered with fluorescence intensity based assays and particular attention is paid to compound interference, the protease, deacetylating enzyme and kinase enzyme target classes. What the reader will gain: Designing a critical path in early stage drug discovery, which combines several diverse and minimally overlapping readout modes, will maximise the chance that compound activities will translate between the primary assay (utilised in the initial screening campaign) and secondary assay (utilised to evaluate the confirmed hits identified in the primary assay, usually a cell based assay) formats in a meaningful way. However, this is not always the case as is amply demonstrated across both academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Paying insufficient attention to these points can lead to the early termination of drug discovery programmes, not for want of resources or confidence in the rationale underlying the target, but instead because decision making has been driven by assay data originating from a different biological mechanism than the one under investigation. Take home message: Although fluorescence intensity based assays are likely to remain popular for many target classes in drug discovery, in particular in small molecule screening campaigns, it is essential that at the outset they are sufficiently well validated so that compounds are likely to exhibit profiles that are confirmed in subsequent assays.",

This review examines the clinical signatures of this problem, signals predictive of its occurrence (particularly of more frequent, reversible, low-grade injury) and the role of monitoring in prevention by examining several recent examples (for example, troglitazone). In addition, the failure of preclinical toxicology to predict idiosyncratic reactions, and what can be done to improve this problem, is discussed. Finally, our current understanding of the pathophysiology of experimental drug hepatotoxicity is examined, focusing on acetaminophen, particularly with respect to the role of the innate immune system and control of cell-death pathways, which might provide targets for exploration and identification of risk factors and mechanisms in humans.",

All available antidepressants act through monoaminergic mechanisms, so there is considerable interest in novel non-monoaminergic approaches for potentially improved treatment. One such strategy involves targeting melatonergic receptors, as melatonin has a key role in synchronizing circadian rhythms, which are known to be perturbed in depressed states. This article describes the discovery and development of agomelatine, which possesses both melatonergic agonist and complementary 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C (5-HT2C) antagonist properties. Following comprehensive pharmacological evaluation and extensive clinical trials, agomelatine (Valdoxan/Thymanax; Servier) was granted marketing authorization in 2009 for the treatment of major depression in Europe, thereby becoming the first approved antidepressant to incorporate a non-monoaminergic mechanism of action.",

Genetic factors may underlie susceptibility to SADRs and the identification of predisposing genotypes may improve patient management through the prospective selection of appropriate candidates. Here we discuss three specific SADRs with an emphasis on genetic risk factors.

        "abstract": "Human therapeutic antibody discovery has utilized a variety of systems, from in vivo immunization of human immunoglobulin-expressing mice, to in vitro display of antibody libraries. Of the in vitro antibody display technologies, mammalian cell display provides a number of advantages with the ability to co-select immunoglobulin molecules for high expression level in mammalian cells, native folding, and biophysical properties appropriate for drug development. Mammalian cell display has been achieved using either transient or stable expression systems, using a number of alternate transmembrane domains to present antibody on the cell surface. The unique capability of mammalian cells to present IgG in its fully post-translationally modified format also allows selection of antibodies for functional properties. One limitation of mammalian cell based systems, however, has been the smaller library size that can be presented compared to phage display approaches. Until recently, this has necessitated the use of libraries biased toward a particular antigen, such as libraries derived from immunized donors, to achieve success. An alternative approach has now been developed which recapitulates key aspects of the in vivo immune system through reproducing somatic hypermutation (SHM) in vitro. Libraries representing a na\u00efve human B lymphocyte antibody repertoire are created by PCR amplification of the rearranged (D)J segments of heavy and light chain variable regions from human donors and incorporating the resulting sequence diversity into panels of human germline VH and VL genes. The resulting antibodies are presented as full length IgG on the surface of HEK293 cells. After isolation of antibodies binding to individual target antigens, subsequent affinity maturation using in vitro SHM is induced by expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Selection of antibodies from na\u00efve fully human libraries using mammalian cell display coupled with in vitro SHM is an efficient methodology for the generation of high affinity human antibodies with excellent properties for drug development.",

Current mass spectrometry methodologies allow the detection and quantification of multiple molecular lipid species with various structural and functional roles. The opportunities provided by lipidomics for lipid-based biomarker discovery are prominent in disease diagnostics, monitoring of drug efficacy, and translational model development. For example, the analysis of human plasma samples assessing the effects of statins has shown correlative effects between the LDL/HDL ratio and sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine. Additionally, at the vascular tissue level, lipids from different classes are enriched in human plaques of coronary arteries and in the aortas of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice exposed to cigarette smoke, highlighting a set of lipid biomarkers for translational research.

In this article, we provide the recommendations of the International Transporter Consortium on these issues, and present decision trees that are intended to help guide clinical studies on the currently recognized most important drug transporter interactions. The recommendations are generally intended to support clinical development and filing of a new drug application. Overall, it is advised that the timing of transporter investigations should be driven by efficacy, safety and clinical trial enrolment questions (for example, exclusion and inclusion criteria), as well as a need for further understanding of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties of the drug molecule, and information required for drug labelling.",

In recent years, extensive analyses of successful and failed discovery compounds and drug candidates have improved our understanding of the role of physicochemical properties in drug attrition. Based on the clarified challenges in finding the 'sweet spot' in medicinal chemistry programmes, we suggest that this goal can be achieved through a combination of first identifying chemical starting points with appropriate 'nature' and then rigorously 'nurturing' them during lead optimization. Here, we discuss scientific, strategic, organizational and cultural considerations for medicinal chemistry practices, with the aim of promoting more effective use of what is already known, as well as a wider appreciation of the risks of pursuing suboptimal compounds.",

Medicinal plant drug discovery continues to provide new and important leads against various pharmacological targets including cancer, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's, malaria, and pain. Several natural product drugs of plant origin have either recently been introduced to the United States market, including arteether, galantamine, nitisinone, and tiotropium, or are currently involved in late-phase clinical trials. As part of our National Cooperative Drug Discovery Group (NCDDG) research project, numerous compounds from tropical rainforest plant species with potential anticancer activity have been identified. Our group has also isolated several compounds, mainly from edible plant species or plants used as dietary supplements, that may act as chemopreventive agents. Although drug discovery from medicinal plants continues to provide an important source of new drug leads, numerous challenges are encountered including the procurement of plant materials, the selection and implementation of appropriate high-throughput screening bioassays, and the scale-up of active compounds. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Inc.

These signalling events aim to ameliorate the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER; however, when these events are severe or protracted they can induce cell death.

For many years, drug discovery was a target- and mechanism-agnostic approach that was based on ethnobotanical knowledge often fueled by serendipity. With the advent of modern molecular biology methods and based on knowledge of the human genome, drug discovery has now largely changed into a hypothesis-driven target-based approach, a development which was paralleled by significant environmental changes in the pharmaceutical industry. Laboratories became increasingly computerized and automated, and geographically dispersed research sites are now more and more clustered into large centers to capture technological and biological synergies. Today, academia, the regulatory agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry all contribute to drug discovery, and, in order to translate the basic science into new medical treatments for unmet medical needs, pharmaceutical companies have to have a critical mass of excellent scientists working in many therapeutic fields, disciplines, and technologies. The imperative for the pharmaceutical industry to discover breakthrough medicines is matched by the increasing numbers of first-in-class drugs approved in recent years and reflects the impact of modern drug discovery approaches, technologies, and genomics.",

Methods: This review provides background on the principle of SPA and its application to biomolecular interactions from a variety of biological sources. Conclusion: The SPA approach is well suited to the demands of commercial high volume automation and assay miniaturization for target-based high-throughput screening campaigns on synthetic and natural product libraries as well as for benchtop characterization and confirmation studies.

Tumour cells have thus evolved the ability to function in a more acidic environment than normal cells. Key pH regulators in tumour cells include: isoforms 2, 9 and 12 of carbonic anhydrase, isoforms of anion exchangers, Na+/HCO3- co-transporters, Na+/H+ exchangers, monocarboxylate transporters and the vacuolar ATPase. Both small molecules and antibodies targeting these pH regulators are currently at various stages of clinical development. These antitumour mechanisms are not exploited by the classical cancer drugs and therefore represent a new anticancer drug discovery strategy.",

It is a fusion of traditional and modern medicine, phenotypic and targeted drug discovery, or systems and reductionist thinking.  This is exemplified by using a combination of network medicine and high throughput screening.  It blends the use of physiol. relevant biol. systems with the high throughput and statistical robustness of modern assay technologies.  The basic principles of network theory and tools of network medicine are described.  Scale-free networks and their organizing principles are discussed.  They are emergent properties of living, autopoietic systems.  This includes networks of people who do high throughput screening (HTS), and microscopic networks of ions, metabolites, DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, viruses, bacteria, fungi, human cells and tissues.  Databases have been constructed based on the metabolome, genome, transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, glycocode, virome, bacteriome and many others.  Modern HTS can be used to examine the interactions of many parts of the complex human network.  High content screening (HCS) can look at perturbations that occur when test compds. are added to single cells.  Allo-network drugs can have effects far beyond a single protein and can be transmitted to other cells.  Interactions and hidden connections can be revealed, with the goal of developing new drugs that have few, if any harmful side effects and are effective against multi-drug resistant cancer cells or bacteria.

Since the publication of The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin 150 years ago, evolution has been a central concept in biology. In this article, we show that evolutionary concepts are also helpful to streamline the drug-discovery pipeline through facilitating the discovery of targets and drug candidates. Furthermore, the antioxidant paradox can be addressed by an evolutionary methodology. Through examining the evolved biological roles of natural polyphenols (which dominate current antioxidant drug discovery), we reveal that polyphenols (particularly flavonoids) are not evolved for scavenging free radicals. This finding provides new clues to understanding why the strong in vitro antioxidant activities of polyphenols cannot be translated into in vivo effects. Polyphenols have evolved a superior ability to bind various proteins, so we also argue that they are good starting points for multi-target drugs. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "A common underlying assumption in current drug discovery strategies is that compounds with higher in vitro potency at their target(s) have greater potential to translate into successful, low-dose therapeutics. This has led to the development of screening cascades with in vitro potency embedded as an early filter. However, this approach is beginning to be questioned, given the bias in physicochemical properties that it can introduce early in lead generation and optimization, which is due to the often diametrically opposed relationship between physicochemical parameters associated with high in vitro potency and those associated with desirable absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) characteristics. Here, we describe analyses that probe these issues further using the ChEMBL database, which includes more than 500,000 drug discovery and marketed oral drug compounds. Key findings include: first, that oral drugs seldom possess nanomolar potency (50 nM on average); second, that many oral drugs have considerable off-target activity; and third, that in vitro potency does not correlate strongly with the therapeutic dose. These findings suggest that the perceived benefit of high in vitro potency may be negated by poorer ADMET properties.",

Here, we will briefly review hybridoma technology and the evolution of therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of human disease. We will focus on the evolution of humanized mouse models for the generation of therapeutic human antibodies, comparing the early models, such as severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice which do not engraft human leukocytes well due to residual innate immunity, to the more recently developed models such as non-obese diabetic (NOD)/SCID IL-2R\u03b3-deficient mice in which numerous human hematopoietic lineages can be cultivated. Building on the identification of suitable host strains for the reconstitution of human immune cells, focus has now shifted onto humanizing the murine microenvironment in order to support human immune cell function. Although several recent studies have shown that the provision of human soluble factors can support maturation and function of human immune cells, particularly within the myeloid compartment, this does not appear to impact antibody production significantly. Moreover, models in which grafting of human tissues is performed to provide human microenvironments which support human leukocyte maturation do show improved humoral immune function, but require several surgical manipulations for generation of the model. Ultimately the most desirable scenario is to generate transgenic models that can be bred efficiently and express a sufficient number of human molecules to support functional human immune cells and several groups have made progress in making this idea a reality. These studies in the context of the generation of human antibodies will be discussed.",

Further consideration should be given to data quality, ease-of-use, reagent stability, and matters of cost-effectiveness. Methods: Here we focus on three main classes of assays that are at present the most popular, useful, and practical for HTS drug discovery efforts. These methods measure: i) viability by metabolism reductase activities; ii) viability by bioluminescent ATP assays; or iii) cytotoxicity by enzymes 'released' into culture medium. Multi-parametric technologies are also briefly discussed. Results/conclusion: Each of these methods has its relative merits and detractions; however multi-parametric methods using both viability and cytotoxicity markers may mitigate the inherent shortcomings of single parameter measures.",

Aberrant activity of many of these enzymes is associated with human disease, hence, there is a growing interest in identifying corresponding small molecule inhibitors with therapeutic potential. To date, most of the technologies supporting the identification of these inhibitors constitute in vitro biochemical assays which, although robust and sensitive, do not study HMTs and HDMs in their native cellular state nor provide information of inhibitor's cell permeability and toxicity. The evident need for complementary cellular approaches has recently propelled the development of cell-based assays that enable screening of HMT and HDM enzymes in a more relevant environment. Here, we highlight current cellular methodologies for HMT and HDM drug discovery support. We anticipate that implementation of these cell-based assays will positively impact the discovery of pharmacologically potent HMT and HDM inhibitors.",

Acetyl-lysine modifications create docking sites for bromodomains, which are small interaction modules found on diverse proteins, some of which have a key role in the acetylation-dependent assembly of transcriptional regulator complexes. These complexes can then initiate transcriptional programmes that result in phenotypic changes. The recent discovery of potent and highly specific inhibitors for the BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) family of bromodomains has stimulated intensive research activity in diverse therapeutic areas, particularly in oncology, where BET proteins regulate the expression of key oncogenes and anti-apoptotic proteins. In addition, targeting BET bromodomains could hold potential for the treatment of inflammation and viral infection. Here, we highlight recent progress in the development of bromodomain inhibitors, and their potential applications in drug discovery.",

Conduction block in demyelinated axons underlies early neurological symptoms, but axonal transection and neuronal loss are believed to be responsible for more permanent chronic deficits. Several therapies are approved for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, all of which are immunoregulatory and clinically proven to reduce the rate of lesion formation and exacerbation. However, existing approaches are only partially effective in preventing the onset of disability in MS patients, and novel treatments to protect myelin-producing oligodendrocytes and enhance myelin repair may improve long-term outcomes. Studies in vivo in genetically modified mice have assisted in the characterization of mechanisms underlying the generation of neuropathology in MS patients, and have identified potential avenues for oligodendrocyte protection and myelin repair. However, no treatments are yet approved that target these areas directly, and in addition, the relationship between demyelination and axonal transection in the lesions of the disease remains unclear. Here, we review translational research targeting oligodendrocyte protection and myelin repair in models of autoimmune demyelination, and their potential relevance as therapies in MS.",

Of the total 36 antibodies approved by major maket regulatory agencies, the variable domain sequences of 26 originate from the mouse.

Ten marketed antibodies have originated from human antibody genes, three isolated from phage libraries of human antibody genes and seven from transgenic mice producing human antibodies. Five antibodies currently in clinical trials have been sourced from camelids, as well as two from non-human primates, one from rat, and one from rabbit. Additional sources of antibody variable domains that may soon find their way into the clinic are potential antibodies from sharks and chickens.

        "abstract": "Phenotypic lead generation strategies seek to identify compounds that modulate complex, physiologically relevant systems, an approach that is complementary to traditional, target-directed strategies. Unlike gene-specific assays, phenotypic assays interrogate multiple molecular targets and signaling pathways in a target \"agnostic\" fashion, which may reveal novel functions for well-studied proteins and discover new pathways of therapeutic value. Significantly, existing compound libraries may not have sufficient chemical diversity to fully leverage a phenotypic strategy. To address this issue, Eli lilly and Company Launched the Phenotypic Drug Discovery Initiative (PD(2)), a model of open innovation whereby external research groups can submit compounds for testing in a panel of Lilly phenotypic assays. This communication describes the statistical validation, operations, and initial screening results from the first PD(2) assay panel. Analysis of PD(2) submissions indicates that chemical diversity from open source collaborations complements internal sources. Screening results for the first 4691 compounds submitted to PD(2) have confirmed hit rates from 1.6% to 10%, with the majority of active compounds exhibiting acceptable potency and selectivity. Phenotypic lead generation strategies, in conjunction with novel chemical diversity obtained via open-source initiatives such as PD(2), may provide a means to identify compounds that modulate biology by novel mechanisms and expand the innovation potential of drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Background: Human tumor xenografts constitute the major efficacy and tumor biology models for cancer drug discovery. Gene expression and protein expression technologies have improved understanding of the malignant diseases represented by human tumor lines. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of cancer are improving and allow assessment of immune system-mediated therapeutics. Objective: The current brief review discusses the status of human tumor xenografts, GEM models and normal tissue assays used in cancer drug discovery. Results: The Preclinical Pediatric Tumor Program consortium with 47 molecularly well-characterized pediatric tumor xenografts is leading the field. Individual laboratory studies show no correlation between culture and in vivo characteristics of some human tumor lines. The TRAMP and RIP1TAG2 GEM models have been used for efficacy studies. Recent GEM models often have two mutated genes leading to greater genetic instability. Host normal cells are important contributors in malignant disease. While convenient and frequent subcutaneous tumor implantation does not provide an optimal microenvironment for modeling clinical disease. Orthoptopic tumor implantation is gaining in use due to the availability of labeled tumor sub-lines and non-invasive imaging techniques. Conclusion: The science associated with human tumor xenografts and GEM cancer models is not static. The application of gene and protein expression technologies, the wider availability of non-invasive imaging and improved genetic engineering are allowing improved tumor modeling. However, as more is learned about current models, it is becoming clear that there is a shortage of models to cover the broad spectrum of human malignant disease.",

However, the types of biophysical forces involved in the interaction of drugs with lipid membranes are no different from those involved in their interaction with proteins, and so arguments based on lipophilicity could also be applied to drug uptake by membrane transporters or carriers.

        "abstract": "There is strong interest in developing small molecules that modulate protein-protein interactions (PPI), since such compounds could serve as drug leads or as probes of protein function. Fragment-based ligand discovery has been a particularly useful approach for modulating PPI. Fragments are typically <250 Da compounds that bind to proteins with weak affinity but high ligand efficiency. Here, we review a method for fragment-based ligand discovery using covalent disulfide trapping (Tethering). Tethering uses a native or engineered cysteine residue to select thiol-containing fragments that bind to the protein near the tethering cysteine. Taking advantage of the site-directed nature of Tethering, one can investigate the 'druggability' of particular binding sites on a protein surface; furthermore, Tethering has been used to find new binding sites and to stabilize allosteric conformations. We review the principles of Tethering and discuss two examples where disulfide trapping has expanded our understanding of PPI. For the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL2), Tethering identified a binding site adjacent to the IL2/IL2-receptor and a new site allosterically coupled to this PPI. For the kinase PDK1, Tethering identified ligands that activated or inhibited enzymatic activity by binding to a single allosteric site. These examples provide a context for successful fragment-discovery projects, in which complementary technologies work together to identify starting points for chemical biology and drug discovery. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

We introduce the concept of drug efficiency as a new tool both to guide the drug discovery program teams during the lead optimization phase and to better assess the developability potential of a drug candidate.",

In this article, we provide an overview of the current strategies and point out where and how the method of maximum entropy has been introduced in this area. The maximum entropy principle has its root in thermodynamics, yet since Jaynes\u2019 pioneering work in the 1950s, the maximum entropy principle has not only been used as a physics law, but also as a reasoning tool that allows us to process information in hand with the least bias. Its applicability in various disciplines has been abundantly demonstrated. We give several examples of applications of maximum entropy in different stages of drug discovery. Finally, we discuss a promising new direction in drug discovery that is likely to hinge on the ways of utilizing maximum entropy.",

Cellular signalling is commonly mediated through dynamic protein-protein interactions (PPIs). When pivotal PPIs are deregulated, cellular signalling can be altered; it is therefore attractive to monitor regulated PPIs to understand their role in health and disease. Genetically encoded biosensors that rely on protein fragment complementation have made it feasible to monitor PPIs in living cells precisely and robustly. In particular, split protein biosensors using fluorescent proteins or luciferases are frequently applied. Further, split TEV and split ubiquitin biosensor platforms flexibly allow using readouts of choice, including transcriptional barcode reporters that are amenable to multiplexed high-throughput formats and next-generation sequencing. Combining these technologies will enable assessing drug target activities and cellular response profiles in parallel, thereby opening up new avenues in drug discovery.",

A phenolic chemotype was also identified in fragment screening and was found to bind with affinity close to 1 mM. This fragment was optimized using structure based design into a resorcinol lead which has subnanomolar affinity for Hsp90, excellent cell potency, and good ligand efficiency. This fragment to lead campaign improved affinity for Hsp90 by over 1,000,000-fold with the addition of only six heavy atoms.

The majority of safety-related attrition occurs preclinically, suggesting that approaches to identify 'predictable' preclinical safety liabilities earlier in the drug development process could lead to the design and/or selection of better drug candidates that have increased probabilities of becoming marketed drugs. In this Review, we discuss how the early application of preclinical safety assessment--both new molecular technologies as well as more established approaches such as standard repeat-dose rodent toxicology studies--can identify predictable safety issues earlier in the testing paradigm. The earlier identification of dose-limiting toxicities will provide chemists and toxicologists the opportunity to characterize the dose-limiting toxicities, determine structure-toxicity relationships and minimize or circumvent adverse safety liabilities.",

To demonstrate the applicability of this concept, we report here a study on epsilon-viniferin, an active ingredient for cosmetic development. Nevertheless, this natural substance is weakly defined in terms of biological properties. SELNERGY, an inverse docking computer software, was used to identify putative binding biological targets for epsilon-viniferin. Among the 400 screened proteins two targets were retained. For cosmetic application, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) was the most interesting candidate. Moreover, other PDE subtypes (1, 2, 3, 5 and 6) were not retained, indicating a selectivity for PDE4. The experimental binding tests on the 6 subtypes of PDE revealed a significant selectivity of epsilon-viniferin for the PDE4 subtype. This selectivity was confirmed by evaluation of epsilon-viniferin on the secretion of TNF-alpha and Interleukin-8. Our data demonstrated that epsilon-viniferin possesses anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting PDE4 subtype. In conclusion, reverse pharmacognosy and its inverse docking component cannot only be integrated into a program for new lead discovery but is also a useful approach to find new applications for identified compounds.",

        "abstract": "In the olfactory epithelium (OE), odorant receptor stimulation generates cAMP signals that function in both odor detection and the regulation of axon guidance molecule expression. The enzyme that synthesizes cAMP, adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3), is coexpressed in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) with poly-N-acetyllactosamine (PLN) oligosaccharides determined by the glycosyltransferase \u03b23GnT2. The loss of either enzyme results in similar defects in olfactory bulb (OB) innervation and OSN survival, suggesting that glycosylation may be important for AC3 function. We show here that AC3 is extensively modified with N-linked PLN, which is essential for AC3 activity and localization. On Western blots, AC3 from the wild-type OE migrates diffusely as a heavily glycosylated 200 kDa band that interacts with the PLN-binding lectin LEA. AC3 from the \u03b23GnT2(-/-) OE loses these PLN modifications, migrating instead as a 140 kDa glycoprotein. Furthermore, basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP production is reduced 80-90% in the \u03b23GnT2(-/-) OE. Although AC3 traffics normally to null OSN cilia, it is absent from axon projections that aberrantly target the OB. The cAMP-dependent guidance receptor neuropilin-1 is also lost from \u03b23GnT2(-/-) OSNs and axons, while semaphorin-3A ligand expression is upregulated. In addition, kirrel2, a mosaically expressed adhesion molecule that functions in axon sorting, is absent from \u03b23GnT2(-/-) OB projections. These results demonstrate that PLN glycans are essential in OSNs for proper AC3 localization and function. We propose that the loss of cAMP-dependent guidance cues is also a critical factor in the severe axon guidance defects observed in \u03b23GnT2(-/-) mice.",

There is a growing need to increase productivity in R&D, and to use technologies that can both increase and more efficiently facilitate the flow of products through the development pipeline. This article describes how the twin processes of modelling and simulation are being used to improve the efficiency of the clinical drug-development process, and consequently how these methodologies have delivered significant benefits in the drive to save time, money (and additionally assisted in ensuring an 'optimal quality' drug label) in the development of novel therapeutic agents.",

        "abstract": "The main obstacles that drugs meet when administered via the buccal route derive from the limited absorption area and the barrier properties of the mucosa. The effective physiological removal mechanisms of the oral cavity that take the formulation away from the absorption site are the other obstacles that have to be considered. The strategies studied to overcome such obstacles include the employment of new materials that, possibly, combine mucoadhesive, enzyme inhibitory and penetration enhancer properties and the design of innovative drug delivery systems which, besides improving patient compliance, favor a more intimate contact of the drug with the absorption mucosa. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Despite important advances made in the last century, infectious diseases caused by pathogenic microrganisms are still a major threat to human health. This is worsened by the occurrence of new forms of bacterial resistance against antibiotics, that are the main remedy against infectious diseases, and their rapid spreading across bacterial species, pose additional threats to our health. Thus, the necessity to develop new weapons against pathogenic bacteria is widely recognized as a major challenge for modern drug research. Traditional antibiotic discovery procedures have so far focused on inhibiting the main processes of the bacterial cell (replication, transcription, translation, and peptidoglycan synthesis). This review will give an overview of the therapeutic strategies to cure infectious diseases caused by Gram-negative bacteria through the development of inhibitors of Kdo biosynthesis. Kdo is a monsaccharide essential for OM biogenesis, OM being an essential cellular structure shared by all Gram-negative bacteria. Hence, inhibitors of its biosynthesis can have a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity.",
