Recent advances in stem cell technology have the potential to improve drug screening. For tests of cardiotoxicity and efficacy of cardioactive drugs, cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells and/or human induced pluripotent stem cells, collectively termed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), have been utilized as model alternatives to current drug screening platforms. In this review, we report on recent advances in the differentiation of hPSCs to cardiomyocytes and summarize the evidence for pharmacological responses in hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.",

        "abstract": "The initial stage of drug development is the hit (active) compound search from a pool of millions of compounds; for this process, in silico (virtual) screening has been successfully applied. One of the problems of in silico screening, however, is the low hit ratio in relation to the high computational cost and the long CPU time. This problem becomes serious in structure-based in silico screening. The major reason is the low accuracy of the estimation of protein-compound binding free energy. The problem of ligand-based in silico screening is that the conventional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach is not effective at predicting new hit compounds with new scaffolds. Recently, machine-learning approaches have been applied to in silico drug screening to overcome the above problems. We review here machine-learning approaches for both structure-based and ligand-based drug screening. Machine learning is used to improve database enrichment in two ways, namely by improving the docking score calculated by the protein-compound docking program and by calculating the optimal distance between the feature vectors of active and inactive compounds. Both approaches require compounds that are known to be active with respect to the target protein. In structure-based screening, the former approach is mainly used with a protein-compound affinity matrix. In ligand-based screening, both the former and latter approaches are used, and the latter approach can be applied to various kinds of descriptors, such as 1D/2D descriptors/fingerprints and the affinity fingerprint given by the protein-compound affinity matrix.",

Yet, not many studies have been published emphasizing flow cytometry as a tool of choice for drug screening except multiplex bead assay. Areas covered in this review: Scanning the literature for technology breakouts in screening by flow is not an easy task. When a private industry has an accurate and fast screening technology on hands, why should they make public a tool precious for their screening applications? On the European academic side, there are regrettably few grants to help develop and publish screening methodologies. So, a less scientific way to find out is a close market survey seeking new instruments and associated kits or new methods. From here, can one expect flow cytometry to be a tool with new potential for drug discovery? What the reader will gain: As the machines are getting simpler to use, a need for plug-and-analyze software has emerged. New analysis tools remain an important step as they will permit to analyze and compare several parameters in a multi-well format simultaneously and this for several cell types for cytomics: a multiparametric, dynamic approach to cell research as cytomics has a practical role to play in drug discovery within the immediate limitations of cell-based analyses. Take home message: Developing new software with multi-well comparison capabilities and most importantly real-time interaction on cytograms can easily circumvent the lack of fluorescent channels on small bench top machines.",

        "abstract": "The zebrafish embryo has become an important vertebrate model for assessing drug effects. It is well suited for studies in genetics, embryology, development, and cell biology. Zebrafish embryos exhibit unique characteristics, including ease of maintenance and drug administration, short reproductive cycle, and transparency that permits visual assessment of developing cells and organs. Because of these advantages, zebrafish bioassays are cheaper and faster than mouse assays, and are suitable for large-scale drug screening. Here we describe the use of zebrafish bioassays for assessing toxicity, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Using 18 chemicals, we demonstrated that toxic response, teratogenic effects, and LC(50) in zebrafish are comparable to results in mice. The effects of compounds on various organs, including the heart, brain, intestine, pancreas, cartilage, liver, and kidney, were observed in the transparent animals without complicated processing, demonstrating the efficiency of toxicity assays using zebrafish embryos. Using endogenous alkaline phosphatase staining and a whole-animal enzyme assay, we demonstrated that SU5416 and flavopiridol, compounds shown to have antiangiogenic effects in mammals, inhibit blood vessel growth in zebrafish, and this bioassay is suitable for high-throughput screening using a 96-well microplate reader. We also demonstrated that in vivo acridine orange staining can be used to visualize apoptotic events in embryos treated with brefeldin A, neomycin, or caspase inhibitors. After in vivo staining, acridine orange can be extracted and quantitated using a fluorescence microplate reader, providing a screening system for agents that modulate apoptosis.",

Areas covered in this review: This review highlights the recent progress of the post-processing of protein-compound complexes after docking. What the reader will gain: These methods utilize ensembles of docking poses of compounds to improve the prediction accuracy for the ligand-docking pose and screening results. While the individual docking poses are not reliable, the free energy surface or the most probable docking pose can be estimated from the ensemble of docking poses. Take home message: The protein-compound docking program provides an arbitral rather than a canonical ensemble of docking poses. When the ensemble of docking poses satisfies the canonical ensemble, we can discuss how these post-docking analysis methods work and fail. Thus, improvements to the docking software will be needed in order to generate well-defined ensembles of docking poses.",

Despite advance standard therapy the prognosis for patients with gliomas remains poor. Chemotherapy has played an important role as an adjuvant in treating gliomas. The efficacy of the chemotherapeutic drug is limited due to poor drug delivery and the inherent chemo- and radio-resistance. Challenges of the brain cancer therapy in clinical settings are; i) to overcome the chemo- and radio-resistance, ii) to improve drug delivery to tumors and iii) the development of effective drug screening procedures.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors discuss clinically important chemotherapeutic agents used for treating malignant gliomas along with novel drug design approaches. The authors, furthermore, discuss the in vitro and in vivo drug screening procedures for the development of novel drug candidates.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The development of novel and highly potent chemotherapeutic agents for both glioma and glioma stem cells (GSCs) is highly important for future brain cancer research. Thus, research efforts should be directed towards developing innovative molecularly targeted antiglioma agents in order to reduce the toxicity and drug resistance which are associated with current forms of therapy. Development of novel pre-clinical drug screening procedures is also very critical for the overall success of brain cancer therapies in clinical settings.",

Ordering and interpreting these tests requires an understanding of testing modalities, detection times for specific drugs, and common explanations for false-positive and false-negative results. Employment screening, federal regulations, unusual patient behavior, and risk patterns may prompt urine drug screening. Compliance testing may be necessary for patients taking controlled substances. Standard immunoassay testing is fast, inexpensive, and the preferred initial test for urine drug screening. This method reliably detects morphine, codeine, and heroin; however, it often does not detect other opioids such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, fentanyl, buprenorphine, and tramadol. Unexpected positive test results should be confirmed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry or high-performance liquid chromatography. A positive test result reflects use of the drug within the previous one to three days, although marijuana can be detected in the system for a longer period of time.

A simple colorimetric detection method allowed one to prove the screening capability of the microarray with the possibility to assay with high reproducibility at the single spot level. Measurements of the optical signal as a function of concentration and of time verified the occurrence at the solid-liquid interface of the competitive enzymatic inhibition with a similar behavior occurring for this system in a solution phase along with overcoming competition effects. We propose this methodology as a general application for drug screening purposes, since it may be extended to any kind of enzyme-substrate/inhibitor or ligand-target biochemical system.",

        "abstract": "Reactions that convert carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds into carbon-carbon (C-C) or carbon-heteroatom (C-Y) bonds are attractive tools for organic chemists, potentially expediting the synthesis of target molecules through new disconnections in retrosynthetic analysis. Despite extensive inorganic and organometallic study of the insertion of homogeneous metal species into unactivated C-H bonds, practical applications of this technology in organic chemistry are still rare. Only in the past decade have metal-catalyzed C-H functionalization reactions become more widely utilized in organic synthesis. Research in the area of homogeneous transition metal-catalyzed C-H functionalization can be broadly grouped into two subfields. They reflect different approaches and goals and thus have different challenges and opportunities. One approach involves reactions of completely unfunctionalized aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, which we refer to as \"first functionalization\". Here the substrates are nonpolar and hydrophobic and thus interact very weakly with polar metal species. To overcome this weak affinity and drive metal-mediated C-H cleavage, chemists often use hydrocarbon substrates in large excess (for example, as solvent). Because highly reactive metal species are needed in first functionalization, controlling the chemoselectivity to avoid overfunctionalization is often difficult. Additionally, because both substrates and products are comparatively low-value chemicals, developing cost-effective catalysts with exceptionally high turnover numbers that are competitive with alternatives (including heterogeneous catalysts) is challenging. Although an exciting field, first functionalization is beyond the scope of this Account. The second subfield of C-H functionalization involves substrates containing one or more pre-existing functional groups, termed \"further functionalization\". One advantage of this approach is that the existing functional group (or groups) can be used to chelate the metal catalyst and position it for selective C-H cleavage. Precoordination can overcome the paraffin nature of C-H bonds by increasing the effective concentration of the substrate so that it need not be used as solvent. From a synthetic perspective, it is desirable to use a functional group that is an intrinsic part of the substrate so that extra steps for installation and removal of an external directing group can be avoided. In this way, dramatic increases in molecular complexity can be accomplished in a single stroke through stereo- and site-selective introduction of a new functional group. Although reactivity is a major challenge (as with first functionalization), the philosophy in further functionalization differs; the major challenge is developing reactions that work with predictable selectivity in intricately functionalized contexts on commonly occurring structural motifs. In this Account, we focus on an emergent theme within the further functionalization literature: the use of commonly occurring functional groups to direct C-H cleavage through weak coordination. We discuss our motivation for studying Pd-catalyzed C-H functionalization assisted by weakly coordinating functional groups and chronicle our endeavors to bring reactions of this type to fruition. Through this approach, we have developed reactions with a diverse range of substrates and coupling partners, with the broad scope likely stemming from the high reactivity of the cyclopalladated intermediates, which are held together through weak interactions.",

We demonstrate that arrays of hepatic organoids can be formed from co-cultures of HepG2 and NIH-3T3 cells embedded in hydrogel matrices. The organoids exhibit fibroblast-dependent contractile behaviour, and their albumin secretion profiles and cytochrome P450 3A4 activities are better mimics of in vivo liver tissue than comparable two-dimensional cell culture systems. As proof of principle for screening, MODS was used to generate and analyze the effects of a dilution series of acetaminophen on apoptosis and necrosis.

        "abstract": "The alarming rate of failure of clinical trials is a major hurdle in cancer therapy that partly results from the inadequate use of in vitro tumor models for the screening of promising hits and leads in preclinical studies. 2D cultures of cancer cell lines that are primarily used for drug screening do not adequately recapitulate tumor microenvironment (TME) complexities compared with 3D cancer cell cultures and tumor-derived primary cell cultures. In this review, we focus on the potential use of in vitro tumor models that reproduce in vivo tumor complexities for effective drug selection in the preclinical stages of drug development.",

        "abstract": "Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neuro- and cardiodegenerative disorder for which there are no proven effective treatments. FRDA is caused by decreased expression and/or function of the protein frataxin. Frataxin chaperones iron in the mitochondrial matrix for the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs), which are prosthetic groups critical for the function of the Krebs cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Decreased expression of frataxin or the yeast frataxin orthologue, Yfh1p, is associated with decreased ISC assembly, mitochondrial iron accumulation, and increased oxidative stress, all of which contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. Using yeast depleted of Yfh1p, a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay was developed in which mitochondrial function was monitored by reduction of the tetrazolium dye WST-1 in a growth medium with a respiration-only carbon source. Of 101 200 compounds screened, 302 were identified that effectively rescue mitochondrial function. To confirm activities in mammalian cells and begin understanding mechanisms of action, secondary screening assays were developed using murine C2C12 cells and yeast mutants lacking specific complexes of the ETC, respectively. The compounds identified in this study have potential relevance for other neurodegenerative disorders associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Parkinson disease.",

        "title": "Drug Screening : Cardiotoxicity Assay for hERG Channels",
        "abstract": "Evaluation of drug cardiotoxicity is essential to the safe development of novel pharmaceuticals. Assessing a compound's risk for prolongation of the surface electrocardiographic QT interval, and hence risk for life threatening arrhythmias is mandated before approval of nearly all new pharmaceuticals. QT prolongation has most commonly been associated with loss of current through hERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) potassium ion channels due to direct block of the ion channel by drugs or occasionally by inhibition of the plasma membrane expression of the channel protein. To develop an efficient, reliable, and cost-effective hERG screening assay for detecting drug-mediated disruption of hERG membrane trafficking, we demonstrate the use of microfluidic-based systems to improve throughput and lower cost of current methods. We validate our microfluidics array platform in polystyrene (PS), cyclo-olefin polymer (COP) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microchannels for drug-induced disruption of hERG trafficking by culturing stably transfected HEK cells that overexpressed hERG (WT-hERG), and studying their morphology, proliferation rates, hERG protein expression, and response to drug treatment. Our results show that WT-hERG cells readily proliferate in PS, COP, and PDMS microfluidic channels. We demonstrated that conventional Western blot analysis was possible using cell lysate extracted from a single microchannel. The Western blot analysis also provided important evidence that WT-hERG cells cultured in microchannels maintained regular (well plate-based) expression of hERG. We further showed that experimental procedures can be streamlined by using direct inchannel immunofluorescent staining in conjunction with detection using an infrared scanner. Finally, treatment of WT-hERG cells with five different drugs suggested that PS (and COP) microchannels were more suitable than PDMS microchannels for drug screening applications, particularly for tests involving hydrophobic drug molecules.",

Human glioblastoma multiforme cells were engineered by gene transfer to express Gluc as a reporter for cell viability, which can be monitored over time by bioluminescence measurements using a plate luminometer. We have optimized the Gluc assay for screening and validated it using the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) custom collection II library consisting of 1,040 drugs and bioactive compounds, most of which are Food and Drug Administration-approved and are able to cross the blood-brain barrier. We found that the cardiac glycosides family sensitized glioblastoma multiforme cells to the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, the Gluc secretion assay is a robust tool for functional drug screening and can be applied to many different fields including cancer.",

        "title": "Urine drug screening in the medical setting",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The term drug screen is a misnomer since it implies screening for all drugs, which is not possible. Current practice is to limit the testing to the examination of serum for several drugs such as ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and of urine for several specific drugs or classes of drugs. In the emergency setting the screen should be performed in less than one hour. Controversies continue to exist regarding the value of urine drug testing in the medical setting. The reasons for these include the drugs involved, the sample, the methods utilized to perform the tests, and the level of understanding of the physician using the data, all of which are closely related to the other. METHODS: Current automated methods provide rapid results demanded in emergency situations, but are often designed for, or adapted from, workplace testing and are not necessarily optimized for clinical applications. Furthermore, the use of these methods without consideration of the frequency in which the drugs are found in a given area is not cost-effective. The laboratory must understand the limitations of the assays used and provide this information to the physician. Additionally, the laboratory and the physicians using the data must cooperate to determine which drugs are appropriate and necessary to measure for their institution and clinical setting. In doing so it should be remembered that for many drugs, the sample, urine, contains the end product(s) of drug metabolism, not the parent drug. Furthermore, it is necessary to understand the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug of interest when interpreting data. Finally, while testing for some drugs may not appear cost-effective, the prevention or reduction of morbidity and mortality may offset any laboratory costs. CONCLUSIONS: While the literature is replete with studies concerning new methods and a few regarding physician understanding, there are none that we could find that thoroughly, objectively, and fully addressed the issues of utility and cost-effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Most current drug screening assays used to identify new drug candidates are 2D cell-based systems, even though such in vitro assays do not adequately re-create the in vivo complexity of 3D tissues. Inadequate representation of the human tissue environment during a preclinical test can result in inaccurate predictions of compound effects on overall tissue functionality. Screening for compound efficacy by focusing on a single pathway or protein target, coupled with difficulties in maintaining long-term 2D monolayers, can serve to exacerbate these issues when using such simplistic model systems for physiological drug screening applications. Numerous studies have shown that cell responses to drugs in 3D culture are improved from those in 2D, with respect to modeling in vivo tissue functionality, which highlights the advantages of using 3D-based models for preclinical drug screens. In this review, we discuss the development of microengineered 3D tissue models that accurately mimic the physiological properties of native tissue samples and highlight the advantages of using such 3D microtissue models over conventional cell-based assays for future drug screening applications. We also discuss biomimetic 3D environments, based on engineered tissues as potential preclinical models for the development of more predictive drug screening assays for specific disease models.",

False-positive results of immunoassays can lead to serious medical or social consequences if results are not confirmed by secondary analysis, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The Department of Health and Human Services' guidelines for the workplace require testing for the following 5 substances: amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates, and phencyclidine.

It is very important to discover new compounds that exhibit specific features such as binding to proteic targets. Given the clinical successes of the poisons of the mitotic spindle chemotherapeutic agent class, it is often considered that tubulin represents one of the best cancer targets identified so far, and it seems likely that discovering new drugs of this class will significantly improve the range of active chemotherapeutic agents. The aim of this work is to present the new screening test that has been developed in our laboratory in order to study the binding of compounds to tubulin. We have developed a screening protocol involving three sampling strategies before the MALDI-TOFMS analysis. The three strategies give very accurate and reproducible results and could therefore possibly be used in screening campaigns. We have also proved that no unspecific binding can provide a loss of specificity of the test. Our protocol presents all the requirements for being a useful tool to screen the binding of compounds to tubulin.",

Recent discoveries by systems biologists have provided emerging evidence that cellular responses to anti-cancer modalities are stochastic in nature. To uncover the intricacies of cell-to-cell variability and its relevance to cancer therapy, new analytical screening technologies are needed. The last decade has brought forth spectacular innovations in the field of cytometry and single cell cytomics, opening new avenues for systems oncology and high-throughput real-time drug screening routines. The up-and-coming microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) technology and micro-total analysis systems (\u03bcTAS) are arguably the most promising platforms to address the inherent complexity of cellular systems with massive experimental parallelization and 4D analysis on a single cell level. The vast miniaturization of LOC systems and multiplexing enables innovative strategies to reduce drug screening expenditures while increasing throughput and content of information from a given sample. Small cell numbers and operational reagent volumes are sufficient for microfluidic analyzers and, as such, they enable next generation high-throughput and high-content screening of anti-cancer drugs on patient-derived specimens. Herein we highlight the selected advancements in this emerging field of bioengineering, and provide a snapshot of developments with relevance to anti-cancer drug screening routines.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) is a rare but fatal cancer for which systematic testing of therapy options has never been performed.\\n\\nMETHODS: On the basis of disease biology, we compared the efficacy of the CDK9 inhibitor flavopiridol (FP) with a panel of anticancer agents in NMC cell lines and mouse xenografts.\\n\\nRESULTS: In vitro anthracyclines, topoisomerase inhibitors, and microtubule poisons were among the most cytotoxic drug classes for NMC cells, while efficacy of the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 varied considerably between lines carrying different BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4)-NUT (nuclear protein in testis) translocations. Efficacy of FP was comparable to vincristine and doxorubicin, drugs that have been previously used in NMC patients. All three compounds showed significantly better activity than etoposide and vorinostat, agents that have also been used in NMC patients. Statins and antimetabolites demonstrated intermediate single-agent efficacy. In vivo, vincristine significantly inhibited tumour growth in two different NMC xenografts. Flavopiridol in vivo was significantly effective in one of the two NMC xenograft lines, demonstrating the biological heterogeneity of this disease.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that FP may be of benefit to a subset of patients with NMC, and warrant a continued emphasis on microtubule inhibitors, anthracyclines, and topoisomerase inhibitors as effective drug classes in this disease.",

        "abstract": "Tissue engineering for in vitro drug-screening applications based on tissue function is an active area of translational research. Compared to targeted high-throughput drug-screening methods that rapidly analyze hundreds of thousands of compounds affecting a single biochemical reaction or gene expression, high-content screening (HCS) with engineered tissues is more complex and based on the cumulative positive and negative effects of a compound on the multiple pathways altering tissue function. It may therefore serve as better predictor of in vivo activity and serve as a bridge between high-throughput drug screening and in vivo animal studies. In the case of the musculoskeletal system, tissue function includes determining improvements in the mechanical properties of bone, tendon, cartilage, and, for skeletal muscle, contractile properties such as rate of contraction/relaxation, force generation, fatigability, and recovery from fatigue. HCS of compound banks with engineered tissues requires miniature musculoskeletal organs as well as automated functional testing. The resulting technologies should be rapid, cost effective, and reduce the number of small animals required for follow-on in vivo studies. Identification of compounds that improve the repair/regeneration of damaged tissues in vivo would have extensive clinical applications for treating musculoskeletal disorders.",

Disease-specific human embryonic stem cells were the first to provide a useful source for studying certain disease states. The recent demonstration that human somatic cells, derived from readily accessible tissue such as skin or blood, can be converted to embryonic-like induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has opened new perspectives for modelling and understanding a larger number of human pathologies. In this review, we examine the opportunities and challenges for the use of disease-specific pluripotent stem cells in disease modelling and drug screening.

        "abstract": "Introduction: The pharmaceutical industry urgently needs new ways of profiling the safety and efficacy of new cardiovascular (CV) drugs and more effectively transitioning these compounds through the stages of CV drug screening. This article reviews new technologies and methodological innovations and assesses whether these frameworks offer improved solutions to the problems facing the contemporary CV drug development. Areas covered: The article comprises literature derived from a systematic search (from 2000 onwards) using the US patent office and ESP@CENET search engines as well as through multiple Boolean terms. The article focuses on patents relating to technologies and resources and categorises the patents according to their niche in the CV drug screening landscape. Expert opinion: The CV drug pipeline is stalling due to the inability of many contemporary drug screening frameworks to discriminate between safe, efficacious therapy and hazardous off-target effect. Given the current limitations of drug screening frameworks, there is little scope for expanding the CV drug portfolio with newer, safer drugs with improved mechanisms of action. New screening modalities are urgently needed. Searches reveal that there are few examples of truly new technologies and systems in the patent literature. This apparent failure to revamp facets of the CV drug screening process can only perpetuate the inability of current platforms to improve the CV drug pipeline. Consequently, with few exceptions, there is stagnation in pre-clinical assay design that limits the pharmaceutical industry's ability to search for new drugs in new and more effective ways.",

The template molecule is KZ7088 (Chou et al., 2003, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 308: 148-151). The MDL MACCS keys were used to fingerprint the molecules. The Tanimoto coefficient is taken as the metric to compare fingerprints.

The AutoDock 3.011 was used to carry out molecular docking of 50 ligands to their macromolecular protein receptors. Three compounds, i.e., C(28)H(34)O(4)N(7)Cl, C(21)H(36)O(5)N(6), and C(21)H(36)O(5)N(6), were found that may be promising candidates for further investigation.

        "abstract": "Introduction: The development of one standard, simplified in vitro three-dimensional tissue model suitable to biological and pathological investigation and drug-discovery may not yet be feasible, but standardized models for individual tissues or organs are a possibility. Tissue bioengineering, while concerned with finding methods of restoring functionality in disease, is developing technology that can be miniaturized for high throughput screening (HTS) of putative drugs. Through collaboration between biologists, physicists and engineers, cell-based assays are expanding into the realm of tissue analysis. Accordingly, three-dimensional (3D) micro-organoid systems will play an increasing role in drug testing and therapeutics over the next decade. Nevertheless, important hurdles remain before these models are fully developed for HTS. Areas covered: We highlight advances in the field of tissue bioengineering aimed at enhancing the success of drug candidates through pre-clinical optimization. We discuss models that are most amenable to high throughput screening with emphasis on detection platforms and data modeling. Expert opinion: Modeling 3D tissues to mimic in-vivo architecture remains a major challenge. As technology advances to provide novel methods of HTS analysis, so do potential pitfalls associated with such models and methods. We remain hopeful that integration of biofabrication with HTS will significantly reduce attrition rates in drug development. \u00a9 Informa UK, Ltd.",

Here, we describe a high-content, cell-based drug discovery platform based on phosphospecific flow cytometry, or phosphoflow, that enabled screening for inhibitors against multiple endogenous kinase signaling pathways in heterogeneous primary cell populations at the single-cell level. From a library of small-molecule natural products, we identified pathway-selective inhibitors of Jak-Stat and MAP kinase signaling. Dose-response experiments in primary cells confirmed pathway selectivity, but importantly also revealed differential inhibition of cell types and new druggability trends across multiple compounds. Lead compound selectivity was confirmed in vivo in mice. Phosphoflow therefore provides a unique platform that can be applied throughout the drug discovery process, from early compound screening to in vivo testing and clinical monitoring of drug efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a severe liver malignancy with few drug treatment options. In finding an effective treatment for HCC, screening drugs that are already FDA-approved will fast track the clinical trial and drug approval process. Connectivity Map (CMap), a large repository of chemical-induced gene expression profiles, provides the opportunity to analyze drug properties on the basis of gene expression. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were utilized to classify the effectiveness of drugs against HCC using gene expression profiles in CMap. The results of this classification will help us (1) identify genes that are chemically sensitive, and (2) predict the effectiveness of remaining chemicals in CMap in the treatment of HCC and provide a prioritized list of possible HCC drugs for biological verification. Four HCC cell lines were treated with 146 distinct chemicals, and cell viability was examined. SVM successfully classified the effectiveness of the chemicals with an average Area Under ROC Curve (AUROC) of 0.9. Using reported HCC patient samples, we identified chemically sensitive genes that may be possible HCC therapeutic targets, including MT1E, MYC, and GADD45B. Using SVM, several known HCC inhibitors, such as geldanamycin, alvespimycin (HSP90 inhibitors), and doxorubicin (chemotherapy drug), were predicted. Seven out of the 23 predicted drugs were cardiac glycosides, suggesting a link between this drug category and HCC inhibition. The study demonstrates a strategy of in silico drug screening with SVM using a large repository of microarrays based on initial in vitro drug screening. Verifying these results biologically would help develop a more accurate chemical sensitivity model.",

A microfabricated electrochemical biochip is presented in this paper. Using dopaminergic cells grown on the chip, the dopamine excytosis can be electrochemical amperomatric detected non-invasively from drug incubated dopaminegic cells by the microelectrode integrated on chip. This silicon-based electrochemical chip has been designed with an electrode array located on the cell culture chamber bottom. Each electrode is individually electrical controlled. MN9D and PC12 dopaminergic cell lines have been demonstrated on this chip for drug effects study. This silicon-based electrochemical microchip provides a non-invasive, in situ, temporal detection of dopamine exocytosis from dopaminegic cells, and holds the potential for applications in studying the mechanisms of dopamine exocytosis and drug screening.

        "abstract": "Perturbed intracellular store calcium homeostasis is suggested to play a major role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). A number of mechanisms have been suggested to underlie the impairment of endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis associated with familial AD-linked presenilin 1 mutations (FAD-PS1). Without aiming at specifically targeting any of those pathophysiological mechanisms in particular, we rather performed a high-throughput phenotypic screen to identify compounds that can reverse the exaggerated agonist-evoked endoplasmic reticulum calcium release phenotype in HEK293 cells expressing FAD-PS1. For that purpose, we developed a fully automated high-throughput calcium imaging assay using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based calcium indicator at single-cell resolution. This novel robust assay offers a number of advantages compared with the conventional calcium measurement screening technologies. The assay was employed in a large-scale screen with a library of diverse compounds comprising 20,000 low-molecular-weight molecules, which resulted in the identification of 52 primary hits and 4 lead structures. In a secondary assay, several hits were found to alter the amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) production. In view of the recent failure of AD drug candidates identified by target-based approaches, such a phenotypic drug discovery paradigm may present an attractive alternative for the identification of novel AD therapeutics.",

This established microdevice was based on a modularization method and it integrated a drug/medium concentration gradient generator (CGG), pneumatic microvalves and a cell culture microchamber array. The CGG was able to generate five steps of linear concentrations with the same outlet flow rate. The medium/drug flowed through CGG and then into the pear-shaped cell culture microchambers vertically. This vertical perfusion mode was used to reduce the impact of the shear stress on the physiology of cells induced by the fluid flow in the microchambers. Pear-shaped microchambers with two arrays of miropillars at each outlet were adopted in this microdevice, which were beneficial to cell distribution. The chemotherapeutics Cisplatin (DDP)-induced Cisplatin-resistant cell line A549/DDP apoptotic experiments were performed well on this platform. The results showed that this novel microdevice could not only provide well-defined and stable conditions for cell culture, but was also useful for cell-based high-throughput drug screening with less reagents and time consumption. \u00a9 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Despite rapid advances in cardiac tissue engineering, limited successful strategies have been achieved to cure cardiovascular diseases. This situation is mainly due to poor understanding of the mechanism of diverse heart diseases and unavailability of effective in vitro heart tissue models for cardiovascular drug screening. With the development of microengineering technologies, three-dimensional (3D) cardiac microtissue (CMT) models, mimicking 3D architectural microenvironment of native heart tissues, have been developed. The engineered 3D CMT models hold greater potential to be used for assessing effective drugs candidates than traditional twodimensional cardiomyocyte culture models.

        "abstract": "Evaluation of drug cardiotoxicity is essential to the safe development of novel pharmaceuticals. Assessing a compound's risk for prolongation of the surface electrocardiographic QT interval and hence risk for life-threatening arrhythmias is mandated before approval of nearly all new pharmaceuticals. QT prolongation has most commonly been associated with loss of current through hERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) potassium ion channels due to direct block of the ion channel by drugs or occasionally by inhibition of the plasma membrane expression of the channel protein. To develop an efficient, reliable, and cost-effective hERG screening assay for detecting drug-mediated disruption of hERG membrane trafficking, the authors demonstrate the use of microfluidic-based systems to improve throughput and lower cost of current methods. They validate their microfluidics array platform in polystyrene (PS), cyclo-olefin polymer (COP), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels for drug-induced disruption of hERG trafficking by culturing stably transfected HEK cells that overexpressed hERG (WT-hERG) and studying their morphology, proliferation rates, hERG protein expression, and response to drug treatment. Results show that WT-hERG cells readily proliferate in PS, COP, and PDMS microfluidic channels. The authors demonstrated that conventional Western blot analysis was possible using cell lysate extracted from a single microchannel. The Western blot analysis also provided important evidence that WT-hERG cells cultured in microchannels maintained regular (well plate-based) expression of hERG. The authors further show that experimental procedures can be streamlined by using direct in-channel immunofluorescence staining in conjunction with detection using an infrared scanner. Finally, treatment of WT-hERG cells with 5 different drugs suggests that PS (and COP) microchannels were more suitable than PDMS microchannels for drug screening applications, particularly for tests involving hydrophobic drug molecules.",

In the present study, the compounds in a database were docked onto a target protein that had a known protein-ligand complex structure. The new score is the summation of the docking score and the MVO score, which is the measure of the volume overlap between the docking poses of the compound in question and the known ligand. The compounds were sorted according to the new score. The in silico screening results were improved by comparing the MVO score to the original docking score only. The present method was also applied to some target proteins with known ligands, and the results demonstrated that it worked well.",

        "abstract": "Cellular technologies are widely used in drug discovery to treat human diseases. Most studies involve the expression of recombinant targets in immortalized cells and measure drug interactions using simple, quantifiable responses. Such cells are also amenable to high throughput screening (HTS) methods. However, the cell phenotype employed in HTS is often determined by the assay technology available, rather than the physiological relevance of the cell background. They are, therefore, suboptimal surrogates for cells that accurately reflect human diseases. Consequently, there is growing interest in adopting primary and embryonic stem cells in drug discovery. Primary cells are already used in secondary screening assays in conjunction with confocal imaging techniques, as well as in target validation studies employing, for example, gene silencing approaches. Stem cells can be grown in unlimited quantities and can be derived from transgenic animals engineered to express disease causing proteins better coupling the molecular target with function in vivo. Human stem cells also offer unique opportunities for drug discovery in that they can be directed to specific phenotypes thus providing a framework to identify tissue-selective agents. Organizing stem cells into networks resembling those in native tissues, potentially returns drug discovery back to the highly successful pharmacological methods of the past, in which organ and tissue based systems were used, but with the advantage that they can be utilized using modern HTS technologies. This emerging area will lead to discovery of compounds whose effect in vivo is more predictable thereby increasing the efficiency of drugs that ameliorate human disease.",

The authors highlight the factors affecting FA readouts, fluorophore selection and instrumentation. Furthermore, the authors describe the recent development of a successful, commercially valuable FA assay for long QT syndrome drug toxicity to illustrate the role that FA can play in the early stages of drug discovery. Expert opinion: Despite the success in drug discovery, the FA-based technique experiences competitive pressure from other homogeneous assays. That being said, FA is an established yet rapidly developing technique, recognized by academic institutions, the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies across the globe. The technical problems encountered in working with small molecules in homogeneous assays are largely solved, and new challenges come from more complex biological molecules and nanoparticles. With that, FA will remain one of the major work-horse techniques leading to precision (personalized) medicine.",

Herein, we describe a novel screening strategy to identify multi-target ligands for proteins having varying pharmacophoric features with their ligands. This strategy was adopted to identify multi-target ligands for death-associated protein kinase (DAPk) family. The role of the kinase activity of DAPk in eukaryotic cell apoptosis and the ability of bioavailable DAPk inhibitors to rescue neuronal death after brain injury have made it a drug-discovery target for neurodegenerative disorders. In this work, we employed a novel strategy using the existing computational approaches to design multi-target inhibitors, which can potentially inhibit one or any combination of the three DAPk family members. The strategy employs a combination of merged pharmacophore matching, database screening and molecular docking to reliably identify potential multi-target inhibitors targeted against DAPk protein family.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of a comprehensive drug screening method as a first line diagnostic tool on clinical decision making in patients attending an emergency department for suspected drug overdose in terms of agreement between physicians on patients' disposal. METHODS: Five emergency physicians retrospectively evaluated the records of 142 adult patients, admitted to the emergency department of a community hospital for suspected drug overdose. They were asked for an expert opinion on patients' disposal at the end of the observation period, based on paired records, with/without the results of a comprehensive drug screening. RESULTS: In the absence of the drug screening, a very poor agreement (kappa statistics) was observed between physicians. When the drug screening was available, the interobserver agreement for decision on patients' disposal increased to the fair to good range (global agreement: from 0.238 (0.019) to 0.461 (0.020) (mean(SE)); p<0.001). The agreement also increased when admission to an intensive care unit, to a general ward, and discharge from hospital were separately analysed. The availability of drug screening would have saved 21.7% of hospital admissions and 53.3% of high dependency and/or intensive care unit admissions. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive drug screening adds to decision making for patients attending an emergency department for suspected drug overdose, improving agreement among physicians on patients' disposal and potentially saving hospital resources.",

The platform involves a galactosylated microfabricated membrane sandwich to support cellular function through uniform and efficient mass transfer while protecting cells from excessive shear. Perfusion bioreactor further enhances mass transfer and cellular functions over long period; and hepatoctyes are readily transferred to 96-well plate for high-throughput robotic liquid handling. The bioreactor design and perfusion flow rate are optimized by computational fluid dynamics simulation and experimentally. The cultured hepatocytes preserved 3D cell morphology, urea production and cytochrome p450 activity of the mature hepatocytes for 14 days. When the perfusion-cultured sandwich is transferred to 96-well plate for drug testing, the hepatocytes exhibited improved drug sensitivity and low variability in hepatotoxicity responses amongst cells transferred from different dates of perfusion culture.

        "abstract": "In the pharmaceutical industry, new drugs are tested to find appropriate compounds for therapeutic purposes for contemporary diseases. Unfortunately, novel compounds emerge at expensive prices and current target evaluation processes have limited throughput, thus leading to an increase of cost and time for drug development. This work shows the development of the novel inkjet-based deposition method for assembling a miniature drug-screening platform, which can realistically and inexpensively evaluate biochemical reactions in a picoliter-scale volume at a high speed rate. As proof of concept, applying a modified Hewlett Packard model 5360 compact disc printer, green fluorescent protein expressing Escherichia coli cells along with alginate gel solution have been arrayed on a coverslip chip under a repeatable volume of 180% \u00b1 26% picoliters per droplet; subsequently, different antibiotic droplets were patterned on the spots of cells to evaluate the inhibition of bacteria for antibiotic screening. The proposed platform was compared to the current screening process, validating its effectiveness. The viability and basic function of the printed cells were evaluated, resulting in cell viability above 98% and insignificant or no DNA damage to human kidney cells transfected. Based on the reduction of investment and compound volume used by this platform, this technique has the potential to improve the actual drug discovery process at its target evaluation stage.",

        "title": "A programmable microfluidic cell array for combinatorial drug screening",
        "abstract": "We describe the development of a fully automatic and programmable microfluidic cell culture array that integrates on-chip generation of drug concentrations and pair-wise combinations with parallel culture of cells for drug candidate screening applications. The device has 64 individually addressable cell culture chambers in which cells can be cultured and exposed either sequentially or simultaneously to 64 pair-wise concentration combinations of two drugs. For sequential exposure, a simple microfluidic diffusive mixer is used to generate different concentrations of drugs from two inputs. For generation of 64 pair-wise combinations from two drug inputs, a novel time dependent variable concentration scheme is used in conjunction with the simple diffusive mixer to generate the desired combinations without the need for complex multi-layer structures or continuous medium perfusion. The generation of drug combinations and exposure to specific cell culture chambers are controlled using a LabVIEW interface capable of automatically running a multi-day drug screening experiment. Our cell array does not require continuous perfusion for keeping cells exposed to concentration gradients, minimizing the amount of drug used per experiment, and cells cultured in the chamber are not exposed to significant shear stress continuously. The utility of this platform is demonstrated for inducing loss of viability of PC3 prostate cancer cells using combinations of either doxorubicin or mitoxantrone with TRAIL (TNF-alpha Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand) either in a sequential or simultaneous format. Our results demonstrate that the device can capture the synergy between different sensitizer drugs and TRAIL and demonstrate the potential of the microfluidic cell array for screening and optimizing combinatorial drug treatments for cancer therapy.",

        "title": "Development of an in vitro drug screening assay using Schistosoma haematobium schistosomula",
        "abstract": "Background: The development of novel antischistosomal drugs is crucial, as currently no vaccine and only a single drug is available for the treatment of schistosomiasis. Fast and accurate in vitro assays are urgently needed to identify new drug candidates and research efforts should include Schistosoma haematobium. The aim of the present study was to develop a S. haematobium drug sensitivity assay based on newly transformed schistosomula (NTS). Methods: We first undertook comparative studies on the cercarial emergence rhythms of the intermediate host snails Biomphalaria glabrata (S. mansoni) and Bulinus truncatus (S. haematobium). Two transformation methods as well as three purification methods were studied on S. haematobium cercariae in order to produce a large number of viable and clean NTS. Known antischistosomal drugs were tested in the established NTS assay in vitro. Drug effects were evaluated either microscopically or fluorometrically, using a resazurin based viability marker. Microscopically obtained IC50 values were compared with results obtained for S. mansoni. Results: A circadian rhythm existed in both snail species. Infected B. truncatus snails shed less cercariae than B. glabrata during the testing period. The highest transformation rate (69%) of S. haematobium cercariae into NTS was obtained with the vortex transformation (mechanical input) and the highest purification factor was observed using Percoll (R). The fluorimetric readout based on resazurin was very precise in detecting dead or/and severely damaged schistosomula. Conclusions: With the use of viability markers such as resazurin, drug screening assays using S. haematobium NTS can be efficiently performed. However, drugs acting on the morphology and motility of S. haematobium NTS, such as metrifonate are missed. Drug sensitivity assays with NTS of both species, S. haematobium and S. mansoni, showed very similar results using known antischistosomal drugs. The S. mansoni NTS assay might be more suitable as primary screen in drug discovery efforts, which ultimately aim for a broad-spectrum antischistosomal drug as a larger number of S. mansoni NTS can be generated.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The study determined whether dispositions from an urban psychiatric emergency service would differ between patients who received a mandatory urine drug test and those who may or may not have had a test based on the attending psychiatrist's clinical judgment. The accuracy of clinicians' suspicion of substance use among mandatorily screened patients was also examined. METHODS: A total of 392 consenting patients presenting to an urban psychiatric emergency service were randomly assigned to a mandatory-screen group (N=198) or a usual-care group (N=194). Physicians ordered screens based on clinical judgment. Additional screens were performed without physicians' knowledge for patients in the mandatory-screen group for whom no screen was ordered. Demographic and clinical information, results of drug screens, and information about dispositions were collected from clinical charts or hospital databases. RESULTS: No difference in dispositions was found between the mandatory-screen group and the usual-care group. Survival analysis did not reveal a difference between the two groups in length of stay in inpatient psychiatric units. As for accuracy of physicians' suspicion of substance use, positive drug screens were recorded for 10.2 percent of the 198 patients in the mandatory-screen group who did not admit drug use or for whom physicians did not expect drug use. A total of 39.3 percent of the patients who were suspected of use and 88.2 percent of those who admitted use had positive drug screens. Only 20.8 percent of patients who denied substance use had positive screens. CONCLUSIONS: Routine urine drug screening in a psychiatric emergency service did not affect disposition or the subsequent length of inpatient stays. The results do not support routine use of drug screens in this setting.",

        "abstract": "Hair has become an important matrix for drug analysis, complementary to blood and urine as a matrix. A prolonged detection window makes hair analysis suitable for the detection of exposure to illegal and medicinal drugs for periods up to 12 months. In the present study, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method for drug screening in hair was developed and validated. To 20 mg of hair, 0.45 mL of acetonitrile/25 mM formic acid (5:95 v/v) and 50 microL of deuterated internal standards were added, and the sample was incubated in a water bath at 37 degrees C for 18 h. LC separation was achieved with a Zorbax SB-Phenyl column (2.1 x 100 mm, 3.5-microm particle). Mass detection was performed by positive ion mode electrospray LC-MS-MS and included the following drugs/metabolites: nicotine, cotinine, morphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, codeine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymeth-amphetamine, cocaine, benzoylecgonine, 7-aminonitrazepam, 7-aminoclonazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, oxazepam, diazepam, alprazolam, zopiclone, zolpidem, carisoprodol, meprobamate, buprenorphine, and methadone. Within- and between-assay relative standard deviations varied from 2.0% to 12% and 2.7% to 15%, respectively. The accuracies were in the range of -24% to 16%, and recoveries ranged from 25% to 100%. The LC-MS-MS method proved to be simple and robust for the determination of drugs in hair. It has been used for authentic samples in our laboratory in the past year.",

        "title": "Using the Zebrafish Photomotor Response for Psychotropic Drug Screening",
        "abstract": "Because psychotropic drugs affect behavior, we can use changes in behavior to discover psychotropic drugs. The original prototypes of most neuroactive medicines were discovered in humans, rodents and other model organisms. Most of these discoveries were made by chance, but the process of behavior based drug discovery can be made more systematic and efficient. Fully automated platforms for analyzing the behavior of embryonic zebrafish capture digital video recordings of animals in each individual well of a 96-well plate before, during, and after a series of stimuli. To analyze systematically the thousands of behavioral recordings obtained from a large-scale chemical screen, we transform these behavioral recordings into numerical barcodes, providing a concise and interpretable summary of the observed phenotypes in each well. Systems-level analysis of these behavioral phenotypes generate testable hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms of poorly understood drugs and behaviors. By combining the in vivo relevance of behavior-based phenotyping with the scale and automation of modern drug screening technologies, systematic behavioral barcoding represents a means of discovering psychotropic drugs and provides a powerful, systematic approach for unraveling the complexities of vertebrate behavior. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

        "title": "Use of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutants for anticancer drug screening",
        "abstract": "We investigated the possibility of utilizing alga cells instead of mammalian cells for the screening of anticancer drugs. The alga cells grow in synthetic media whereas the mammalian cells require complex and more expensive media along with heavy investment and manpower. To assess the validity of this new approach, analysis of growth inhibition by antitumor agents was carried out jointly on a wall-less (cw15) mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, that obviates the problem of drug uptake, and the murine leukemic cell line L1210, commonly used for anticancer drug screening. The presence of the topoisomerases I and II (\u223c97 and \u223c2 \u00d7 170kDa, respectively) in the nuclear extracts of C. reinhardtii and their possible role as targets of the drugs was also investigated. Concentrated extracts were separated into >100 and <100kDa fractions and their topoisomerase I and II activities were measured on relaxation of supercoiled plasmid DNA, decatenation of the catenated kinetoplast DNA and cleavage of plasmid DNA. Our results do not show significant difference in growth inhibition by antitumorals between the wall-less mutant of the alga and the murine leukemic cell line L1210. We noted that alga cells were inhibited by antibiotics that target gyrase, a bacterial variant of topoisomerase II which is also found in chloroplasts. At the molecular level, the alga nuclear fractions, >100 and <100kDa, displayed the same activities as the mammalian enzymes topoisomerases I and II, respectively, and were blocked by the same poisons. We concluded that the wall-less cw15 mutant of C. reinhardtii could advantageously replace mammalian cells in the screening of the anticancer drugs. The alga enzymes could also provide an opportunity to delineate the phylogeny of the topoisomerase superfamily. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Drug discovery and development are hampered by high failure rates attributed to the reliance on non-human animal models employed during safety and efficacy testing. A fundamental problem in this inefficient process is that non-human animal models cannot adequately represent human biology. Thus, there is an urgent need for high-content in vitro systems that can better predict drug-induced toxicity. Systems that predict cardiotoxicity are of uppermost significance, as approximately one third of safety-based pharmaceutical withdrawals are due to cardiotoxicty. Here, we present a cardiac microphysiological system (MPS) with the attributes required for an ideal in vitro system to predict cardiotoxicity: i) cells with a human genetic background; ii) physiologically relevant tissue structure (e.g. aligned cells); iii) computationally predictable perfusion mimicking human vasculature; and, iv) multiple modes of analysis (e.g. biological, electrophysiological, and physiological). Our MPS is able to keep human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiac tissue viable and functional over multiple weeks. Pharmacological studies using the cardiac MPS show half maximal inhibitory/effective concentration values (IC\u2085\u2080/EC\u2085\u2080) that are more consistent with the data on tissue scale references compared to cellular scale studies. We anticipate the widespread adoption of MPSs for drug screening and disease modeling.",

        "title": "Evaluation of a fluorescence-based method for antibabesial drug screening",
        "abstract": "In vitro evaluation of chemotherapeutic agents against Babesia and Theileria parasites has become routine, and the effectiveness of these chemicals is usually determined by comparing the parasitemia dynamics of untreated and treated parasites. Although microscopy is widely used to calculate parasitemia, several disadvantages are associated with this technique. The present study evaluated a fluorescence-based method using SYBR green I stain (SG I) to screen antibabesial agents in in vitro cultures of Babesia bovis. The linearity between relative fluorescence units (RFU) and parasitemia was found to be well correlated with a 0.9944 goodness-of-fit (r(2)) value. Subsequently, 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were calculated for 3 antiprotozoan agents, diminazene aceturate, nimbolide, and gedunin, by this method. For diminazene aceturate and nimbolide, the IC50s determined by the fluorescence-based method (408 nM and 8.13 \u03bcM, respectively) and microscopy (400.3 nM and 9.4 \u03bcM, respectively) were in agreement. Furthermore, the IC50 of gedunin determined by the fluorescence-based method (19 \u03bcM) was similar to the recently described microscopy-based value (21.7 \u03bcM) for B. bovis. Additionally, the Z' factor (0.80 to 0.90), signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio (44.15 to 87.64), coefficient of variation at the maximum signal (%CVmax) (0.50 to 2.85), and coefficient of variation at the minimum signal (%CVmin) (1.23 to 2.21) calculated for the fluorescence method using diminazene aceturate were comparable to those previously determined in malaria research for this assay. These findings suggest that the fluorescence-based method might be useful for antibabesial drug screening and may have potential to be developed into a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay.",

        "abstract": "The ability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to persist in a latent stage in memory T cells in the presence of antiretroviral therapy poses a major obstacle to the development of an HIV-1 therapy with curative intent. As latently infected cells are phenotypically not distinguishable from uninfected cells, therapeutic reactivation of the latent infection, followed by the death of the host cell induced by viral cytopathicity, is considered the only means to eliminate this viral reservoir. To identify compounds with the potential to reactivate latent HIV-1, we have developed a series of latently HIV-1-infected reporter cell lines that allow for high throughput drug screening (HTS) in a 384-well plate-based format. The latent reporter cell lines use enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) as a direct and quantitative marker of HIV-1 expression. To aid identification of specific compounds, the cells are engineered to constitutively express a second, red fluorescent protein that has no spectral overlap with eGFP, which allows for the simultaneous quantification of cell viability (inversely correlated to compound toxicity). Thus, these reporters enable prioritization of compounds most likely to have a favorable therapeutic window. The high dynamic signal range and the excellent reproducibility of the primary screening assay result in a Z' -factor of 0.89, which characterizes the HTS system as very robust. The assay has been implemented for automated drug screening, and we here discuss the advantages and limitations of the HTS system based on the data obtained for 1,600 compounds during a limited proof-of-concept drug screen.",

        "title": "Drug screening versus history in detection of substance use in ED psychiatric patients",
        "abstract": "Because self-reporting of substance use may not be reliable, physicians rely on drug screening. We tested the hypothesis that drug screening alone is sufficient to detect substance use in ED psychiatric patients. We prospectively evaluated patients receiving psychiatric consultation over 6 months ending in April 1998 in an urban medical/psychiatric ED with 42,000 annual visits. After informed consent, patients underwent a structured interview by trained research associates who queried regarding substance use in the past 3 days. This self-report was compared with urine drug screen results for 11 substances of abuse. Standard descriptive statistical techniques were used. Kappa statistics were used to assess concordance between history and drug screens. Two hundred eighteen patients participated, 124 had a urine drug screen obtained. Patients with and without urine drug screens were similar with respect to age (34.9 versus 34.9 years, P = .3) and psychiatric diagnosis (P = .24). Overall, there was only fair concordance between history and drug screens (kappa = 0.46). History alone detected substance use in 70 patients (57%); drug screening alone detected substance use in 77 patients (62%). The combination of history and drug screening more often detected substance use than either alone (90 pts (73%); P < .05 for both comparisons). Depending on the particular drug, there was wide variation in concordance between history and drug screen (kappa's varied from 0.07 for ethanol to 0.79 for cocaine). History was better than drug screening for ethanol use (40 versus 10 patients), and THC (28 versus 15 pts). Drug testing alone was never significantly better than history. Although self-reporting of substance use is not reliable, reliance on drug screening alone is also flawed. Optimal identification of drug use in emergency department psychiatric patients requires both history and drug screening. Copyright ?? 2001 by W.B. Saunders Company.",

        "abstract": "The majority of proteins contain intrinsic fluorophores as natural sensors of molecular structures, dynamics, and interactions. The intrinsic protein fluorescence signal allows for the label-free and, hence, undisturbed and rapid study of protein-ligand interactions. Ultraviolet-based drug screening is hampered by the background, photobleaching, light scattering, inner filter effects, and interfering assay compounds. Such problems can be overcome by means of molecular three-photon excitation (3PE) with infrared femtosecond light pulses since longer excitation wavelengths result in less Raleigh scattering, and the subfemtoliter (confocal-like) 3PE volume minimizes out-of-focus photobleaching, background generation, and inner filter effects. We demonstrate the general feasibility of 3PE for protein spectroscopy and illustrate the technique's excellent potential for high-throughput screening. By using the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of a protein-substrate, we were able to discriminate between ligands of different affinities in binding assays.",

        "abstract": "AIM: Cell culture is highly desirable, as it provides systems for ready, direct access and evaluation of tissues. The use of tissue culture is a valuable tool to study problems of clinical relevance, especially those related to diseases, screening, and studies of cell toxicity mechanisms. Ready access to the cells provides the possibility for easy studies of cellular mechanisms that may suggest new potential drug targets and, in the case of pathological-derived tissue, it has an interesting application in the evaluation of therapeutic agents that potentially may treat the dysfunction. However, special considerations must be addressed to establish stable in vitro function. In primary culture, these factors are primarily linked to greater demands of tissue to adequately survive and develop differentiated conditions in vitro. Additional requirements include the use of special substrates (collagen, laminin, extracellular matrix preparations, etc.), growth factors and soluble media supplements, some of which can be quite complex in their composition. These demands, along with difficulties in obtaining adequate tissue amounts, have prompted interest in developing immortalized cell lines which can provide unlimited tissue amounts. However, cell lines tend to exhibit problems in stability and/or viability, though they serve as a feasible alternative, especially regarding new potential applications in cell transplant therapy. In this regard, stem cells may also be a source for the generation of various cell types in vitro. This review will address aspects of cell culture system application, with focus on immortalized cell lines, in studying cell function and dysfunction with the primary aim being to identify cell targets for drug screening.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey design was implemented. The impact of structured screening protocols on the numbers of neonates screened and positive testing in 2004 was reviewed. RESULTS: Of 81 birthing hospitals, 53 (65%) participated in the study. Screening and positive test rates were higher in hospitals utilizing a structured screening protocol compared to those not utilizing one (10.9 versus 2.1% and 0.9 versus 0.2%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Hospitals with higher population, numbers of outpatients, inpatients, deliveries, and availability of drug abuse treatment services utilized a structured screening protocol more often. CONCLUSION: Utilization of a structured screening protocol increases the number of neonates screened for illicit drugs and positive testing rate regardless of urbanization. Regional standardization of structured screening protocols may improve the recognition of perinatal illicit drug exposure and provision of treatment services.",

Consequently, there is a high demand for new drugs to treat these diseases. This review first provides a brief synopsis of the use of zebrafish model for screening drugs with vision benefits. In particular, visual-motor response, the activity response of larvae to a change in light stimuli, is proposed to serve as a simple and efficient tool for screening drugs that may improve vision in various zebrafish visual mutants. The second part of the review discusses the identification of novel drug candidates, with particular emphasis on naturally derived chemicals including traditional Chinese medicines and nutritional therapies on retinal degenerative diseases. Many of these chemicals have been used in neuroprotection and/or have been consumed by many populations for good health and vision; thus, the screening of these chemicals with various zebrafish visual mutants would expedite the development of novel drugs for treating early-onset eye diseases.",

Because of increasing considerations of earlier stage ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) in drug development, cell-based HTS is highly recommended in modern drug discovery for its ability to detect more biologically relevant characteristics of compounds in living systems.

The hiPS-CMs had spontaneous beating activity, and \u03b2-adrenergic function was comparable in all stages of differentiation. Microelectrode array analyses using ion channel blockers indicated that the electrophysiological properties of these ion channels were comparable at all differentiation stages. Ultrastructural analysis using electron microscopy showed that myofibrillar structures at days 60 and 90 were similarly distributed and more mature than that at day 30. Analysis of motion vectors in contracting cells showed that the velocity of contraction was the highest at day 90 and was the most mature among the three stages. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that expression of some genes related to myofilament and sarcoplasmic reticulum increased with maturation of morphological and contractile properties. In conclusion, day 30 cardiomyocytes are useful for basic screening such as the assessment of electrophysiological properties, and days 60 and 90 are the appropriate differentiation stage for morphological assays. For the assay of contractile function associated with subcellular components such as sarcoplasmic reticulum, day 90 cardiomyocytes are the most suitable.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular toxicity is a leading contributor to drug withdrawal and late-stage attrition. Earlier and broader screening is a validated approach to build-in cardiovascular safety as demonstrated with human Ether-\u00e0-go-go-related gene (hERG) screening to reduce drug-induced arrhythmia. There is an urgent need for novel in vitro assays to address other mechanistic aspects of cardiovascular function, including contractility, heart rate, toxicity, hypertrophy, and non-hERG arrhythmia. Recent advances in label-free cellular impedance technology now enable tracking of spontaneous, synchronized beating of cultured cardiomyocytes. Analysis of beating allows integrated detection that is downstream of electrical and mechanical aspects of contraction. Here, we evaluate impedance-based cardiomyocyte responses against criteria required for drug screening. The throughput and sensitivity allowed for rapid assay development. Critical variables for rat neonatal cardiomyocyte assays included cell density and serum levels. Once optimized, consistent, stable beating for at least 3 days was straight-forward to achieve. In tests of compounds spanning a breadth of target classes, the potency values showed excellent precision, wide dynamic range, and consistency across multiple experiments. Cardiomyocyte impedance assays can extract multiple beat-related parameters. In these experiments, rate, amplitude, and rise slope were examined and each yielded acceptable precision. Potency values calculated by beat rate and amplitude were highly correlated for most compounds although selected compounds displayed unique profiles indicative of different mechanisms. Tests with known cardiovascular active drugs revealed concordance with clinical findings. Thus, impedance assays combine novel features including sensitivity to contractile activity, versatile data analysis, and robust/translatable data in a format with sufficient throughput to become a valuable addition to the cardiovascular in vitro screening arsenal.",

        "abstract": "In computer-aided drug design, software tools are used to narrow down possible drug candidates, thereby reducing the amount of expensive in vitro research, by a process called virtual screening. This process includes large computations that require advanced computing infrastructure; however, using rapidly evolving high-performance computing platforms can be difficult for biochemists. In this paper, we present a science gateway for virtual screening that has been tailored to the specific needs of our local users. The gateway provides user-friendly access to distributed computing infrastructures for high-throughput experiments with a few clicks. Its design is based on the generic layer developed for another gateway for neuroimaging data analysis, including data and computation management, as well as support for its operation. To facilitate scalability, the system architecture allows for adding new computing platforms to the back-end without affecting the front-end, from which the user can dynamically choose the preferred infrastructure. This paper describes the user-centered design process, the system architecture and a performance assessment using gLite grid, Hadoop, and a local cluster.

Convenient methods to assess the efficacy of potentially therapeutic reagents for GPCRs are strongly required for high-throughput screening (HTS) assay. We recently developed a rapid, sensitive, and quantitative method for detecting potential chemicals that act on GPCRs using split luciferase complementation. In principle, this is based on the detection of interactions of GPCR with beta-arrestin, which translocates to the activated GPCRs. This method can facilitate the construction of HTS systems in a multi-well plate format. Particularly, the method is compatible with single-cell imaging and animal models and even deeper tissues such as organs, because of its high sensitivity, suggesting that promising candidates from HTS assay can be moved easily to the next phase for additional analysis. This system can contribute to the effective evaluation of potentially therapeutic reagents and expedite the development of new drugs for GPCRs.",

        "abstract": "Although the idea of homogeneous electrochemical immunoassay using antibody and an electroactive modified antigen as a probe looks to be very useful for high-throughput drug screening, there have been few reports. One reason for this is the difficulty experienced making an electroactive probe, because the introduction of electroactive compounds to antigens often interferes with the antigen-antibody interaction. To apply a homogeneous electrochemical assay to drug screening, we have designed new probes referring to the information of immobilization on beads which could identify the drug receptor. FK506 (also called Tacrolimus), immunosuppressive agent is modified with ferrocene derivatives as an electron mediator between glucose oxidase and an electrode, at a non-obstructing part. One of the probes still indicated the electrochemical activity as a mediator and had the specific binding capability for FKBP12 (FK506 binding protein). The current decrease in response to the additional FKBP12, detected with constant voltage amperometry using the probe, was observed within 5 min. Then, free FK506 as a leader drug, rapamycin and cyclosporine A as unknown drugs were used as a model for drug screening. Since the order of response currents at the same concentration of each drug reflected their binding constants, it was shown that binding capacity of an unknown drug candidate could be estimated by comparison of response currents between the leader drug and the unknown drug candidate. Thus, this glucose oxidase assisted homogeneous electrochemical drug-receptor binding assay has been proved to be a useful tool for drug screening. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Identification of HIV-1 transcription inhibitors was previously performed using infectivity assays. As de novo HIV-1 infection is highly sensitive to even minor compound toxicities, these assays are plagued by extremely high levels of false-positive hits. Hit identification is further complicated because infectivity assays lack target specificity. The authors demonstrate that it is possible to overcome these limitations by establishing a stable, chronically actively HIV-1-infected reporter cell line that exclusively identifies HIV-1 transcription inhibitors. In the reporter cell line, 2 spectrally separated fluorescence proteins serve as simultaneously accessible quantitative markers of HIV-1 expression and drug toxicity. The combined analysis of these markers drastically reduces the level of false-positive hits. As determination of fluorescence intensity in a plate-based format can be performed in a noninvasive manner, repeated measurements of fluorescence levels over several days after compound addition can be used to define the kinetic and dynamic characteristics of inhibitory drug effects. In addition, because of the stable nature of the reporter cell line, the assay requires no cell manipulation during assay preparation or assay analysis, rendering the system extremely cost-effective and reliable.",

        "abstract": "New drug development requires simple in vitro models that resemble the in vivo situation more in order to select active drugs against solid tumours and to decrease the use of experimental animals. In this paper, we review the characteristics and scope of a relatively simple cell-culture system with a three-dimensional organisation pattern - the multilayered postconfluent cell culture model. Solid tumour cell lines from diverse origins when grown in V-bottomed microtiter plates reach confluence in 3-5 days and then start to form multilayers. The initial exponential growth of the culture is followed by a plateau phase when cells reach confluence. This produces changes in the morphology of the cells. For some cell lines, it is possible to observe cell differentiation. A substantial advantage of the system is the use of the sulforodamine B (SRB) assay to determine relative cell growth or viability, which allows semiautomation of the experiments. Several experiments were performed to assess the differences and similarities between cells cultured as monolayers and multilayers, and eventually, compared with the results for solid tumours and some other models such as spheroids. Cell-cycle analysis for multilayers showed a lower S-phase arrest, which is accompanied by a decrease in the expression of cell-cycle-related proteins and a decrease in cellular nucleotide pools. Gene and protein expression of topoisomerase I, topoisomerase II and thymidylate synthase expression were lower for multilayers, but no substantial changes were observed for the expression of DT-diaphorase. P53 expression increased. Multilayer cultures present distinctive properties for drug transport across the membrane, drug accumulation and retention. In fact, the transport of antifolates across the membrane, accumulation of topotecan and gemcitabine-triphosphate are reduced in multilayers when compared with monolayers, which may be related to a decrease in drug penetration to the inner regions of the multilayers. Alteration of these pharmacodynamic parameters is directly related to a decrease in drug activity. The most powerful application of multilayers is in the assessment of cytotoxicity. Solid tumour cell lines from different origins have been treated with several conventional and investigational anticancer drugs. The data show that multilayers are more resistant to the drugs than the corresponding monolayers, but there are substantial differences between the drugs depending on culture conditions, e.g. the difference was rather small for a drug such as cisplatin, miltefosine and EO9, a drug, which is activated under hypoxic conditions. Gemcitabine was active against ovarian cancer but not against colon cancer, resembling the in vivo situation. This observation was not evident with monolayer experiments. Another interesting application is the possibility to perform drug combination studies. The combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin proved to produce selective cell kill in H322 cells (non-small cell lung cancer cell line). Neither of the drugs was independently able to produce similar effects. In summary, multilayer cultures are relatively simple three-dimensional systems to study the effect of microenvironmental conditions on anticancer drug activity. The model might serve as a base for a more rigorous secondary in vitro screening.",

Encapsulation in an alginate shell increased the time that cells could be maintained in three-dimensional culture for MCF-7 breast cancer cells prior to out-of-bead proliferation, permitting formation of spheroids over a period of 14 days without the need move the cell-laden beads to clean culture flasks to separate beads from underlying monolayers. Tamoxifen and docetaxel dose response shows decreased toxicity for multicellular aggregates in three-dimensional core-shell bead culture compared to monolayer. Using simple core-only beads gives mixed monolayer and 3-D culture during drug screening, and alters the treatment result compared to the 3-D core-shell or the 2-D monolayer groups, as measured by standard proliferation assay. By preventing the out-of-bead proliferation and subsequent monolayer formation that is observed with core-only beads, the core-shell structure can obviate the requirement to transfer the beads to a new culture flask during drug screening, an important consideration for cell-based drug screening and drugs which have high multicellular resistance index.",

        "abstract": "Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are present in key proteins involved in many vital cell processes. For example, the PH domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) binds to phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP(3)) in the plasma membrane after stimulation of the B-cell receptor in B cells. Mutations in the Btk PH domain result in changes in its affinity for PIP(3), with higher binding leading to cell transformation in vitro and lower binding leading to antibody deficiencies in both humans and mice. We describe here a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biochemical assay that directly monitors the interaction of a PH domain with PIP(3) at a membrane surface. We overexpressed a fusion protein consisting of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the N-terminal 170 amino acids of a Tec family kinase that contains its PH domain (PH170). Homogeneous unilamellar vesicles were made that contained PIP(3) and octadecylrhodamine (OR), a lipophilic FRET acceptor for GFP. After optimization of both protein and vesicle components, we found that binding of the GFP-PH170 protein to PIP3 in vesicles that contain OR results in about a 90% reduction of GFP fluorescence. Using this assay to screen 1440 compounds, we identified three that efficiently inhibited binding of GFP-PH170 to PIP(3) in vesicles. This biochemical assay readily miniaturized to 1.8-microl reaction volumes and was validated in a 3456-well screening format.",

For example, animal models have shortcomings of species differences and long test periods; in addition, poor mimics of in vivo microenvironment results in the low accuracy of cell-based high-throughput drug screening assays. The 3D cell printing technology may provide solutions of establishing biomimetic tissue models in vitro. Moreover, the combination of 3D cell printing and cell chip provides a highly valuable tool for the efficient and accurate drug screening in vitro. In this study, a cell chip integrating several groups of IDEs, was designed and manufactured. Then, the HMSC-H and HO-8910 cell lines were assembled within the gelatin/alginate mixture on the manufactured chip using 3D cell printing. The IDEs was used to detect changes in the cell impedance which reflects the cell growth, adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis and effects of drugs on the viability. Based on this cells-loaded chip, the antitumor effect or hepatoxicity of both CTX and DDP were measured respectively. Our results showed that the 3D structure could suppot the growth of HMSC-H or HO-8910 cells. The scaffold possessed pores with diameter of 200 -300 \u03bcm. The change of impedance caused by the cell proliferation was precisely detected by the chip at 104 Hz using DMEM as electrolyte solution, 20 h later, the cell impedance increased by 69.6%. Using this chip-based in vitro drug screening model, we simultaneously detected the antitumor effect and hepatotoxicity of the drugs. Meanwhile, the efficacy of these drugs, which require hepatic metabolism for activation such as CTX, was also evaluated in the same chip.",

In this report, the genome rearranged strategy was extended to A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1), and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) or GFP was expressed downstream of the full-length NS1 gene (designated GLucCa04 and GFPCa04, respectively). In growth kinetics studies, culture of amantadine sensitive GLucCa04 (Sens/GlucCa04) in the presence of amantadine significantly decreased GLuc expression and viral titers for 48. h post-infection (hpi). When Sens/GlucCa04 was subsequently used in an in vitro anti-viral screening assay, amantadine treatment significantly decreased GLuc expression from amantadine sensitive compared to amantadine resistant GLucCa04 (Res/GlucCa04) as early as 16 hpi. In in vivo screening studies, DBA mice were treated daily with amantadine from 1 day prior to infection and inoculated with either Sens/GlucCa04 or Res/GlucCa04 alone or as a co-infection with the parental strain. On days 3 and 5 post-infection, lung samples were collected and amantadine treatment was shown to decrease GLuc expression by two orders of magnitude (p < 0.05) in Sens/GlucCa04 infected mice. Furthermore, while both Sens and Res/GlucCa04 were highly attenuated, addition of the parental strain to the inoculum yielded clinical disease indicative of GLuc expression and pulmonary viral titers. These findings indicate that the use of GLucCa04 can potentially accelerate in vitro and in vivo anti-viral screening by shortening the time required for virus detection. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

Samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction with ethylacetate/heptane (4:1). LC-separation was achieved with an Atlantis dC18-column (2.1 x 50 mm, 3 microm particle). Mass detection was performed by positive ion mode electrospray LC-MS/MS and included the following drugs/metabolites: morphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, codeine, buprenorphine, methadone, amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine, cocaine, benzoylecgonine, Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, lysergic acid diethylamide, alprazolam, bromazepam, clonazepam, 7-aminoclonazepam, diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, 3-OH-diazepam, fenazepam, flunitrazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, 7-aminonitrazepam, oxazepam, zopiclone, zolpidem, carisoprodol, and meprobamat.\\n\\nRESULTS: Screening of 32 drugs was performed with a run time of 14 min. Within- and between-day relative CVs varied from 2.0% to 31.8% and from 3.6% to 39.1%, respectively. Extraction recoveries were >50% except for morphine (30%) and benzoylecgonine (0.2%). The concentrations of the lowest calibrator were 1 nmol/L (0.28 microg/L) to 500 nmol/L (68 microg/L), depending on the drug.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The method allowed rapid and sensitive oral fluid screening for the most commonly abused drugs in Norway and will be used for a road-side survey of drug use in normal traffic.",

A side-by-side comparison of this fluorescence assay and a standard radioisotopic method was performed by testing known antimalarial agents against Plasmodium falciparum strain D6. Both assay methods were used to determine the effective concentration of drug that resulted in a 50% reduction in the observed counts (EC(50)) after 48 h of parasite growth in the presence of each drug. The EC(50)s of chloroquine, quinine, mefloquine, artemisinin, and 3,6-bis-epsilon-(N,N-diethylamino)-amyloxyxanthone were similar or identical by both techniques.

Although increasing numbers of disease-specific iPSCs have been generated, there has been limited progress in iPSC-based drug screening/discovery for liver diseases, and the low gene-targeting efficiency in human iPSCs warrants further improvement. Using iPSC lines from patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, for which there is currently no drug or gene therapy available, we established a platform to discover new drug candidates and correct disease-causing mutation with a high efficiency. A high-throughput format screening assay, based on our hepatic differentiation protocol, was implemented to facilitate automated quantification of cellular AAT accumulation using a 96-well immunofluorescence reader. To expedite the eventual application of lead compounds to patients, we conducted drug screening utilizing our established library of clinical compounds (the Johns Hopkins Drug Library) with extensive safety profiles. Through a blind large-scale drug screening, five clinical drugs were identified to reduce AAT accumulation in diverse patient iPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells. In addition, using the recently developed transcription activator-like effector nuclease technology, we achieved high gene-targeting efficiency in AAT-deficiency patient iPSCs with 25%-33% of the clones demonstrating simultaneous targeting at both diseased alleles. The hepatocyte-like cells derived from the gene-corrected iPSCs were functional without the mutant AAT accumulation. This highly efficient and cost-effective targeting technology will broadly benefit both basic and translational applications.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated the feasibility of effective large-scale drug screening using an iPSC-based disease model and highly robust gene targeting in human iPSCs, both of which are critical for translating the iPSC technology into novel therapies for untreatable diseases.",

Using these dystrophin-null zebrafish, we have screened the Prestwick chemical library for small molecules that modulate the muscle phenotype in these fish. With a quick and easy birefringence assay, we have identified seven small molecules that influence muscle pathology in dystrophin-null zebrafish without restoration of dystrophin expression. Three of seven candidate chemicals restored normal birefringence and increased survival of dystrophin-null fish. One chemical, aminophylline, which is known to be a nonselective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, had the greatest ability to restore normal muscle structure and up-regulate the cAMP-dependent PKA pathway in treated dystrophin-deficient fish. Moreover, other PDE inhibitors also reduced the percentage of affected sapje fish. The identification of compounds, especially PDE inhibitors, that moderate the muscle phenotype in these dystrophin-null zebrafish validates the screening protocol described here and may lead to candidate molecules to be used as therapeutic interventions in human muscular dystrophy.",

The study aimed to develop an assay with the parasitic adult stage of this species that could be used in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, the free-living larval stage screens commonly used for drug discovery with many parasitic nematode species. The feeding assay showed limitations due to the apparent continuation of a significant degree of feeding in worms showing greatly reduced motility in the presence of some drugs. Hence, it appeared most likely that the feeding assay would underestimate the toxicity of these drugs. The motility assay was able to detect toxicity of known anthelmintics, including the 'slow-acting' benzimidazoles. A small-scale screening exercise used the motility assay to detect toxicity towards adult parasites in 10 compounds out of a group of 200 chemicals (selected due to known toxic effects in larval development assays). The motility assay appeared suitable for drug screening against adult H. contortus. The use of the adult stage for drug screening in this way ensures that the drug is toxic towards the parasite life stage to be targeted in vivo. A lack of activity in subsequent in vivo trials could, therefore, be most likely attributable to host pharmacokinetic factors rather than an intrinsic lack of activity of the drug towards the adult parasite.

In the article, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates with different stiffness (mimicking articular cartilage, collagenous bone and mammary tumor respectively) and plastic substrate were employed to establish the mechanical microenvironment for the in vitro drug screening platform. We studied the influences of stiffness on the responses of MCF-7 cells to typical antitumor drugs, cisplatin and taxol. Results showed that for both the treatment IC50 value to MCF-7 cells decreased significantly (p < 0.01) on the rigid substrate, indicating that MCF-7 cells on soft substrate have a resistance to cytotoxicity of antitumor drugs. The sensitivity of MCF-7 cells on rigid substrate to drug cytotoxicity was attributed to the increased cell cycle progression, implying that agents proven to be effective in vitro by conventional screening approach might be inefficient in a soft microenvironment in vivo. We conclude that stiffness of the substrates, as a critical mechanical factor, should be concerned for screening antitumor agents in vitro. As an extrapolation, the extensively used drug screening system needs to be revalued and redesigned.",

We have shown recently that long-lived states (LLS) can be more sensitive to ligand binding. LLS can be excited if the ligand comprises at least two coupled spins. Herein we broaden the scope of ligand screening by LLS to arbitrary ligands by covalent attachment of a functional group, which comprises a pair of coupled protons that are isolated from neighboring magnetic nuclei. The resulting functionalized ligands have longitudinal relaxation times T1 ((1) H) that are sufficiently long to allow the powerful combination of LLS with dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (D-DNP). Hyperpolarized weak \"spy ligands\" can be displaced by high-affinity competitors. Hyperpolarized LLS allow one to decrease both protein and ligand concentrations to micromolar levels and to significantly increase sample throughput.",

Using these dystrophin-null zebrafish, we have screened the Prestwick chemical library for small molecules that modulate the muscle phenotype in these fish. With a quick and easy birefringence assay, we have identified seven small molecules that influence muscle pathology in dystrophin-null zebrafish without restoration of dystrophin expression. Three of seven candidate chemicals restored normal birefringence and increased survival of dystrophin-null fish. One chemical, aminophylline, which is known to be a nonselective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, had the greatest ability to restore normal muscle structure and up-regulate the cAMP-dependent PKA pathway in treated dystrophin-deficient fish. Moreover, other PDE inhibitors also reduced the percentage of affected sapje fish. The identification of compounds, especially PDE inhibitors, that moderate the muscle phenotype in these dystrophin-null zebrafish validates the screening protocol described here and may lead to candidate molecules to be used as therapeutic interventions in human muscular dystrophy.",

        "abstract": "Discovery of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in 2006 provided a new path for cell transplantation and drug screening. The iPS cells are stem cells derived from somatic cells that have been genetically reprogrammed into a pluripotent state. Similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells, iPS cells are capable of differentiating into three germ layers, eliminating some of the hurdles in ES cell technology. Further progress and advances in iPS cell technology, from viral to non-viral systems and from integrating to non-integrating approaches of foreign genes into the host genome, have enhanced the existing technology, making it more feasible for clinical applications. In particular, advances in iPS cell technology should enable autologous transplantation and more efficient drug discovery. Cell transplantation may lead to improved treatments for various diseases, including neurological, endocrine, and hepatic diseases. In studies on drug discovery, iPS cells generated from patient-derived somatic cells could be differentiated into specific cells expressing specific phenotypes, which could then be used as disease models. Thus, iPS cells can be helpful in understanding the mechanisms of disease progression and in cell-based efficient drug screening. Here, we summarize the history and progress of iPS cell technology, provide support for the growing interest in iPS cell applications with emphasis on practical uses in cell-based drug screening, and discuss some challenges faced in the use of this technology.",

As a result, it would be beneficial to have a platform to produce them in a high-throughput format for drug screening. We have developed a miniaturized fluid array device for cell-free protein synthesis, and the device was exploited to produce both soluble and membrane proteins. Two membrane-associated proteins, bacteriorhodopsin and ApoA lipoprotein, were coexpressed in an expression medium in the presence of lipids. Simultaneous expression of ApoA lipoprotein enhanced the solubility of bacteriorhodopsin and would facilitate functional studies. In addition, the device was employed to produce two enzymes, luciferase and beta-lactamase, both of which were demonstrated to be compatible with enzyme inhibition assays. Beta-lactamase, a drug target associated with antibiotic resistance, was further used to show the capability of the device for drug screening. Beta-lactamase was synthesized in the 96 units of the device and then assayed by a range of concentrations of four mock drug compounds without harvesting and purification. The inhibitory effects of these compounds on beta-lactamase were measured in a parallel format, and the degree in their drug effectiveness agreed well with the data in the literature. This work demonstrated the feasibility of the use of the fluid array device and cell-free protein expression for drug screening, with advantages in less reagent consumption, shorter analysis time, and higher throughput.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess requesting patterns and clinical utility of urine drug screens (UDS). METHODS: All UDS requests received between March 2002 and October 2002 were identified. Two trained assessors reviewed case histories and categorized the utility of the UDS and gave a utility score using a Visual Analogue Scale. RESULTS: Of 171 UDS requested, 67.3% were men. Age range was 15-92 (mean 36) years. In total, 70.8% were received from accident and emergency centre (AEC). Clinical utility was identified in only 85 of 171 UDS. Sixty-one per cent of requests from AEC were defined as having no clinical utility. Twenty-four per cent of requests originating from other specialities were identified as having no clinical utility. Overall, a test was more likely to be of utility if it was requested from non-AEC than from AEC (Pearson's chi(2) two-sided t-test, P < 0.0001). Indications for UDS were toxic ingestion (33.3%), psychosis (15.2%), impaired consciousness (13.5%), behavioural disturbance (4.1%), confusion with HIV infection (3.5%), alleged adulteration (3.5%), seizure (9.4%), cardiac arrest (1.8%) and miscellaneous (15.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show excessive requesting for UDS in routine overdose, contrary to international guidelines. Requests for UDS originating from AEC are more likely to have no utility than those from other specialities. Availability of point of care UDS might increase use of UDS, but cost-effectiveness and utility must be assessed.",

Increased levels of GFAP are the hallmark feature of gliosis, a non-specific response of astrocytes to a wide variety of injuries and disorders of the CNS, and also occur in Alexander disease where the initial insult is a mutation within the coding region of GFAP itself. In both settings, excess GFAP may cause or exacerbate astrocyte dysfunction. With the goal of finding drugs that reduce the expression of GFAP, we have devised screens to detect changes in GFAP promoter activity or protein levels in primary cultures of mouse astrocytes in a 96-well format. We have applied these screens to libraries enriched in compounds that are already approved for human use by the FDA. We report that several compounds are active at micromolar levels in suppressing the expression of GFAP.

Phenotype and pharmacology have been examined in only 17 of 63 lines, primarily those that model neurological and cardiac conditions. Drug screening is most advanced in hPSC-cardiomyocytes. Responses for almost 60 agents include examples of how careful tests in hPSC-cardiomyocytes have improved on existing in vitro assays, and how these cells have been integrated into high throughput imaging and electrophysiology industrial platforms.

To improve cost effectiveness, and to minimize animal testing in pharmaceutical research, in vitro monolayer cell microarrays with multiwell plate assays have been developed. Integration of cell microarrays with microfluidic systems has facilitated automated and controlled component loading, significantly reducing the consumption of the candidate compounds and the target cells. Even though these methods significantly increased the throughput compared to conventional in vitro testing systems and in vivo animal models, the cost associated with these platforms remains prohibitively high. Besides, there is a need for three-dimensional (3D) cell-based drug-screening models which can mimic the in vivo microenvironment and the functionality of the native tissues.

The simplicity, specificity and rapidity of its antimicrobial response have accorded the horseshoe crab as an excellent animal model from which immune responsive tissues may be procured for biomedical research. Such usefulness is exemplified by the extensive application for nearly four decades, of the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) for sensitive detection of endotoxin in the medical industry. Apart from the amebocytes, the cell-free hemolymph (CFH) of this arthropod offers a large repertoire of evolutionarily conserved proteins, which are highly sensitive to pathogens. This makes the hemolymph an ideal physiological microenvironment for simulating an in vitro infection. We therefore propose to employ the CFH as a quick and convenient tool for antimicrobial drug screening in vitro. This specific drug screening system also provides further optimization of drug design, and selection of drugs with antioxidant properties. Being an easily accessible natural resource, and allowing high-throughput screening with uniform and reliable data output, the horseshoe crab CFH provides a desirable physiological milieu for drug screening and development.",

In this work, we propose a fluorimetric method for drug screening using red fluorescent parasites. Fluorescent Leishmania amazonensis were developed after transfection with integration plasmids containing either red (RFP) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) genes. After transfection, wild-type (LaWT) and transfected (LaGFP and LaRFP) parasites were subjected to flow cytometry, macrophage infection, and tests of susceptibility to current antileishmanial agents and propranolol derivatives previously shown to be active against Trypanosoma cruzi. Flow cytometry analysis discriminated LaWT from LaRFP and LaGFP parasites, without affecting cell size or granulosity. With microscopy, transfection with antibiotic resistant genes was not shown to affect macrophage infectivity and susceptibility to amphotericin B and propranolol derivatives. Retention of fluorescence remained in the intracellular amastigotes in both LaGFP and LaRFP transfectants. However, detection of intracellular RFP parasites was only achieved in the fluorimeter. Murine BALB/c macrophages were infected with LaRFP parasites, exposed to standard (meglumine antimoniate, amphotericin B, Miltefosine, and allopurinol) and tested molecules. Although it was possible to determine IC50 values for 4 propranolol derivatives (1, 2b, 3, and 4b), all compounds were considered inactive. This study is the first to develop a fluorimetric drug screening test for L. amazonensis RFP. The fluorimetric test was comparable to microscopy with the advantage of being faster and not requiring manual counting. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

We present 3D inverted colloidal crystals made of hydrogel as a realistic cell migration assay, where the geometry and stiffness can be set independently to mimic the tissue requirements in question. We show the utility of this 3D assay for drug screening purposes, specifically in contrast to conventional 2D migration studies, by surveying the effects of commonly used cytoskeletal toxins that impact cell mechanics. This assay allows studying large cell numbers for good statistics but at single-cell resolution.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Resistance and partial responses to targeted monotherapy are major obstacles in cancer treatment. Systematic approaches to identify efficacious drug combinations for cancer are not well established, especially in the context of genotype. To address this, we have tested pairwise combinations of an array of small-molecule inhibitors on early-passage melanoma cultures using combinatorial drug screening. Results reveal several inhibitor combinations effective for melanomas with activating RAS or BRAF mutations, including mutant BRAF melanomas with intrinsic or acquired resistance to vemurafenib. Inhibition of both EGF receptor and AKT sensitized treatment-resistant BRAF mutant melanoma cultures to vemurafenib. Melanomas with RAS mutations were more resistant to combination therapies relative to BRAF mutants, but were sensitive to combinations of statins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. These results show the use of combinatorial drug screening for discovering unique treatment regimens that overcome resistance phenotypes of mutant BRAF- and RAS-driven melanomas. SIGNIFICANCE: We have used drug combinatorial screening to identify effective combinations for mutant BRAF melanomas, including those resistant to vemurafenib, and mutant RAS melanomas that are resistant to many therapies. Mechanisms governing the interactions of the drug combinations are proposed, and in vivo xenografts show the enhanced benefit and tolerability of a mutant RAS -selective combination, which is currently lacking in the clinic.",

If some active compounds are known, the screening results that rank these active compounds at the top should be reliable. If no active compound is known, how to select the result is in question. We propose a concept of a set of \"universal active probes\" (UAPs), which is a set of small active compounds that bind to different kinds of proteins. We found that the hit ratio of the true active compounds in in silico screening shows positive correlation to that of the UAPs, probably because UAPs form a set of drug-like compounds. Thus, if the UAPs were added to the compound library, the screening result that shows a high hit ratio of the UAPs could give reliable actual hit compounds for the target protein. We examined this method for several targets and found this idea useful.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new microfluidic platform for screening drugs and their dose response on the locomotion behavior of free living nematodes and parasitic nematodes. The system offers a higher sensitivity drug screening chip which employs a combination of existing and newly developed methods. Real-time observation of the entire drug application process (i.e. the innate pre-exposure locomotion, the transient response during drug exposure and the time-resolved, post-exposure behavior) at a single worm resolution is made possible. The chip enables the monitoring of four nematode parameters (number of worms responsive, number of worms leaving the drug well, average worm velocity and time until unresponsiveness). Each parameter generates an inherently different dose response; allowing for a higher resolution when screening for resistance. We expect this worm chip could be used as a robust cross species, cross drug platform. Existing nematode motility and migration assays do not offer this level of sophistication. The device comprises two principal components: behavioral microchannels to study nematode motility and a drug well for administering the dose and observing drug effects as a function of exposure time. The drug screening experiment can be described by three main steps: (i) 'pre-exposure study'- worms are inserted into the behavioral channels and their locomotion is characterized, (ii) 'dose exposure'- worms are guided from the behavioral microchannels into the drug well and held for a predefined time, during which time their transient response to the dose is characterized and (iii) 'post-exposure study'- worms are guided back into the behavioral microchannels where their locomotion (i.e. their time-resolved response to the dose) is characterized and compared to pre-exposure motility. The direction of nematodes' movement is reliably controlled by the application of an electric field within a defined range. Control experiments (e.g. in the absence of any drug) confirm that the applied electric fields do not affect the worms' motility or viability. We demonstrate the workability of the microfluidic platform on free living Caenorhabditis elegans (wild-type N2 and levamisole resistant ZZ15 lev-8) and parasitic Oesophagotomum dentatum (levamisole-sensitive, SENS and levamisole-resistant, LEVR) using levamisole (a well-studied anthelmintic) as the test drug. The proposed scheme of drug screening on a microfluidic device is expected to significantly improve the resolution, sensitivity and data throughput of in vivo testing, while offering new details on the transient and time-resolved exposure effects of new and existing anthelmintics.",

        "abstract": "PubChem is a scientific showcase of the NIH Roadmap Initiatives. It is a compound repository created to facilitate information exchange and data sharing among the NIH Roadmap-funded Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN) and the scientific community. However, PubChem has more than 10 million records of compound information. It will be challenging to conduct a drug screening of the whole database of millions of compounds. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to develop a data mining cheminformatics approach in order to construct a representative and structure-diverse sublibrary from the large PubChem database. In this study, a new chemical diverse representative subset, rePubChem, was selected by whole-molecule chemistry-space matrix calculation using the cell-based partition algorithm. The representative subset was generated and was then subjected to evaluations by compound property analyses based on 1D and 2D molecular descriptors. The new subset was also examined and assessed for self-similarity analysis based on 2D molecular fingerprints in comparing with the source compound library. The new subset has a much smaller library size (540K compounds) with minimum similarity and redundancy without loss of the structural diversity and basic molecular properties of its parent library (5.3 million compounds). The new representative subset library generated could be a valuable structure-diverse compound resource for in silico virtual screening and in vitro HTS drug screening. In addition, the established subset generation method of using the combined cell-based chemistry-space partition metrics with pairwised 2D fingerprint-based similarity search approaches will also be important to a broad scientific community interested in acquiring structurally diverse compounds for efficient drug screening, building representative virtual combinatorial chemistry libraries for syntheses, and data mining large compound databases like the PubChem library in general.",

        "abstract": "Multicellular spheroid models have been recognized as superior to monolayer cell cultures in antitumor drug screening, but their commercial adaptation in the pharmaceutical industry has been delayed, primarily due to technological limitations. The current study presents a new spheroid culture platform that addresses these technical restrictions. The new culturing device is based on a multiwell plate equipped with a glass bottom patterned with an array of UV adhesive microchambers. Each microchamber is designed to accommodate a single spheroid. The system facilitates the simultaneous creation and culturing of a large number of spheroids, as well as screening their response to antitumor drugs. The volume of the spheroids is easily controlled by seeding density. The location of each spheroid is preserved in the same microchamber throughout its growth, treatment with soluble agents, and imaging. The growth ratio parameter, a non-intrusive size analysis of the same spheroid before and after exposure to drugs, was found to be a sensitive indicator for the reaction of MCF7 breast cancer spheroids to cytotoxic drugs. This feature helps reveal the heterogeneity within the spheroid population during the formation process and their drug response, and provides an opportunity to detect specific, highly active or drug-resistant spheroid sub-groups. The advantages of this spheroid-based system make it an efficient drug-screening tool that may be valuable to related fields of research and clinical applications. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

For example, the human immortalized cell lines or animal primary cells commonly used in traditional drug screening may not faithfully recapitulate the pathological mechanisms of human diseases, leading to biases in assays, targets, or compounds that do not effectively address disease mechanisms. Recent advances in stem cell research, especially in the development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, provide a new paradigm for drug screening by permitting the use of human cells with the same genetic makeup as the patients without the typical quantity constraints associated with patient primary cells. In this article, we will review the progress made to date on cellular disease models using human stem cells, with a focus on patient-specific iPSCs for neurological diseases. We will discuss the key challenges and the factors that associated with the success of using stem cell models for drug discovery through examples from monogenic diseases, diseases with various known genetic components, and complex diseases caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and other factors.",

This study was designed to characterize the sensitivity and specificity of three LC-MS(/MS) vendor-supplied methods for targeted CDS and identify the current limitations associated with the use of these technologies. Methods: Five methods for broad spectrum CDS, including LC-UV (REMEDi), full scan GC-MS, LC-MS (ZQ???-Mass Detector with MassLynx???-software), LC-QTRAP-MS/MS (3200-QTRAP?? with Cliquid??-software) and LC-LIT-MS/MS (LXQ??? Linear Ion Trap with ToxID???-software) were evaluated based on their ability to detect drugs in 48 patient urine samples. Results: The tandem MS methods identified 15% more drugs than the single stage MS or LC-UV methods. Use of two broad spectrum screening methods identified more drugs than any single system alone. False negatives and false positives generated by the LC-MS(/MS) software programs were identified upon manual review of the raw data. Conclusions: The LC-MS/MS methods detected a broader menu of drugs; however, it is essential to establish manual data review criteria for all LC-MS(/MS) drug screening methods. Use of an EI-GC-MS and ESI-LC-MS/MS combination for targeted CDS may be optimal due to the complementary nature of the chromatographic and ionization techniques. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

In this study, the elastmeric material, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), was employed to fabricate microchannels and microchambers. The microchip consists of two sections: a histamine-releasing one, which has a cell chamber, and a histamine-derivatizing one. Both were laminated to one microchip. Rat peritoneal mast cells were retained in the cell chamber (1.2 microL) with a filtering system using a cellulose nitrate membrane. This filtering system could easily retain suspension cells without cell damage. Mast cells were viable for a sufficient time to conduct the assay on the cell chamber. The cells were stimulated with a chemical release compound 48/80 (C48/80), and then histamine flowed into the lower layer, where it was derivatized to the fluorescent molecules with o-phthalaldehyde and its fluorescence was detected on the microchip. This flow system could detect the time course of the histamine release, and this microchip system required only 20 min for the assay. By this integrated system, 51 pmol of histamine released from 500 cells was detected, and the number of cells required for the assay was reduced to 1% compared with conventional bulk systems. By comparing the released histamine levels with and without drugs, their effect could be evaluated. The inhibition ratio of C48/80 induced-histamine release using an antiallergic drug, disodium cromoglicate (DSCG), was related to the concentration of DSCG. This flow system was applicable for antiallergy drug screening by rapid measurement of the inhibition of histamine release from a very small amount of mast cells.",

For non-targeted screening by UPLC-MS electrospray interface, in-source fragmentation was used along with MS scanning (m/z 80-650) and library search for over 700 drug and metabolite analytes. Targeted detection of over 200 analytes by UPLC-MS-MS was performed with dual transition ion monitoring. Validation studies confirmed reproducibility of both mass spectra produced by in-source fragmentation and transition ion ratios by collision-cell dissociation. Lower limit of detection by UPLC-MS (10-150 ng/mL) and UPLC-MS-MS (1-50 ng/mL) was determined for a subset of drugs and correlated with extraction recovery and matrix effect. Drug findings by UPLC-MS and UPLC- MS-MS were compared with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) screening in postmortem blood from 410 medical examiner cases with 1121 positive drug findings by all methods. Accuracy, based on results of confirmation testing, was high (98-99%) across all screening assays and detection sensitivity by GC-MS (71%), UPLC-MS (73%), and UPLC-MS-MS (76%) was determined. UPLC-MS plus UPLC-MS-MS screening resulted in the highest drug detection rate (95%) and provided optimal dual-screening for the postmortem casework.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish a drug screening system based on transcriptional regulation of microsomal PGE(2) synthase 1 (mPGES-1), cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and 2 (COX-2) for discovering selective down-regulators of mPGES-1. METHODS: The upstream regulatory sequences of mPGES-1, COX-1, COX-2 were respectively cloned into pGL3B-neo vector containing luciferase gene and neomycin resistance gene (the pGL3B-neo vector had been previously constructed by cloning the neomycin resistance gene into the Sal I site of the pGL3-Basic vector). After that, the recombinant reporter gene vectors pGL3B-neo/mPGES-1, pGL3B-neo/COX-1, pGL3B-neo/COX-2 were respectively transfected into A549 cells and therefore stable cell lines, namely M 1, M 2 and M 3, were obtained. Samples were detected then by testing luciferase activity of M 1, M 2 and M 3 cells in microtiter wells to identify compounds that can selectively down-regulate mPGES-1 expression. Through luciferase activity testing, the compounds which had more than 40 % inhibition ratio on M 1 and less than 20 % inhibition ratio on M 2 and M 3 cells could be regarded as hits. RESULTS: Using the cell-based reporter gene assay, we screened compounds for selectively down-regulation of mPGES-1 expression and several compounds were discovered. CONCLUSION: A cell-based drug screening system was established to screen selective down-regulators of mPGES-1 expression, and compound CM188 was identified, which might become a lead compound for novel anti-arthritic drugs.",

        "abstract": "Stem cell therapy is one of the most promising treatments in neuroregenerative medicine. Considering the role of the endogenous opioid system in controlling the pathophysiology of neurological disorders and behavioral aberrations, current studies have focused on enkephalins as a part of the opioid system. Due to high capability of unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) for cell therapy and transplantation; here, we examined their enkephalinergic differentiation potential through Ikaros-related pathways in order to develop in vitro models to help drug screening and stem cell therapy for the opioid-related disorders. The authenticity of the stem cells was verified by differentiation experiments along with flow cytometry for surface markers. Later, we confirmed their neurogenic differentiation with semiquantitative and quantitative transcriptional and translational evaluations of the enkephalinergic-related genes such as proenkephalin, CREBZF, Ikaros, and prodynorphin. Our findings supported the enkephalinergic differentiation of these stem cells. Noteworthy, USSCs showed higher potential for differentiating into enkephalinergic neurons under Ikaros activation than hMSCs, which makes them appropriate for neurological therapeutic applications. In conclusion, this study suggests a powerful in vitro model for neurogenesis that may help clarification of enkephalinergic differentiation and related signaling networks along with neural drug screening. Such investigations may be beneficial to ameliorate the neural-related therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": "We investigate an application case study of a phase sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor based on Mach-Zehnder configuration for efficient targeted drug screening, where calculating reaction kinetic constants, inhibition effect and cytotoxicity analysis are three key factors in the evaluation. As a typical targeted drug, cetuximab is selected in the measurements assisted by the phase SPR biosensor with a sensitivity of 10-6 in terms of refractive index unit (RIU) and stability of 6 \u00d7 10-7 RIU in 80 min. The reaction kinetic constants of cetuximab binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are found as: kd (dissociation constant) = 1.75 \u00b1 0.29 \u00d7 10-3 S-1, kD (equilibrium dissociation constant) = 4.19 \u00b1 0.58 nM. The results of inhibition effect analysis show that cetuximab can block EGFR binding to its two ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EGFR-transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1). This effect has been tested in three cell lines of lung adenocarcinoma, colon cancer and breast cancer. Comparing to other conventional methods, we find that the phase SPR biosensor can determine the cell sensitivity to cetuximab in just 4 h. As a label-free, real-time, high sensitivity and stability biosensor, the phase SPR biosensor is a potential optical technique for targeted drug screening and analysis of cell resistance to drugs with comparative advantages.",

        "abstract": "A large spectrum of methods has been used in both routine and scientific studies of the hemostatic system. The particular interest of the investigators has been focused on methods simultaneously evaluating clotting and fibrinolysis processes. The aim of the present study was to develop an optical method for overall evaluation of clot formation and lysis (CL-test) that could be used in drug screening. The CL-test was performed in citrate plasma diluted with Tris-buffered saline. Thrombin was applied for plasma clotting (0.5 IU/ml), while tissue plasminogen activator (60 ng/ml) was used for fibrinolysis activation. Clot formation and lysis were monitored in thermostatic conditions (37 degrees C) as a continuous record of transmittance change. By means of own computer program, kinetic parameters of the processes studied and plasma overall clot formation and fibrinolysis potential, expressed as the area under the clotgeneration and fibrinolysis curves, were calculated. The CL-test was developed and checked by evaluation of the effect, on clot formation and lysis, of various concentrations of acetylsalicylic acid (a drug that affects hemostasis), aprotinin (fibrinolysis activator) and venoruton (fibrinolysis inhibitor). The obtained results confirmed that the test we propose for monitoring clot formation, stabilization and lysis is sensitive and enables precise estimation of the processes studied. In our opinion, it can be a useful tool in drug screening investigations.",

        "abstract": "Currently, there has been a growing need for developing in vitro models to better reflect organism response to chemotherapy at tissue level. For this reason, a microfluidic platform was developed for mimicking physiological microenvironment of solid tumor with multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) for anticancer drug screening. Importantly, the power of this system over traditional systems is that it is simple to operate and high integration in a more physiologically relevant context. As a proof of concept, long-term MTS cultures with uniform structure were realized on the microfluidic based platform. The response of doxorubicin and paclitaxel on different types of spheroids were simultaneously performed by in situ Live/Dead fluorescence stain to provide spatial distribution of dead cells as well as cytotoxicity information. In addition, the established platform combined with microplate reader was capable to determine the cytotoxicity of different sized MTS, showing a more powerful tool than cell staining examination at the end-point of assay. The HCT116 spheroids were then lysed on chip followed by signaling transduction pathway analysis. To our knowledge, the on chip drug screening study is the first to address the drug susceptibility testing and the offline detailed drug signaling pathway analysis combination on one system. Thus, this novel microfluidic platform provides a useful tool for drug screening with tumor spheroids, which is crucial for drug discovery and development.",

        "abstract": "Motivation: Targeted kinase inhibitors have dramatically improved cancer treatment, but kinase dependency for an individual patient or cancer cell can be challenging to predict. Kinase dependency does not always correspond with gene expression and mutation status. High-throughput drug screens are powerful tools for determining kinase dependency, but drug polypharmacology can make results difficult to interpret. Results: We developed Kinase Addiction Ranker (KAR), an algorithm that integrates high-throughput drug screening data, comprehensive kinase inhibition data and gene expression profiles to identify kinase dependency in cancer cells. We applied KAR to predict kinase dependency of 21 lung cancer cell lines and 151 leukemia patient samples using published datasets. We experimentally validated KAR predictions of FGFR and MTOR dependence in lung cancer cell line H1581, showing synergistic reduction in proliferation after combining ponatinib and AZD8055.

Our highly optimized OpenCL implementation of BUDE sustains 1.43 TFLOP/s on a single Nvidia GTX 680 GPU, or 46% of peak performance. BUDE also exploits OpenCL to deliver effective performance portability across a broad spectrum of different computer architectures from different vendors, including GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, Intel's Xeon Phi and multi-core CPUs with SIMD instruction sets.",

        "abstract": "Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor children. Despite aggressive multimodal therapy, many patients succumb to the disease, and survivors experience severe long-term side effects from the treatment. Patients whose tumors express high levels of theMYC oncogene have a particularly poor prognosis, and would benefit from more effective therapies. To identify such therapies, we used a recently developed animal model of MYC-driven MB as a platform for high-throughput drug screening. Among the most effective compounds identified in our screen were histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). In vitro, HDACi showed potent activity against cells from murine and human MYC-driven MB, with minimal toxicity to normal cerebellar cells. Gene expression analysis suggested that a major target of HDACI is Foxo1, a transcription factor that antagonizes MYC-mediated transformation. Since PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki) have also been shown to activate Foxo1 by promoting its nuclear localization, we tested the combination of HDACi and PI3K inhibitors on MB cells. HDACi and PI3Ki synergized in vitro, and potently inhibited growth of murine and human MYC-driven MB in vivo. These findings highlight the power of high-throughput drug screening for identifying novel cancer therapies, and point to HDACi/PI3Ki combination therapy as a promising avenue for treatment of aggressive MB.",

We used mouse Col1a1GFP MC-3T3 E1 osteoblastic cells, which have a marker gene system expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of osteoblast-specific promoters. With our microchip-based cell culture system, we realized automated long-term monitoring of cells and sampling of the culture supernatant system for osteoblast differentiation assay using a small number of cells. The system successfully monitored cells for 10 days. Under the 3D microchannel condition, shear stress (0.07 dyne/cm(2) at a flow rate of 0.2 microL/min) was applied to the cells and it enhanced the GFP expression and differentiation of the osteoblasts. Analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which is an enzyme marker of osteoblasts, supported the results of GFP expression. In the case of differentiation medium containing bone morphogenetic protein 2, we found that ALP activity in the culture supernatant was enhanced 10 times in the microchannel compared with the static condition in 48-well dishes. A combined system of a microchip and a cell-based sensor might allow us to monitor osteogenic differentiation easily, precisely, and noninvasively. Our system can be applied in high-throughput drug screening assay for discovering osteogenic compounds.",

        "abstract": "We suggest the use of biomimetic superhydrophobic patterned chips produced by a benchtop methodology as low-cost and waste-free platforms for the production of arrays of cell spheroids/microtissues by the hanging drop methodology. Cell spheroids have a wide range of applications in biotechnology fields. For drug screening, they allow studying 3D models in structures resembling real living tissues/tumors. In tissue engineering, they are suggested as building blocks of bottom-up fabricated tissues. We used the wettability contrast of the chips to fix cell suspension droplets in the wettable regions and evaluated on-chip drug screening in 3D environment. Cell suspensions were patterned in the wettable spots by three distinct methods: (1) by pipetting the cell suspension directly in each individual spot, (2) by the continuous dragging of a cell suspension on the chip, and (3) by dipping the whole chip in a cell suspension. These methods allowed working with distinct throughputs and degrees of precision. The platforms were robust, and we were able to have static or dynamic environments in each droplet. The access to cell culture media for exchange or addition/removal of components was versatile and opened the possibility of using each spot of the chip as a mini-bioreactor. The platforms' design allowed for samples visualization and high-content image-based analysis on-chip. The combinatorial analysis capability of this technology was validated by following the effect of doxorubicin at different concentrations on spheroids formed using L929 and SaOs-2 cells.",

        "abstract": "Drug poisoning is a common cause for attendance in the emergency department. Several toxicology centres suggest performing urinary drug screens, even though they rarely influence patient management. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Measuring the impact on patient management, in a University Emergency Department with approximately 40 000 admissions annually, of a rapid urinary drug screening test using specifically focused indications. Drug screening was restricted to patients having a first psychotic episode or cases demonstrating respiratory failure, coma, seizures, a sympathomimetic toxidrome, severe opiate overdose necessitating naloxone, hypotension, ventricular arrhythmia, acquired long QT or QRS >100 ms, and high-degree heart block. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of Triage(R) TOX drug screen tests performed between September 2009 and November 2011, and between January 2013 and March 2014. RESULTS: A total of 262 patients were included, mean age 35 +/- 14.6 (standard deviation) years, 63% men; 29% poisoning with alcohol, and 2.3% deaths. Indications for testing were as follows: 34% were first psychotic episodes; 20% had acute respiratory failure; 16% coma; 8% seizures; 8% sympathomimetic toxidromes; 7% severe opioid toxidromes; 4% hypotension; 3% ventricular arrhythmias or acquired long QT intervals on electrocardiogram. A total of 78% of the tests were positive (median two substances, maximum five). The test resulted in drug-specific therapy in 6.1%, drug specific diagnostic tests in 13.3 %, prolonged monitoring in 10.7% of methadone-positive tests, and psychiatric admission in 4.2%. Overall, 34.3% tests influenced patient management. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous studies showing modest effects of toxicological testing, restricted use of rapid urinary drug testing increases the impact on management of suspected overdose patients in the ED.",

Recently, certain mechanisms underlying the differential effects of green tea polyphenols (GTPPs) on tumor versus normal cells have been determined. These suggest that GTPPs may simultaneously activate multiple pathways. However, existing screening methods are insufficient for the identification of agents that possess both a cytotoxic effect on tumor cells and a protective effect on normal cells. The current study describes the establishment of an in vitro survival/apoptosis testing system based on detecting these mechanisms by a double-fluorescence method. This system is able to screen potential chemopreventive or therapeutic agents from (but not limited to) plant-derived compounds based on the pathways differentially activated by the agents. Tumor cell death and normal cell survival are detected simultaneously, in a device that co-cultures normal human cells adjacent to human tumor cells.",

        "abstract": "Functional cardiomyocytes can now be derived routinely from hPSCs (human pluripotent stem cells), which collectively include embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. This technology presents new opportunities to develop pharmacologically relevant in vitro screens to detect cardiotoxicity, with a view to improving patient safety while reducing the economic burden to industry arising from high drug attrition rates. In the present article, we consider the need for human cardiomyocytes in drug-screening campaigns and review the strategies used to differentiate hPSCs towards the cardiac lineage. During early stages of differentiation, hPSC-cardiomyocytes display gene expression profiles, ultra-structures, ion channel functionality and pharmacological responses reminiscent of an embryonic phenotype, but maturation during extended time in culture has been demonstrated convincingly. Notably, hPSC-cardiomyocytes have been shown to respond in a highly predictable manner to over 40 compounds that have a known pharmacological effect on the human heart. This suggests that further development and validation of the hPSC-cardiomyocyte model as a tool for assessing cardiotoxicity is warranted.",

Urine and blood samples from 26 suspected intoxicated patients and from 22 suspected lethal poisoning cases were examined. Eighty-one of the 99 parent drugs/main metabolites detected were identified by SB/GC-MS and 54 with U/REM. Thirty-six drugs/metabolites were identified with both methods, 45 by SB/GC-MS alone, and 18 by U/REM alone. Absence of the mass spectrometry (MS) spectra in the reference library and high polarity of the analytes were the main reasons for failed identification by SB/GC-MS. Unsuccessful identifications with U/REM were basically caused by the absence of the UV spectra in the reference library or by low chromatographic and spectroscopic selectivity as in the case of barbiturates and benzodiazepines (BZD), which represented 11% and 51%, respectively, of the 45 SB/GC-MS unique identifications. Urine samples of 14 BZD-positive cases were also submitted to enzymatic hydrolysis and analyzed with the REMEDi UBz assay, and results were compared with those obtained by SB/GC-MS: 14 of the 22 identified BZD were detected with both methods, three by U/REM only, and five by SB/GC-MS only. In conclusion, the integrated use of SB/GC-MS and U/REM approaches greatly enhances the amount and quality of analytical information obtainable by applying either method alone.",

        "abstract": "A multitude of proteins reside at or near the cell membrane, which provides a unique environment for organizing and promoting assemblies of proteins that are involved in a variety of cellular signaling functions. Many of these proteins and pathways are implicated in disease. For example, strong links have been established between receptor tyrosine kinases and disease, most notably, cancer. However, a significant impediment to researchers remains: membrane-associated proteins are difficult to reconstitute and study. Template-directed assembly represents a powerful new technology that enables the assembly of membrane-associated proteins. We show that template-directed assembly restores tyrosine kinase activity and regulation, and provides a way for researchers to build multicomponent assemblies. As an example of better enzyme regulation, the Tie2 tyrosine kinase domain exhibits (biologically relevant) autoinhibitory behavior when template assembled. Also, template-assembled insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domains exhibit significant autophosphorylation (none detected without template-directed assembly) and an eightfold increase in substrate phosphorylation (compared to best solution conditions). Thus, template-directed assembly has a demonstrated ability to effectively produce more biologically relevant results using these commercial reagents. Template-directed assembly promises to be generally applicable to the signaling networks important for human health, because these pathways frequently contain membrane-associated proteins that require the organizing influence of a membrane surface.",

The over- the-counter antitussive medication dextromethorphan (DXM) can cause false-positive results for phencyclidine (PCP) upon urine drug screening (UDS). It is believed that DXM can also cause a false positive for opiates, presumably due to structural similarities. This could have serious implications, as DXM abuse is reported to be increasing. However, many of these claims are anecdotal, as no fully comprehensive studies exist. Furthermore, what studies have been completed reveal that DXM does not cause a false positive for opiates, despite their similarity in structure. Laboratories have established cut-off limits for opiates for the initial screen, and like all presumptive positives, confirmation with more sensitive methods are strongly recommended to rule out false positives.",

        "abstract": "The development of a relatively simple, reliant and cost-effective animal test will greatly facilitate drug development. In this study, our goal was the establishment of a rapid, simple, sensitive and reproducible zebrafish xenograft model for anti-cancer drug screening. We optimized the conditions for the cancer cell xenograft in terms of injected cell numbers, incubation temperature and time. A range of human carcinoma cell types were stained with a fluorescent dye prior to injection into the fish larvae. Subsequent cancer cell dissemination was observed under fluorescent microscopy. Differences in injected cell numbers were reflected in the rate of dissemination from the xenograft site. Paclitaxel, known as a microtubule stabilizer, dose-dependently inhibited cancer cell dissemination in our zebrafish xenograft model. An anti-migratory drug, LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) also decreased the cancer cell dissemination. Chemical modifications to increase cancer drug pharmacokinetics, such as increased solubility (17-DMAG compared to geldanamycin) could also be assessed in our xenograft model. In addition to testing our new model using known anti-cancer drugs, we carried out further validation by screening a tagged triazine library. Two novel anti-cancer drug candidates were discovered. Therefore, our zebrafish xenograft model provides a vertebrate animal system for the rapid screening and pre-clinical testing of novel anti-cancer agents, prior to the requirement for testing in mammals. Our model system should greatly facilitate drug development for cancer therapy because of its speed, simplicity and reproducibility.",

The study was a secondary data analysis of 3,517 mothers. The sample was extracted from National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data gathered in 1994-2004. Results of logistic regression show welfare participation is not associated with heavy alcohol use or alcohol- and drug-screening requirements, but is associated with a history of reported heavy alcohol use, informal help with childcare, and scant human capital. Results also indicate that alcohol- and drug screening required under TANF may not exclude heavy drinking mothers from TANF participation, and that social support networks do not cancel heavy drinking's association with participation.

        "abstract": "We developed a new protocol for in silico drug screening for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) using a set of \"universal active probes\" (UAPs) with an ensemble docking procedure. UAPs are drug-like compounds, which are actual active compounds of a variety of known proteins. The current targets were nine human GPCRs whose three-dimensional (3D) structures are unknown, plus three GPCRs, namely \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), A(2A) adenosine receptor (A(2A)), and dopamine D3 receptor (D(3)), whose 3D structures are known. Homology-based models of the GPCRs were constructed based on the crystal structures with careful sequence inspection. After subsequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation taking into account the explicit lipid membrane molecules with periodic boundary conditions, we obtained multiple model structures of the GPCRs. For each target structure, docking-screening calculations were carried out via the ensemble docking procedure, using both true active compounds of the target proteins and the UAPs with the multiple target screening (MTS) method. Consequently, the multiple model structures showed various screening results with both poor and high hit ratios, the latter of which could be identified as promising for use in in silico screening to find candidate compounds to interact with the proteins. We found that the hit ratio of true active compounds showed a positive correlation to that of the UAPs. Thus, we could retrieve appropriate target structures from the GPCR models by applying the UAPs, even if no active compound is known for the GPCRs. Namely, the screening result that showed a high hit ratio for the UAPs could be used to identify actual hit compounds for the target GPCRs.",

        "abstract": "An important application of model organisms in neurological research has been to identify and characterise therapeutic approaches for epilepsy, a recurrent seizure disorder that affects > 1% of the human population. Proconvulsant-treated rodent models have been widely used for antiepileptic drug discovery and development, but are not suitable for high-throughput screening. To generate a genetically tractable model that would be suitable for large-scale, high-throughput screening for antiepileptic drug candidates, we characterized a Drosophila chemical treatment model using the GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin. This proconvulsant, delivered to Drosophila larvae via simple feeding methods suitable for automated screening, generated robust generalised seizures with lethality occurring at doses between 0.3 and 0.5 mg/mL. Electrophysiological analysis of CNS motor neuron output in picrotoxin-treated larvae revealed generalised seizures within minutes of drug exposure. At subthreshold doses for seizure induction, picrotoxin produced an increased frequency of motor neuron action potential bursting, indicating that CNS GABAergic transmission regulates patterned activity. Mutants in the Drosophila Rdl GABA(A) receptor are resistant to picrotoxin, confirming that seizure induction occurs via a conserved GABA(A) receptor pathway. To validate the usefulness of this model for in vivo drug screening, we identified several classes of neuroactive antiepileptic compounds in a pilot screen, including phenytoin and nifedipine, which can rescue the seizures and lethal neurotoxicity induced by picrotoxin. The well-defined actions of picrotoxin in Drosophila and the ease with which compounds can be assayed for antiseizure activity makes this genetically tractable model attractive for high-throughput in vivo screens to identify novel anticonvulsants and seizure susceptibility loci.",

We define a new term, intrinsic specificity ratio (ISR), which describes the level of discrimination in binding free energies of the native basin for a protein-ligand complex from the weaker binding states of the same ligand. We discuss the relationship between the intrinsic specificity we defined here and the conventional definition of specificity. In a docking study of molecules with the enzyme COX-2, we demonstrate a statistical correspondence between ISR value and geometrical shapes of the small molecules binding to COX-2. We further observe that the known selective (nonselective) inhibitors of COX-2 have higher (lower) ISR values.

Zebrafish with a mutation in scn1Lab recapitulate salient phenotypes associated with DS, including seizures, early fatality, and resistance to antiepileptic drugs. To discover new drug candidates for the treatment of DS, we screened a chemical library of \u223c1000 compounds and identified 4 compounds that rescued the behavioral seizure component, including 1 compound (dimethadione) that suppressed associated electrographic seizure activity. Fenfluramine, but not huperzine A, also showed antiepileptic activity in our zebrafish assays. The effectiveness of compounds that block neuronal calcium current (dimethadione) or enhance serotonin signaling (fenfluramine) in our zebrafish model suggests that these may be important therapeutic targets in patients with DS. Over 150 compounds resulting in fatality were also identified.

        "title": "poolHiTS: a shifted transversal design based pooling strategy for high-throughput drug screening.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A key goal of drug discovery is to increase the throughput of small molecule screens without sacrificing screening accuracy. High-throughput screening (HTS) in drug discovery involves testing a large number of compounds in a biological assay to identify active compounds. Normally, molecules from a large compound library are tested individually to identify the activity of each molecule. Usually a small number of compounds are found to be active, however the presence of false positive and negative testing errors suggests that this one-drug one-assay screening strategy can be significantly improved. Pooling designs are testing schemes that test mixtures of compounds in each assay, thereby generating a screen of the whole compound library in fewer tests. By repeatedly testing compounds in different combinations, pooling designs also allow for error-correction. These pooled designs, for specific experiment parameters, can be simply and efficiently created using the Shifted Transversal Design (STD) pooling algorithm. However, drug screening contains a number of key constraints that require specific modifications if this pooling approach is to be useful for practical screen designs. RESULTS: In this paper, we introduce a pooling strategy called poolHiTS (Pooled High-Throughput Screening) which is based on the STD algorithm. In poolHiTS, we implement a limit on the number of compounds that can be mixed in a single assay. In addition, we show that the STD-based pooling strategy is limited in the error-correction that it can achieve. Due to the mixing constraint, we show that it is more efficient to split a large library into smaller blocks of compounds, which are then tested using an optimized strategy repeated for each block. We package the optimal block selection algorithm into poolHiTS. The MATLAB codes for the poolHiTS algorithm and the corresponding decoding strategy are also provided. CONCLUSION: We have produced a practical version of STD algorithm for pooled drug screens. This pooling strategy provides both assay compression and error-correction capabilities that can both accelerate and reduce the overall cost of HTS in drug discovery.",

Because many facets of biology are regulated by protein phosphorylation, aberrant kinase and/or phosphatase activity forms the basis for many different types of pathology. The disease relevance of protein kinases and phosphatases has led many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to expend significant resources in lead discovery programs for these two target classes. The existence of >500 kinases and phosphatases encoded by the human genome necessitates development of methodologies for the rapid screening for novel and specific compound inhibitors. We describe here a fluorescence-based, molecular assay platform that is compatible with robotic, ultra-high throughput screening systems and can be applied to virtually all tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinases and phosphatases. The assay has a coupled-enzyme format, utilizing the differential protease sensitivity of phosphorylated versus nonphosphorylated peptide substrates. In addition to screening individual kinases, the assay can be formatted such that kinase pathways are re-created in vitro to identify compounds that specifically interact with inactive kinases. Miniaturization of this assay format to the 1-microl scale allows for the rapid and accurate compound screening of a host of kinase and phosphatase targets, thereby facilitating the hunt for new leads for these target classes.",

Current in vitro screening methods hardly correspond with the in vivo situation, whereas there is a lack of assays for more accurate cell culture models. Therefore, development of automated assays for 3D cell culture models is urgently required. In this work, we present a SpheroChip system: a microfluidic-based platform for long-term 3D cell culture and analysis. The system is compatible with commercially available microplate readers and provides continuous, in situ monitoring of tumour spheroids cultured on a chip. The microfluidic chip consists of cell culture microchambers and hemispherical microwells connected with a concentration gradient generator. HT-29 and Hep-G2 cells were successfully cultured as tumour spheroids in the SpheroChip, and metabolic activity of cells was monitored for up to two weeks by in situ fluorimetric measurements. Cellular response to an anticancer drug was observed using the SpheroChip. The experimental setup provided the unique possibility of observing dynamic changes in metabolic activity of one culture during sequencing days after drug dosage. According to this new approach, unknown phenomena of cellular response to the anticancer drug were observed, such as increase of metabolic activity shortly after drug dosage. Moreover, the influence of a second dose of a drug was evaluated. The SpheroChip system can be used by researchers working on drug screening, evaluation of anticancer procedures and chemoresistance phenomena.",

It is involved in the production of mycolic acid and is a known target for isoniazid, an effective antibiotic for tuberculosis treatment. The increasing prevalence of tuberculosis in many areas of the world, which is associated with the rise of drug-resistant MTB strains, presents a major global health threat. In this study, we attempted to identify novel antibiotics specifically targeting the MTB enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase. We performed in silico structure-based drug screening using the crystal structure data for the MTB enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (PDB code; 2H7I) and a virtual compound library, which includes 152,102 chemicals. By a two-step screening method using DOCK (first screening) and GOLD (second screening), we identified 5 chemical compounds expected to have high binding affinity to the active center of the MTB enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase. Moreover, we examined the antibiotic effects of these chemical compounds on model bacterial strains by in vitro experiments. We found that a chemical compound, which has a basic skeleton comprised of dibenzofuran, acetoamide, trizol, furyl and methylphenyl groups, completely inhibited the growth of Mycobacterium vanbaalenii and had no toxic effects on enterobacteria and cultured mammalian cells. Therefore, the chemical compound is likely to be useful in the research and development of new antibiotics for tuberculosis. ?? 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",

Currently the complexity of the protocol and the amount of hands-on time required for this assay limits its use to low throughput applications; furthermore, variability in antibody quality poses an additional obstacle in scaling up ChIP for large scale screening purposes. To address these challenges, we report HTChIP, an automated microfluidic-based platform for performing high-throughput ChIP screening measurements of 16 different targets simultaneously, with potential for further scale-up. From chromatin to analyzable PCR results only takes one day using HTChIP, as compared to several days up to one week for conventional protocols. HTChIP can also be used to test multiple antibodies and select the best performer for downstream ChIP applications, saving time and reagent costs of unsuccessful ChIP assays as a result of poor antibody quality. We performed a series of characterization assays to demonstrate that HTChIP can rapidly and accurately evaluate the epigenetic states of a cell, and that it is sensitive enough to detect the changes in the epigenetic state induced by a cytokine stimulant over a fine temporal resolution. With these results, we believe that HTChIP can introduce large improvements in routine ChIP, antibody screening, and drug screening efficiency, and further facilitate the use of ChIP as a valuable tool for research and discovery.",

        "abstract": "Most drug discovery programs today originate by selection of 'hit' molecules resulting from assays against large compound screening libraries. The chemical space in which these hits reside has implications for its biological activity in vivo and likelihood of progression to a drug candidate. We have created a database of commercially available screening compounds and natural products in order to analyse the drug- and lead-likeness of commercial screening compounds and compare them with i) orally administered drugs, ii) non-orally administered drugs, and iii) compounds with significant biological activity but unspecified or not yet determined route of administration from the public databases DrugBank and ChEMBL. The data set contained 15.5 million entries from 102 vendors, which resulted in just over 8 million unique chemical structures. We review these data for current drug/lead-likeness, then utilise substructure-based filters for promiscuity and unwanted groups, and finally compare chemical properties for structures within the different sub-sets. While the majority of the commercial compounds satisfy various drug-likeness rules, they show a larger molecular weight and higher hydrophobicity compared to orally available drugs, with generally higher aromaticity and lower solubility. This 'right shift' of chemical properties has also been found in the majority of the compounds with significant biological activity in ChEMBL, reflecting a common trend in current drug discovery, towards larger, more hydrophobic compounds and fewer drug-like compounds. In particular, successful drugs were found to possess much lower median logD values than those found for compound collections. In addition, commercial compounds show a quite narrow distribution in molecular weight, with a median absolute deviation of only 78 Da around a median of 387 Da. For high-throughput screening a highly stringent combination of several lead-likeness and substructure filters against unwanted groups could be applied, resulting in 2 million lead-like structures. For fragment based screening approaches the rule of three (Ro3) would select around 400,000 structures.",

        "abstract": "We report the development of a novel fluorescent drug sensor from the bacterial drug target TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase through the combined strategy of Val216\u2192Cys216 mutation and fluorophore labelling for in vitro drug screening. The Val216 residue in TEM-1 is replaced with a cysteine residue, and the environment-sensitive fluorophore fluorescein-5-maleimide is specifically attached to the Cys216 residue in the V216C mutant for sensing drug binding at the active site. The labelled V216C mutant has wild-type catalytic activity and gives stronger fluorescence when \u03b2-lactam antibiotics bind to the active site. The labelled V216C mutant can differentiate between potent and impotent \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and can distinguish active-site binders from non-binders (including aggregates formed by small molecules in aqueous solution) by giving characteristic time-course fluorescence profiles. Mass spectrometric, molecular modelling and trypsin digestion results indicate that drug binding at the active site is likely to cause the fluorescein label to stay away from the active site and experience weaker fluorescence quenching by the residues around the active site, thus making the labelled V216C mutant to give stronger fluorescence in the drug-bound state. Given the ancestor's role of TEM-1 in the TEM family, the fluorescent TEM-1 drug sensor represents a good model to demonstrate the general combined strategy of Val216\u2192Cys216 mutation and fluorophore labelling for fabricating tailor-made fluorescent drug sensors from other clinically significant TEM-type \u03b2-lactamase variants for in vitro drug screening.",

        "abstract": "In oncology, combating the spread of tumor cells is a clinical need which currently remains unsatisfied. Identifying anti-migratory compounds usually requires in vitro screening of a large number of molecules. Efficient and realistic (i.e., preferably 3D) in vitro tests are thus required in order to quantify the anti-migratory effects of anti-cancer drugs. To remain compatible with high-throughput screening, we focus on assays where unlabeled cells are migrating in 3D transparent gels and are observed under time-lapse 3D phase-contrast microscopy. In this context, we present a method for automatically tracking cells that combines a template matching preprocessing step with a mean-shift process. The preprocessing step consists in performing a correlation of a cell template with each observed volume in order to provide a phase-contrast artifact-free volume where the cells appear as correlation peaks surrounded by smooth gradients. This transformation enables the cells to be efficiently tracked by a mean-shift process. Robustness and efficiency of this approach are qualitatively and quantitatively shown in various experiments. Finally, we successfully applied our method to the quantitative characterization of the anti-migratory impact of cytochalasin-D on cancer cells. In conclusion, our method can efficiently be used for drug screening aiming to evidence drug-induced effects on cell migration in 3D transparent environments, such as matrix gels. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was undertaken to identify novel chemical modulators for the hydrolase activity of UCH-L1. To identify chemicals that bind to the active site of UCH-L1, we carried out in silico structure-based drug screening using human UCH-L1 crystal structure data (PDB ID: 2ETL) and virtual compound libraries containing 26,891 and 304,205 compounds. Among the compounds with the highest binding scores, we identified one that potentiates the hydrolase activity of UCH-L1, and six that inhibit the activity in enzymatic assays.

However, reprogramming of human somatic cells that use readily accessible tissue, such as skin or blood, to generate embryonic-like induced pluripotent stem cells has opened new perspectives for modeling and understanding a larger number of human pathologies. Here, we examine the challenges in creating a disease model from human pluripotent stem cells, and describe their use to model both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, the need for adequate control experiments and the genetic limitations of human induced pluripotent stem cells.

One of the major limitations in these methodologies is their inability to provide information on the dynamic, post-translational regulation of enzymatic proteins.

Thus, methods that allow direct monitoring of protease activity in the context of a living cell or whole animal will be required to begin to understand the systems-wide functional roles of proteases.

However, L. amazonensis is pathogenic and requires a relatively expensive medium for large-scale cultivation. Herein, the purification and characterization of tubulin from the non-pathogenic Leishmania tarentolae is reported, together with the sequence of \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin from this organism. This protein was purified by sonication, diethylaminoethyl-Sepharose chromatography, and one assembly disassembly cycle in 1% overall recovery based on total cellular protein. Leishmania tarentolae tubulin was indistinguishable from the corresponding L. amazonensis protein in terms of binding affinity for dinitroaniline sulfanilamides and sensitivity to assembly inhibition by these compounds. The amino acid sequences derived from the L. tarentolae \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin genes were 99.6 and 99.4% identical to the corresponding amino acid sequences from the Leishmania major Friedlin strain.

Development and high-throughput screening of efficacious drugs is therefore critical. However, currently there remains a lack of such a safe system. Here, the generation and characterization of the first selectable, SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-based replicon cell line which can be used for screening is described. Partial SARS-CoV cDNAs and antibiotic resistance/reporter gene DNA were generated and assembled in vitro to produce the replicon transcription template, which was then transcribed in vitro to generate the replicon RNA. The latter was introduced into a mammalian cell line and the transfected cells were selected for by antibiotic application. For the antibiotic-resistant cell lines thus generated, the expression of reporter gene was ensured by continued monitoring using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. The suitability of this replicon cell line in drug screening was demonstrated by testing the inhibitory effect of several existing drugs and the results demonstrate that the SARS-CoV replicon cell lines provide a safe tool for the identification of SARS-CoV replicase inhibitors. The replicon cell lines thus developed can be applied to high-throughput screening for anti-SARS drugs without the need to grow infectious SARS-CoV. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Unpredicted hERG and drug interaction affecting channel activity is of main concern for drug discovery. Although there are several methods to test hERG and drug interaction, it is still necessary to develop some efficient and economic ways to probe hERG and drug interactions. To contribute this aim, we have developed a biomimetic lipid membrane platform into which the hERG channel can be folded. Expression and integration of the hERG channel was achieved using a cell-free (CF) expression system. The folding of hERG in the biomimetic membrane system was investigated using Surface Plasmon Enhanced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (SPFS) and Imaging Surface Plasmon Resonance (iSPR). In addition, the hERG channel folded into our biomimetic membrane platform was used for probing the channel and drug interactions through fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. Our results suggest that the biomimetic system employed is capable of detecting the interaction between hERG and different channel blockers at varied concentrations. We believe that our current approach could be applied to other membrane proteins for drug screening or other protein-related interactions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Robustness is a recognized feature of biological systems that evolved as a defence to environmental variability. Complex diseases such as diabetes, cancer, bacterial and viral infections, exploit the same mechanisms that allow for robust behaviour in healthy conditions to ensure their own continuance. Single drug therapies, while generally potent regulators of their specific protein/gene targets, often fail to counter the robustness of the disease in question. Multi-drug therapies offer a powerful means to restore disrupted biological networks, by targeting the subsystem of interest while preventing the diseased network from reconciling through available, redundant mechanisms. Modelling techniques are needed to manage the high number of combinatorial possibilities arising in multi-drug therapeutic design, and identify synergistic targets that are robust to system uncertainty. RESULTS: We present the application of a method from robust control theory, Structured Singular Value or mu- analysis, to identify highly effective multi-drug therapies by using robustness in the face of uncertainty as a new means of target discrimination. We illustrate the method by means of a case study of a negative feedback network motif subject to parametric uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: The paper contributes to the development of effective methods for drug screening in the context of network modelling affected by parametric uncertainty. The results have wide applicability for the analysis of different sources of uncertainty like noise experienced in the data, neglected dynamics, or intrinsic biological variability.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that NP (nucleoprotein), which possesses multiple functions in the viral life cycle, is a new potential anti-influenza drug target. NP inhibitors reliably induce conformational changes in NPs, and these changes may confer inhibition of the influenza virus. The six conserved tryptophan residues in NP can be used as an intrinsic probe to monitor the change in fluorescence of the tryptophan residues in the protein upon binding to an NP inhibitor. In the present study, we found that the fluorescence of recombinant NP proteins was quenched following the binding of available NP inhibitors (such as nucleozin) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which suggests that the inhibitor induced conformational changes in the NPs. The minimal fluorescence-quenching effect and weak binding constant of nucleozin to the swine-origin influenza virus H1N1pdm09 (SOIV) NP revealed that the SOIV is resistant to nucleozin. We have used the fluorescence-quenching property of tryptophans in NPs that were bound to ligands in a 96-well-plate-based drug screen to assess the ability of promising small molecules to interact with NPs and have identified one new anti-influenza drug, CSV0C001018, with a high SI value.

Meanwhile, the use of hiPSCs to explore cellular mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases in vitro has proven to be extremely valuable. For example, hiPSC-CMs have been shown to recapitulate disease phenotypes from patients with monogenic cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, patient-derived hiPSC-CMs are now providing new insights regarding drug efficacy and toxicity.

Drug testing has been suggested by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to identify pharmacologically induced sleepiness. However, there is limited data on how common an issue this is and the effectiveness of drug testing in this setting. Materials and methods: We undertook a retrospective study of all patients undergoing evaluation of sleepiness after referral to a tertiary sleep centre over a 30months period from 2005 to 2007. Urine drug screening tests (UDST) were obtained following a recommended 2weeks discontinuation of medications which may influence sleep; analysis was by gas-chromatography with mass-spectrometry (GC\u2013MS). Results: 187 patients were included in the study. Prior to the results of the UDST, using standard diagnostic criteria, only 2 (1%) of patients were suspected to have hypersomnia due to drugs or medication. However, 61 patients had positive UDST results: opioids, cannabis and anti- depressants were the commonest drugs detected. In the 48 patients with suspected idiopathic hypersomnia, 23% had detectable sedatives in their UDST. 39% of the 44 patients with narcolepsy had a detectable stimulant and 42% of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) diagnoses had detectable anti- depressants which are known to contribute to RLS/PLMD symptoms. Conclusion: The role of drugs and medication are underappreciated in the assessment of patients reporting excessive sleepiness. Urine drug testing should be considered in all patients undergoing multiple sleep latency testing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Current therapeutic strategies, however, face substantial challenges partially due to a lack of applicable pre-clinical models and drug-screening platforms. Notably, microscale and three-dimensional (3D) tissue culture platforms capable of mimicking in vivo microenvironments to replicate physiological conditions have become vital tools in a wide range of cellular and clinical studies. Here, we present a microfluidic device capable of mimicking a configurable tumor microenvironment to study in vivo-like cancer cell migration as well as screening of inhibitors on both parental tumors and migratory cells. In addition, a novel evaporation-based paper pump was demonstrated to achieve adaptable and sustainable concentration gradients for up to 6 days in this model. This straightforward modeling approach allows for fast patterning of a wide variety of cell types in 3D and may be further integrated into biological assays. We also demonstrated cell migration from tumor spheroids induced by an epidermal growth factor (EGF) gradient and exhibited lowered expression of an epithelial marker (EpCAM) compared with parental cells, indicative of partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in this process. Importantly, pseudopodia protrusions from the migratory cells - critical during cancer metastasis - were demonstrated. Insights gained from this work offer new opportunities to achieve active control of in vitro tumor microenvironments on-demand, and may be amenable towards tailored clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) has the potential to supplement other drug screening platforms used in toxicology laboratories. HRMS offers high analytical specificity, which can be further enhanced by incorporating a fragment ion for each analyte. The ability to obtain precursor ions and fragment ions using elevated collision energies (MS(E)) can help improve the specificity of HRMS methods. METHODS We developed a broad-spectrum screening method on an ultraperformance liquid chromatography TOF mass spectrometer (UPLC-TOF-MS) using the MS(E) mode. A diverse set of patient samples were subjected to a simple dilute, hydrolyze, and shoot protocol and analyzed in a blind manner. Data were processed with 3 sets of criteria with increasing stringency, and the results were compared with the reference laboratory results. RESULTS A combination of retention time match (\u00b10.2 min), a protonated analyte, and fragment ion mass accuracy of \u00b15 ppm produced zero false-positive results. Using these criteria, we confirmed 92% (253/275) of true positives. The positive confirmation rate increased to 98% (270/275) when the requirement for a fragment ion was dropped, but also produced 53 false positives. A total of 136 additional positive drug findings not identified by the reference methods were identified with the UPLC-TOF-MS. CONCLUSIONS MS(E) provides a unique way to incorporate fragment ion information without the need of precursor ion selection. A primary limitation of requiring a fragment ion for positive identification was that certain drug classes required high-energy collisions, which formed many fragment ions of low abundance that were not readily detected.",

Modelling techniques are needed to manage the high number of combinatorial possibilities arising in multi-drug therapeutic design, and identify synergistic targets that are robust to system uncertainty. RESULTS: We present the application of a method from robust control theory, Structured Singular Value or mu- analysis, to identify highly effective multi-drug therapies by using robustness in the face of uncertainty as a new means of target discrimination. We illustrate the method by means of a case study of a negative feedback network motif subject to parametric uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: The paper contributes to the development of effective methods for drug screening in the context of network modelling affected by parametric uncertainty. The results have wide applicability for the analysis of different sources of uncertainty like noise experienced in the data, neglected dynamics, or intrinsic biological variability.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) makes the treatment of infectious diseases in hospitals more difficult and increases the mortality of the patients. In this study, we attempted to identify novel potent antibiotic candidate compounds against S. aureus dihydrofolate reductase (saDHFR). We performed three-step in silico structure-based drug screening (SBDS) based on the crystal structure of saDHFR using a 154,118 chemical compound library. We subsequently evaluated whether candidate chemical compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on the growth of the model bacterium: Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis). The compound KB1 showed a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of S. epidermidis. Moreover, we rescreened chemical structures similar to KB1 from a 461,397 chemical compound library. Three of the four KB1 analogs (KBS1, KBS3, and KBS4) showed inhibitory effects on the growth of S. epidermidis and enzyme inhibitory effects on saDHFR. We performed structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of active chemical compounds and observed a correlative relationship among the IC50 values, interaction residues, and structure scaffolds. In addition, the active chemical compounds (KB1, KBS3, and KBS4) had no inhibitory effects on the growth of model enterobacteria (E. coli BL21 and JM109 strains) and no toxic effects on cultured mammalian cells (MDCK cells). Results obtained from Protein Ligand Interaction Fingerprint (PLIF) and Ligand Interaction (LI) analyses suggested that all of the active compounds exhibited potential inhibitory effects on mutated saDHFR of the drug-resistant strains. The structural and experimental information concerning these novel chemical compounds will likely contribute to the development of new antibiotics for both wild-type and drug-resistant S. aureus.",

Human breast cancer cells, MCF7, were seeded into the chip and patterned via DEP forces onto the planar interdigitated ring electrode (PIRE) arrays. Roughly, only one third of the cell amount was required for the chip compared to that for a 96-well plate control. Drug concentrations (cisplatin or docetaxel) were stably generated by functional integration of a concentration gradient generator (CGG) and an anti-crosstalk valve (ACV) to treat cells for 24 hours. Cell viability was quantified using a dual staining method. Results of cell patterning show substantial uniformity of patterned cells (92 \u00b1 5 cells per PIRE). Furthermore, after 24 hour drug perfusion, no statistical significance in dose-responses between the chip and the 96-well plate controls was found. The IC(50) value from the chip also concurred with the values from the literature. Moreover, the perfusion culture exhibited reproducibility of drug responses of cells on different PIREs in the same chamber. The chip would enable applications where cells are of limited supply, and supplement microfluidic perfusion cultures for clinical practices.",

        "abstract": "Constitutively activated signaling molecules are often the primary drivers of malignancy, and are favored targets for therapeutic intervention. However, the effectiveness of targeted inhibition of cell signaling can be blunted by compensatory signaling which generates adaptive resistance mechanisms and reduces therapeutic responses. Therefore, it is important to identify and target these compensatory pathways with combinations of targeted agents to achieve durable clinical benefit. In this report, we demonstrate the use of high-throughput combinatorial drug screening as a discovery tool to identify compensatory pathways that generate resistance to the cytotoxic effects of targeted therapy. We screened 420 drug combinations in 14 different cell lines representing three cancer lineages, and assessed the ability of each combination to cause synergistic cytotoxicity. Drug substitution studies were used to validate the functionally important drug targets. Of the 84 combinations that caused robust synergy in multiple cell lines, none were synergistic in more than half of the lines tested, and we observed no pattern of lineage specificity in the observed synergies. This reflects the plasticity of cell signaling networks, even among cell lines of the same tissue of origin. Mechanistic analysis of one novel synergistic combination identified in the screen, the multi-kinase inhibitor Ro31-8220 and lapatinib, demonstrated compensatory crosstalk between the p70S6 kinase and EGF receptor pathways. In addition, we identified BAD as a node of convergence between these two pathways that may be playing a role in the enhanced apoptosis observed upon combination treatment.",

We have established conditions for DNA transformation of axenically grown Leishmania infantum amastigotes. Parameters for DNA electroporation of Leishmania axenic amastigotes were systematically studied using luciferase-mediated transient transfection. Cell lines expressing stable luciferase activity were then selected, and their ability to be used in an in vitro drug screening procedure was determined. A model was established, using axenic amastigotes expressing luciferase activity, for rapidly determining the activity of drugs directly against both axenic and intracellular amastigotes. For intracellular amastigotes, the 50% effective concentrations of pentamidine, sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam), meglumine (Glucantime), and potassium antimonyl tartrate determined with the luciferase assay were 0.2 microM (0.12 microg/ml), 55 microg/ml, 95 microg/ml, and 0.12 microg/ml, respectively; these values are in agreement with values determined by more labor-intensive staining methods. We also showed the usefulness of luciferase-expressing parasites for analyzing drug resistance. The availability of luciferase-expressing amastigotes for use in high-throughput screening should facilitate the search for new antileishmanial drugs.",

To facilitate simple spheroid manipulation, magnetic spheroids were generated from magnetically labeled cells using a scaffold-free approach. This method is applicable to a variety of cell types. The spheroids generated can be targeted and immobilized using magnetic field gradients, allowing media change or dilution to be performed with minimal disruption to the spheroids. Cells in magnetic spheroids showed good viability and displayed typical 3D morphology. Using this platform, a 28 day study was carried out using doxorubicin on magnetic MCF-7 spheroids. The results provided a proof-of-principle for using magnetic tumor spheroids in therapeutic studies.

In this mu-PECD, aptamers modified three-dimensional macroporous Au-paper electrode (Au-PE) was fabricated and employed as the working electrode for specific and efficient cancer cell capture as well as for sequential in-electrode 3D cell culture. This Au-PE showed enhanced capture capacity for cancer cells and good biocompatibility for preserving the activity of captured living cells. Sensitive cancer cell detection was achieved in this mu-PECD, which could respond down to four HL-60 cells in 10 mu L volume with a wide linear calibration range from 5.0 x 10(2) to 7.5 x 10(7) cells mL(-1) and exhibited good stability and reproducibility. Then, in situ anticancer drug screening was successfully implemented in this mu-PECD through monitoring of the apoptotic cancer cells after the in-electrode 3D cell culture with drug-containing culture medium, demonstrating its wide range of potential applications to facilitate effective clinical cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Although the combination of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine is used as therapy for this disease, these drugs can have serious side effects and its use is limited in pregnancy. Therefore there is a need for new anti-T. gondii drugs in the clinic. Some systems for T. gondii drug screening have been described, but these have limitations and can be difficult. In order to solve these problems, we established a system to screen drugs in vitro that involved using cell viability methods to calculate drug selectivities, which are Trypan blue, [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-zyl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazoliuzolium, inner salt] (MTS) method and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. These assays were simple to establish and perform. The IC50 values calculated from the morphological assay were not significantly different from the EC50 values calculated using the other three methods. In particular, the results of the morphological assay showed a distinct association with the MTS assay (R = 0.9841). These assays could be used for a wide range of applications in the screening of new drugs and may provide an alternative to the techniques currently used to screen for candidate anti-T. gondii compounds in vitro. In this study, we also tested many compounds and identified some that had a good anti-T. gondii effect in vitro based on the MTS assay. This simple and fast system allowed us to determine which compounds to investigate further using in vivo experiments. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Micro-size exclusion chromatography coupled with capillary liquid chromatography (capLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) provides a rapid and simple approach to the preliminary screening of active ligands toward a specific target macromolecule. In this study, the effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated by a number of small molecule ligands with known binding affinities towards the protein target. All ligands were incubated together with a target protein under native conditions. Separation was then achieved by microcentrifugation where the high molecular weight (MW) compounds were selectively passed through the size-exclusion material. The retained low MW compounds were then recovered and analyzed by capLC/MS. The absence of the ligand indicated strong affinity towards the target, while ligand detection indicated inactivity. This assay demonstrated the drugs that were acting as strong inhibitors of Co-PDF from those showing to be comparatively inactive. The relative binding rank order of the drugs towards Co-PDF was also determined. The results were validated by a corresponding set of control experiments in which the target molecules were excluded from the process. In principle, high-throughput micro-size exclusion chromatography, coupled with capLC/MS, offers a powerful technique as a preliminary screen in determining both the strong binding affinity and the relative affinity rank ordering of ligands towards a specific target macromolecule, and is complementary with other analytical drug screening techniques.",

The programme now screens 1.3 million women each year, about 75% of those invited, and diagnoses about 10,000 breast cancers annually. Although some have questioned the value of screening for breast cancer, the scientific evidence demonstrates clearly that regular mammographic screening between the ages of 50 and 70 years reduces mortality from the malignancy. Screened women are slightly more likely than unscreened women to be diagnosed with breast cancer. The cancers in screened women are smaller and are less likely to be treated with mastectomy than they would have been if diagnosed without screening. For every 400 women screened regularly by the NHSBSP over a 10-year period, one woman fewer will die from breast cancer than would have died without screening. The current NHSBSP saves an estimated 1400 lives each year in England. The screening programme spends about pound sterling 3000 for every year of life saved.",

We then evaluated whether the candidate hit compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on the growth of two model mycobacterial strains: Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium vanbaalenii. Two compounds (KE3 and KE4) showed potent inhibitory effects against both model mycobacterial strains. In addition, we rescreened KE4 analogs, which were identified from a compound library of 461,383 chemicals through fingerprint analysis and genetic algorithm-based docking simulations. All of the KE4 analogs (KES1-KES5) exhibited inhibitory effects on the growth of M. smegmatis and/or M. vanbaalenii. Based on the predicted binding modes, we probed the structure-activity relationships of KE4 and its analogs and found a correlative relationship between the IC50 values and the interaction residues/LogP values. The most potent inhibitor, compound KES4, strongly and stably inhibited the long-term growth of the model bacteria and showed higher inhibitory effects (IC50 = 4.8 \u03bcM) than isoniazid (IC50 = 5.4 \u03bcM), which is a first-line drug for tuberculosis therapy. Moreover, compound KES4 did not exhibit any toxic effects that impede cell growth in several mammalian cell lines and enterobacteria. The structural and experimental information of these novel chemical compounds will likely be useful for the development of new anti-TB drugs.

The AD brain is characterized by deposition of amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2), which is produced from amyloid precursor protein by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase (presenilin complex)-mediated sequential cleavage. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells potentially provide an opportunity to generate a human cell-based model of AD that would be crucial for drug discovery as well as for investigating mechanisms of the disease.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We differentiated human iPS (hiPS) cells into neuronal cells expressing the forebrain marker, Foxg1, and the neocortical markers, Cux1, Satb2, Ctip2, and Tbr1. The iPS cell-derived neuronal cells also expressed amyloid precursor protein, \u03b2-secretase, and \u03b3-secretase components, and were capable of secreting A\u03b2 into the conditioned media. A\u03b2 production was inhibited by \u03b2-secretase inhibitor, \u03b3-secretase inhibitor (GSI), and an NSAID; however, there were different susceptibilities to all three drugs between early and late differentiation stages. At the early differentiation stage, GSI treatment caused a fast increase at lower dose (A\u03b2 surge) and drastic decline of A\u03b2 production.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that the hiPS cell-derived neuronal cells express functional \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases involved in A\u03b2 production; however, anti-A\u03b2 drug screening using these hiPS cell-derived neuronal cells requires sufficient neuronal differentiation.",

        "abstract": "The primary cause of death from breast cancer is the progressive growth of tumors and resistance to conventional therapies. It is currently believed that recurrent cancer is repopulated according to a recently proposed cancer stem cell hypothesis. New therapeutic strategies that specifically target cancer stem-like cells may represent a new avenue of cancer therapy. We aimed to discover novel compounds that target breast cancer stem-like cells. We used a dye-exclusion method to isolate side population (SP) cancer cells and, subsequently, subjected these SP cells to a sphere formation assay to generate SP spheres (SPS) from breast cancer cell lines. Surface markers, stemness genes, and tumorigenicity were used to test stem properties. We performed a high-throughput drug screening using these SPS. The effects of candidate compounds were assessed in vitro and in vivo. We successfully generated breast cancer SPS with stem-like properties. These SPS were enriched for CD44(high) (2.8-fold) and CD24(low) (4-fold) cells. OCT4 and ABCG2 were overexpressed in SPS. Moreover, SPS grew tumors at a density of 10(3), whereas an equivalent number of parental cells did not initiate tumor formation. A clinically approved drug, niclosamide, was identified from the LOPAC chemical library of 1,258 compounds. Niclosamide downregulated stem pathways, inhibited the formation of spheroids, and induced apoptosis in breast cancer SPS. Animal studies also confirmed this therapeutic effect. The results of this proof-of-principle study may facilitate the development of new breast cancer therapies in the near future. The extension of niclosamide clinical trials is warranted.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Work-related injuries exert a great financial and economic burden on the US population. The study objectives were to identify the industries and occupations associated with worker injuries and to determine the predictors for injured worker drug screening in trauma centers.\\n\\nMETHODS: Work-related injury cases were selected using three criteria (expected payer source of workers' compensation, industry-related e-codes, and work-related indicator) from the Kentucky Trauma Registry data set for years 2008 to 2012. Descriptive analyses and multiple logistic regression were performed on the work-related injury cases.\\n\\nRESULTS: The \"other services\" and construction industry sectors accounted for the highest number of work-related cases. Drugs were detected in 55% of all drug-screened work-related trauma cases. Higher percentages of injured workers tested positive for drugs in the natural resources and mining, transportation and public utilities, and construction industries. In comparison, higher percentages of injured workers in the other services as well as transportation and public utilities industries were drug screened. Treatment at Level I trauma centers and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores indicating a coma or severe brain injury were both significant independent predictors for being screened for drugs; industry was not a significant predictor for being drug screened. The injured worker was more likely to be drug screened if the worker had a greater than mild injury, regardless of whether the worker was an interfacility transfer.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: These findings indicate that there may be elevated drug use or abuse in natural resources and mining, transportation and public utilities, as well as construction industry workers; improved identification of the specific drug types in positive drug screen results of injured workers is needed to better target prevention efforts.\\n\\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Epidemiologic study, level III.",

        "abstract": "Microwell technology has revolutionized many aspects of in vitro cellular studies from 2D traditional cultures to 3D in vivo-like functional assays. However, existing lithography-based approaches are often costly and time-consuming. This study presents a rapid, low-cost prototyping method of CO2 laser ablation of a conventional untreated culture dish to create concave microwells used for generating multicellular aggregates, which can be readily available for general laboratories. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and polystyrene (PS) microwells are investigated, and each produces distinctive microwell features. Among these three materials, PS cell culture dishes produce the optimal surface smoothness and roundness. A549 lung cancer cells are grown to form cancer aggregates of controllable size from \u224840 to \u224880 \u03bcm in PS microwells. Functional assays of spheroids are performed to study migration on 2D substrates and in 3D hydrogel conditions as a step towards recapitulating the dissemination of cancer cells. Preclinical anti-cancer drug screening is investigated and reveals considerable differences between 2D and 3D conditions, indicating the importance of assay type as well as the utility of the present approach.",

        "title": "A preliminary report on spinal muscular atrophy lymphoblastoid cell lines: are they an appropriate tool for drug screening?",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease of the motor neurons that results in progressive muscle weakness. It is also the leading hereditary cause of infant mortality. Homozygous loss of the survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene causes SMA, and the number of copies of the SMN2 gene modulates the severity of the disease. Increasing the expression of the SMN2 gene by pharmacological agents is one of the therapeutic approaches currently being implemented. METHODS: In this preliminary study, we investigated the effect of phenylbutyrate, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, on SMN2 expression in two SMA type III Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines to understand the suitability of lymphoblastoid cell lines in drug screening. These cell lines are regarded as a good source as they can easily be established from the peripheral leucocytes of patients. Quantitative analysis of SMN2 mRNA was performed on established cell lines treated with various concentrations of phenylbutyrate and for a range of incubation periods using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Western blot analysis was used to determine SMN protein levels. RESULTS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the levels of SMN2 full-length (fl-SMN2) transcripts and protein were not increased in phenylbutyrate-treated cell lines compared to non-treated controls. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines are not suitable for studying the effect of certain HDAC inhibitors on SMN2 gene expression.",

        "abstract": "The observed stability of a protein is altered when ligands bind, which results in a shift in the melting temperature (T(m)). Binding to the native state in the absence of binding to the denatured state will necessarily lead to an increase in the T(m), while binding to the unfolded state in the absence of native state binding will decrease the T(m) relative to that of the protein in the absence of ligand. These effects are required by the thermodynamics of reversible folding. However, the relationship between binding affinity and the magnitude of the observed temperature shift is not a simple correlation (i.e., a larger shift in T(m) does not necessarily mean tighter binding) and is complicated by interaction with the denatured state. Using exact simulations, the range of behavior for the dependence of the observed T(m) shift on the energetics of ligand binding is investigated here. Specifically, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves are simulated for protein unfolding in the presence of ligands binding to both the native and denatured states. The results have implications for drug screening and the determination of heat capacity changes for protein unfolding.",

        "abstract": "Plasmodium gametocytes (GCT) have recently been proposed as a crucial target for the development of new antimalarials in order to achieve malaria elimination and eventually eradication. At present, however, a widely accepted and routinely used screening method for potential gametocytocidal drugs does not exist. The aim of our work was to adapt the parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), already standardised for drug screening on asexual stages, to measure gametocyte drug sensitivity. In clinics the GCT- pLDH, which is present during all the five stages of gametocyte development, can be measured with good sensitivity through OptiMAL, an immunochromatographic diagnostic test. The pLDH assay is fast, simple, not expensive and does not require complex equipment or special waste disposal. It can be applied to field isolates since transgenesis is not needed. Gametocytogenesis of two different strains of P. falciparum, 3D7 and NF54, was induced in vitro using a standardized protocol, asexual parasites were removed by N-acetylglucosamine treatment, and GCT were seeded in 96well plates. A linear correlation between the percentage of gametocytemia, microscopically counted by Giemsa staining, and the optical density, measured spectroscopically by pLDH assay, was demonstrated. A good signal to noise ratio was obtained with the pLDH assay, and the Z' factor was calculated as indicator of the robustness of the method. Our data also indicate that GCT have a pLDH activity higher than asexual parasites. GCT were treated for 48-72h with primaquine, the gold standard against mature gametocytes in vivo, which was used to validate most of the GCT screening methods in literature; dihydroartemisinin, active on young GCT; and methylene blue, an old antimalarial recently characterised also for its anti-GCT activity. Finally, epoxomicin was tested since its strong gametocytocidal effect has been recently reported. Dose-response curves were obtained with all the four drugs. However, some discrepancies were observed between the Giemsa staining and the pLDH detection at high concentrations of the drugs, suggesting that morphological abnormalities, detected microscopically, precede the decay of pLDH activity in drug-treated GCT. In order to better understand these observations, we prolonged the treatment for further 72h. This extra-incubation period allowed us to calculate, from the pLDH assay, the IC50 (as the 50% inhibition compared to control untreated GCT) of the tested compounds, which were comparable to those obtained by Giemsa staining. These results demonstrate the feasibility of pLDH assay to measure GCT content in culture. Although more specific probes for GCT viability need to be standardized for measuring stage-specific drug activity, pLDH can be used as the first, fast and cheap screening method to find potential gametocitocydal drugs.",

        "abstract": "Chagas disease, a neglected illness, affects nearly 12-14 million people in endemic areas of Latin America.  Although the occurrence of acute cases sharply has declined due to Southern Cone Initiative efforts to control vector transmission, there still remain serious challenges, including the maintenance of sustainable public policies for Chagas disease control and the urgent need for better drugs to treat chagasic patients.  Since the introduction of benznidazole and nifurtimox approximately 40 years ago, many natural and synthetic compounds have been assayed against Trypanosoma cruzi, yet only a few compounds have advanced to clinical trials.  This reflects, at least in part, the lack of consensus regarding appropriate in vitro and in vivo screening protocols as well as the lack of biomarkers for treating parasitaemia.  The development of more effective drugs requires (i) the identification and validation of parasite targets, (ii) compounds to be screened against the targets or the whole parasite and (iii) a panel of minimum standardised procedures to advance leading compounds to clinical trials.  This third aim was the topic of the workshop entitled Experimental Models in Drug Screening and Development for Chagas Disease, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on the 25th and 26th of November 2008 by the Fiocruz Program for Research and Technological Development on Chagas Disease and Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative.  During the meeting, the minimum steps, requirements and decision gates for the determination of the efficacy of novel drugs for T. cruzi control were evaluated by interdisciplinary experts and an in vitro and in vivo flowchart was designed to serve as a general and standardised protocol for screening potential drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease.[on SciFinder (R)]",

In this sense, there is an urgent need for new drugs as a treatment solution for this neglected disease. Here we show the development and implementation of an automated high-throughput viability screening assay for the discovery of new drugs against Leishmania. Assay validation was done with Leishmania promastigote forms, including the screening of 4,000 compounds with known pharmacological properties. In an attempt to find new compounds with leishmanicidal properties, 26,500 structurally diverse chemical compounds were screened. A cut-off of 70% growth inhibition in the primary screening led to the identification of 567 active compounds. Cellular toxicity and selectivity were responsible for the exclusion of 78% of the pre-selected compounds. The activity of the remaining 124 compounds was confirmed against the intramacrophagic amastigote form of the parasite. In vitro microsomal stability and cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition of the two most active compounds from this screening effort were assessed to obtain preliminary information on their metabolism in the host. The HTS approach employed here resulted in the discovery of two new antileishmanial compounds, bringing promising candidates to the leishmaniasis drug discovery pipeline.",

        "abstract": "Immunoassay is currently the most common approach for urine drug screening. However, the continuous emergence of new psychoactive substances (NPS) and their low urinary concentrations have challenged the scope and sensitivity of immunoassays. Consequently, specialized toxicology laboratories rely more and more on mass spectrometry (MS) based techniques. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS) is an especially attractive technique for comprehensive drug screening. The objective was to compare the performances of immunoassay and UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS in terms of scope, flexibility, sensitivity, and reliability of substance identification. A total of 279 post-mortem urine samples were analyzed using a method representative of each technique. The immunoassay method was an Emit II Plus enzyme immunoassay for the following drug groups: amphetamines, benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, cannabis, and opiates. The UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS method was a recently published method covering hundreds of drugs: conventional drugs of abuse, abused prescription drugs, and NPS of various classes. UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS produced a lower number of false positive (FP) results for the drug groups covered by immunoassay. Many of the false negative (FN, n = 40) and FP (n = 22) immunoassay results were obviously due to the higher cut-off concentrations and interfering matrix, respectively. Moreover, the wider scope of UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS allowed detection of NPS and prescription drugs. UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS gave FP results related to a few particular substances. The future option of adjusting all compound-specific reporting parameters individually would allow the method's sensitivity and specificity to be fully exploited.",

        "abstract": "The development of preclinical models amenable to live animal bioactive compound screening is an attractive approach to discovering effective pharmacological therapies for disorders caused by misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins. In general, however, live animal drug screening is labor and resource intensive, and has been hampered by the lack of robust assay designs and high throughput work-flows. Based on their small size, tissue transparency and ease of cultivation, the use of C. elegans should obviate many of the technical impediments associated with live animal drug screening. Moreover, their genetic tractability and accomplished record for providing insights into the molecular and cellular basis of human disease, should make C. elegans an ideal model system for in vivo drug discovery campaigns. The goal of this study was to determine whether C. elegans could be adapted to high-throughput and high-content drug screening strategies analogous to those developed for cell-based systems. Using transgenic animals expressing fluorescently-tagged proteins, we first developed a high-quality, high-throughput work-flow utilizing an automated fluorescence microscopy platform with integrated image acquisition and data analysis modules to qualitatively assess different biological processes including, growth, tissue development, cell viability and autophagy. We next adapted this technology to conduct a small molecule screen and identified compounds that altered the intracellular accumulation of the human aggregation prone mutant that causes liver disease in \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency. This study provides powerful validation for advancement in preclinical drug discovery campaigns by screening live C. elegans modeling \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency and other complex disease phenotypes on high-content imaging platforms.",

The wafer-level fabrication features thin-film platinum and iridium oxide microelectrodes on a glass chip, microfluidics in an epoxy resist, a hybrid assembly and an on-chip reference electrode. The reliable analytical performance of the sensors in cell culture medium was demonstrated. The pH sensors exhibit a long-term stable, linear response. The oxygen sensors show a linear behaviour, which is also observed for low oxygen concentrations. Glucose and lactate measurements show a linear, long-term stable, selective and reversible behaviour in the desired range. T98G human brain cancer cells were cultivated and cell culture metabolism was measured on-chip. Stop/flow cycles were applied and extracellular acidification, respiration, glucose consumption and lactate production were quantified. Long-term metabolic rates were determined and all parameters could be measured in the outlet channel. A placement downstream of the cell cultivation area for biosensors was realised. A highly effective medium exchange and undiluted sampling from the cell culture chamber with low flow rates (2 \u03bcl min(-1)) and low volumes (15 \u03bcl per cycle) were achieved.

A computational docking study using the X-ray crystallographic structure of CDK2 in complex with CR229 was evaluated. This predicted binding mode study of CR229 with CDK2 demonstrated that CR229 interacted effectively with the Leu83 and Glu81 residues in the ATP-binding pocket of CDK2 for the possible hydrogen bond formation. Furthermore, biochemical studies on inhibitory effects of CR229 on various kinases in the human cervical cancer HeLa cells demonstrated that CR229 was a potent inhibitor of CDK2 (IC50: 3 microM), CDK1 (IC50: 4.9 microM), and CDK4 (IC50: 3 microM), yet had much less inhibitory effect (IC50: >20 microM) on other kinases, such as casein kinase 2-1 (CK2- alpha1), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC). Accordingly, these data demonstrate that CR229 is a potent CDK inhibitor with anticancer efficacy.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Damage to segmental motoneurons and to spinal cord parenchyma cause denervation atrophy to the muscles, contributing to the chronic disability originated by spinal cord injury (SCI) and spinal motor neuron diseases. After SCI, damage is promoted by several underlying mechanisms, including release of glutamate and consequent over-activation of glutamate receptors, mainly NMDA receptors, that lead to neuronal death. Due to the lack of effective treatments for such conditions, new alternatives need to be explored. METHODS: In order to perform a relatively quick and high-fidelity drug screening, we optimized a postnatal rat organotypic spinal cord culture. By using a glutamate excitotoxic model of spinal cord damage on the explants, we compared the neuroprotective efficacy of four agents: methylprednisolone, erythropoietin, riluzole and rolipram. We evaluated the number of surviving ventral motor neurons stained with the SMI32 antibody and estimated the cord tissue preservation by quantifying the amount of EthD fluorescent probe incorporated into the cells. RESULTS: The best tissue protection was achieved with riluzole (98%) whereas the highest motoneuron preservation was obtained with methylprednisolone (92%). CONCLUSION: The in vitro model used may serve to initiate comparative analyses of new compounds to narrow the choice for future neuroprotective agents to be tested in vivo.",

Microfluidic networks on copolyester and poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates are fabricated by silicon template imprinting and capillary molding techniques. The first device is developed to perform affinity capture, concentration, and direct identification of targeted compounds using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) membranes sandwiched between the imprinted copolyester microchannels in an integrated platform provide continuous affinity dialysis and concentration of a reaction mixture containing aflatoxin B1 antibody and aflatoxins. The second microfluidic device is composed of microchannels on the poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates. The device is designed to perform miniaturized ultrafiltration of affinity complexes of phenobarbital antibody and barbiturates, including the sequential loading, washing, and dissociation steps. These microfabricated devices not only significantly reduce dead volume and sample consumption but also increase the detection sensitivity by at least 1-2 orders of magnitude over those reported previously. Improvements in detection sensitivity are attributed to analyte preconcentration during the affinity purification step, limited analyte dilution in the microdialysis junction, minimal sample loss, and the amenability of ESI-MS to nanoscale sample flow rates.",

To investigate toxicity of pharmaceutical compounds, five toxic chemicals, indomethacin, dexamethasone, hydroxyurea, 5-fluorouracil, and cytosine arabinoside were applied in mouse ES cells during formation of EBs. Using microscopic evaluation, the size of EBs was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with pharmaceutical chemicals. While apoptosis-related proteins, cleaved caspase-3 and PARP, were decreased in compound-exposed EBs, necrosis-related protein (Hmgb1) was present in culture media of EBs, indicating that detection of Hmgb1 can result in activation of necrosis by pharmaceutical compounds. While pharmaceutical compounds impaired the differentiation of mES cells linked with spontaneous apoptotic cell death, it was determined that cytotoxic cell damage is necrosis-dependent in mES cells. In addition, an apoptotic transcript (Noxa mRNA) in toxicant-exposed EBs was decreased in parallel with apoptosis-related proteins. Following impairment of apoptosis, differentiation-related markers including un-differentiation (. Sox2), endoderm (. Hnf4), mesoderm (. Bmp4), and ectoderm (. Pax6) also fluctuated by treatment with pharmaceutical compounds. Taken together, the data imply that exposure to pharmaceutical compounds results in increased cell death hindering the spontaneous apoptosis of cells to undergo differentiation. Using both characteristics of ES cells like self-renewal or cellular pluripotency and potentials of ES cells for evaluation in toxicity of various compounds, the current study was conducted for establishment of a novel drug screening system beyond hidden virtues of the well-known chemicals.",

        "abstract": "Chagas disease, a neglected illness, affects nearly 12-14 million people in endemic areas of Latin America. Although the occurrence of acute cases sharply has declined due to Southern Cone Initiative efforts to control vector transmission, there still remain serious challenges, including the maintenance of sustainable public policies for Chagas disease control and the urgent need for better drugs to treat chagasic patients. Since the introduction of benznidazole and nifurtimox approximately 40 years ago, many natural and synthetic compounds have been assayed against Trypanosoma cruzi, yet only a few compounds have advanced to clinical trials. This reflects, at least in part, the lack of consensus regarding appropriate in vitro and in vivo screening protocols as well as the lack of biomarkers for treating parasitaemia. The development of more effective drugs requires (i) the identification and validation of parasite targets, (ii) compounds to be screened against the targets or the whole parasite and (iii) a panel of minimum standardised procedures to advance leading compounds to clinical trials. This third aim was the topic of the workshop entitled Experimental Models in Drug Screening and Development for Chagas Disease, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on the 25th and 26th of November 2008 by the Fiocruz Program for Research and Technological Development on Chagas Disease and Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative. During the meeting, the minimum steps, requirements and decision gates for the determination of the efficacy of novel drugs for T. cruzi control were evaluated by interdisciplinary experts and an in vitro and in vivo flowchart was designed to serve as a general and standardised protocol for screening potential drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease.",

        "abstract": "As breast cancer is a disease of multiple cell types in which the growth, invasion, and metastasis of epithelial carcinomas is heavily influenced by the surrounding cell types, screening of anti-cancer compounds using cancer cell lines grown in 2D often overestimates drug potency. Regulatory agencies are currently seeking improved preclinical oncology models to overcome hurdles to efficient drug development, including bridging the gap between the use of 2D cell lines and 3D animal models. One way to more accurately determine the effects of anti-cancer compounds is through the use of cancer tissue models that incorporate stromal cells of the tumor microenvironment. Breast stroma, composed of fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and adipocytes, plays a key role in the process of carcinogenesis and metastasis. These cell types secrete extracellular matrix, growth factors, and hormones that affect how therapeutic agents access and target cancer cells. We have used Organovo's NovoGen BioprintingTM Platform to develop a model of human breast cancer in which a core of breast cancer cells is surrounded by a physiologically-relevant stromal milieu consisting of adipocytes, mammary fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. This system has several advantages over current screening tools, including the ability to simultaneously measure the effects of small molecules on cancer cells as well as different cell types in the breast microenvironment. Histological analyses of bioprinted neotissues demonstrated that they were stable and viable for at least 14 days in culture and characterized by interaction between stroma and carcinoma compartments. Incorporation of endothelial cells into the 3D neotissue led to the formation of robust microvascular networks. Breast cancer neotissues were fabricated directly into multi-well plates and used to establish biological response profiles to the standard chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin, paclitaxel, methotrexate, and tamoxifen. The cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on specific cell types within the neotissues were assessed biochemically and histologically. he response of the 3D breast cancer neotissues to chemotherapeutic gents was compared to the response of 2D breast cancer cell lines to determine he relative efficacy of compounds in 2D versus 3D. This model can be used to screen new anti-cancer therapeutics in the context of the in vivo-like microenvironment, leading to enhanced efficiency and accuracy of the drug development process.Citation Format: Shelby M.

By facing down the platform, it was possible to generate independent spheroid bodies in a high throughput manner, in order to mimic in vivo tumour models on the lab-on-chip scale. To validate this system for drug screening purposes, the toxicity of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin in cell spheroids was tested and compared to cells in 2D culture. The advantages presented by this platform, such as feasibility of the system and the ability to control the size uniformity of the spheroid, emphasize its potential to be used as a new low cost toolbox for high-throughput drug screening and in cell or tissue engineering.",

The molecular system consists of the query compound and the other compound(s) selected from a compound library. The newly introduced intermolecular interaction between compounds is proportional to the molecular overlap instead of the van der Waals and Coulomb interactions between atoms of different molecules. This method was able to achieve both conformer generation of molecules and molecular overlapping (alignment) at the same time. After an energy minimization and following short-time MD simulation, the molecules in the system were overlapped with each other and the similarity between compounds was measured by the volume of the overlap. We applied this MD simulation method to ligand-based in-silico drug screening and found that it worked well for several targets. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Cancer screening is a complicated science. Each screening intervention must be carefully assessed before it is widely implemented. A screening test can falsely appear useful as it finds disease at an early stage and leads to intervention and cure. Such a test can be harmful to the population screened if it commonly finds disease that fulfills the pathologic criteria of cancer but behaves indolently (meaning it would never harm the host). Such \"pseudo-disease\" or \"overdiagnosed disease\" has been demonstrated in many malignancies including cancers of the lung, breast, and especially the prostate. The nature of each specific screening test and each disease is such that some screened patients may receive unnecessary treatment with all its complications and risk. Alternatively, some screening technologies have been proven useful providing net benefit to the population screened. Often these beneficial technologies are underused. These screening technologies if widely implemented have the potential of saving countless lives. Many available screening tests have tremendous potential in terms of benefit, but have yet to be fully assessed. At the minimum, patients should be informed of what is known, what is not known, and what is believed about these tests.",

Unfortunately, most of the relevant behavior-related risk factors are not accessible to objective verification. Drug screening can be used to validate a defined section of donor statements. It may be assumed that donors who conceal drug consumption may also conceal other relevant risk factors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Hair and urine samples from 186 young potential donors who denied having consumed drugs were investigated by gas chromatography with mass selective detection and a urine fluorescence polarization immunoassay for cannabinoids, amphetamine and amphetamine derivatives, cocaine, and opiates. RESULTS: Ten potential donors with 14 positive results on hair and urine analyses (6x cannabinoids, 4x cocaine, 1x opiates, 3x dihydrocodeine) could be identified in the population investigated. CONCLUSIONS: The donor history is not adequate for identifying potential donors with risk factors. Deliberately false statements concerning risk factors are a clear breach of trust between the blood bank and potential donors. These unreliable donors represent an incalculable risk for the transfusion recipient. Therefore, it is appropriate to validate donor statements about drug consumption by random hair and urine analyses and to exclude from the donor pool all persons revealed as drug users",

We used albumin as a model system because this transport protein is well established as a binder (both weak and strong) for drug substances. Bovine serum albumin was immobilized on microparticulate diolsilica particles and then packed into a 24-channel cartridge, which served as the separation platform. Analysis of the obtained chromatograms yielded information about affinity even in the millimolar range. Employing this approach, thousands of substances can be screened in just a day.

Upon multi-injections of KCl solution into the culture of PC12 cells attached on a MEA biochip, the K+-stimulated dopamine release was temporally and amperometrically recorded by biochip microelectrodes. Two parameters in the recorded amperometric spectra were defined in this study: the peak current of the first KCl injection (Max1), and the steady current after the fourth KCl injection (St4). Statistically significant effects of L-dopa and reserpine were demonstrated by comparing both Max1 and St4 of the second detections in drugs with those of the control without drug treatment. The values of both Max1 and St4 in the first detections were normalized as 1. In contrast, the statistically significant effect of nomifensine was detected by comparing the ratios of St4 to Max1 in the first detections in drug with those of the control. The reason for using different analytical methods for measurements between L-dopa/reserpine and nomifensine lies in the different mechanisms of action on PC12 cells among these drugs. The novel analytical methods developed use the same detection setup and parameters, and the data analysis for the effect of drugs becomes simple. The methods hence may provide a high-throughput in vitro drug screening approach for dopamine-related psychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Malaria is a major health concern and affects over 300. million people a year. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for new efficacious anti-malarial drugs. A major challenge in developing new anti-malarial drugs is to design active molecules that have preferable drug-like characteristics. These \"drug-like\" characteristics include physiochemical properties that affect drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Compounds with poor ADME profiles will likely fail in vivo due to poor pharmacokinetics and/or other drug delivery related issues. There have been numerous assays developed in order to pre-screen compounds that would likely fail in further development due to poor absorption properties including PAMPA, Caco-2, and MDCK permeability assays. Methods: The use of cell-based permeability assays such as Caco-2 and MDCK serve as surrogate indicators of drug absorption and transport, with the two approaches often used interchangeably. We sought to evaluate both approaches in support of anti-malarial drug development. Accordingly, a comparison of both assays was conducted utilizing apparent permeability coefficient (P<inf>app</inf>) values determined from liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses. Results: Both Caco-2 and MDCK permeability assays produced similar P<inf>app</inf> results for potential anti-malarial compounds with low and medium permeability. Differences were observed for compounds with high permeability and compounds that were P-gp substrates. Additionally, the utility of MDCK-MDR1 permeability measurements was demonstrated in probing the role of P-glycoprotein transport in Primaquine-Chloroquine drug-drug interactions in comparison with in vivo pharmacokinetic changes. Discussion: This study provides an in-depth comparison of the Caco-2 and MDCK-MDR1 cell based permeability assays and illustrates the utility of cell-based permeability assays in anti-malarial drug screening/development in regard to understanding transporter mediated changes in drug absorption/distribution.",

The short time frame needed for xenotransplantation studies means that the zebrafish can serve as an early preclinical drug screening tool and can also help personalize cancer therapy by providing real-time data on the response of the human cells to treatment. In this Review, we summarize the use of zebrafish embryos in drug screening and highlight the potential for xenotransplantation approaches to be adopted as a preclinical tool to identify and prioritize therapies for further clinical evaluation.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper was to research the potential of a dynamic cell model in drug screening by studying the influence of microvascular wall shear stress on the drug absorption of endothelial cells compared to that in the static state. The cells were grown and seeded on gelatin-coated glass slides and were pretreated with extracts of Salviae miltiorrhizae (200 mug/ml) for 1 h. Then oxidative stress damage was produced by H2O2 (300 mumol/l) for 0.5 h under the 1.5 dyn/cm2 shear stress incorporated in a parallel plate flow chamber. Morphological analysis was conducted with an inverted microscope and image analysis software, and high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used for the detection of active compounds. We compared the drug absorption in the dynamic group with that in the static group. In the dynamic model, five compounds and two new metabolite peaks were detected. However, in the static model, four compounds were absorbed by cells, and one metabolite peak was found. This study indicated that there were some effects on the absorption and metabolism of drugs under the microvascular shear stress compared to that under stasis. We infer that shear stress in the microcirculation situation in vivo played a role in causing the differences between drug screening in vitro and in vivo.",

Among them, molecules able to interact with nucleic acids can represent important targets. In this study, an optical DNA biosensor, based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) transduction, has been studied in its potential application as new analytical device for drug screening. This device was applied to the analysis of pure synthetic or natural molecules and also to some fractions obtained by chromatographic separation of an extract of Chelidonium majus L. (great celandine), a plant containing benzo[c]phenanthridinium alkaloids having intercalating properties. The ability of these molecules to interact with the double stranded nucleic acid (dsDNA) immobilised on the sensor surface has been investigated. The optical sensing relies on the SPR-based bench instrument Biacore X\u2122 and represents an example of multiuse sensor. The results obtained demonstrate the potential application of this device for the rapid screening of bioeffective compounds.

        "abstract": "In the continual search of new therapeutics, many possible drug candidates are excluded, because they are found to negatively affect mitochondrial function. We have developed an approach for directly, electrochemically assaying mitochondrial metabolic activity as a function of metabolic substrate to determine drug toxicity. By wiring mouse mitochondria to a carbon electrode surface, electrons can be intercepted before they reach Complex IV, the terminal step of electron transport chain. The electrons are rerouted, to a separate electrode of the electrochemical cell, the cathode. This allows for the direct measurement of electrical current and potential of the mitochondria during their oxidation of substrates such as pyruvate and fatty acids when there are different concentrations of drug present. This analytical technique has been shown to reliably assay several classical mitochondrial toxins and exhibits potential for the further development of a drug candidate screening technique, as well as other applications where the quantitative study of mitochondrial dysfunction is important.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ca\u00b2(+)-activated Cl\u207b channels (CaCCs) participate in many important physiological processes. However, the lack of effective and selective blockers has hindered the study of these channels, mostly due to the lack of good assay system. Here, we have developed a reliable drug screening method for better blockers of CaCCs, using the endogeneous CaCCs in Xenopus laevis oocytes and two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) technique.\\n\\nRESULTS: Oocytes were prepared with a treatment of Ca\u00b2(+) ionophore, which was followed by a treatment of thapsigargin which depletes Ca\u00b2(+) stores to eliminate any contribution of Ca\u00b2(+) release. TEVC was performed with micropipette containing chelerythrine to prevent PKC dependent run-up or run-down. Under these conditions, Ca\u00b2(+)-activated Cl\u207b currents induced by bath application of Ca\u00b2(+) to oocytes showed stable peak amplitude when repetitively activated, allowing us to test several concentrations of a test compound from one oocyte. Inhibitory activities of commercially available blockers and synthesized anthranilic acid derivatives were tested using this method. As a result, newly synthesized N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)anthranilic acid with trifluoromethyl group (-CF\u2083) at para position on the benzene ring showed the lowest IC\u2085\u2080.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our results provide an optimal drug screening strategy suitable for high throughput screening, and propose N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)anthranilic acid as an improved CaCC blocker.",

        "abstract": "Drug discovery is the process of identifying compounds which have potentially meaningful biological activity. A major challenge that arises is that the number of compounds to search over can be quite large, sometimes numbering in the millions, making experimental testing intractable. For this reason computational methods are employed to filter out those compounds which do not exhibit strong biological activity. This filtering step, also called virtual screening reduces the search space, allowing for the remaining compounds to be experimentally tested.In this paper we propose several novel approaches to the problem of virtual screening based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and on a kernel-based extension. Spectral learning ideas motivate our proposed new method called Indefinite Kernel CCA (IKCCA). We show the strong performance of this approach both for a toy problem as well as using real world data with dramatic improvements in predictive accuracy of virtual screening over an existing methodology.",

        "abstract": "Postmortem drug findings yield important analytical evidence in medical examiner casework, and chromatography coupled with nominal mass spectrometry (MS) serves as the predominant general unknown screening approach. We report screening by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MS(E)-TOF), with comparison to previously validated nominal mass UPLC-MS and UPLC-MS-MS methods. UPLC-MS(E)-TOF screening for over 950 toxicologically relevant drugs and metabolites was performed in a full-spectrum (m/z 50-1,000) mode using an MS(E) acquisition of both molecular and fragment ion data at low (6 eV) and ramped (10-40 eV) collision energies. Mass error averaged 1.27 ppm for a large panel of reference drugs and metabolites. The limit of detection by UPLC-MS(E)-TOF ranges from 0.5 to 100 ng/mL and compares closely with UPLC-MS-MS. The influence of column recovery and matrix effect on the limit of detection was demonstrated with ion suppression by matrix components correlating closely with early and late eluting reference analytes. Drug and metabolite findings by UPLC-MS(E)-TOF were compared with UPLC-MS and UPLC-MS-MS analyses of postmortem blood in 300 medical examiner cases. Positive findings by all methods totaled 1,528, with a detection rate of 57% by UPLC-MS, 72% by UPLC-MS-MS and 80% by combined UPLC-MS and UPLC-MS-MS screening. Compared with nominal mass screening methods, UPLC-MS(E)-TOF screening resulted in a 99% detection rate and, in addition, offered the potential for the detection of nontargeted analytes via high-resolution acquisition of molecular and fragment ion data.",

        "abstract": "Leishmania amazonensis recombinants expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) gene or beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) were constructed for drug screening and histopathological analysis. The egfp or lacZ in a leishmanial transfection vector, p6.5, was introduced into L. amazonensis promastigotes, and egfp or lacZ-carrying recombinant L. amazonensis, La/egfp and La/lacZ, respectively, were obtained. Expression of egfp or lacZ in both promastigotes and amastigotes could be clearly visualized by fluorescence microscopy or by light microscopy with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal), respectively. Fluorescence signal and beta-galactosidase activity measured by a colorimetric reaction with chlorophenol red beta-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG) were well correlated to the numbers of these parasites. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) of a leishmanicidal drug, amphotericin B, in L. amazonensis promastigotes measured using La/egfp and La/lacZ was similar to that measured by conventional methods such as cell counting, thymidine incorporation and colorimetric assay. Furthermore, the fluorescence signal and absorbance of CPRG correlated well with the numbers of La/egfp and La/lacZ amastigotes in macrophages, respectively, suggesting La/egfp and La/lacZ can be a convenient and useful tool for drug screening not only in promastigotes, but also in amastigotes of L. amazonensis. La/lacZ collected from mouse tissues four weeks after the parasite infection were stained well with X-Gal. La/lacZ allowed parasite detection at high sensitivity in the tissues of infected mice and will be useful for following infections in macrophages in vivo. Thus, the marker-transfected Leishmania parasites constructed in this study will be useful for analyses of Leishmania parasites, especially at the intracellular stage.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Visits to settings such as emergency departments (EDs) may present a \"teachable moment\" in that a patient may be more open to feedback and suggestions regarding their risky alcohol and illicit drug-use behaviors. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an 'opportunistic' public health approach that targets low-risk users, in addition to those already dependent on alcohol and/or drugs. SBIRT programs provide patients with comprehensive screening and assessments, and deliver interventions of appropriate intensity to reduce risks related to alcohol and drug use. METHODS: This study used a single group pre-post test design to assess the effect of the California SBIRT service program (i.e., CASBIRT) on 6 substance-use outcomes (past-month prevalence and number of days of binge drinking, illegal drug use, and marijuana use). Trained bilingual/bicultural Health Educators attempted to screen all adult patients in 12 EDs/trauma centers (regardless of the reason for the patient's visit) using a short instrument, and then delivered a brief motivational intervention matched to the patient's risk level. A total of 2,436 randomly selected patients who screened positive for alcohol and/or drug use consented to be in a 6-month telephone follow-up interview. Because of the high loss to follow-up rate, we used an intention-to-treat approach for the data analysis. RESULTS: RESULTS of generalized linear mixed models showed modest reductions in all 6 drug-and alcohol-use outcomes. Men (versus women), those at relatively higher risk status (versus lower risk), and those with only one substance of misuse (versus both alcohol and illicit drug misuse) tended to show more positive change. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SBIRT services provided in acute care settings are associated with modest changes in self-reported recent alcohol and illicit drug use.",

A comprehensive method of mimicking a 3D microenvironment to study effects of anticancer drugs on specific cancer types is essential. Here, we report the development of a three- dimensional microfluidic cell array (3D \u03bcFCA), which reconstructs a 3D tumor microenvironment with cancer cells and microvascular endothelial cells. To mimic the in vivo spatial relationship between microvessels and nonendothelial cells embedded in extracellular matrix, three polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers were built into this array. The multilayer property of the device enabled the imitation of the drug delivery in a microtissue array with simulated blood circulation. This 3D \u03bcFCA system may provide better predictions of drug responses and identification of a suitable treatment for a specific patient if biopsy samples are used. To the pharmaceutical industry, the scaling-up of our 3D \u03bcFCA system may offer a novel high throughput screening tool.",

        "abstract": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality around the world. Despite some success, traditional anticancer drugs developed to reduce tumor growth face important limitations primarily due to undesirable bone marrow and cardiovascular toxicity. Many drugs fail in clinical development after showing promise in preclinical trials, suggesting that the available in vitro and animal models are poor predictors of drug efficacy and toxicity in humans. Thus, novel models that more accurately mimic the biology of human organs are necessary for high-throughput drug screening. Three-dimensional (3D) microphysiological systems can utilize induced pluripotent stem cell technology, tissue engineering, and microfabrication techniques to develop tissue models of human tumors, cardiac muscle, and bone marrow on the order of 1\u2009mm(3) in size. A functional network of human capillaries and microvessels to overcome diffusion limitations in nutrient delivery and waste removal can also nourish the 3D microphysiological tissues. Importantly, the 3D microphysiological tissues are grown on optically clear platforms that offer non-invasive and non-destructive image acquisition with subcellular resolution in real time. Such systems offer a new paradigm for high-throughput drug screening and will significantly improve the efficiency of identifying new drugs for cancer treatment that minimize cardiac and bone marrow toxicity.",

Here, we present a novel scoring function, MedusaScore, for evaluating protein-ligand binding. MedusaScore is based on models of physical interactions that include van der Waals, solvation, and hydrogen bonding energies. To ensure the best transferability of the scoring function, we do not use any protein-ligand experimental data for parameter training. We then test the MedusaScore for docking decoy recognition and binding affinity prediction and find superior performance compared to other widely used scoring functions. Statistical analysis indicates that one source of inaccuracy of MedusaScore may arise from the unaccounted entropic loss upon ligand binding, which suggests avenues of approach for further MedusaScore improvement.",

        "abstract": "Drug candidate and toxicity screening processes currently rely on results from early-stage in vitro cell-based assays expected to faithfully represent essential aspects of in vivo pharmacology and toxicology. Several in vitro designs are optimized for high throughput to benefit screening efficiencies, allowing the entire libraries of potential pharmacologically relevant or possible toxin molecules to be screened for different types of cell signals relevant to tissue damage or to therapeutic goals. Creative approaches to multiplexed cell-based assay designs that select specific cell types, signaling pathways and reporters are routine. However, substantial percentages of new chemical and biological entities (NCEs/NBEs) that fail late-stage human drug testing, or receive regulatory \"black box\" warnings, or that are removed from the market for safety reasons after regulatory approvals all provide strong evidence that in vitro cell-based assays and subsequent preclinical in vivo studies do not yet provide sufficient pharmacological and toxicity data or reliable predictive capacity for understanding drug candidate performance in vivo. Without a reliable translational assay tool kit for pharmacology and toxicology, the drug development process is costly and inefficient in taking initial in vitro cell-based screens to in vivo testing and subsequent clinical approvals. Commonly employed methods of in vitro testing, including dissociated, organotypic, organ/explant, and 3-D cultures, are reviewed here with specific focus on retaining cell and molecular interactions and physiological parameters that determine cell phenotypes and their corresponding responses to bioactive agents. Distinct advantages and performance challenges for these models pertinent to cell-based assay and their predictive capabilities required for accurate correlations to in vivo mechanisms of drug toxicity are compared.",

        "abstract": "In contrast to GC-MS libraries, currently available LC-MS libraries for toxicological detection contain besides parent drugs only some main metabolites limiting their applicability for urine screening. Therefore, a metabolite-based LC-MS(n) screening procedure was developed and exemplified for antidepressants. The library was built up with MS(2) and MS(3) wideband spectra using an LXQ linear ion trap with electrospray ionization in the positive mode and full-scan information-dependent acquisition. Pure substance spectra were recorded in methanolic solution and metabolite spectra in urine from rats after administration of the corresponding drugs. After identification, the metabolite spectra were added to the library. Various drugs and metabolites could be sufficiently separated. Recovery, process efficiency, matrix effects, and limits of detection for selected drugs were determined using protein precipitation. Automatic data evaluation was performed using ToxID and SmileMS software. The library consists of over 700 parent compounds including 45 antidepressants, over 1,600 metabolites, and artifacts. Protein precipitation led to sufficient results for sample preparation. ToxID and SmileMS were both suitable for target screening with some pros and cons. In our study, only SmileMS was suitable for untargeted screening being not limited to precursor selection. The LC-MS(n) method was suitable for urine screening as exemplified for antidepressants. It also allowed detecting unknown compounds based on known fragment structures. As ion suppression can never be excluded, it is advantageous to have several targets per drug. Furthermore, the detection of metabolites confirms the body passage. The presented LC-MS(n) method complements established GC-MS or LC-MS procedures in the authors' lab.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: \"Therapeutic Targeting of Glioblastoma\" is a new pan-Canadian research team of the Terry Fox Research Institute and the Canadian Stem Cell Network funded to discover efficacious therapeutics for GBM. The team's goals are also to discover novel signaling pathways regulating GBM cell survival and genetic alterations that mediate drug resistance. As a platform, we use our collection of over 100 primary GBM tumor-initiating lines (BTIC) that are subjected to drug screening by over 1400 compounds, and to genetic and phosphoproteomic analysis.\\n\\nMETHODS: We performed drug screening of 21 BTIC lines that represent the molecular heterogeneity of GBM patients, with a library of 110 clinically-relevant kinase inhibitors at three concentrations. We have also completed a phosphotyrosine characterization of 14 BTIC lines using phosphoproteomics.\\n\\nRESULTS: Multiple compounds that exhibit nanomolar cytotoxicity towards all of the lines were prioritized based upon their potency, novelty for GBM, ability to accumulate to relevant concentrations in brain, clinical status and cytotoxicity towards normal cells. Of the several hit compounds that fulfilled all of these criteria, the CDK inhibitor dinaciclib was chosen as our lead compound. We are currently investigating its mechanism of action using phosphoproteomics and RNAi as well as testing its efficacy in vivo in an orthotopic xenograft model as a single agent and in combination with TMZ. Furthermore, we have identified several compounds that exhibit selective cytotoxicity towards only a specific set of BTIC lines, suggesting that genetic differences between the lines account for differential sensitivities. The sensitivity of BTICs to one such compound, EMD-1214063, a selective MET inhibitor, may correlate with Met amplification status. Finally, phosphoproteomics results show activation of RTKs (EGFR, FGFR, PDGFRA, Eph receptor family) and non-receptor kinases (FYN, FAK1, GSK3b, MAPK, CDKs, DYRK) in the majority of BTIC lines, and of adaptor/scaffold proteins and proteins important in adhesion and migration. We are now (1) determining whether drugs that inhibit the activity of identified phosphoproteins suppress BTIC survival in culture and in orthotopic models, (2) validating the importance of those phosphoproteins in GBM survival, and (3) asking whether the prioritized drug hits from our drug screens suppress the phosphorylation of the identified phosphoproteins.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that our drug screening approach will generate several clinical candidates that will enable us to proceed to the clinic in the next several years. We also believe that our phosphoproteomics results will lead to identification of novel therapeutic targets for GBM.\\n\\nSECONDARY CATEGORY: Preclinical Experimental Therapeutics.",

In this study, the promoter sequences of PTP1B were cloned into pGL3B-neo vector containing luciferase gene and neomycin resistance gene. The recombinant reporter gene vector pGL3B-neo /PTP1B was transfected into CV1 cells and therefore stable cell line, namely SPTP1B, was obtained. With the cell-based reporter gene assay, we detected more than one hundred compounds in microtiter wells.

We selected Evodia rutaecarpa Benth out of 83 examples of traditional Chinese medicine and explored the mechanisms of evodiamine, the major active component of Evodia rutaecarpa Benth, on anti-IAV activity. Our results showed that evodiamine could significantly inhibit IAV replication, as determined by a plaque inhibition assay, an IAV vRNA promoter luciferase reporter assay and the Sulforhodamine B method using cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction. Additionally, evodiamine could significantly inhibit the accumulation of LC3-II and p62, and the dot-like aggregation of EGFP-LC3. This compound also inhibited the formation of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 heterotrimer, the expressions of Atg5, Atg7 and Atg12, and the cytokine release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 after IAV infection. Evodiamine inhibited IAV-induced autophagy was also dependent on its action on the AMPK/TSC2/mTOR signal pathway.

        "abstract": "Background: Global travellers are increasingly at risk of contracting malaria. The increasing occurrence of drug-resistance in many endemic areas emphasizes the need for novel drug targets for antimalarial-screening. In this study, the use of pyruvate kinase as a drug-target is evaluated. The functional validation of a gene encoding pyruvate kinase (designated PK1) has previously been reported. However, alternative copies of this enzyme encoded by Plasmodium falciparum could also circumvent the role of PK1. A survey of genome data revealed a putative ORF seemingly coding for another pyruvate kinase (designated PK2). Methods: The expression of PK1 and PK2 in in vitro cultures were investigated by RT-PCR. Biocomputational analysis was carried out to identify structural differences between the P. falciparum pyruvate kinases and the corresponding enzymes from its human host. Results: Both PK1 and PK2 were indeed actively transcribed during the intraerythrocytic stages, suggesting the involvement of both enzymes during infection. A comparison of amino acid residues at the effector binding sites of PK1 and PK2, to those of the human pyruvate kinases revealed some significant differences that could serve as targets for selective inhibitors to be designed against parasitic pyruvate kinases. Conclusion: Experimental evidence for the expression of both PK1 and PK2 during the blood stages of malaria infection was provided. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the \"PK2\" type of enzyme appears to be confined to Apicomplexans, an important observation with respect to the assessment of PK2 as a drug-target. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, high-throughput methodology for the quantitative analysis of platelet signaling events is still lacking.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: To develop a high-throughput assay for the analysis of platelet signaling events in whole blood.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a fluorescent barcoding protocol to facilitate multiplexing and enable large-scale signaling profiling in platelets in whole blood. The methodology allowed simultaneous staining and acquisition of 24-96 samples in a single analysis tube with a standard flow cytometer. This approach significantly reduced experimental numbers, data acquisition time, and antibody consumption, while providing automated statistically rich quantitative data on signaling events. Using vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), an established marker of platelet inhibition and antiplatelet drug therapy, we demonstrated that the assay could detect subtle changes in phosphoVASP-Ser157/239 in response to cAMP-elevating agents of varying potency and known modulators of the cAMP signaling cascade. The assay could be used with washed platelets or whole blood, analyzed immediately or frozen, without any significant change in assay performance. To demonstrate the usefulness of the assay as a drug discovery platform, we examined a prostaglandin screening library. Our screen of 70 prostaglandin derivatives revealed three previously uncharacterized lipids that stimulated phosphorylation of VASP-Ser157. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these agents elevated intraplatelet cAMP and inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This novel method enables rapid, large-scale quantitative signaling profiling and compound screening in human platelets present in whole blood.",

The literature indicates a significant trend toward the use of computational- or informatics-based methods for generating initial repositioning hypotheses, followed by focused assessment of biological activity in phenotypic assays. Another viable method for drug repositioning is in vitro screening of known drugs or drug-like molecules, initially in disease-relevant phenotypic assays, to identify and validate candidates for repositioning. This approach can use large compound libraries or can focus on subsets of known drugs or drug-like molecules. In this short review, we focus on ways to generate and validate repositioning candidates in disease-related in vitro and phenotypic assays, and we discuss specific examples of this approach as applied to a variety of disease areas. We propose that in vitro screens offer several advantages over biochemical or in vivo methods as a starting point for drug repositioning.",

Activation of this pathway has been reported to be associated with resistance to various chemotherapeutical agents. We here used a chemical biology/chemical informatic approach to identify apoptotic mechanisms that are insensitive to activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Mechanistic Set drug library was screened for agents that induce apoptosis in colon carcinoma cells expressing a constitutively active form of AKT1. The cytotoxicity screening data available as self-organized maps at the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the NCI was then used to classify the identified compounds according to mechanism of action. The results showed that drugs that interfere with the mitotic process induce apoptosis which is comparatively insensitive to constitutive AKT1 activity. The conditional screening approach described here is expected to be useful for identifying relationships between the state of activation of signaling pathways and sensitivity to anticancer agents.",

        "abstract": "We report two improved assays for in vitro and in vivo screening of chemicals with potential anti-malarial activity against the blood stages of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. These assays are based on the determination of luciferase activity (luminescence) in small blood samples containing transgenic blood stage parasites that express luciferase under the control of a promoter that is either schizont-specific (ama-1) or constitutive (eef1\u03b1a). Assay 1, the in vitro drug luminescence (ITDL) assay, measured the success of schizont maturation in the presence of candidate drugs quantifying luciferase activity in mature schizonts only (ama-1 promoter). The ITDL assay generated drug-inhibition curves and EC50 values comparable to those obtained with standard in vitro drug-susceptibility assays. The second assay, the in vivo drug-luminescence (IVDL) assay, measured parasite growth in vivo in a standard 4-day suppressive drug test, monitored by measuring the constitutive luciferase activity of circulating parasites (eef1\u03b1a promoter). The IVDL assay generates growth-curves that are identical to those obtained by manual counting of parasites in Giemsa-stained smears. The reading of luminescence assays is rapid, requires a minimal number of handling steps and no experience with parasite morphology or handling fluorescence-activated cell sorters, produces no radioactive waste and test-plates can be stored for prolonged periods before processing. Both tests are suitable for use in larger-scale in vitro and in vivo screening of drugs. The standard methodology of anti-malarial drug screening and validation, which includes testing in rodent models of malaria, can be improved by the incorporation of such assays. \u00a9 2008 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.",

It is extensively distributed geographically with a wide range of mammalian hosts and causes great economical loss. Trypanosoma equiperdum causes a venereal disease called Dourine in horses and donkeys. Chemotherapy appears to be the most effective form of control for T. evansi, whereas infections caused by T. equiperdum are considered incurable. Due to emerging drug resistance, efficient control of T. evansi is severely threatened, emphasising the urgent need to find new alternative drugs. A drug profile for a panel of T. evansi and T. equiperdum strains has been established for the four standard drugs currently used in treatment. The 3H-hypoxanthine incorporation assay was used to obtain 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for each standard drug against the various strains. The results indicate the presence (and in some cases, the emergence) of drug resistance in several strains. This panel of characterised strains with known drug sensitivities and resistances will be of great value for the screening of new active compounds, in comparison with the four standard drugs currently available. \u00a9 2007.",

Adulteration of samples is a common problem in this setting. A recently developed polyethylene glycol marker system allows reliable identification of urine samples. In this study, we aimed to compare the rates of drug detection in conventional and marker urine samples., DESIGN: This cross-sectional evaluation was performed in an ambulatory opiate substitution program. We studied 55 opiate-dependent patients (32 men, 23 women). In all patients we compared the rates of drugs detected in the marker urine with the most recent conventional urine control. Additionally we assessed the rate of marker urine manipulation., FINDINGS: In the conventional urine controls, opiates and benzodiazepines were found in 3.6 and 27%, respectively, whereas in the marker urine controls, these rates were 33 and 40%, respectively. Signs of urine manipulation were present in 35%. The rates of concomitant consumption and urine manipulation were higher among the patients without than among those with take-home substitution., CONCLUSIONS: With the marker urine, an unexpectedly high prevalence of concomitant consumption can be found. Marker urine testing has a significantly higher sensitivity for the detection of concomitant drug use.Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.",

        "abstract": "Cardiac side effects are one of the major causes of drug candidate failures in preclinical drug development or in clinical trials and are responsible for the retraction of several already marketed therapeutics. Thus, the development of a relatively high-throughput, high information content tool to screen drugs and toxins would be important in the field of cardiac research and drug development. In this study, recordings from commercial multielectrode arrays were combined with surface patterning of cardiac myocyte monolayers to enhance the information content of the method; specifically, to enable the measurement of conduction velocity, refractory period after action potentials and to create a functional re-entry model. Two drugs, 1-Heptanol, a gap junction blocker, and Sparfloxacin, a fluoroquinone antibiotic, were tested in this system. 1-Heptanol administration resulted in a marked reduction in conduction velocity, whereas Sparfloxacin caused rapid, irregular and unsynchronized activity, indicating fibrillation. As shown in these experiments, patterning of cardiac myocyte monolayers solved several inherent problems of multielectrode recordings, increased the temporal resolution of conduction velocity measurements, and made the synchronization of external stimulation with action potential propagation possible for refractory period measurements. This method could be further developed as a cardiac side effect screening platform after combination with human cardiomyocytes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

Recent advances in high-throughput drug screening techniques and next-generation sequencing have identified new therapeutic targets in other cancer types, but an HNSCC-specific study has not yet been carried out. We have exploited data from two large-scale cell line projects to clearly describe the mutational and copy number status of HNSCC cell lines and identify candidate drugs with elevated efficacy in HNSCC.\\n\\nMETHODS: The genetic landscape of 42 HNSCC cell lines including mutational and copy number data from studies by Garnett et al., and Barretina et al., were analyzed. Data from Garnett et al. was interrogated for relationships between HNSCC cells versus the entire cell line pool using one- and two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). As only seven HNSCC cell lines were tested with drugs by Barretina et al., a similar analysis was not carried out.\\n\\nRESULTS: Recurrent mutations in human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative patient tumors were confirmed in HNSCC cell lines, however additional, recurrent, cell line-specific mutations were identified. Four drugs, Bosutinib, Docetaxel, BIBW2992, and Gefitinib, were found via multiple-test corrected ANOVA to have lower IC50 values, suggesting higher drug sensitivity, in HNSCC lines versus non-HNSCC lines. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor AZD6482 demonstrated significantly higher activity (as measured by the IC50) in HNSCC cell lines harbouring PIK3CA mutations versus those that did not.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: HNSCC-specific reanalysis of large-scale drug screening studies has identified candidate drugs that may be of therapeutic benefit and provided insights into strategies to target PIK3CA mutant tumors. PIK3CA mutations may represent a predictive biomarker for response to PI3K inhibitors. A large-scale study focused on HNSCC cell lines and including HPV-positive lines is necessary and has the potential to accelerate the development of improved therapeutics for patients suffering with head and neck cancer. This strategy can potentially be used as a template for drug discovery in any cancer type.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Large collections of annotated cancer cell lines are powerful tools for precisely matching targeted drugs with genomic alterations that can be tested as biomarkers in the clinic. Whether these screening platforms, which utilize short-term cell survival to assess drug responses, can be applied to precision radiation medicine is not established. To this end, 32 cancer cell lines were screened using 18 targeted therapeutic agents with known or putative radiosensitizing properties (227 combinations). The cell number remaining after drug exposure with or without radiation was assessed by nonclonogenic assays. We derived short-term radiosensitization factors (SRF2Gy) and calculated clonogenic survival assay-based dose enhancement factors (DEFSF0.1). Radiosensitization was characterized by SRF2Gy values of mostly \u223c1.05 to 1.2 and significantly correlated with drug-induced changes in apoptosis and senescence frequencies. SRF2Gy was significantly correlated with DEFSF0.1, with a respective sensitivity and specificity of 91.7% and 81.5% for a 3-day endpoint, and 82.8% and 84.2% for a robotic 5-day assay. KRAS mutations (codons 12/13) were found to be a biomarker of radiosensitization by midostaurin in lung cancer, which was pronounced under conditions that enriched for stem cell-like cells. In conclusion, although short-term proliferation/survival assays cannot replace the gold-standard clonogenic survival assay for measuring cellular radiosensitivity, they capture with high accuracy the relative change in radiosensitivity that is caused by a radiosensitzing targeted agent.\\n\\nIMPLICATIONS: This study supports a paradigm shift regarding the utility of short-term assays for precision radiation medicine, which should facilitate the identification of genomic biomarkers to guide the testing of novel drug/radiation combinations.",

        "abstract": "Rapid advancing computational technologies have greatly speeded up the development of computer-aided drug design (CADD). Recently, pharmaceutical companies have increasingly shifted their attentions toward traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for novel lead compounds. Despite the growing number of studies on TCM, there is no free 3D small molecular structure database of TCM available for virtual screening or molecular simulation. To address this shortcoming, we have constructed TCM Database@Taiwan (http://tcm.cmu.edu.tw/) based on information collected from Chinese medical texts and scientific publications. TCM Database@Taiwan is currently the world's largest non-commercial TCM database. This web-based database contains more than 20,000 pure compounds isolated from 453 TCM ingredients. Both cdx (2D) and Tripos mol2 (3D) formats of each pure compound in the database are available for download and virtual screening. The TCM database includes both simple and advanced web-based query options that can specify search clauses, such as molecular properties, substructures, TCM ingredients, and TCM classification, based on intended drug actions. The TCM database can be easily accessed by all researchers conducting CADD. Over the last eight years, numerous volunteers have devoted their time to analyze TCM ingredients from Chinese medical texts as well as to construct structure files for each isolated compound. We believe that TCM Database@Taiwan will be a milestone on the path towards modernizing traditional Chinese medicine.",

        "title": "Performance evaluation of on-site oral fluid drug screening devices in normal police procedure in Germany",
        "abstract": "There is a need for quick and reliable methods for rapid screening of drug-influenced drivers on the roadside by police. Because the window of detection in oral fluid is more similar to blood than to urine, this matrix should therefore be appropriate for screening procedures. The performance of the Rapid STAT\u00ae (Mavand Solution GmbH, M\u00f6ssingen, Germany), DrugWipe5/5+\u00ae (Securetec Detektions-Systeme AG, Brunnthal, Germany) and Dr\u00e4ger DrugTest\u00ae 5000 (Draeger Safety AG & Co. KGaA, Luebeck, Germany) on-site oral fluid devices was evaluated with random oral fluid specimens from car drivers in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany). Additionally, some drivers were checked using an on-site urine device (DrugScreen\u00ae, NAL von Minden, Regensburg, Germany). During a 11-month period, 1.212 drivers were tested. Both OF and urine on-site tests were compared to serum results. The following sensitivities were obtained by the oral fluid devices: THC 71% (DrugWipe\u00ae), 87% (Dr\u00e4ger), 91% (RapidSTAT); opiates 95% (Dr\u00e4ger), 100% (DrugWipe\u00ae, RapidSTAT\u00ae); amphetamine 84% (DrugTest\u00ae 5000), 90% (RapidSTAT\u00ae), 100% (DrugTest\u00ae 5000); methamphetamine 50% (DrugTest\u00ae 5000), 100% (RapidSTAT\u00ae); cocaine 76% (DrugTest\u00ae 5000), 100% (DrugWipe\u00ae, RapidSTAT\u00ae); methadone 33-63%, and benzodiazepines 0-33% (both with a low number of positives). THC specificity was especially low (29% [DrugWipe\u00ae] and 47% [DrugTest\u00ae 5000]) due to low cut-off concentrations. These data were similar to those obtained from the literature (e.g., DRUID project). The urine screening device showed a good sensitivity (THC 93%, opiate 94%, amphetamine 94%, methamphetamine 75% (low number of positives), cocaine 100%) and also an acceptable specificity (39%, 86%, 63%, 77%, 47%, respectively). Although oral fluid may be a useful matrix for on-site testing of drugged drivers, it is evident that oral fluid devices still show a lack of sensitivity (methamphetamine, benzodiazepines) and specificity (THC). Poor results for benzodiazepines may be explained by the small positive test number. Although the sensitivity for THC came out higher than compared to the literature, specificity is not yet satisfactory (only <90%). Furthermore, specificity was poor due to lowered cut-offs resulting in multiple false positive tests. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In view of the current widespread use of and reliance on a single schistosomicide, praziquantel, there is a pressing need to discover and develop alternative drugs for schistosomiasis. One approach to this is to develop High Throughput in vitro whole organism screens (HTS) to identify hits amongst large compound libraries.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have been carrying out low throughput (24-well plate) in vitro testing based on microscopic evaluation of killing of ex-vivo adult S. mansoni worms using selected compound collections mainly provided through the WHO-TDR Helminth Drug Initiative. To increase throughput, we introduced a similar but higher throughput 96-well primary in vitro assay using the schistosomula stage which can be readily produced in vitro in large quantities. In addition to morphological readout of viability we have investigated using fluorometric determination of the reduction of Alamar blue (AB), a redox indicator of enzyme activity widely used in whole organism screening. A panel of 7 known schistosome active compounds including praziquantel, produced diverse effects on larval morphology within 3 days of culture although only two induced marked larval death within 7 days. The AB assay was very effective in detecting these lethal compounds but proved more inconsistent in detecting compounds which damaged but did not kill. The utility of the AB assay in detecting compounds which cause severe morbidity and/or death of schistosomula was confirmed in testing a panel of compounds previously selected in library screening as having activity against the adult worms. Furthermore, in prospective library screening, the AB assay was able to detect all compounds which induced killing and also the majority of compounds designated as hits based on morphological changes.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: We conclude that an HTS combining AB readout and image-based analysis would provide an efficient and stringent primary assay for schistosome drug discovery.",

        "title": "Metabolomics guides rational development of a simplified cell culture medium for drug screening against trypanosoma brucei",
        "abstract": "In vitro culture methods underpin many experimental approaches to biology and drug discovery. The modification of established cell culture methods to make them more biologically relevant or to optimize growth is traditionally a laborious task. Emerging metabolomic technology enables the rapid evaluation of intra- and extracellular metabolites and can be applied to the rational development of cell culture media. In this study, untargeted semiquantitative and targeted quantitative metabolomic analyses of fresh and spent media revealed the major nutritional requirements for the growth of bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei. The standard culture medium (HMI11) contained unnecessarily high concentrations of 32 nutrients that were subsequently removed to make the concentrations more closely resemble those normally found in blood. Our new medium, Creek's minimal medium (CMM), supports in vitro growth equivalent to that in HMI11 and causes no significant perturbation of metabolite levels for 94% of the detected metabolome (<3-fold change; \u03b1 = 0.05). Importantly, improved sensitivity was observed for drug activity studies in whole-cell phenotypic screenings and in the metabolomic mode of action assays. Four-hundred-fold 50% inhibitory concentration decreases were observed for pentamidine and methotrexate, suggesting inhibition of activity by nutrients present in HMI11. CMM is suitable for routine cell culture and offers important advantages for metabolomic studies and drug activity screening.",

        "title": "Candida albicans biofilm chip (CaBChip) for high-throughput antifungal drug screening",
        "abstract": "Candida albicans remains the main etiological agent of candidiasis, which currently represents the fourth most common nosocomial bloodstream infection in US hospitals. These opportunistic infections pose a growing threat for an increasing number of compromised individuals, and carry unacceptably high mortality rates. This is in part due to the limited arsenal of antifungal drugs, but also to the emergence of resistance against the most commonly used antifungal agents. Further complicating treatment is the fact that a majority of manifestations of candidiasis are associated with the formation of biofilms, and cells within these biofilms show increased levels of resistance to most clinically-used antifungal agents. Here we describe the development of a high-density microarray that consists of C. albicans nano-biofilms, which we have named CaBChip. Briefly, a robotic microarrayer is used to print yeast cells of C. albicans onto a solid substrate. During printing, the yeast cells are enclosed in a three dimensional matrix using a volume as low as 50 nL and immobilized on a glass substrate with a suitable coating. After initial printing, the slides are incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours to allow for biofilm development. During this period the spots grow into fully developed \"nano-biofilms\" that display typical structural and phenotypic characteristics associated with mature C. albicans biofilms (i.e. morphological complexity, three dimensional architecture and drug resistance). Overall, the CaBChip is composed of ~750 equivalent and spatially distinct biofilms; with the additional advantage that multiple chips can be printed and processed simultaneously. Cell viability is estimated by measuring the fluorescent intensity of FUN1 metabolic stain using a microarray scanner. This fungal chip is ideally suited for use in true high-throughput screening for antifungal drug discovery. Compared to current standards (i.e. the 96-well microtiter plate model of biofilm formation), the main advantages of the fungal biofilm chip are automation, miniaturization, savings in amount and cost of reagents and analyses time, as well as the elimination of labor intensive steps. We believe that such chip will significantly speed up the antifungal drug discovery process.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a fully automated high throughput drug screening (HTDS) system based on the microfluidic cell culture array to perform combinational chemotherapy. This system has 64 individually addressable cell culture chambers where the sequential combinatorial concentrations of two different drugs can be generated by two microfluidic diffusive mixers. Each diffusive mixer has two integrated micropumps connected to the media and the drug reservoirs respectively for generating the desired combination without the need for any extra equipment to perfuse the solution such as syringe pumps. The cell array is periodically exposed to the drug combination with the programmed LabVIEW system during a couple of days without extra handling after seeding the cells into the microfluidic device and also, this device does not require the continuous generation of solutions compared to the previous systems. Therefore, the total amount of drug being consumed per experiment is less than a few hundred micro liters in each reservoir. The utility of this system is demonstrated through investigating the viability of the prostate cancer PC3 cell line with the combinational treatments of curcumin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL). Our results suggest that the system can be used for screening and optimizing drug combination with a small amount of reagent for combinatorial chemotherapy against cancer cells.",

This method can potentially transfer several protein spots on to an organized array for applications such as disease diagnosis and drug screening by parallel biological or chemical processes. Fabrication of the micro stamp and the micro well arrays involves thick-photoresist lithography, bulk micromachining, and a molding process, whereas fabrication of the bio-absorption chip involves amino-modification by use of APTS (aminopropyltrimethoxysilane) and surface activation by use of BS3 (bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate). Successful transfer of protein on to the bio-absorption surface using the micro stamp-well array has been demonstrated. The size variation between different stamping spots has been shown to be less than 10%, and the APTS-BS3 surface has also been proved to bind the protein efficiently. Appreciable protein retention was achieved during 6-h washing, which shows the binding strength of the bio-absorption surface is sufficient for protein processing.",

In this work, we describe the use of LLS for competitive binding experiments to measure accurate dissociation constants of fragments that bind weakly to the ATP binding site of the N-terminal ATPase domain of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. The LLS approach allows one to characterize ligands with an exceptionally wide range of affinities, since it can be used for ligand concentrations [L] that are several orders of magnitude smaller than the dissociation constants K(D). This property makes the LLS method particularly attractive for the initial steps of fragment-based drug screening, where small molecular fragments that bind weakly to a target protein must be identified, which is a difficult task for many other biophysical methods.",

We establish three-dimensional culture conditions to induce the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into exocrine progenitor organoids that form ductal and acinar structures in culture and in vivo. Expression of mutant KRAS or TP53 in progenitor organoids induces mutation-specific phenotypes in culture and in vivo. Expression of TP53(R175H) induces cytosolic SOX9 localization. In patient tumors bearing TP53 mutations, SOX9 was cytoplasmic and associated with mortality. We also define culture conditions for clonal generation of tumor organoids from freshly resected PDAC. Tumor organoids maintain the differentiation status, histoarchitecture and phenotypic heterogeneity of the primary tumor and retain patient-specific physiological changes, including hypoxia, oxygen consumption, epigenetic marks and differences in sensitivity to inhibition of the histone methyltransferase EZH2. Thus, pancreatic progenitor organoids and tumor organoids can be used to model PDAC and for drug screening to identify precision therapy strategies.",

        "abstract": "Vibrational spectroscopy, including Raman micro spectroscopy, has been widely used over the last few years to explore potential biomedical applications. Indeed, Raman micro spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be a powerful non-invasive tool in cancer diagnosis and monitoring. In confocal microscopic mode, the technique is also a molecularly specific analytical tool with optical resolution which has potential applications in subcellular analysis of biochemical processes, and therefore as an in vitro screening tool of the efficacy and mode of action of, for example, chemotherapeutic agents. In order to demonstrate and explore the potential in this field, established, model chemotherapeutic agents can be valuable. In this study paper, Raman micro spectroscopy coupled with confocal microscopy were used for the localization and tracking of the commercially available drug, doxorubicin (DOX), in the intracellular environment of the lung cancer cell line, A549. Cytotoxicity assays were employed to establish clinically relevant drug doses for 24 h exposure, and Confocal Laser Scanning Fluorescence Microscopy was conducted in parallel with Raman micro spectroscopy profiling to confirm the drug internalisation and localisation. Multivariate statistical analysis, consisting of PCA (principal components analysis) was used to highlight doxorubicin interaction with cancer cells and spectral variations due to its effects before and after DOX spectral features subtraction from nuclear and nucleolar spectra, were compared to non-exposed control spectra. Results show that Raman micro spectroscopy is not only able to detect doxorubicin inside cells and profile its specific subcellular localisation, but, it is also capable of elucidating the local biomolecular changes elicited by the drug, differentiating the responses in different sub cellular regions. Further analysis clearly demonstrates the early apoptotic effect in the nuclear regions and the initial responses of cells to this death process, demonstrating the potential of the technique to monitor the mechanisms of action and response on a molecular level, with subcellular resolution.",

Among human parasitic diseases, schistosomiasis ranks second behind malaria in terms of socio-economic and public health importance in tropical and subtropical areas. More than 200 million people are currently infected in 77 countries, 85% of whom live in sub-Saharian Africa. To date no vaccine is available against schistosomiasis. As chemotherapy relies on a single drug, praziquantel, many initiatives have been promoted aiming to search for novel anti-schistosomal drugs that can represent a valid alternative to the current treatment or could be used in case of emerging resistance. Quantitative, objective and validated methods for compound collections screening are needed for the discovery of novel anti-schistosomal drugs. Here, we report the development and validation of a medium-throughput, luminescence-based assay for assessing viability at the schistosomulum stage of the human parasite S. mansoni. Our methodology enables a simple, reproducible, highly sensitive and objective quantitation of parasite viability. It is also automation compatible and enables the screening of compound collections thus hopefully contributing to the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies against schistosomiasis.",

        "abstract": "Primary cultures of patient tumor cells (PCPTC) have been used for prediction of diagnosis-specific activity and individual patient response to anticancer drugs, but have not been utilized as a model for identification of novel drugs in high throughput screening. In the present study, ovarian carcinoma cells from three patients were tested in response to a library of 3000 chemically diverse compounds. Eight hits were retrieved after counter screening using normal epithelial cells, and one of the two structurally related hit compounds was selected for further preclinical evaluation. This compound, designated VLX 50, demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity when tested in a panel of PCPTCs representing different forms of leukemia and solid tumors and displayed a high tumor to normal cell activity. VLX 50 induced delayed cell death with some features of classical apoptosis. Significant in vivo activity was confirmed on primary cultures of human ovarian carcinoma cells in mice using the hollow fiber model. Mechanistic exploration was performed using gene expression analysis of drug exposed tumor cells to generate a drug-specific signature. This query signature was analyzed using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and the Connectivity Map database. Strong connections to hypoxia inducible factor 1 and iron chelators were retrieved. The mechanistic hypothesis of intracellular iron depletion leading to hypoxia signaling was confirmed by a series of experiments. The results indicate the feasibility of using PCPTC for cancer drug screening and that intracellular iron depletion could be a potentially important strategy for cancer therapy. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In this context, transgenic parasites expressing reporter genes are interesting tools for investigating parasite biology and host-parasite interactions, with a view to developing new strategies for disease prevention and treatment. We describe here the construction of a stably transfected fluorescent T. cruzi clone in which the GFP gene is integrated into the chromosome carrying the ribosomal cistron in T. cruzi Dm28c. This fluorescent T. cruzi produces detectable amounts of GFP only at replicative stages (epimastigote and amastigote), consistent with the larger amounts of GFP mRNA detected in these forms than in the non replicative trypomastigote stages. The fluorescence signal was also strongly correlated with the total number of parasites in T. cruzi cultures, providing a simple and rapid means of determining the growth inhibitory dose of anti-T.cruzi drugs in epimastigotes, by fluorometric microplate screening, and in amastigotes, by the flow cytometric quantification of T. cruzi-infected Vero cells. This fluorescent T. cruzi clone is, thus, an interesting tool for unbiased detection of the proliferating stages of the parasite, with multiple applications in the genetic analysis of T. cruzi, including analyses of host-parasite interactions, gene expression regulation and drug development.",

        "abstract": "Amyloid-?? (A??) is the major constituent of senile plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. In order to develop an efficient in vitro system for studying the interaction of cells with A?? aggregates, we have prepared a synthetic amyloid lawn by immobilizing A?? peptides over a functionalized glass surface and subsequently incubating the template in a fresh A?? solution. On the top of different types of amyloid lawns (e.g. monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar), we cultivated PC12 cells, creating physical contacts between the cells and the lawns. Results indicated that cell viability was differentially affected when grown atop different A?? lawns while cells were well adhered onto the surface of these A?? lawns. The mode of cell death by A?? lawn was confirmed to be apoptotic rather than necrotic, showing that cells undergo suicide by just contact with A?? lawn. While conventional 'solution-based' methods for testing amyloid toxicity suffer from problems such as lot-to-lot variations, continued fibrillation, and heterogeneous population of aggregates, our 'surface-based' lawn system is suitable for high-throughput analysis of amyloid toxicity, which may enable high-throughput screening of potential drug candidates for treating amyloid diseases with the goal of reducing the cell death on the lawn. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "A rapid, sensitive, and rugged method for detecting drugs and drug metabolites in extracts of horse urine is described. The use of large-volume injection (LVI) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for analysis of horse urine extracts allowed automation of the derivatization procedure and reduction of the sample volume from 5 mL to 1 mL of urine. An autosampler and temperature-programmable inlet were used to automatically dissolve the sample extract and form trimethylsilyl derivatives of over 200 analytes. The suitability of this procedure for routine GC-MS detection of approximately 80 basic analytes in extracts of racehorse urine was investigated. The formation of derivatives using LVI with in-liner derivatization was compared to a manual procedure involving the dissolution of sample extracts in N,O-bis(trimethylsily)trifluoroacetamide, heating the resulting mixture, and injecting 1 or 2 microL of the mixture through a splitless injector into the GC-MS instrument. In all cases, the in-liner derivatization reactions were found to be as complete as conventional heating block procedures. Ruggedness testing of the method demonstrated that peak resolution, shape, and area were maintained through 40 consecutive injections of sample extracts. No evidence of the accumulation of interfering substances was observed. The limits of detection using LVI GC-MS for routine screening of basic drugs in urine were generally in the range of 5-25 ng/mL. The method is currently being used to detect basic analytes in horse urine extracts with a throughput of approximately 50 urine sample extracts per instrument per day",

The methylation of the cap guanine at its N7-position (N7-MTase, 7MeGpppA-RNA) is essential for viral replication. The development of high throughput methods to identify specific inhibitors of N7-MTase is hampered by technical limitations in the large scale synthesis of long capped RNAs. In this work, we describe an efficient method to generate such capped RNA, GpppA2'OMe-RNA74, by ligation of two RNA fragments. Then, we use GpppA2'OMe-RNA74 as a substrate to assess DENV N7-MTase activity and to develop a robust and specific activity assay. We applied the same ligation procedure to generate 7MeGpppA-RNA74 in order to characterize the DENV 2'-O-MTase activity specifically on long capped RNA.We next compared the N7- and 2'-. O-MTase inhibition effect of 18 molecules, previously proposed to affect MTase activities. These experiments allow the validation of a rapid and sensitive method easily adaptable for high-throughput inhibitor screening in anti-flaviviral drug development. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a late-onset, fatal disorder in which the motor neurons degenerate. The discovery of new drugs for treating ALS has been hampered by a lack of access to motor neurons from ALS patients and appropriate disease models. We generate motor neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from familial ALS patients, who carry mutations in Tar DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43). ALS patient-specific iPSC-derived motor neurons formed cytosolic aggregates similar to those seen in postmortem tissue from ALS patients and exhibited shorter neurites as seen in a zebrafish model of ALS. The ALS motor neurons were characterized by increased mutant TDP-43 protein in a detergent-insoluble form bound to a spliceosomal factor SNRPB2. Expression array analyses detected small increases in the expression of genes involved in RNA metabolism and decreases in the expression of genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins. We examined four chemical compounds and found that a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor called anacardic acid rescued the abnormal ALS motor neuron phenotype. These findings suggest that motor neurons generated from ALS patient-derived iPSCs may provide a useful tool for elucidating ALS disease pathogenesis and for screening drug candidates.",

However, these assays are inherently end-point measurements and labor intensive. Here we describe a novel non-radioactive assay based on the principle of pyrosequencing coupled-enzyme system to monitor the activity of HIV-RT by indirectly measuring the release of pyrophosphate (PP(i)), which is generated during nascent strand synthesis. The results show that our assay could monitor HIV-RT activity with high sensitivity and is suitable for rapid high-throughput drug screening targeting anti-HIV therapies due to its high speed and convenience. Moreover, this assay can be used to measure primase activity in an easy and sensitive manner, which suggests that this novel approach could be wildly used to analyze the activity of PP(i)-generated and ATP-free enzyme reactions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Several Leishmania strains with episomal expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) require constant drug pressure for its continuous expression and hence limit its use in ex vivo or in vivo systems. The aim of this study was to alleviate this problem by stably integrating the GFP gene into the parasite genome, so as to use these transfectants for ex vivo and in vivo drug screening. METHODS: The GFP gene was integrated downstream of the 18S ribosomal promoter region of Leishmania donovani. After initial selection, GFP-expressing parasites-both sodium stibogluconate (SAG)-susceptible (2001) and -resistant (2039) isolates-were grown without adding G418. The infectivity of these transfectants to macrophages (J774.1) as well as to hamsters was checked. The ex vivo screening assay was standardized using standard antileishmanial drugs. RESULTS: A constitutive and enhanced expression of GFP in promastigote and amastigote stages was achieved for approximately 12 months without any need for drug pressure. These transfectants were highly infective to macrophage cell lines as well as to hamsters, as observed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry (FACS). GFP-tagged promastigotes as well as intracellular amastigotes were found to be highly susceptible to miltefosine, amphotericin B and pentamidine, in a concentration-dependent manner. SAG was inactive against the GFP-promastigotes, as well as SAG-resistant intracellular amastigotes, correlating well with earlier reports. CONCLUSIONS: The GFP-transfectants were found to be suitable for FACS-based ex vivo screening assays. They were also infective to hamsters up to day 60 post-infection.",

        "abstract": "Invasive epithelial tumors form from cells that are released from their natural basement membrane and form 3-D structures that interact with each other and with the microenvironment of the stromal tissues around the tumor. which often contains collagen. Cancer cells, growing as monolayers on tissue Culture plastic, do not reflect many of the properties of whole tumors. This shortcoming limits their ability to serve as models for testing of pharmacologically active compounds, including those that are being tested as antineoplastics. This work seeks to create new 3-D cellular materials possessing properties similar to those in native tissues Surrounding cancers, specifically electrospun micro- and nanofibrous collagen scaffolds that support tumor growth in 3-D. We hypothesize that a 3-D culture system will provide a better replica of tumor growth in a native environment and, thus, better report the bioactivity of antineoplastic agents. In addition, we optimized conditions and identified physical characteristics that support growth of the highly invasive, prostate cancer bone metastatic cell line C4-2B on these matrices for use in anticancer drug Studies. The effects of matrix porosity, fiber diameter, elasticity, and surface toughness on growth of cancer cells were evaluated. Data indicates that while cells attach and grow well on both nano- and microfibrous electrospun membranes, the microfibrous membrane represented a better approximation of the tumor microenvironment. It was also observed that C4-2B nonadherent cells migrated through the depth of two electrospun membranes and formed colonies resembling tumors on day 3. An apoptosis study revealed that cells on electrospun substrates were more resistant to both antineoplastic agents, docetaxel (DOC), and camptothecin (CAM) compared to the cells grown on standard collagen-coated tissue culture polystyrene (TCP). Growth, Survival, and apoptosis were measured, as well as the differences in the apoptotic capabilities, of the two above-mentioned compounds compared to known clinical performance. We conclude that 3-D electrospun membranes arc amenable to high throughput screening for cancer cell susceptibility and combination killing (Banerjee, S.; Hussain, M.; Wang, Z.; Saliganan, A.; Che, M.; Bonfil, D.; Cher, M.; Sarkar, F.H.

        "title": "Cellular impedance assays for predictive preclinical drug screening of kinase inhibitor cardiovascular toxicity",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular (CV) toxicity is a leading contributor to drug attrition. Implementing earlier testing has successfully reduced human Ether-\u00e0-go-go-Related Gene-related arrhythmias. How- ever, analogous assays targeting functional CV effects remain elusive. Demand to address this gap is particularly acute for kinase inhibitors (KIs) that suffer frequent CV toxicity. The drug class also presents some particularly challenging requirements for assessing functional CV toxicity. Specifically, an assay must sense a downstream response that integrates diverse kinase signaling pathways. In addition, sufficient throughput is essential for handling inherent KI nonselectivity. A new opportunity has emerged with cellular impedance technology, which detects spontaneous beating cardiomyocytes. Impedance assays sense morphology changes downstream of cardiomyocyte contraction. To evaluate cardiomyocyte impedance assays for KI screening, we investigated two distinct KI classes where CV toxicity was discovered late and target risks remain unresolved. Microtubule-associated protein/microtubule affinity regulating kinase (MARK) inhibitors decrease blood pressure in dogs, whereas checkpoint kinase (Chk) inhibitors (AZD7762, SCH900776) exhibit dose-limiting CV toxicities in clinical trials. These in vivo effects manifested in vitro as cardiomyocyte beat cessation. MARK effects were deemed mechanism associated because beat inhibition potencies correlated with kinase inhibition, and gene knockdown and microtubule-targeting agents suppressed beating. MARK inhibitor impedance and kinase potencies aligned with rat blood pressure effects. Chk inhibitor effects were judged off-target because Chk and beat inhibition potencies did not correlate and knockdowns did not alter beating. Taken together, the data demonstrate that cardiomyocyte impedance assays can address three unmet needs-detecting KI functional cardiotoxicity in vitro, determining mechanism of action, and supporting safety structure-activity relationships.",

However, simplified in vitro culture systems often lead to inaccurate results regarding the efficacy of drugs. Histopathologically, glioblastoma multiform (GBM) cells migrate along the orientation of thin, elongated anatomical structures, such as white-matter tracts. Here, a tapered microtract array platform which mimics the anatomical features of brain tissue is introduced. This platform enables optimization of design for platform fabrication depending on topographic effects. By monitoring the migration of GBM cells on a simple tapered microtract, a saltatory migration resembling the migratory phenotype of human GBM cells in vivo is observed. The platform effectively induces the native characteristics and behavior of cells by topographic cues, allowing to observe the critical point for crawling to saltatory transition. Furthermore, this platform can be applied to efficiently screen anti-cancer drug by inhibiting associated signaling pathways on GBM cells. In conclusion, the microtract array platform reported here may provide a better understanding of the effects of topographic characteristics on cell migration, and may also be useful to determine the efficacy of antimigratory drugs for glioblastoma cells with cellular and molecular research and high-throughput screening.",

The thymidine monophosphate kinase (TMPK) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), which is an essential enzyme for the maintenance of the thymidine triphosphate pools, is considered an attractive target for the development of effective antibiotics against tuberculosis. In this study, we attempted to identify novel chemical compounds that specifically target the M. tuberculosis TMPK (mtTMPK). We performed in silico structure-based drug screening using the crystal structure data of mtTMPK and a large-scale virtual compound library, which is composed of 6,192,930 chemicals. Through a three-step screening method using the DOCK and GOLD, we identified ten chemical compounds that were predicted to have high binding affinity to the active site cleft of the mtTMPK. We then evaluated the antibiotic effects of these chemical compounds on model mycobacteria strains. As a result, we found that a chemical compound, K10, completely inhibited the growth of Mycobacterium vanbaalenii (M. vanbaalenii) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis). Moreover, K10 does not exhibit any toxic effects on the growth of enterobacteria and mammalian cells. The structural and experimental information regarding this novel chemical compound, K10, is likely to be useful for the hit-to-lead optimization of new antibiotics for the treatment of tuberculosis.",

        "abstract": "Chagas' disease, caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is the major cause of heart failure in Latin America. Classic clinical manifestations result from the infection of heart muscle cells leading to progressive cardiomyopathy. To ameliorate disease, chemotherapy must eradicate the parasite. Current drugs are ineffective and toxic, and new therapy is a critical need. To expedite drug screening for this neglected disease, we have developed and validated a cell-based, high-throughput assay that can be used with a variety of untransfected T. cruzi isolates and host cells and that simultaneously measures efficacy against the intra-cellular amastigote stage and toxicity to host cells. T. cruzi-infected muscle cells were incubated in 96-well plates with test compounds. Assay plates were automatically imaged and analyzed based on size differences between the DAPI (4\u0605,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-stained host cell nuclei and parasite kinetoplasts. A reduc-tion in the ratio of T. cruzi per host cell provided a quantitative measure of parasite growth inhibition, while a decrease in count of the host nuclei indicated compound toxicity. The assay was used to screen a library of clinically approved drugs and identified 55 compounds with activity against T. cruzi. The flexible assay design allows the use of various parasite strains, including clinical isolates with different biological characteristics (e.g., tissue tropism and drug sensitivity), and a broad range of host cells and may even be adapted to screen for inhibitors against other intracellular pathogens. This high-throughput assay will have an important impact in antiparasitic drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We have established a panel of 15 human ovarian cancer xenografts grown subcutaneously in the flank of the nude mouse. Similar to the clinic, the xenografts show differences in histological subtype and volume doubling time. We determined whether the panel is useful for drug screening by testing the sensitivity to six conventional anticancer agents. In addition, we investigated whether the glutathione detoxification system affects sensitivity to cisplatin and cyclophosphamide, major drugs in the treatment of ovarian cancer.\\n\\nMETHODS: Mice bearing well-established tumors were treated at maximum tolerated doses as defined by a reversible weight loss up to 15% of their initial weight: cisplatin 5 mg/kg iv weekly x2, cyclophosphamide 150 mg/kg ip 2-weekly x2, doxorubicin 8 mg/kg iv weekly x2, hexamethylmelamine ip 150 mg/kg every other day x4, methotrexate ip 150 mg/kg weekly x2, and 5-fluorouracil 60 mg/kg ip weekly x4. Glutathione levels and the activities of three different glutathione-dependent enzymes were measured in untreated xenograft tissues.\\n\\nRESULTS: Growth inhibition >75% was reached for cisplatin in 40%, for cyclophosphamide in 27%, and for doxorubicin in 20% of the xenografts. Methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil did not induce growth inhibition of importance. Hexamethylmelamine showed >75% growth inhibition in 53% of the xenografts, which may have been caused by the favorable metabolism of the drug in mice when compared with that in patients. Glutathione levels varied 3.6-fold in the xenografts and did not show a relation with sensitivity to cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, or doxorubicin. No relation was found between the activities of glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase and the sensitivities to the three anticancer agents. Glutathione reductase activity, however, showed a weak, inverse relation with the efficacy of cisplatin and cyclophosphamide (r values of -0.55 and -0.58, respectively).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity to the six anticancer agents of our panel of 15 human ovarian cancer xenografts reflects the response rates known for similar drugs in ovarian cancer patients. In that respect, the panel may be useful for drug screening as well as studies on the relevance of drug resistance features in vivo. The various components of the glutathione detoxification system did not predict for primary drug resistance which confirms clinical data in ovarian cancer.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a solid-phase ELISA for the specific and sensitive detection of apoptotic cells. This method is based on the ability of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to specifically identify apoptotic cells. The assay involves binding of cells to 96-well microtiter plates, treatment of the attached cells with formamide to denature DNA in apoptotic cells and one-step staining of the denatured DNA with a mixture of anti-ssDNA MAb and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM. A near linear increase in signal was seen as the number of apoptotic cells increased from 500 to 5000. Untreated and necrotic cells or cells with single-stranded DNA breaks induced by H(2)O(2) did not produce signal above the background level. In leukemic cell cultures grown, treated with ID(50) concentration of etoposide, stained and analyzed in the same 96-well assay plate, intense ELISA signal was detected. The ratio of absorbance values from drug resistant and drug-sensitive cell lines treated with etoposide was in agreement with the degree of resistance determined by growth inhibition assays. These data show that this ELISA has sufficient sensitivity for use in drug screening protocols. In breast cancer cell cultures treated with cisplatin, ELISA absorbance increased only after treatment with drug concentrations 10-fold higher than concentrations inducing 95% growth inhibition. In cultures treated with staurosporine, there was a near linear relation between the ELISA absorbance values and cytotoxicity in the range of 15-92% growth inhibition. The absence of apoptotic signal in breast cancer cells treated with cytotoxic concentrations of cisplatin indicated that this drug kills cells by non-apoptotic mechanisms, whereas apoptosis was the dominant mechanism of cell death caused by staurosporine. The formamide-MAb apoptosis ELISA described here may provide a basis for high-throughput screening of drugs based on their ability to induce or suppress apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "A method based on in-source collision-induced dissociation (ISCID) liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) and reverse target database search was developed and evaluated for drug screening and confirmation in analytical toxicology context. An established LC-TOFMS screening method, in which identification relies solely on protonated molecule accurate mass measurement, isotopic pattern fit, and retention time (RT), was completed to include 1-3 qualifier ions for each analyte in the database. The qualifier ions for 431 compounds were selected from the experimental ISCID spectra, and their molecular formulae were assigned by applying SmartFormula3D and MSFragmenter software. Three qualifier ions were assigned for 64.5%, two or three for 81.4%, one for 14.8%, and none for 3.7% of the compounds studied. Comparison between ISCID LC-TOFMS and LC-TOFMS with 25 authentic autopsy urine samples showed an improved confidence level with the ISCID method, as isomeric interferences were excluded in most cases. However, some false negative (FN) results were obtained at low concentration levels close to the reporting criteria. The cut-off concentration of the ISCID method was 10-100 ng/mL with 80% of the 49 representative compounds tested, and the level was approximately two times higher than that obtained by LC ion trap MS. The presented method enables simultaneous screening and confirmation whenever at least one qualifier ion is available, as applying an accurate mass precursor ion and one product ion surpasses the standard of four identification points that is required by the current EU protocol.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the effect of haloperidol on a four-cell and nine-cell cardiomyocyte network on an agarose microchamber array chip to evaluate a cell-based model for drug screening. Using a network of cardiomyocytes whose beating intervals were stable and relatively uniform (they only fluctuated 10% from the mean beating interval), we easily observed the effect of haloperidol on the cell network beating interval 5 min after administering it. We also observed the beating interval returned to its original state 10 min after the haloperidol was washed out of the chip. Although the four-cell network showed the unstable recovery of its beating rhythm after washout of haloperidol, the nine-cell network recovered completely to the stable original beating rhythm even after a second administration of haloperidol. The results indicate the importance of the community size in cell networks used in the stable cell-based screening model. Moreover, they indicate the advantage of using direct cell-based measurements in which the amount of drug administered and the time course over which it is administered are strictly controlled for evaluating the quantitative chemical effects of drugs on cells.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancement in the area of green fluorescent protein techniques coupled with microscopic imaging has significantly contributed in defining and dissecting subcellular changes of apoptosis with high spatio-temporal resolution. Although single cell based studies using EGFP and associated techniques have provided valuable information of initiation and hierarchical changes of apoptosis, they are yet to be exploited for multiparameter cell based real time analysis for possible drug screening or pathway defining in a high throughput manner. Here we have developed multiple cancer cell lines expressing FRET sensors for active caspases and adapted them for high throughput live cell ratio imaging, enabling high content image based multiparameter analysis. Sensitivity of the system to detect live cell caspase activation was substantiated by confocal acceptor bleaching as well as wide field FRET imaging. Multiple caspase-specific activities of DEVDase, IETDase and LEHDase were analysed simultaneously with other decisive events of cell death. Through simultaneous analysis of caspase activation by FRET ratio change coupled with detection of mitochondrial membrane potential loss or superoxide generation, we identified several antitumor agents that induced caspase activation with or without membrane potential loss or superoxide generation. Also, cells that escaped the initial drug-induced caspase activation could be easily followed up for defining long term fate. Employing such a revisit imaging strategy of the same area, we have tracked the caspase surviving fractions with multiple drugs and its subsequent response to retreatment, revealing drug-dependent diverging fate of surviving cells. This thereby indicates towards a complex control of drug induced tumor resistance. The technique described here has wider application in both screening of compound libraries as well as in defining apoptotic pathways by linking multiple signaling to identify non-classical apoptosis inducing agents, the greatest advantage being that the high content information obtained are from individual cells rather than being population based.",

        "abstract": "The purinergic receptor signaling system plays an important role in communication between cells in the nervous system and opens new opportunities for screening of potential drugs. Our objective was to explore the pharmacological properties and establish a new methodology for ligand screening for the P2X2 receptor, which has been developed by the combinatorial library approach Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment (SELEX). To this end, membranes of 1321N1 cells stably transfected with rat P2X2 receptors were resuspended in 2% cholate detergent and subsequently coupled onto an immobilized artificial membrane (IAM). The IAM-cholate-P2X2 mixture was then dialyzed, centrifuged and packed into a FPLC column. Equilibrium binding to the receptor and competition between ATP and the purinergic antagonists suramin and 2???3???-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5???-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) were analyzed by a chromatographic assay using 32P alpha ATP as a radioligand. Our data indicate that suramin does not compete with ATP for the ligand binding site and TNP-ATP is a competitive antagonist, confirming previous studies [C.A. Trujillo, A.A. Nery, A.H. Martins, P. Majumder, F.A. Gonzalez, H. Ulrich, Biochemistry 45 (2006) 224-233]. In addition, we demonstrate that this assay can be used in in vitro selection procedures for RNA aptamers binding to P2X2 receptors. The results demonstrate that the receptor can be immobilized in a stable format and reused over an extended period of time, facilitating the exploration of ligand-receptor interactions and screening of combinatorial pools for possible ligands. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Statistics from the National Trauma Data Bank imply that discretionary blood alcohol and urine drug testing is common. However, there is little evidence to determine which patients are appropriate for routine testing, based on information available at trauma center arrival. In 2002, Langdorf reported alcohol and illicit drug rates in Trauma Activation Patients. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This is a retrospective investigation of alcohol and illicit drug rates in consecutive St. Elizabeth Health Center (SEHC) trauma patients. SEHC Trauma Activation Patients are compared with the Langdorf Activation Patients and with the SEHC Trauma Nonactivation Patients. Minimum Rates are positive tests divided by total patients (tested and not tested). Activation patients: The minimum alcohol rates were: SEHC 23.1%, Langdorf 28.2%, combined 24.8%. The minimum illicit drug rates were: SEHC 15.7%, Langdorf 23.5, combined 18.3%. The minimum alcohol and/or illicit drug rates were: SEHC 33.4%, Langdorf 41.8%, combined 36.2%. Nonactivation patients: The SEHC minimum alcohol rate was 4.7% and the minimum illicit drug rate was 6.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol and illicit drug rates were significantly greater for Trauma Activation Patients, when compared to Nonactivation Patients. At minimum, Trauma Activation Patients are likely to have a 1-in-3 positive test for alcohol and/or an illicit drug. This substantial rate suggests that Trauma Activation Patients, a readily discernible group at trauma center arrival, are appropriate for routine alcohol and illicit drug testing. However, discretionary testing is more reasonable for Trauma Nonactivation Patients, because minimum rates are low",

The purpose of in vitro testing is to aid in the selection of efficacious compounds from a range of candidates with variable levels of the desired properties. In vitro cell-culture tumor models are the most widely used screening systems, however, they lack the complexity of the natural microenvironment of the host organism. Clearly, an effective screening system should possess qualities and organization similar to those of a natural tumor microenvironment. In an attempt to better simulate a tumor and its microenvironment sophisticated models have been developed, such as the three-dimensional cultures. In addition to these in vitro culture methods, tissue-based testing methods have been used to screen potential anticancer drugs but these methods have limited utility.

The method relies on a large target database of exact monoisotopic masses representing the elemental formulae of reference drugs and their metabolites. Mass spectral identification is based on matching measured accurate mass and isotopic pattern (SigmaFit) of a sample component with those in the database. Data post-processing software was developed for automated reporting of findings in an easily interpretable form. The mean and median of SigmaFit for true-positive findings were 0.0066 and 0.0051, respectively. The mean and median of mass error absolute values for true-positive findings were 2.51 and 2.17 ppm, respectively, corresponding to 0.65 and 0.60 mTh. For routine screening practice, a SigmaFit tolerance of 0.03 and a mass tolerance of 10 ppm were chosen. Ion abundance differences from urine extracts did not affect the accuracy of the automatically acquired SigmaFit or mass values. The results show that isotopic pattern matching by SigmaFit is a powerful means of identification in addition to accurate mass measurement.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The definitive indicator of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is the profuse accumulation of amyloid-\u00df (A\u00df) within the brain. Various in vitro and cell-based models have been proposed for high throughput drug screening for potential therapeutic benefit in diseases of protein misfolding. Caenorhabditis elegans offers a convenient in vivo system for examination of A\u00df accumulation and toxicity in a complex multicellular organism. Ease of culturing and a short life cycle make this animal model well suited to rapid screening of candidate compounds.\\n\\nRESULTS: We have generated a new transgenic strain of C. elegans that expresses full length A\u00df\u2081\u208b\u2084\u2082. This strain differs from existing A\u00df models that predominantly express amino-truncated A\u00df\u2083\u208b\u2084\u2082. The A\u00df\u2081\u208b\u2084\u2082 is expressed in body wall muscle cells, where it oligomerizes, aggregates and results in severe, and fully penetrant, age progressive-paralysis. The in vivo accumulation of A\u00df\u2081\u208b\u2084\u2082 also stains positive for amyloid dyes, consistent with in vivo fibril formation. The utility of this model for identification of potential protective compounds was examined using the investigational Alzheimer's therapeutic PBT2, shown to be neuroprotective in mouse models of AD and significantly improve cognition in AD patients. We observed that treatment with PBT2 provided rapid and significant protection against the A\u00df-induced toxicity in C. elegans.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This C. elegans model of full length A\u00df\u2081\u208b\u2084\u2082 expression can now be adopted for use in screens to rapidly identify and assist in development of potential therapeutics and to study underlying toxic mechanism(s) of A\u00df.",

We addressed this need by synthesizing cartilage from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to establish and validate an in vitro model of OA.\\n\\nMETHODS: Native or iPSC-derived mouse cartilage samples were treated with the cytokine interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1) for 3 days to model the inflammatory environment of OA. The biochemical content, mechanical properties, and gene expression of the resulting tissues were assayed. In addition, the inflammatory and catabolic environment of the media was assessed. To establish high-throughput capability, we used a 96-well plate format and conducted a screen of previously identified candidate OA drugs. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release into the medium was used as the primary output for screening.\\n\\nRESULTS: Treatment of iPSC-derived or native cartilage with IL-1\u03b1 induced characteristic features of OA in a rapid and dose-dependent manner. In addition to the loss of GAGs and tissue mechanical properties, IL-1\u03b1 treatment induced the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and increased the production of the inflammatory mediators nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 . In the high-throughput screen validation, all candidate OA therapeutic agents provided some benefit, but only the NF-\u03baB inhibitor SC514 effectively reduced cartilage loss in response to IL-1\u03b1.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This work demonstrates the utility of iPSCs for studying cartilage pathology and provides a platform for identifying novel, patient-specific therapeutic agents that prevent cartilage degradation and modify the course of OA development.",

        "abstract": "Dysregulation of eating behavior can lead to obesity, which affects 10% of the adult population worldwide and accounts for nearly 3 million deaths every year. Despite this burden on society, we currently lack effective pharmacological treatment options to regulate appetite. We used Drosophila melanogaster larvae to develop a high-throughput whole organism screen for drugs that modulate food intake. In a screen of 3630 small molecules, we identified the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) receptor antagonist metitepine as a potent anorectic drug. Using cell-based assays we show that metitepine is an antagonist of all five Drosophila 5-HT receptors. We screened fly mutants for each of these receptors and found that serotonin receptor 5-HT2A is the sole molecular target for feeding inhibition by metitepine. These results highlight the conservation of molecular mechanisms controlling appetite and provide a method for unbiased whole-organism drug screens to identify novel drugs and molecular pathways modulating food intake.",

To study drug effects on three-dimensional cultures in real-time we designed and fabricated a novel type of sensor chip for fast, non-destructive impedance spectroscopy and extracellular recording. Precultured spheroids are trapped between four gold electrodes. Fifteen individual 100 \u03bcm deep square microcavities with sizes from 200 to 400 \u03bcm allow an optimised positioning during the measurement. Although apoptosis was induced in human melanoma spheroids by Camptothecin (CTT), treated cultures did not show disintegration but displayed increased impedance magnitudes compared to controls after 8 h resulting from an altered morphology of the outer cells. Contractions in cardiomyocyte spheroids were monitored when the innovative chip was used for recording of extracellular potentials. The silicon-based electrode array is used as an acute test system for the monitoring of any kind of 3D cell cultures. Since no adherence of cells or labelling is necessary the multifunctional sensor chip provides a basis for improved drug development by high content screenings with reduced costs and assay times. Additional improvements for parallel testing of different substances on one chip are presented. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Therapeutic development for Alzheimer's disease has largely focused on the removal of beta amyloid because of its suggested role in the primary agent in initiating the disease process. However, with the recent discovery of mutations that result as pathologic buildup of tau in the absence of amyloid pathology, tau is beginning to be recognized as a potential target for drug discovery. We have developed a high-throughput drug screening method that allows for direct intracellular quantitation of tau protein species, enabling the fast, reliable detection of these changes. We have identified a family of small, blood brain barrier penetrant heat shock protein 90 inhibitors that significantly reduce tau protein levels in vitro. Western blot analysis demonstrated a clear inverse correlation between the tau levels and the increase in HSP27, HSP40 and HSP90. Modifications to this assay will further allow the specific analysis of pathologically relevant species. Using this assay, we have demonstrated that a class of HSP90 inhibitors is able to significantly lower intracellular tau levels most likely through induction of a heat shock response.",

Besides the recycling of the enzyme, IMER approach allows a simple way to determine affinity data and thus the ranking of inhibiting potency of the compounds under study, especially when coupled to MS. In this study, the immobilization of MMP-8 was investigated in terms of type of support, kinetic parameters, storage and pH stability. Epoxy activated silica resulted the best matrix for the preparation of an immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER) containing human MMP-8.

The original 12 cell line hollow fibre panel has been supplemented with histology-specific panels, and we begin here to analyse their utility in predicting activity in subsequent in vivo models.

We develop environmentally and genetically driven in vitro models of the condition using human-induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes. First, we mimic diabetic clinical chemistry to induce a phenotypic surrogate of diabetic cardiomyopathy, observing structural and functional disarray. Next, we consider genetic effects by deriving cardiomyocytes from two diabetic patients with variable disease progression. The cardiomyopathic phenotype is recapitulated in the patient-specific cells basally, with a severity dependent on their original clinical status. These models are incorporated into successive levels of a screening platform, identifying drugs that preserve cardiomyocyte phenotype in vitro during diabetic stress. In this work, we present a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model of a complex metabolic condition, showing the power of this technique for discovery and testing of therapeutic strategies for a disease with ever-increasing clinical significance.",

Multiple evaluation methods indicated that the observed data are inconsistent with the threshold model while supporting the hormetic model. Hormetic response patterns were observed approximately four times more often than would be expected by chance alone. The data call for the rejection of the threshold model for low-dose prediction, and they support the hormetic model as the default model for scientific interpretation of low-dose toxicological responses.",

        "abstract": "The purinergic receptor signaling system plays an important role in communication between cells in the nervous system and opens new opportunities for screening of potential drugs. Our objective was to explore the pharmacological properties and establish a new methodology for ligand screening for the P2X2 receptor, which has been developed by the combinatorial library approach Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment (SELEX). To this end, membranes of 1321N1 cells stably transfected with rat P2X2 receptors were resuspended in 2% cholate detergent and subsequently coupled onto an immobilized artificial membrane (IAM). The IAM-cholate-P2X2 mixture was then dialyzed, centrifuged and packed into a FPLC column. Equilibrium binding to the receptor and competition between ATP and the purinergic antagonists suramin and 2'3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) were analyzed by a chromatographic assay using 32P alpha ATP as a radioligand. Our data indicate that suramin does not compete with ATP for the ligand binding site and TNP-ATP is a competitive antagonist, confirming previous studies [C.A. Trujillo, A.A. Nery, A.H. Martins, P. Majumder, F.A. Gonzalez, H. Ulrich, Biochemistry 45 (2006) 224-233]. In addition, we demonstrate that this assay can be used in in vitro selection procedures for RNA aptamers binding to P2X2 receptors. The results demonstrate that the receptor can be immobilized in a stable format and reused over an extended period of time, facilitating the exploration of ligand-receptor interactions and screening of combinatorial pools for possible ligands.",

Developing a cell-based reporter gene model targeting PPAR\u03b3 would be useful to screen human PPAR\u03b3 agonists that could be beneficial to patients with these diseases.\\n\\nMETHODS: We stably co-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line 293T cells with phPPAR\u03b3-IRES2-EGFP vector to express human PPAR\u03b3 (hPPAR\u03b3), a reporter vector pPPRE\u00d73-TK-LUC, and control vector pRL-CMV. The efficiency of the co-transfection was evaluated with flow cytometry of hPPAR\u03b3 expressing cells. Specificity of hPPAR\u03b3 activity was determined by dual luciferase reporter assay of co-transfected cells exposed to PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone, PPAR\u03b1 agonist WY14643 and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR\u03b1) agonist all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA).\\n\\nKEY FINDINGS: The phPPAR\u03b3-IRES2-EGFP co-transfected HEK293T cells showed concentration- and time-dependent luciferase induction upon exposure to the rosiglitazone, while WY14643 and ATRA were unable to activate the co-transfected HEK293T cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that the HEK293T cells could be stably transfected with hPPAR\u03b3. This cell-based drug screening platform could be used targeting specific nuclear receptor of hPPAR\u03b3 with effectiveness and specificity for hPPAR\u03b3 agonists discovery.",

The main objective of the study was to evaluate the reliability of the devices for testing drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs (DUID). The performance of the devices was assessed by their ability to detect substances using cut-offs which were set at sufficiently low levels to allow optimal detection of positive DUID cases. The devices were evaluated for the detection of amphetamine(s), cannabis, cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines when the relevant test was incorporated. Methamphetamine, MDMA and PCP tests that were included in some devices were not evaluated since there were too few positive samples. The device results were compared with confirmation analysis results in oral fluid. The opiates tests appeared to perform relatively well with sensitivity results between 69 and 90%. Amphetamines and benzodiazepines tests had lower sensitivity, although the DrugWipe test evaluated was promising for amphetamine. In particular, it is evident that the cannabis and cocaine tests of the devices still lack sensitivity, although further testing of the cocaine tests is desirable due to the low prevalence and low concentrations encountered in this study. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

Because prion protein (PrP) is necessary for prion replication but dispensable for the host, we developed the PrP-FRET-enabled high throughput assay (PrP-FEHTA) to screen for compounds that decrease PrP expression. We screened a collection of drugs approved for human use and identified astemizole and tacrolimus, which reduced cell-surface PrP and inhibited prion replication in neuroblastoma cells. Tacrolimus reduced total cellular PrP levels by a nontranscriptional mechanism. Astemizole stimulated autophagy, a hitherto unreported mode of action for this pharmacophore. Astemizole, but not tacrolimus, prolonged the survival time of prion-infected mice. Astemizole is used in humans to treat seasonal allergic rhinitis in a chronic setting. Given the absence of any treatment option for CJD patients and the favorable drug characteristics of astemizole, including its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, it may be considered as therapy for CJD patients and for prophylactic use in familial prion diseases. Importantly, our results validate PrP-FEHTA as a method to identify antiprion compounds and, more generally, FEHTA as a unique drug discovery platform.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the fabrication and use of a microfluidic device for performing whole-animal chemical screens using non-invasive electrophysiological readouts of neuromuscular function in the nematode worm, C. elegans. The device consists of an array of microchannels to which electrodes are attached to form recording modules capable of detecting the electrical activity of the pharynx, a heart-like neuromuscular organ involved in feeding. The array is coupled to a tree-like arrangement of distribution channels that automatically delivers one nematode to each recording module. The same channels are then used to perfuse the recording modules with test solutions while recording the electropharyngeogram (EPG) from each worm with sufficient sensitivity to detect each pharyngeal contraction. The device accurately reported the acute effects of known anthelmintics (anti-nematode drugs) and also correctly distinguished a specific drug-resistant mutant strain of C. elegans from wild type. The approach described here is readily adaptable to parasitic species for the identification of novel anthelmintics. It is also applicable in toxicology and drug discovery programs for human metabolic and degenerative diseases for which C. elegans is used as a model.",

This study reports a strategy for in vitro engineering of cell-compatible paper chips that allow for adherent cell culture, quantitative assessment of drug efficiency, and label-free sensing of intracellular molecules via paper spray mass spectrometry. The polycarbonate paper is employed as an excellent alternative bioscaffold for cell distribution, adhesion, and growth, as well as allowing for fluorescence imaging without light scattering. The cell-cultured paper chips are thus amenable to fabricate 3D tissue construction and cocultures by flexible deformation, stacks and assembly by layers of cells. As a result, the successful development of cell-compatible paper chips subsequently offers a uniquely flexible approach for in situ sensing of live cell components by paper spray mass spectrometry, allowing profiling the cellular lipids and quantitative measurement of drug metabolism with minimum sample pretreatment. Consequently, the developed paper chips for adherent cell culture are inexpensive for one-time use, compatible with high throughputs, and amenable to label-free and rapid analysis.",

Overall, 41% of these drivers were ultimately confirmed positive by mass spectrometry for the presence of one or more drugs. The most frequently detected drugs were cannabinoids (30%), benzodiazepines (11%) and cocaine (10%). Thirty-nine percent of drivers with blood alcohol concentrations >0.08 g/100 mL were found to be drug positive.

Many recent improvements in sample preparation, chromatographic separation, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and above all liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques are described, which are applicable or have been applied to STA and/or GUS, generally with promising results. These improvements come from miniaturization and automation of solid-phase extraction, turbulent-flow or ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography, linear ion traps, accurate (e.g., time of flight or orbital trap) mass spectrometry, as well as software refinements to alternate between different ionization modes or automatically interpret the results. It also shows that robust LC-MS/MS techniques already exist for STA or GUS, which are at least as efficient as the traditional techniques used in most toxicology laboratories, such as GC-MS or high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection, as shown by three comparative studies. However, the major drawback of LC-MS/MS in the full-scan mode for STA or GUS is that it still lacks universal reference libraries due to insufficient reproducibility of LC-MS(/MS) mass spectra obtained with different instrument types. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

One of the restricting factors for developing specific Cdk5 inhibitors is the lack of reproducible and well-characterized cellular in vitro assay systems.\\n\\nMETHODS: HEK293 cells were transfected with Cdk5 and its activator p25 as a starting point for an assay to screen for Cdk5 kinase inhibitors. To identify suitable substrates for Cdk5 we utilized an antibody that recognizes phospho serine in a consensus motif for Cdk substrates.\\n\\nRESULTS: Western blot analysis of transfected cells detected a 200 kDa band that was identified, by mass spectrometry, as non-muscle myosin heavy chain, type B (NMHC-B). Phosphorylation of NMHC-B was evident only in cells that were double transfected with Cdk5/p25 and was dose-dependently inhibited by Roscovitine and other Cdk5 inhibitors. Cdk5 was found to phosphorylate NMHC-B also in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: A novel Cdk5 substrate NMHC-B was identified in this study. A cellular assay for screening of Cdk5 inhibitors was established using NMHC-B phosphorylation as a read-out in Cdk5/p25 transfected HEK293 cells.

Immortalized cell lines overexpressing mutant CFTR are typically used to screen candidate molecules but have proven to be poor predictors of clinical efficacy. The complexity of CFTR maturation and turnover requires the use of cellular models that closely recapitulate the specific properties of the clinically most affected organs. Importantly, current screening efforts based on primary airway cells or intestinal organoids cannot specifically target single rare CFTR mutations or mimic multiple cell types.In the near future, genetically engineered induced pluripotent stem cells will provide an excellent basis for personalized organotypic models of CF disease and biological screens for identification of CFTR potentiators and correctors.",

        "abstract": "Deregulation of c-Myc plays a central role in the tumorigenesis of many human cancers. Yet, the development of drugs regulating c-Myc activity has been challenging. To facilitate the identification of c-Myc inhibitors, we developed a molecular imaging sensor-based high-throughput screening (HTS) system. This system uses a cell-based assay to detect c-Myc activation in a HTS format, which is established from a pure clone of a stable breast cancer cell line that constitutively expresses a c-Myc activation sensor. Optimization of the assay performance in the HTS format resulted in uniform and robust signals at the baseline. Using this system, we conducted a quantitative HTS against approximately 5,000 existing bioactive compounds from five different libraries. Thirty-nine potential hits were identified, including currently known c-Myc inhibitors. There are a few among the top potent hits that are not known for anti-c-Myc activity. One of these hits is nitazoxanide, a thiazolide for treating human protozoal infections. Validation of nitazoxanide in different cancer cell lines revealed a high potency for c-Myc inhibition with IC50 ranging between 10 and 500 nmol/L. Oral administration of nitazoxanide in breast cancer xenograft mouse models significantly suppressed tumor growth by inhibition of c-Myc and induction of apoptosis. These findings suggest a potential of nitazoxanide to be repurposed as a new antitumor agent for inhibition of c-Myc-associated neoplasia. Our work also demonstrated the unique advantage of molecular imaging in accelerating discovery of drugs for c-Myc-targeted cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Because Ras signaling is frequently activated by major hepatocellular carcinoma etiological factors, a transgenic zebrafish constitutively expressing the kras(V12) oncogene in the liver was previously generated by our laboratory. Although this model depicted and uncovered the conservation between zebrafish and human liver tumorigenesis, the low tumor incidence and early mortality limit its use for further studies of tumor progression and inhibition. Here, we employed a mifepristone-inducible transgenic system to achieve inducible kras(V12) expression in the liver. The system consisted of two transgenic lines: the liver-driver line had a liver-specific fabp10 promoter to produce the LexPR chimeric transactivator, and the Ras-effector line contained a LexA-binding site to control EGFP-kras(V12) expression. In double-transgenic zebrafish (driver-effector) embryos and adults, we demonstrated mifepristone-inducible EGFP-kras(V12) expression in the liver. Robust and homogeneous liver tumors developed in 100% of double-transgenic fish after 1 month of induction and the tumors progressed from hyperplasia by 1 week post-treatment (wpt) to carcinoma by 4 wpt. Strikingly, liver tumorigenesis was found to be 'addicted' to Ras signaling for tumor maintenance, because mifepristone withdrawal led to tumor regression via cell death in transgenic fish. We further demonstrated the potential use of the transparent EGFP-kras(V12) larvae in inhibitor treatments to suppress Ras-driven liver tumorigenesis by targeting its downstream effectors, including the Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways. Collectively, this mifepristone-inducible and reversible kras(V12) transgenic system offers a novel model for understanding hepatocarcinogenesis and a high-throughput screening platform for anti-cancer drugs.",

To identify inhibitors of DNA binding to NF-\u03baB, we developed a new homogeneous method for detection of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. This method, which we refer to as DSE-FRET, is based on two phenomena: protein-dependent blocking of spontaneous DNA strand exchange (DSE) between partially double-stranded DNA probes, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). If a probe labeled with a fluorophore and quencher is mixed with a non-labeled probe in the absence of a target protein, strand exchange occurs between the probes and results in fluorescence elevation. In contrast, blocking of strand exchange by a target protein results in lower fluorescence intensity. Recombinant human NF-\u03baB (p50) suppressed the fluorescence elevation of a specific probe in a concentration-dependent manner, but had no effect on a non-specific probe. Competitors bearing a NF-\u03baB binding site restored fluorescence, and the degree of restoration was inversely correlated with the number of nucleotide substitutions within the NF-\u03baB binding site of the competitor. Evaluation of two NF-\u03baB inhibitors, Evans Blue and dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin ([-]-DHMEQ), was carried out using p50 and p52 (another form of NF-\u03baB), and IC50 values were obtained. The DSE-FRET technique also detected the differential effect of (-)-DHMEQ on p50 and p52 inhibition. These data indicate that DSE-FRET can be used for high throughput screening of anticancer drugs targeted to DNA-binding proteins.",

Here we report the development of a single-quantum-dot (QD)-based nanosensor for sensitively quantifying Rev peptide-RRE interaction and characterizing the potential inhibitors by virtue of single-molecule detection and QD-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We demonstrate that the stoichiometry of Rev peptide binding to RRE can be accurately determined by using this single-QD-based nanosensor. Importantly, this single-QD-based nanosensor can sensitively quantify the inhibitory efficacy of proflavin on the Rev peptide-RRE binding, even in the presence of substantial levels of interference fluorescence from high-concentration proflavin, which usually prevents the discrimination of FRET signals in ensemble measurements. The application of this nanosensor in the screening of libraries of small-molecule drugs will facilitate the development of new drugs against various diseases, cancers, and HIV.",

The identity of MDMA was confirmed by flight time of the fragmentation ([M + H]+ ion) using a mass calculation curve, the quantification of MDMA was achieved using stable-isotope-labeled MDMA (MDMA-D5) as the internal standard. For the analysis of MDMA/MDMA-D5-spiked urine samples, the calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.1-100 ppm with a coefficient of determination, r2, of 0.9993. This assay was used to determine MDMA in actual urine samples. The MALDI-TOFMS results were comparable to the GC/MS results. No significant bias is shown between the two methods by t-test at 95% confidence level.

According to gene ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, the up-regulated genes were related to cell death and lupus erythematosus, respectively. On the other hand, the down-regulated genes were related to cell division or DNA replication. Connectivity map (cMAP) analysis revealed that the molecular drugs, such as antiasthmatic or antiallergy agents that have negative correlations with cMAP score, may have beneficial effect for the resistant subclones.

        "abstract": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) is an incurable disease that warrants new therapeutic treatments. CLL cells accumulate in the peripheral blood, in the bone marrow and in secondary lymphoid organs. Unlike circulating CLL cells, CLL cells resident in these last two compartments display high chemoresistance and proliferative capacity. Given the importance of the microenvironment in this disease, strategies that aim to develop new therapeutic agents need to consider this critical factor. Various cell culture conditions have been described that attempt to emulate either the different types of microenvironments in which CLL cells are found or an individual component of a particular microenvironment. Here, a methodology that partially mimics the interaction between CLL cells and the CD3+ CD4+ CD154+ T cells is described. Moreover, within this method, two protocols are presented and compared that may partially recapitulate different physiological states. The methodology can be exploited for target validation and drug development in CLL.",

        "title": "Cancer stem cells and escape from drug-induced premature senescence in human lung tumor cells Implications for drug resistance and in vitro drug screening models",
        "abstract": "In this study, using an in vitro human tumor model, we show that non-small lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells after treatment with DNA damaging antitumor drugs become permanently growth-arrested as a result of so-called drug-induced premature senescence (pseudo-senescence). However, a small fraction of drug-treated cells escapes pseudo-senescence that leads to re-growth of tumor cell population after drug treatment. We show that this re-growth is associated with the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in lung tumor cell population. We also document that re-growth of CSCs can be greatly delayed if lung tumor cells are treated with drug/caffeine combination that leads to the inhibition of the ATM/ATR pathway and decreased phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at Ser473. We show that in non-treated A549 cells caffeine by itself induces a reversible growth arrest that is associated with increased fraction of so-called side population cells, containing CSCs. These results point to the existence of an unknown, caffeine-sensitive mechanism that controls the number of CSCs in lung tumor cell population. Full characterization of this mechanism may lead to the development of innovative cancer therapies, which are based on small molecular weight inhibitors of CSC differentiation and self-renewal, which mimic caffeine action. Our results have also important implications for drug screening tumor models in vitro.",

        "abstract": "The rapid increase of viral strains that are resistant to the currently available antiretroviral drugs is a threat to the success of current human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) treatment and emphasizes the importance of developing novel anti-HIV-1 compounds. To improve the current abilities to screen for novel HIV-1 inhibitors, here we introduce a T-cell-based reporter cell line (JLTRG-RS) that expresses both HIV-1 coreceptors, CXCR4 and CCRS, and provides the convenience of using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a direct and quantitative marker. Unlike previous EGFP-based reporter cell lines, JLTRG-RS cells have an unusually high dynamic signal range, sufficient for plate reader detection using a 384-well format. In this format, JLTRG-R5 cell-based infectivity assays have a Z'-factor of 0.78, which defines the assay as extremely robust and clearly amenable to high-throughput screening. The functional similarity of the JLTRG-R5 cell line and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was demonstrated through the identity of the inhibitory concentrations, 50% (IC50s) for four antiretroviral compounds or neutralizing antibodies. Because EGFP can be directly and continuously quantified in cell culture, the reporter cell line requires no manipulation during assay preparation or analysis. In addition, the EGFP marker allows for data acquisition at an optimal time point by prescreening selected positive control wells using fluorescent microscopy. These characteristics make the system extremely flexible, rapid, and inexpensive. Due to its intrinsic flexibility, the JLTRG-R5 cell-based reporter system provides a powerful tool to greatly facilitate future screening for HIV-1 inhibitors.",

Urine was collected from neonates treated with phenobarbital for clinical indications within 4 to 6 hours of clinically indicated collection of serum phenobarbital levels. Urine samples were also collected from control neonates not treated with phenobarbital. One aliquot was assayed fresh, another frozen at -30 degrees C and assayed 1 to 3 months later. Phenobarbital was assayed using the ONLINE TDM Roche/Hitachi automated clinical chemistry analyzer. Serum and urine concentrations were compared as were fresh and frozen urine measurements. Serum phenobarbital ranged from 5.6 to 52.7 mug/mL. Matched urine samples were 56.6 +/- 12.5% of the serum level. Frozen samples were 98.3 +/- 8.0% of the fresh samples. Urine phenobarbital concentrations, either fresh or frozen, can be used in neonates as a noninvasive estimate of drug levels.",

        "abstract": "Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic pediatric epilepsy with severe intellectual disability, impaired social development and persistent drug-resistant seizures. One of its primary monogenic causes are mutations in Nav1.1 (SCN1A), a voltage-gated sodium channel. Here we characterize zebrafish Nav1.1 (scn1Lab) mutants originally identified in a chemical mutagenesis screen. Mutants exhibit spontaneous abnormal electrographic activity, hyperactivity and convulsive behaviours. Although scn1Lab expression is reduced, microarray analysis is remarkable for the small fraction of differentially expressed genes (~3%) and lack of compensatory expression changes in other scn subunits. Ketogenic diet, diazepam, valproate, potassium bromide and stiripentol attenuate mutant seizure activity; seven other antiepileptic drugs have no effect. A phenotype-based screen of 320 compounds identifies a US Food and Drug Administration-approved compound (clemizole) that inhibits convulsive behaviours and electrographic seizures. This approach represents a new direction in modelling pediatric epilepsy and could be used to identify novel therapeutics for any monogenic epilepsy disorder.",

However, these culture configurations do not present the actual in vivo liver cytoarchitecture for the hepatocytes cultures and thus they may compromise the cells liver-specific functions and their cuboidal morphology over longer term culture. In this study, we present a three-dimensional polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) scaffold with interconnected spherical macropores for the culturing of rat liver cells (hepatocytes). The scaffolds were integrated into our perfusion enhanced bioreactor to improve the nutrients and gas supply for cell cultures. The liver-specific functions of the cell culture were assessed by their albumin and urea production, and the changes in the cell morphology were tracked by immunofluorescence staining over 9 days of culture period. N-Acetyl-Para-Amino-Phenol (acetaminophen) was used as drug model to investigate the response of cells to drug in our scaffold-bioreactor system. Our experimental results revealed that the perfusion enhanced PDMS-based scaffold system provides a more conducive microenvironment with better cell-to-cell contacts among the hepatocytes that maintains the culture specific enzymatic functions and their cuboidal morphology during the culturing period. The numerical simulation results further showed improved oxygen distribution within the culturing chamber with the scaffold providing an additional function of shielding the cell cultures from the potentially detrimental fluid induced shear stresses. In conclusion, this study could serve a crucial role as a platform for future preclinical hepatotoxicity testing.",

To this end, the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) PCa model using immunocompromised mice was established to model the disease with greater fidelity than is possible with currently employed cell lines grown on tissue culture plastic. However, poorly adherent PDX tumor cells exhibit low viability in standard culture, making it difficult to manipulate these cells for subsequent controlled mechanistic studies. To overcome this challenge, we encapsulated PDX tumor cells within a three-dimensional hyaluronan-based hydrogel and demonstrated that the hydrogel maintains PDX cell viability with continued native androgen receptor expression. Furthermore, a differential sensitivity to docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic drug, was observed as compared to a traditional PCa cell line. These findings underscore the potential impact of this novel 3D PDX PCa model as a diagnostic platform for rapid drug evaluation and ultimately push personalized medicine toward clinical reality.",

        "abstract": "We developed a biosensor based on the redox properties of human CYP3A4 to directly monitor electron transfer to the heme protein. Enzyme films were assembled on gold electrodes by alternate adsorption of a CYP3A4 layer on top of a polycation layer. Direct, reversible electron transfer between the electrode and CYP3A4 was observed with voltammetry under anaerobic conditions. In the presence of oxygen, the oxidation peak of the hemoprotein disappeared, and the reduction peak increased 2- to 3-fold. Addition of CYP3A4 substrates (verapamil, midazolam, quinidine, and progesterone) to the oxygenated solution caused a concentration-dependent increase in the reduction current in cyclic voltammetric and amperometric experiments. Product analyses after electrolysis with the enzyme film showed catalytic activity of the biosensor depending on substrate concentration, its inhibition by ketoconazole, and a minor contribution of H(2)O(2) to the catalytic cycle. These results suggest that electron exchange between the electrode and the immobilized CYP3A4 occurred, and that metabolic activity of the enzyme was maintained. Thus, important requirements for the application of human CYP biosensors in order to identify drugs or drug candidates as substrates or inhibitors to the attached enzyme are fulfilled.

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative tauopathies are defined as a group of dementia and movement disorders characterized by prominent filamentous tau inclusions and degeneration located within certain brain regions. Their common sign is a presence of proteinaceous aggregates composed of hyperphosphorylated and truncated tau proteins. The molecular mechanisms of the disease still remain unresolved, therefore transgenic organisms displaying tau-related neurodegenerative cascade have been created to allow decoding of individual pathways involved in human pathological conditions. Moreover, use of transgenic model organisms enables the application of potential therapeutic approaches. The expression of mutated or misfolded tau as a transgene in vivo leads to significant alteration of neurobehavioral features of experimental animal, therefore detailed classification of behavioral phenotype become one of the first crucial analyses, while it functionally correlates with central nervous system impairment. Currently, two major types of behavioral impairment have been described in transgenic rodent models of tauopathies, (1) progressive motor impairment associated with muscular weakness and premature death and (2) age-related impairment of cognitive functions attended with unaffected motor status. Up to the present, only transgenic models displaying motor impairment were successfully applied into the drug trials targeting misfolded tau protein, despite their behavioral inconsistence with clinical profile of progressive human tauopathy. The aim of this study was, therefore, to summarize the pros and cons of used transgenic rodent models mimicking human tauopathies in connection with development of therapeutic strategies.",

Efficient use of oocytes for ion channel characterization requires a system that is inherently stable, reproducible, minimizes drug volumes, and maximizes oocyte longevity. We have constructed a vertical flow oocyte recording chamber to address the aforesaid issues, where the oocyte is placed in a funnel-shaped chamber and perfused from the bottom of the funnel. The vertical rather than horizontal flow of perfusate results in an unusually stable environment for oocyte recording. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from a single oocyte are acquired easily and routinely over several hours while maintaining stable baseline currents and reproducible response profiles. Chamber characteristics were tested using a serotonin ligand-gated ion channel receptor (5-HT3R). Data obtained from this system corresponds well with published data. To further test the stability and reliability of this perfusion chamber, we constructed an automated oocyte perfusion system utilizing a commonly available HPLC autosampler. We were able to obtain dose-response curves for various 5-HT3AR ligands using the automated perfusion system with minimal user intervention. Such a system can easily satisfy need for automated oocyte electrophysiology in academic settings, especially small to medium sized laboratories. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The basic consideration in the field of antidepressants is that tests to model depression do not exist, as depression etiopathology is unknown. So far, any kind of proposed model for depression needs to satisfy construct, face and predictive validities. In the present editorial, this idea is challenged, based on the fact that \u201cold\u201d methods can only reveal therapeutical \u201cme-too\u201d drugs and that there is no longer a need of therapeutical \u201cme-too\u201d drugs in the field of antidepressants. Since reduction in the number of antidepressant nonresponders is a real medical need, the predictive validity of animal models will be challenged in the future, as the new methods should be based on antidepressantinsensitive animals. Moreover, antidepressants exert similar effects in depressed and non-depressed subjects, but mood normalization is only induced in depressed patients. This implies that the use of normal cells and animals only involves pharmacological rather than therapeutical actions of drugs. Therefore, the use of environmental-induced changes, in the hope that these can evidence antidepressant-insensitive animals, will predominantly be used in the future. In the choice of experimental settings, other factors need to be taken into consideration: (1) gender of animals, as depression affects females more than males, (2) natural rhythmicity in drug effects; (3) pharmacokinetics; and (4) possible biomarker(s) to be measured. There are no golden recipes to discover new antidepressants but the experimental long-term strategy should very clearly be declared before starting the experiments.",

In recent years, yeast has revealed to be a powerful model to identify responsible genes, to study primary effects of pathogenic mutations and to determine the molecular mechanisms leading to mitochondrial disorders.

However, there are few agents currently approved for the treatment of obesity. Those that are available are mainly appetite suppressants and gastrointestinal fat blockers. We have developed a simple and rapid method for the measurement of the feeding volume of Danio rerio (zebrafish). This assay can be used to screen appetite suppressants and enhancers. In this study, zebrafish were fed viable paramecia that were fluorescently-labeled, and feeding volume was measured using a 96-well microplate reader. Gene expression analysis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), knockdown of appetite-regulating genes (neuropeptide Y, preproinsulin, melanocortin 4 receptor, agouti related protein, and cannabinoid receptor 1), and the administration of clinical appetite suppressants (fluoxetine, sibutramine, mazindol, phentermine, and rimonabant) revealed the similarity among mechanisms regulating appetite in zebrafish and mammals. In combination with behavioral analysis, we were able to evaluate adverse effects on locomotor activities from gene knockdown and chemical treatments. In conclusion, we have developed an assay that uses zebrafish, which can be applied to high-throughput screening and target gene discovery for appetite suppressants and enhancers.",

However, the development of anti-HIV herbal drugs has proceeded slowly, partly because of the lack of a high-throughput system for screening these drugs. The present study evaluated 16 herbal medicines for anti-HIV activities in vitro and in vivo. Herbal medicines were first screened for the ability to regulate C-X-C receptor 4 (CXCR4) and C-C receptor 5 (CCR5) promoter activities. A single-round pseudotyped HIV-luciferase reporter virus system (HIV-Luc) was used to identify potential anti-HIV mechanisms. CD4+ T cells from healthy volunteers were examined for changes in CXCR4 and CCR5 levels. HIV-1 replication was evaluated by ELISA. Spica Prunellae and Herba Andrographitis were found to down-regulate the activities of both the CXCR4 and CCR5 promoters. Also, Spica Prunellae and Herba Andrographitis (>1000 \u03bcM) inhibited HIV-1 in a dose-dependent manner. CXCR4 and CCR5 levels were reduced in CD4+ T cells from healthy volunteers (p<0.05). Spica Prunellae and Herba Andrographitis (EC\u2085\u2080: 3.18 and 5.49 \u03bcg/mL, respectively) could suppress cell fusion and decrease p24 antigen. In conclusion, the data demonstrated that Spica Prunellae and Herba Andrographitis possessed anti-HIV-1 capabilities, perhaps through the inhibition of the CXCR4 and CCR5 promoters and HIV-1 replication.",

Based on the islet-differentiation ability of ductal epithelial cells and stimulating \u03b2 cell proliferation ability of the Reg I\u03b1 gene, we aimed to establish an in vitro pancreatic \u03b2 cell proliferation model for screening therapeutic drugs of diabetes in the future. Pancreatic ductal epithelial cells were isolated from male Wistar rats, and induced to differentiate into pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Immunofluorescence staining assay, western blot, RT-PCR analysis, and dithizone staining were used to characterize the cells. Rat Reg I\u03b1 protein was transiently expressed in vitro by transfection of HEK 293 cells with the PCMV6-entry-REG Ia plasmid, and expression was verified by RT-PCR analysis, proliferation assay, and apoptosis assay. The pancreatic \u03b2 cell proliferation model was further validated by a proliferation assay using differentiated pancreatic \u03b2 cells treated with transfection supernatant. Finally, we have successfully established an in vitro pancreatic \u03b2 cells proliferation model using transiently expressed rat Reg I\u03b1 protein and differentiated pancreatic \u03b2 cells from pancreatic ductal epithelial cells.

To add high-throughput capacity to flow cytometry, we developed a cell-based multiplexing technique called fluorescent cell barcoding (FCB). In FCB, each sample is labeled with a different signature, or barcode, of fluorescence intensity and emission wavelengths, and mixed with other samples before antibody staining and analysis by flow cytometry. Using three FCB fluorophores, we were able to barcode and combine entire 96-well plates, reducing antibody consumption 100-fold and acquisition time to 5-15 min per plate. Using FCB and phospho-specific flow cytometry, we screened a small-molecule library for inhibitors of T cell-receptor and cytokine signaling, simultaneously determining compound efficacy and selectivity. We also analyzed IFN-gamma signaling in multiple cell types from primary mouse splenocytes, revealing differences in sensitivity and kinetics between B cells, CD4+ and CD4- T cells and CD11b-hi cells.",

        "abstract": "WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: This study examined the ability of an algorithm applied to urine drug levels of hydrocodone in healthy adult volunteers to differentiate among low, medium and high doses of hydrocodone. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers received 20, 60 and 120 mg daily doses of hydrocodone dosed to steady-state at each level while under a naltrexone blockade. Using a florescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA), two urine samples were taken at each dosing level from each participant once steady-state was reached. The concordance was calculated for raw and adjusted FPIA urine hydrocodone values within each study participant across all doses. An analysis of medians was calculated for each of the dosage groupings using Bonett-Price confidence intervals for both raw and adjusted FPIA values. Finally, the Somers' D rank order analysis was performed for both raw and adjusted FPIA methods followed by a linear comparison of parameters to further determine which lab value reporting method produced a better fit with dosage. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The concordance correlation coefficient for the pairs of raw urine FPIA values was 0\u00b7339, while the concordance correlation coefficient for the pairs of normalized FPIA values using the algorithm was 0\u00b7677. While some overlap of the confidence intervals was observed using the raw FPIA values, the intervals for the adjusted FPIA levels did not overlap between any dose levels, despite the application of a Bonferroni adjustment to correct for multiple comparisons. Results of the Somers' D analyses suggest that the adjusted FPIA method is 15% more likely to be concordant with dose than the raw value method. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to raw FPIA values, an algorithm that normalizes hydrocodone urine drug levels for PH, specific gravity and lean body mass discriminates well between all three of the daily doses of hydrocodone tested (20, 60 and 120 mg), even when correcting for multiple analyses.",

        "abstract": "We have used a modified 3D cellular microarray platform for the high-throughput analysis of growth, cytotoxicity, and protein expression profile of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2, in alginate. The results obtained were compared to analogous studies in 2D and 3D environments at the microtiter scale. The antiproliferative effects of four drugs, tamoxifen, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and amitriptyline, were studied as a function of seeding density in the three different culture platforms. The chemosensitivity of HepG2 cells to all four compounds decreased substantially with increasing cell number in the 2D and 3D microtiter-based cultures, while no seeding density dependence was observed in the IC50 values obtained in the 3D microarray culture platform. These results can be rationalized based on the development of confluence-dependent resistance in cultures where proliferation is restricted by cell-cell contacts and nutrient availability, as is the case for both of the microtiter-based cultures. Additionally, further development of an on-chip, in-cell immunofluorescence assay provided quantitative data on the levels of specific target proteins involved in proliferation, adhesion, angiogenesis and drug metabolism, and was used to compare expression profiles between 2D and 3D environments. The up-regulation of several CYP450 enzymes, \u03b21-integrin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the 3D microarray cultures suggests that this platform provides a more in vivo-like environment allowing cells to approach their natural phenotype. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "title": "Assessment of re-aggregated human pancreatic islets for secondary drug screening",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets is a pivotal assay in developing novel insulin secretagogues, given its good correlation with in vivo efficacy. Because the supply of human islets is limited, this assay is typically run with rodent islets, which do not address species differences and are low-throughput, because of the size matching or volume normalization required. Here we have evaluated the suitability of human re-aggregated islets for this assay.\\n\\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We generated re-aggregated human islets of a consistent size, using micromolds and compared their responses with those of native human and rat islets, to known secretagogues and inhibitors of insulin release.\\n\\nKEY RESULTS: Insulin secretion from rat islets, human islets and human re-aggregated cell clusters was concentration-dependently increased by glucose. The calcium channel agonist, Bay K 8644, stimulated insulin secretion in native rat islets and human re-aggregated islets, but not native human islets. Glibenclamide and tolbutamide were more effective and potent in re-aggregated human clusters compared with the other two preparations. Rat islets outperformed both human preparations of islets in response to caffeine, carbachol and glucagon-like peptide-1. Re-aggregated human islet clusters were more sensitive to somatostatin, diazoxide and sodium azide, but rodent islets were more sensitive to nifedipine.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Human re-aggregated clusters of islet cells, of a constant size were more responsive to all compounds tested than native human islets. Importantly, the assay variability was less in the re-aggregated cluster preparations, which suggests that such re-aggregated cells could be useful for drug development.",

        "abstract": "To diagnose the cause of death in autopsy cases, systematic examinations, such as macroscopic, pathological, biochemical, and toxicological are important. In this case report, drug examinations also gave very useful information to diagnose the cause of death, fatal diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). A female methamphetamine abuser in her forties was found dead lying on a hotel bed. Diagnosing her cause of death was difficult only from the macroscopic findings because there was no fatal and/or serious injury or disease. On toxicological examination, acetone was detected at a high concentration (682 ??g/mL in blood, 887 ??g/mL in urine) using gas chromatography (GC). Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), methamphetamine was detected in the blood, urine, hair, and visceral organs; however, these concentrations were low. At the same time, GC-MS examination revealed a high glucose peak. From the results of the biochemical examination of urine, acetoacetic acid was 1940 ??mol/L, ??-hydroxybutyric acid was 14,720 ??mol/L, and glucose was 4620 mg/dL. Histologically, Langerhans' islets in the pancreas were fibrotic and atrophic, and no insulin-immunoreactive cells were observed. The subsequent police investigation also revealed that she had contracted diabetes mellitus type 1; therefore, we concluded that her cause of death was DKA, due to a lack of insulin injection. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To this end we compared the effect of eight anticancer drugs and 10 toxic compounds without known antitumor activity in cultures of human breast cancer cells and normal diploid fibroblasts by Apoptosis ELISA and growth inhibition assays. There was an overlap in concentration values of drugs and toxins inhibiting proliferation in cancer cells. In contrast, Apoptosis ELISA clearly distinguished between the two groups of compounds. Anticancer drugs induced apoptosis in cancer cells at 0.0015-0.5 microM, while toxins were effective at much higher concentrations of 8.0-50.0 microM. Moreover, six out of the 10 toxins did not induce apoptosis in cancer cells. The normal:cancer cell (N:C) ratio for growth inhibiting concentrations was in a similar range for anticancer drugs and toxins. The N:C ratio for apoptosis inducing concentrations was 33-200 for anticancer drugs and 1.3-3.0 for toxins. Our data indicate that apoptosis assays could be used to detect selective toxicity of anticancer drugs by determining apoptosis induction in cancer cells or through a comparison of apoptosis-inducing concentrations in normal and cancer cells.",

Immobilization of drugs, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), on gold microparticles allowed us to investigate the high-throughput release of these drugs from GelMA-gold microparticle gradient systems. The latter gradient constructs were incubated with C2C12 myoblasts for 24. h to examine the cell viability through the release of 6-OHDA. The drug was released from the microparticles in a gradient manner, inducing a cell viability gradient. This novel approach to create 3D chemical gradients within hydrogels is scalable to any arbitrary length scale. It is useful for making anisotropic biomimetic materials and high-throughput platforms to investigate cell-microenvironment interactions in a rapid, simple, cost-effective, and reproducible manner. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports a novel design of a miniaturized three-electrode electrochemical cell, the purpose of which is aimed at generating drug metabolites with a high conversion efficiency. The working electrode and the counter electrode are placed in two separate channels to isolate the reaction products generated at both electrodes. The novel design includes connecting channels between these two electrode channels to provide a uniform distribution of the current density over the entire working electrode. In addition, the effect of ohmic drop is decreased. Moreover, two flow resistors are included to ensure an equal flow of analyte through both electrode channels. Total conversion of fast reacting ions is achieved at flow rates up to at least 8 \u03bcL/min, while the internal chip volume is only 175 nL. Using this electrochemical chip, the metabolism of mitoxantrone is studied by microchip electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. At an oxidation potential of 700 mV, all known metabolites from direct oxidation are observed. The electrochemical chip performs equally well, compared to a commercially available cell, but at a 30-fold lower flow of reagents.",

        "title": "Role of urine drug screening in the medical clearance of pediatric psychiatric patients: is there one?",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to investigate whether urine drug screen (UDS) results affected the medical management of pediatric psychiatric patients presenting to the pediatric emergency department (ED) for psychiatric evaluation and whether it affected the final disposition of these patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of patients who presented to an urban pediatric ED in Newark, NJ, with psychiatric or behavior problems for medical clearance before psychiatric evaluation between June 3, 2008, and June 3, 2009. Inclusion criteria were any patient between the ages of 0 to 20 years who presented to the pediatric ED and had a UDS performed. Exclusion criteria were if the UDS was obtained for a primary medical workup such as altered mental status, known or admitted overdose, or accidental ingestions, or no psychiatric consultation was made from the ED. Abstracted descriptive data include patient's age, sex, race, and insurance status. Visit-specific data include patient's reason for visit, results of the UDS, psychiatric diagnosis if any, history of substance abuse if any, and management decisions other than psychiatric evaluation after medical clearance. RESULTS: A total of 875 charts were identified from laboratory records; 539 of those patients presented to the pediatric ED for psychiatric evaluation. A total of 62 patients had at least 1 substance detected on the UDS and were referred to psychiatry. All of the patients who had presented for psychiatric evaluation, including those with a positive result on the UDS, were medically cleared with no documented change in management or medical intervention in the pediatric ED. CONCLUSIONS: Obtaining a UDS on patients who presented to the pediatric ED for medical clearance before psychiatric evaluation did not alter medical decision for clearance nor necessitate any change in management or interventions before psychiatric evaluation.",

        "title": "Drug Screening for Autophagy Inhibitors Based on the Dissociation of Beclin1-Bcl2 Complex Using BiFC Technique and Mechanism of Eugenol on Anti-Influenza A Virus Activity",
        "abstract": "Autophagy is involved in many human diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and virus infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza A virus (IAV) and coxsackievirus B3/B4 (CVB3/B4), so a drug screening model targeting autophagy may be very useful for the therapy of these diseases. In our study, we established a drug screening model based on the inhibition of the dissociation of Beclin1-Bcl2 heterodimer, an important negative regulator of autophagy, using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) technique for developing novel autophagy inhibitors and anti-IAV agents. From 86 examples of traditional Chinese medicines, we found Syzygium aromaticum L. had the best activity. We then determined the anti-autophagy and anti-IAV activity of eugenol, the major active compound of Syzygium aromaticum L., and explored its mechanism of action. Eugenol could inhibit autophagy and IAV replication, inhibited the activation of ERK, p38MAPK and IKK/NF-\u03baB signal pathways and antagonized the effects of the activators of these pathways. Eugenol also ameliorated the oxidative stress and inhibited the expressions of autophagic genes. We speculated that the mechanism underlying might be that eugenol inhibited the oxidative stress and the activation of ERK1/2, p38MAPK and IKK/NF-\u03baB pathways, subsequently inhibited the dissociation of Beclin1-Bcl2 heterodimer and autophagy, and finally impaired IAV replication. These results might conversely display the reasonableness of the design of our screening model. In conclusion, we have established a drug screening model for developing novel autophagy inhibitor, and find eugenol as a promising inhibitor for autophagy and IAV infection.",

        "abstract": "We have developed an expression system capable of producing large quantities of low cost, specific peptides that are either His12 -tagged, biotinylated, or unlabeled. The flexibility of this peptide system is suitable for interaction studies via surface plasmon resonance (SPR), co-crystallization, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gene blocks containing peptide sequences of interest in addition to a 15 amino acid AviTag, were cloned into a vector expressing an N-terminal maltose binding protein. The constructs were expressed and purified, and the molecular weights of the recombinant proteins were estimated by analytical size exclusion chromatography. Successful in situ biotinylation of the AviTag was confirmed by anti-biotin western blot and was used for coupling to the surface plasmon resonance chip. We were able to validate, as a proof of concept study, the specific protein-protein interaction of Plasmodium falciparum aldolase (PfAldolase) with three different cytoplasmic adhesin tail peptides from the family of thrombospondin-related anonymous proteins (TRAPs), and to determine their affinities. This method of peptide production enables high yield production of peptides in a two-day, cost effective manner. This tool will allow us to screen for protein-protein interaction inhibitors directed toward the liver stage and blood stage complexes of the glideosome in Plasmodium species. Adaptation of this tool will allow researchers to pursue their own studies of protein-protein interactions.",

Success in the generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) as well as related emerging technology on the iPS platform provide great promise in the development of regenerative medicine. Human iPS cells show almost identical properties to human embryonic stem cells (ESC) in pluripotency, but avoid many of their limitations of use. In addition, investigations into reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells facilitate a deeper understanding of human stem cell biology. The iPS cell technology has offered a unique platform for studying the pathogenesis of human disease, pharmacological and toxicological testing, and cell-based therapy. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain to be overcome before the promise of human iPS cell technology can be realised.",

        "abstract": "Major depression is a common mood disorder that affects overall health; currently, almost all of the available antidepressants have the same core mechanisms of action through promotion of serotonin or noradrenaline function in the brain. The major limitation of today's antidepressants is that chronic treatment (3 - 6 weeks) is required before a therapeutic benefit is achieved. More effective and faster treatments for depression are needed. Adult neurogenesis is the birth of new neurons, which continues postnatally and into adulthood in the brains of multiple species, including humans. Recently, a large body of evidence gives rise to the hypothesis that the antidepressant effect and increases in adult hippocampal neurogenesis may be causally related. Multiple classes of antidepressants increase hippocampal neurogenesis in a chronic, but not acute, time course. This effect corresponds to the therapeutic time lag associated with current antidepressants. In addition, antidepressants are not effective in behavioral models of depression when hippocampal neurogenesis is prevented. This review examines the current understanding of adult neurogenesis and the evidence of the causal relationship between antidepressant effects and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. We also present our recent research findings, which support a promising strategy for enhancing adult hippocampal neurogenesis that might be a new approach for the development of novel antidepressants.",

        "abstract": "Development of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires appropriate cell culture models that reflect the errant biochemical pathways and animal models that reflect the pathological hallmarks of the disease as well as the clinical manifestations. In the past two decades AD research has benefited significantly from the use of genetically engineered cell lines expressing components of the amyloid-generating pathway, as well as from the study of transgenic mice that develop the pathological hallmarks of the disease, mainly neuritic plaques. The choice of certain cell types and the choice of mouse as the model organism have been mandated by the feasibility of introduction and expression of foreign genes into these model systems. We describe a universal and efficient gene-delivery system, using lentiviral vectors, that permits the development of relevant cell biological systems using neuronal cells, including primary neurons and animal models in mammalian species best suited for the study of AD. In addition, lentiviral gene delivery provides avenues for creation of novel models by direct and prolonged expression of genes in the brain in any vertebrate animal. TranzVector is a lentiviral vector optimized for efficiency and safety that delivers genes to cells in culture, in tissue explants, and in live animals regardless of the dividing or differentiated status of the cells. Genes can also be delivered efficiently to fertilized single-cell-stage embryos of a wide range of mammalian species, broadening the range of the model organism (from rats to nonhuman primates) for the study of disease mechanism as well as for development of therapeutics.",

Near-infrared 80 MHz picojoule femtosecond laser pulses were employed to excite endogenous fluorophores and fluorescent components of a variety of ointments via a two-photon excitation process. In addition, collagen was imaged by second harmonic generation. A high submicron spatial resolution and 50 ps temporal resolution was achieved using galvoscan mirrors and piezodriven focusing optics together with a time-correlated single-photon counting module with a fast microchannel plate detector. Individual intratissue cells, intracellular mitochondria, melanosomes, and the morphology of the nuclei as well as extracellular matrix elements were clearly visualized due to NAD(P)H, melanin, elastin, and collagen imaging and the calculation of fluorescence lifetime images. Nanoparticles and intratissue drugs were detected by two-photon-excited fluorescence. In addition, hydration effects and UV effects were studied by monitoring modifications of cellular morphology and autofluorescence. The system was used to observe the diffusion through the stratum corneum and the accumulation and release of functionalized nanoparticles along hair shafts and epidermal ridges. The novel noninvasive 4-D multiphoton tomography tool provides high-resolution optical biopsies with subcellular resolution, and offers for the first time the possibility to study in situ the diffusion through the skin barrier, long-term pharmacokinetics, and cellular response to cosmetic and pharmaceutical products.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin A is known to be critical for the beginning of eye development as well as for photoreception in the functional retina. Hardly anything, however, is known about whether retinoic acid (RA)-regulated gene expression also plays a role in the long intervening period, during which the neurobiological retinal structure takes shape. The eye contains a highly intricate architecture of RA-synthesizing (RALDH) and degrading (CYP26) enzymes. Whereas the RALDHs are integrated in the early molecular mechanisms through which the dorso-ventral retina organization is established, the CYP26 enzymes are not necessary for this process and no molecular targets that match their retinal expression pattern have yet been identified. In this article we describe that CYP26 expression in the mouse is most distinctive during later stages of retina formation. Throughout development CYP26A1 degrades RA in a horizontal region that extends across the retina, but during later embryonic and postnatal retina maturation this function is reinforced by another enzyme, CYP26C1. RA applications at this stage do not affect the RALDHs but cause differential changes in CYP26 expression: Cyp26a1 is up-regulated, but more rapidly by 9-cis than all-trans RA, Cyp26c1 is down-regulated, and Cyp26b1, which is undetectable in the normal mouse retina, is strongly activated in retinal ganglion cells. The dynamic regulation in RA-difference patterns by the CYP26 enzymes may set up spatial constellations for expression of genes involved in formation of retinal specializations for higher acuity vision, which are known to form over a prolonged period late in retina development.

Using molecular modeling, the construct was designed to encode the p51 subunit joined by a linker to the thumb (T), connection (C), and RNase H (R) domains of p66. This p51-G-TCR construct was purified from the soluble fraction of an Escherichia coli strain, MIC2067(DE3), lacking endogenous RNase HI and HII. The p51-G-TCR RNase H construct displayed Mg(2+)-dependent activity using a fluorescent nonspecific assay and showed the same cleavage pattern as HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) on substrates that mimic the tRNA removal required for second-strand transfer reactions. The mutant E706Q (E478Q in RT) was purified under similar conditions and was not active. The RNase H of the p51-G-TCR RNase H construct and wild type HIV-1 RT had similar K(m)s for an RNA-DNA hybrid substrate and showed similar inhibition kinetics to two known inhibitors of the HIV-1 RT RNase H.",

Cancer cells usually gain such migratory capability through an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Herein we present a high-throughput microfluidic device with 3120 microchambers to specifically monitor mesenchymal migration. Through imaging of the whole chip and statistical analysis, we can evaluate the two key factors of velocity and percentage related to cell migratory capacity at different cell densities in culture. We also used the device to screen antimetastatic drugs for their inhibition of mesenchymal migration and prevention of metastatic malignancy. This device will provide an excellent platform for biologists to gain a better understanding of cancer metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Since Takagi et al. reported an experimental chronic gastric ulcer model [acetic acid ulcers induced by submucosal injection of acetic acid (Type 1)], we further modified the methodology and subsequently devised three more models. The second model involves inducing ulcers by serosal application of an acetic acid solution (Type 2) and the third model achieves ulcer induction by intragastric application of an acetic acid solution (Type 3). The forth model was modification of the third model by giving the acetic acid solution and the same volume of air to make one ulcer in the stomach (Type 4). In general, animals accepted the procedures without problems and no undesirable effects were noticed. More importantly, this experimental animal model allows production of ulcers that highly resemble human ulcers in terms of both pathology and healing. Indeed, relapse is even endoscopically observed for 360 days after ulceration. The ulcers produced not only respond well to various anti-ulcer medications, such as antisecretory and mucosal protective drugs and growth factors, but also demonstrate appropriate responses to ulcerogenic agents such as NSAIDs. In addition, we have recently demonstrated that H. pylori infection resulted in delayed ulcer healing and recurrence of healed acetic acid ulcers induced in Mongolian gerbils. The present article gives a brief summary of the ulcer history before establishment of acetic acid ulcers and characteristic features of acetic acid ulcer, including both their merits and shortcomings.",

        "abstract": "Identification of factors that improve muscle function in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) could lead to an improved quality of life. To establish a functional in vitro assay for muscle strength, mdx murine myoblasts, the genetic homologue of DMD, were tissue engineered in 96-microwell plates into 3-dimensional muscle constructs with parallel arrays of striated muscle fibers. When electrically stimulated, they generated tetanic forces measured with an automated motion tracking system. Thirty-one compounds of interest as potential treatments for patients with DMD were tested at 3 to 6 concentrations. Eleven of the compounds (insulin-like growth factor-1, creatine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, trichostatin A, lisinopril, and 6 from the glucocorticoid family) significantly increased tetanic force relative to placebo-treated controls. The glucocorticoids methylprednisolone, deflazacort, and prednisone increased tetanic forces at low doses (EC(50) of 6, 19, and 56 nM, respectively), indicating a direct muscle mechanism by which they may be benefitting DMD patients. The tetanic force assay also identified beneficial compound interactions (arginine plus deflazacort and prednisone plus creatine) as well as deleterious interactions (prednisone plus creatine inhibited by pentoxifylline) of combinatorial therapies taken by some DMD patients. Since mdx muscle in vivo and DMD patients respond in a similar manner to many of these compounds, the in vitro assay will be a useful tool for the rapid identification of new potential treatments for muscle weakness in DMD and other muscle disorders.",

        "abstract": "Trypanosomes are a group of protozoan parasites that inflict huge health and economic burdens across the globe. The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness, has a highly sophisticated mechanism of antigenic variation that facilitates chronic survival in the mammalian host, and also all but eliminates any realistic hope for vaccination-based control. However, trypanosomes are also highly divergent organisms, with many biochemical processes setting them apart from their hosts, and there remains great optimism that these features may be exploited for development of new drugs. Unfortunately, the compounds that are in use at present are decades old and resistance has emerged. The article in this issue of the Biochemical Journal by Patham et al., a joint team from the universities of Pittsburgh and Georgia, represents one approach to exploiting this divergence. The authors of the study have exploited novel aspects of the biochemistry within the system for translocation of nascent polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to identify three compounds that are able to inhibit the process. They then demonstrate that these same compounds are both trypanocidal, but well tolerated by human tissue culture cells. These observations may present interesting new leads in the fight against trypanosomiasis, and potentially identify a new target that can be explored for therapeutic potential.",

SETTING A randomised controlled trial (1981-present) of 153,000 subjects, of whom approximately half were offered biennial FOB testing over up to five screening rounds. METHODS The additional costs of participation in screening relative to symptomatic presentation were calculated by combining the results of (i) a comprehensive audit of resource use on the part of subjects within the trial, (ii) previously-established unit costs for each of the procedures involved. Life expectancy gains were estimated from a survival analysis of those trial subjects who had been diagnosed with cancer (screening participants vs controls). RESULTS The cost of screening under the Nottingham trial protocol was pound 5290 per cancer detected (at 2002 prices). Under conservative assumptions, the incremental cost per life year gained as a result of screening was pound 1584 (Confidence Interval [CI]:717 to 8612).",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Enoyl acyl-carrier-protein reductase (InhA), the primary endogenous target for isoniazid and ethionamide, is crucial to type-II fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS-II). The objectives of this study were first to generate InhA mutants of Mycobacterium aurum, secondly to characterize InhA-mediated isoniazid and ethionamide resistance mechanisms across those mutants and finally to investigate the interaction of InhA with enzymes in the FAS-II pathway in M. aurum. METHODS: Spontaneous mutants were generated by isoniazid overdose and limited broth dilution, while for genetically modified mutants sense-antisense DNA technology was used. Southern hybridization and immunoprecipitation were both used to identify the InhA homologue in M. aurum. The latter method was further used to compare the level of InhA expression in M. aurum with that in corresponding mutants. Isoniazid/ethionamide susceptibility modulation was examined in vitro and ex vivo using a resazurin assay as well as by cfu counting. In addition, circular dichroism and the bacterial two-hybrid system were exploited to investigate the interaction of InhA with other enzymes of the FAS-II pathway. RESULTS: A Mycobacterium tuberculosis InhA homologue was detected in M. aurum. Susceptibility to isoniazid/ethionamide was significantly altered in genetically modified mutants and simultaneously InhA was overexpressed in both spontaneous and genetically modified mutants. InhA interacts with other FAS-II enzymes of M. aurum in vivo. CONCLUSION: Close resemblance of isoniazid/ethionamide action on InhA between M. tuberculosis and M. aurum further supports the use of fast-growing and intracellularly surviving drug-resistant M. aurum to substitute for highly virulent, extremely slow-growing M. tuberculosis strains in the early stage of antituberculosis inhibitor screening.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) with untargeted data collection is especially attractive for general unknown drug screening owing to its ability to identify unexpected compounds. LC-HRMS offers several advantages over traditional selected reaction monitoring (SRM) techniques and could be an ideal screening platform as long as its analytical performance is comparable to that of SRM-based methods. METHODS: We developed a broad-spectrum drug screen on a high-resolution mass spectrometer [tandem quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF)] that collected data in an untargeted manner and compared its performance to a nominal mass instrument [triple quadrupole linear ion trap (QqLIT)] that collected data in a targeted manner. Both methods used information-dependent acquisition of product ion spectra. We evaluated the lower limits of detection and matrix effects for each method and compared their ability to identify drugs in 100 routine clinical urine samples. Additional information (patient prescription history, drug screening results, etc.) was used to confirm discordant results. RESULTS: QqLIT was slightly more analytically sensitive than QqTOF; however, this difference did not significantly affect compound identification in patient samples. QqLIT identified 596 drugs in the urine samples, of which 531 (89%) were confirmed. QqTOF identified 515 drugs, of which 500 (97%) were confirmed. There were 562 instances of a confirmed drug (68 unique drugs) in the 100 urine samples; the methods were concordant in 469 of these instances. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, QqTOF performed similarly to QqLIT and could serve as an alternative method for general unknown screening",

        "abstract": "Drug screening through urinalysis is a widely accepted tool for rapid detection of potential drug use at a relatively low cost. It is, therefore, a potentially useful method for detecting and monitoring drug use in a variety of contexts such as the criminal justice system, pre-employment screening and a variety of treatment centers. This article explores the efficacy of two commercially available drug-screening assays: Online KIMS assay (Roche) and EMIT II assays. First, we evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of two immunoassays. A total of 738 urine samples were collected among adult arrestee populations from Chicago, New Orleans and Seattle through the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) program. Partial samples were split within one laboratory and analyzed by both enzymes multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) II and kinetic interaction of microparticle in solution (KIMS) assays for a 10-drug panel (amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, marijuana, cocaine, methadone, methaqualone, opiate, phencyclidine and propoxyphene). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used as a confirmation method for all positives from either EMIT II or KIMS for all experiments. Second, the paper examines whether using different testing laboratories plays a role in the final results. The same experiments were repeated at two different testing locations: one in California and one in London and England. Third, the paper studies whether drug testing results vary between two laboratories when each of them had used their own routine screening method: the Forensic Science Service (FSS) at Birmingham, United Kingdom with KIMS assay and Medscreen Limited at London, United Kingdom with EMIT II. In summary, both EMIT II and KIMS assays generate fairly consistent results. The concordance rate against each of the 10 drugs tested is relatively high (97.4-100%). The discrepancies, in most cases, occurred at drug concentrations near the cut-off levels. There were more discrepant results between two laboratories compared to when specimens were analyzed at the same laboratory using two different assays. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "Several new fluorescence malaria in vitro drug susceptibility microtiter plate assays that detect the presence of malarial DNA in infected erythrocytes have recently been reported, in contrast to traditional isotopic screens that involve radioactive substrate incorporation to measure in vitro malaria growth inhibition. We have assessed and further characterized the malaria SYBR Green I-based fluorescence (MSF) assay for its ability to monitor drug resistance. In order to use the MSF assay as a drug screen, all assay conditions must be thoroughly examined. In this study we expanded upon the capabilities of this assay by including antibiotics and antifolates in the drug panel and testing folic acid-free growth conditions. To do this, we evaluated a more expansive panel of antimalarials in combination with various drug assay culture conditions commonly used in drug sensitivity screening for their activity against Plasmodium falciparum strains D6 and W2. The detection and quantitation limits of the MSF assay were 0.04 to 0.08% and approximately 0.5% parasitemia, respectively. The MSF assay quality was significantly robust, displaying a Z' range of 0.73 to 0.95. The 50% inhibitory concentrations for each drug and culture condition combination were determined by using the MSF assay. Compared to the standard [(3)H]hypoxanthine assay, the MSF assay displayed the expected parasite drug resistance patterns with a high degree of global and phenotypic correlation (r(2) >/= 0.9238), regardless of which culture condition combination was used. In conclusion, the MSF assay allows for reliable one-plate high-throughput, automated malaria in vitro susceptibility testing without the expense, time consumption, and hazard of other screening assays.",

Many pharmacological compounds exert their effects on cell cycle progression by changing intracellular redox state and in many cases cause oxidative damage leading to drug cytotoxicity. Appropriate measurement of intracellular ROS levels during cell cycle progression is therefore crucial in understanding redox-regulation of cell function and drug toxicity and for the development of new drugs. However, due to the extremely short half-life of ROS, measuring the changes in intracellular ROS levels during a particular phase of cell cycle for drug intervention can be challenging. In this article, we have provided updated information on the rationale, the applications, the advantages and limitations of common methods for screening drug effects on intracellular ROS production linked to cell cycle study.

        "abstract": "HLJ1 is a novel tumour suppressor and is a potential druggable target for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this report, using a promoter-containing enhancer region as the HLJ1-targeting drug-screening platform, we identified several herbal compounds from a Chinese herbal bank with the capacity to enhance HLJ1 promoter activity and suppress tumour growth and invasion of NSCLC. Among the herbal drugs identified, the andrographolide (from Andrographis paniculata [Burm. f.] Nees.) most significantly induced HLJ1 expression and suppressed tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo. The andrographolide upregulates HLJ1 via JunB activation, which modulates AP-2\u03b1 binding at the MMP-2 promoter and represses the expression of MMP-2. In addition, silencing of HLJ1 partially reverses the inhibition of cancer-cell invasion by andrographolide. Microarray transcriptomic analysis was performed to comprehensively depict the andrographolide-regulated signalling pathways. We showed that andrographolide can affect 939 genes (analysis of variance, false discovery rate < 0.05) that are dominantly involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis and adhesion-related biological signalling, including mitogen-activated protein kinase, focal adhesion and tight junction pathways, indicating the diverse effects of andrographolide on anticancer invasion and proliferation. In conclusion, the HLJ1-targeting drug-screening platform is useful for screening of novel anticancer compounds. Using this platform, we identified andrographolide is a promising new anticancer agent that could suppress tumour growth and invasion in NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "LC-high resolution (HR)-MS well established in proteomics has become more and more important in bioanalysis of small molecules over the last few years. Its high selectivity and specificity provide best prerequisites for its use in broad screening approaches. Therefore, Orbitrap technology was tested for developing a general metabolite-based LC-HR-MS/MS screening approach for urinalysis of drugs necessary in clinical and forensic toxicology. After simple urine precipitation, the drugs and their metabolites were separated within 10 min and detected by a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer in full scan with positive/negative switching, and subsequent data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Identification criteria were the presence of accurate precursor ions, isotopic patterns, five most intense fragment ions, and comparison with full HR-MS/MS library spectra. The current library contains over 1900 parent drugs and 1200 metabolites. The method was validated for typical drug representatives and metabolites concerning recovery, matrix effects, process efficiency, and limits showed acceptable results. The applicability was tested first for cardiovascular drugs, which should be screened for in poisoning cases and for medication adherence of hypertension patients. The novel LC-HR-MS/MS method allowed fast, simple, and robust urine screening, particularly for cardiovascular drugs showing the usefulness of Orbitrap technology for drug testing.",

        "abstract": "Micro extraction in packed syringe (MEPS) has been evaluated for drug and metabolites screening online with mass spectrometric detection. In this study, silica based (C8), polymer based (ENV+), and a methacrylate based organic monolith were used as sorbents for MEPS. Monolithic material has shown to be an effective chromatographic support for the separation of several classes of compounds. In this study, the focus is subdivided into three parts: 1) Using MEPS for drugs and metabolites screening, 2) Preparation of a monolithic material in situ in a syringe, and 3) Comparison of the monolith, ENV+, and C8 as sorbent material. The synthesis of the monolithic material was by radical polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), and butyl methacrylate (BMA) in porogenic solvent 1-dodecanol and cyclohexanol. An 8 \u03bcL of the synthesized material was drawn into a 250 \u03bcL syringe and thermally polymerized at 57\u00b0C for 24 h. Individual syringes containing the monolithic material, ENV+ (polystyrene) and C8, were prepared and used for screening ropivacaine, lidocaine in plasma, and lidocaine metabolites (glycylxylidide, monoethylglycylxylidide, and 3-OH-lidocaine) in urine samples. Our results showed that all three sorbents could be used for effective and fast screening for analytes in complex matrices, such as plasma and urine. However, for this study, the ENV+ material performed better than C8, followed by the monolithic sorbent.",

        "abstract": "For fragment-based drug development, both hit (active) compound prediction and docking-pose (protein-ligand complex structure) prediction of the hit compound are important, since chemical modification (fragment linking, fragment evolution) subsequent to the hit discovery must be performed based on the protein-ligand complex structure. However, the na\u00efve protein-compound docking calculation shows poor accuracy in terms of docking-pose prediction. Thus, post-processing of the protein-compound docking is necessary. Recently, several methods for the post-processing of protein-compound docking have been proposed. In FBDD, the compounds are smaller than those for conventional drug screening. This makes it difficult to perform the protein-compound docking calculation. A method to avoid this problem has been reported. Protein-ligand binding free energy estimation is useful to reduce the procedures involved in the chemical modification of the hit fragment. Several prediction methods have been proposed for high-accuracy estimation of protein-ligand binding free energy. This paper summarizes the various computational methods proposed for docking-pose prediction and their usefulness in FBDD.",

Here we describe an efficient method to obtain novel binding ligands of human proteins by a chemical array approach.

Using our systematic platform, we detected novel inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase II.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause for drug attrition during pharmaceutical development and has resulted in numerous preventable patient deaths. Incidents of adverse cardiac drug reactions are more common in patients with pre-existing heart disease than the general population. Here we generated a library of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from patients with various hereditary cardiac disorders to model differences in cardiac drug toxicity susceptibility for patients of different genetic backgrounds. METHODS AND RESULTS: Action potential duration (APD) and drug-induced arrhythmia were measured at the single cell level in hiPSC-CMs derived from healthy subjects and patients with hereditary long QT syndrome (LQT), familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Disease phenotypes were verified in LQT, HCM, and DCM iPSC-CMs by immunostaining and single cell patch clamp. Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were used as controls. Single cell PCR confirmed expression of all cardiac ion channels in patient-specific hiPSC-CMs as well as hESC-CMs, but not in HEK293 cells. Disease-specific hiPSC-CMs demonstrated increased susceptibility to known cardiotoxic drugs as measured by APD and quantification of drug-induced arrhythmias such as early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). CONCLUSIONS: We have recapitulated drug-induced cardiotoxicity profiles for healthy subjects, LQT, HCM, and DCM patients at the single cell level for the first time. Our data indicate that healthy and diseased individuals exhibit different susceptibilities to cardiotoxic drugs and that use of disease-specific hiPSC-CMs may predict adverse drug responses more accurately than standard hERG test or healthy control hiPSC-CM/hESC-CM screening assays.",

Efforts to develop non-hemolytic 8-aminoquinolines have been severely limited caused by the lack of a predictive in vivo animal model of hemolytic potential that would allow screening of candidate compounds. This report describes a G6PDD mouse model with a phenotype closely resembling the G6PDD phenotype found in the African A-type G6PDD human. These G6PDD mice, given different doses of primaquine, which used as a reference hemolytic drug, display a full array of hemolytic anemia parameters, consistently and reproducibly. The hemolytic and therapeutic indexes were generated for evaluation of hemotoxicity of drugs. This model demonstrated a complete hemolytic toxicity response to another known hemolytic antimalarial drug, pamaquine, but no response to non-hemolytic drugs, chloroquine and mefloquine. These results suggest that this model is suitable for evaluation of selected 8-AQ type candidate antimalarial drugs for their hemolytic potential",

Powerful new statistical tools have been developed to analyze the vast amounts of data in DNA chip studies, but have not yet found their way into compound screening. In HTS, characterization of single-point hit lists is often done only in retrospect after the results of confirmation experiments are available. However, for prioritization, for optimal use of resources, for quality control, and for comparison of screens it would be extremely valuable to predict the rates of false positives and false negatives directly from the primary screening results. Making full use of the available information about compounds and controls contained in HTS results and replicated pilot runs, the Z score and from it the p value can be estimated for each measurement. Based on this consideration, we have applied the concept of p-value distribution analysis (PVDA), which was originally developed for gene expression studies, to HTS data. PVDA allowed prediction of all relevant error rates as well as the rate of true inactives, and excellent agreement with confirmation experiments was found.",

Currently, gel-associated or matrix-associated 3D cell culture is comprised of intricate procedures that often result in experimental complexity. Therefore, we developed an innovative anti-cancer drug sensitivity screening technique for 3D cell culture on NanoCulture Plates (NCP) by employing the imaging device BioStation CT. Here, we showed that the human breast cancer cell lines BT474 and T47D form multicellular spheroids on NCP plates and compared their sensitivity to the anti-cancer drugs trastuzumab and paclitaxel using the BioStation CT. The anticancer drugs reduced spheroid migration velocity and suppressed spheroid fusion. In addition, primary cells derived from the human breast cancer tissues B58 and B61 grown on NCP plates also exhibited similar drug sensitivity. These results were in good agreement with the conventional assay method using ATP quantification. We confirmed the antitumor effects of the drugs on cells seeded in 96-well plates using the BioStation CT imaging technique. We expect this method to be useful in research for new antitumor agents and for drug sensitivity tests in individually-tailored cancer treatments.",

The purely electronic temperature dependence of our theory arises from two independent mechanisms: the explicit temperature dependence of the finite temperature dielectric function epsilon(q,T) and the finite temperature energy averaging of the transport scattering time. We find that the calculated temperature dependent conductivity is non-monotonic, decreasing with temperature at low temperatures, and increasing at high temperatures. We provide a critical comparison with the corresponding physics in semiconductor-based parabolic band 2D electron gas systems.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Despite increased understanding of the pathogenesis and targets for thyroid cancer and other cancers, developing a new anticancer chemical agent remains an expensive and long process. An alternative approach is the exploitation of clinically used and/or bioactive compounds.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: Our objective was to identify agents with an anticancer effect in thyroid cancer cell lines using quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS).\\n\\nDESIGN: We used the newly assembled National Institutes of Health Chemical Genomic Center's pharmaceutical collection, which contains 2816 clinically approved drugs and bioactive compounds to perform qHTS.\\n\\nRESULTS: Multiple agents, across a variety of therapeutic categories and with different modes of action, were found to have an antiproliferative effect. We found the following therapeutic categories were the most enriched categories with antiproliferative activity: cardiotonic and antiobesity agents. Sixteen agents had an efficacy of greater than 60% and a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the nanomolar range. We validated the results of the qHTS using two agents (bortezomib and ouabain) in additional cell lines representing different histological subtypes of thyroid cancer and with different mutations (BRAF V600E, RET/PTC1, p53, PTEN). Both agents induced apoptosis, and ouabain also caused cell cycle arrest.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to use qHTS of a large drug library to identify candidate drugs for anticancer therapy. Our results indicate such a screening approach can lead to the discovery of novel agents in different therapeutic categories and drugs with nonclassic chemotherapy mode of action. Our approach could lead to drug repurposing and accelerate clinical trials of compounds with well-established pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles.",

Beta-arrestin-2 has been reported to be an important protein involved in D(2) dopamine receptor desensitization, which is essential to Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the potential value of pharmacological inactivation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase or arrestin in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease has recently been shown. We studied the interaction between D(2) dopamine receptor and beta-arrestin-2 and the pharmacological regulation of chemical compounds on such interaction using capillary zone electrophoresis. The results from screening more than 40 compounds revealed three compounds that remarkably inhibit the beta-arrestin-2/D(2) dopamine receptor interaction among them. These compounds are promising therapies for Parkinson's disease, and the method used in this study has great potential for application in large-scale drug screening and evaluation.",

The complementarities between computational and experimental screenings have been recognized and reviewed in the literature. Computational methods have also been used in the combinatorial chemistry field, in particular in library design. However, the integration of computational and combinatorial chemistry screenings has been attempted only recently. Combinatorial libraries (experimental or virtual) represent a notable source of chemically related compounds. Advances in combinatorial chemistry and deconvolution strategies, have enabled the rapid exploration of novel and dense regions in the chemical space.

Applications of virtual screening to discover novel anticancer agents and our ongoing efforts towards the integration of virtual screening and combinatorial chemistry are also discussed.",

These ligands, labeled with europium pyridine-bis-bipyridine cryptate or with Alexa 488,546,647 selectively bound to the vasopressin V1a and oxytocin receptors with high affinities and exhibited antagonistic properties. The affinities of several unlabeled ligands determined by our homogeneous assays on membrane preparations or on intact cells into 96- and 384-well plate formats were similar to those determined by usual radioligand binding methods. Compared to other binding assays, the polarization and HTRF binding assays are nonradiaoactive, therefore safer to perform, yet very sensitive and homogeneous, therefore easier and faster to automate. These methods are thus suitable for efficient drug high-throughput screening procedures and can easily be applied to other G protein-coupled receptor models.",

        "title": "Broad-spectrum drug screening of meconium by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and time-of-flight mass spectrometry",
        "abstract": "Analysis of the major drugs of abuse in meconium has been established in clinical practice for detecting fetal exposure to illicit drugs, particularly for the ready availability of the sample and ease of collection from diapers, compared with neonatal hair and urine. Very little is known about the occurrence and detection possibilities of therapeutic and licit drugs in meconium. Meconium specimens (n = 209) were collected in delivery hospitals, from infants of mothers who were suspected to be drug abusers. A targeted analysis method by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed for abused drugs: amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, morphine, codeine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, oxycodone, methadone, tramadol, buprenorphine, and norbuprenorphine. A separate LC-MS/MS method was developed for 11-nor-(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid. A screening method based on LC coupled to time-of-flight MS was applied to a broad spectrum of drugs. As a result, a total of 77 different compounds were found. The main drug findings in meconium were as follows: local anesthetics 82.5% (n = 172), nicotine or its metabolites 61.5% (n = 129), opioids 48.5% (n = 101), stimulants 21.0% (n = 44), hypnotics and sedatives 19.0% (n = 40), antidepressants 18.0% (n = 38), antipsychotics 5.5% (n = 11), and cannabis 3.0% (n = 5). By revealing drugs and metabolites beyond the ordinary scope, the present procedure helps the pediatrician in cases where maternal denial is strong but the infant seems to suffer from typical drug-withdrawal symptoms. Intrapartum drug administration cannot be differentiated from gestational drug use by meconium analysis, which affects the interpretation of oxycodone, tramadol, fentanyl, pethidine, and ephedrine findings",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to differentiate mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells into a high percentage of hepatocyte-like cells, and to demonstrate their utility as an in vitro hepatotoxicity model. We were able to differentiate 80-90% of mES cells using optimized hepatocyte differentiation medium. These differentiated cells showed typical hepatocyte morphology, expressed hepatic specific genes as shown by RT-PCR and displayed antibody detectable expression of markers specific for hepatic maturation. These hepatocyte-like cells also demonstrated evidence of glycogen storage. These cells when exposed to CCl4, a commonly used hepatotoxicant, showed an elevation of liver function enzymes, SGOT, SGPT and LDH, indicating hepatic damage. Further, this increase was prevented by pre-treatment with N-acetylcysteine, a known anti-oxidant. Thus we propose that the hepatocyte-like cells derived by the present method may prove to be useful as an in vitro model of hepatotoxicity, thereby providing a novel and promising alternative for obtaining large numbers of functional hepatocyte-like cells for in vitro drug metabolism and hepatotoxicity screening of potential drug candidates.",

        "abstract": "We present a rapid procedure for simultaneous extraction of a wide range of acidic and basic drugs from whole blood samples for reliable semi-quantitative NAGINATA drug screening by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To extract a wide range of drugs, the partition/extraction procedure used for the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, Safe) method was employed as the initial step. Various procedures were tested as the second step for the removal of whole blood impurities, including the use of primary secondary amine and C18 for the dispersive solid-phase extraction of the QuEChERS method, four kinds of silica-based C18 columns, alumina columns, and protein-lipid removal filter cartridges (Captiva ND Lipids). Subsequent GC-MS screening used the NAGINATA software with a constructed calibration-locking database for detection of acidic and basic drugs; drug detection ability, accuracy of tentative concentrations, and drug recoveries were examined and compared. We also examined the applicability of our established method in an actual forensic case. Our results showed that the number of drugs detectable at low concentrations was greatly increased by the use of the partition/extraction procedure of the QuEChERS method as the initial step and the protein-lipid removal filter cartridge as the second step. These combined steps provided notably clean extracts. Recoveries carefully measured with each reference standard were largely more than 60 %, and tentative concentrations obtained by the established screening method without reference standards were in the range of 48-310 % of the expected values for 65 acidic and basic drugs. Therefore, relatively reliable semi-quantitative values were obtained at the screening step without the need for each reference standard. We also experienced significant time savings for the extraction and in obtaining tentative concentrations at the screening step in an actual forensic case, indicating that the method is useful for rapid diagnosis of drug intoxication. Our proposed method should prove useful for semi-quantitative screening of a wide range of drugs and poisons in whole blood samples in clinical and forensic cases. \u00a9 2013 Japanese Association of Forensic Toxicology and Springer Japan.",

        "title": "A novel high throughput assay for anthelmintic drug screening and resistance diagnosis by real-time monitoring of parasite motility",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Helminth parasites cause untold morbidity and mortality to billions of people and livestock. Anthelmintic drugs are available but resistance is a problem in livestock parasites, and is a looming threat for human helminths. Testing the efficacy of available anthelmintic drugs and development of new drugs is hindered by the lack of objective high-throughput screening methods. Currently, drug effect is assessed by observing motility or development of parasites using laborious, subjective, low-throughput methods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe a novel application for a real-time cell monitoring device (xCELLigence) that can simply and objectively assess anthelmintic effects by measuring parasite motility in real time in a fully automated high-throughput fashion. We quantitatively assessed motility and determined real time IC(50) values of different anthelmintic drugs against several developmental stages of major helminth pathogens of humans and livestock, including larval Haemonchus contortus and Strongyloides ratti, and adult hookworms and blood flukes. The assay enabled quantification of the onset of egg hatching in real time, and the impact of drugs on hatch rate, as well as discriminating between the effects of drugs on motility of drug-susceptible and -resistant isolates of H. contortus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate that this technique will be suitable for discovery and development of new anthelmintic drugs as well as for detection of phenotypic resistance to existing drugs for the majority of helminths and other pathogens where motility is a measure of pathogen viability. The method is also amenable to use for other purposes where motility is assessed, such as gene silencing or antibody-mediated killing.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a modified migration assay system in 96-well plate format which is able to detect resistance to the macrocyclic lactone group of drugs in Haemonchus contortus. The assay involves exposure of infective stage larvae to drug for a 24 h period, then counting the numbers of larvae that are able to migrate through an agar and filter mesh system over a further 48 h. The agar barrier greatly increased the sensitivity of the assay for resistance detection compared to use of filter mesh alone. The assay was able to detect the presence of 10% resistant worms in an otherwise susceptible background. However, the assay was ineffective with Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Ostertagia circumcincta indicating that its usefulness for field monitoring will be restricted to situations where H. contortus is of most significance. A small-scale drug screening exercise showed that the assay identifies some anthelmintic activities distinct from those identified by larval development assays. The assay therefore also has a potential role in drug discovery programmes in screening for new anthelmintics. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Detection of ketamine exposure in skeletal tissues by automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) is described. Rats (n = 18) received 0, 15, 30, or 75 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride acutely (i.p.), and were euthanized within 15 min or 1 h. Ketamine was extracted from ground femoral bone by methanolic incubation followed by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), while marrow was homogenized in alkaline solution, and then underwent LLE. Extracts were analyzed by ELISA, and subsequently by GC-ECD following derivatization with trifluoroacetic acid anhydride. The effect of tissue type (i.e., diaphyseal bone vs. epiphyseal bone vs. bone marrow) on the immunoassay response was examined through determination of binary classification test sensitivity (S) and measurement of the relative decrease in absorbance (%DA, drug-positive tissues vs. drug-free controls) in each tissue type. The %DA varied significantly between different tissues examined under a given dose condition, and generally decreased in the order marrow > epiphyseal bone > diaphyseal bone, at all dose levels examined. Measured S values for marrow, epiphyseal bone, and diaphyseal bone were 100%, 77%, and 23%, respectively (75 mg/kg dose). These results suggest that the type of skeletal tissue sampled and position sampled within a given bone (diaphyses vs. epiphyses) are important parameters in drug screening of skeletal tissues.",

Here, a novel reduced graphene oxide quantum dots (rGO QDs)/ZnO hybrid nanofibers-based electrochemical biosensor for the detection of intracellular H2O2 released from cancer and normal cells under the stimuli of the corresponding anticancer drugs permits a quantitative study of the interaction between the target drug compound and the cancer cell, which is suitable for candidate drug screening. Nylon 6/6 nanofibers are used as robust templates for the facile fabrication of novel rGO QDs/ZnO hybrid nanofibers via electrospinning followed by a step hydrothermal growth method. The as-made sensor was applied to determine H2O2 released from a prostate cancer cell (PC-3) versus a noncancerous cell (BPH-1) under the stimuli of the corresponding anticancer drugs (apigenin, antisense CK2 alpha etc.). The amount of H2O2 released from the PC-3 cancer cell is about (320 +/- 12) amol per cell and about (210 +/- 6) amol per cell for the BPH-1 noncancerous cell under the stimuli of specific therapy drug antisense CK2 alpha. These results demonstrate that the rGO QDs/ZnO hybrid nanofibers-based electrochemical biosensor can efficiently detect the distinct amounts of H2O2 released from cancer and noncancer cells.",

        "abstract": "Current in silico tools were evaluated for their ability to predict metabolism and mass spectral fragmentation in the context of analytical toxicology practice. A metabolite prediction program (Lhasa Meteor), a metabolite detection program (Bruker MetaboliteDetect), and a fragmentation prediction program (ACD/MS Fragmenter) were used to assign phase I metabolites of the antipsychotic drug quetiapine in the liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOFMS) accurate mass data from ten autopsy urine samples. In the literature, the main metabolic routes of quetiapine have been reported to be sulfoxidation, oxidation to the corresponding carboxylic acid, N- and O-dealkylation and hydroxylation. Of the 14 metabolites predicted by Meteor, eight were detected by LC/TOFMS in the urine samples with use of MetaboliteDetect software and manual inspection. An additional five hydroxy derivatives were detected, but not predicted by Meteor. The fragment structures provided by ACD/MS Fragmenter software confirmed the identification of the metabolites. Mean mass accuracy and isotopic pattern match (SigmaFit) values for the fragments were 2.40 ppm (0.62 mDa) and 0.010, respectively. ACD/MS Fragmenter, in particular, allowed metabolites with identical molecular formulae to be differentiated without a need to access the respective reference standards or reference spectra. This was well exemplified with the hydroxy/sulfoxy metabolites of quetiapine and their N- and O-dealkylated forms. The procedure resulted in assigning 13 quetiapine metabolites in urine. The present approach is instrumental in developing an extensive database containing exact monoisotopic masses and verified retention times of drugs and their urinary metabolites for LC/TOFMS drug screening.",

Current treatment options are, at best, parasitostatic, and involve taking benzimidazoles (albendazole, mebendazole) for the whole of a patient's life. In conjunction with the recent development of optimized procedures for E. multilocularis metacestode cultivation, we aimed to develop a rapid and reliable drug screening test, which enables efficient screening of a large number of compounds in a relatively short time frame.\\n\\nMETHODS: Metacestodes were treated in vitro with albendazole, the nitro-thiazole nitazoxanide and 29 nitazoxanide derivatives. The resulting leakage of phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) activity into the medium supernatant was measured and provided an indication of compound efficacy.\\n\\nRESULTS: We show that upon in vitro culture of E. multilocularis metacestodes in the presence of active drugs such as albendazole, the nitro-thiazole nitazoxanide and 30 different nitazoxanide derivatives, the activity of PGI in culture supernatants increased. The increase in PGI activity correlated with the progressive degeneration and destruction of metacestode tissue in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, which allowed us to perform a structure-activity relationship analysis on the thiazolide compounds used in this study.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The assay presented here is inexpensive, rapid, can be used in 24- and 96-well formats and will serve as an ideal tool for first-round in vitro tests on the efficacy of large numbers of antiparasitic compounds.",

        "abstract": "PHOX2B is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of neurogenesis and in the correct differentiation of the autonomic nervous system. The pathogenetic role of PHOX2B in neuroblastoma (NB) is supported by mutations in familial, sporadic and syndromic cases of NB and overexpression of PHOX2B and its target ALK in tumor samples and NB cell lines.Starting from these observations, we have performed in vitro drug screening approaches targeting PHOX2B overexpression as a potential pharmacological means in NB.In particular, in order to identify molecules able to decrease PHOX2B expression, we have evaluated the effects of 70 compounds in IMR-32 cell line stably expressing the luciferase gene under the control of the PHOX2B promoter. Curcumin, SAHA and trichostatin A showed to down-regulate the PHOX2B promoter activity which resulted in a decrease of both protein and mRNA expressions. In addition, we have observed that curcumin acts by interfering with PBX-1/MEIS-1, NF-\u03baB and AP-1 complexes, in this work demonstrated for the first time to regulate the transcription of the PHOX2B gene.Finally, combined drug treatments showed successful effects in down-regulating the expression of both PHOX2B and its target ALK genes, thus supporting the notion of the effectiveness of molecule combination in tumor therapy.",

        "abstract": "Two commercially available drug-screening assays were evaluated: the Roche kinetic interaction of microparticles in solution (KIMS) assay and the Microgenics cloned enzyme donor immunoassay (CEDIA). Urine samples from known drug-abuse patients were analyzed for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, benzoylecgonine, cannabinoids, LSD, methadone and opiates. Samples with discordant findings for the two assays were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or gas chromatography/electron capture detection (GC/ECD). Amphetamines showed 96.0% concordant results, with two false positive findings by CEDIA, three by KIMS and a further two false negatives by KIMS. Barbiturates showed 99.4% concordant results, with one false negative by KIMS. Benzodiazepines showed 97.4% concordant results, with two false negatives by KIMS (cutoff 100 microg/L, CEDIA cutoff 300 microg/L). Benzoylecgonine showed 17.8% concordant positive and 82.2% concordant negative results and no false finding by either assay. Cannabinoids showed 99.3% concordant results, with one sample negative by KIMS at a cutoff of 50 microg/L and positive by CEDIA (cutoff 25 microg/L). For LSD, 6.7% of findings were not in agreement. Methadone showed 97.5% concordant results, with two false positives by CEDIA, and one false positive and one false negative by KIMS. Opiates showed 96.9% concordant results, with no false KIMS results, but four false positives by CEDIA. The results indicate that the agreement of the CEDIA and KIMS results for the eight drugs is rather good (93.3-100%).",

        "abstract": "About 8000 genes encode membrane proteins in the human genome. The information about their druggability will be very useful to facilitate drug discovery and development. The main problem, however, consists of limited structural and functional information about these proteins because they are difficult to produce biochemically and to study. In this paper we describe the strategy that combines Cell-free protein expression, NMR spectroscopy, and molecular DYnamics simulation (CNDY) techniques. Results of a pilot CNDY experiment provide us with a guiding light towards expedited identification of the hit compounds against a new uncharacterized membrane protein as a potentially druggable target. These hits can then be further characterized and optimized to develop the initial lead compound quicker. We illustrate such \"omics\" approach for drug discovery with the CNDY strategy applied to two example proteins: hypoxia-induced genes HIGD1A and HIGD1B. ?? 2014 The Authors.

        "abstract": "Seven transmembrane G protein coupled receptors (7TM GPCRs) represent one of the largest gene familes in the human genome. Because of the size of the GPCR family, their proven history of being valuable targets for small molecule drug design, the fact that the absolute number of GPCRs that are targets for current medicines represents only a small fraction of the total encoded by the human genome, and that ligands for GPCRs do not have to enter the cell to exert their function, it is very likely that GPCRs will remain major targets for the pharmaceutical industry in the foreseeable future. Despite recent evidence indicating that GPCRs can provide information to cells, that does not require activation of G proteins (\"signaling at zero G\"), most of the GPCRs known to date function via interaction with and activation of heterotrimeric (alphabetagamma) G proteins. Thus, assay systems translating ligand modulation of GPCRs into G protein-dependent intracellular responses are a key component of both basic research and the drug discovery process. This article will review the current knowledge and recent progress in understanding molecular aspects of specific receptor-G protein recognition. It will also highlight how the knowledge generated by such studies can be transformed into assay systems for GPCR drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionally conserved process in cells for cleaning abnormal proteins and organelles in a lysosome dependent manner. Growing studies have shown that defects or induced autophagy contributes to many diseases including aging, neurodegeneration, pathogen infection, and cancer. However, the precise involvement of autophagy in health and disease remains controversial because the theories are built on limited assays and chemical modulators, indicating that the role of autophagy in diseases may require further verification. Many food and drug administration (FDA) approved drugs modulate autophagy signaling, suggesting that modulation of autophagy with pharmacological agonists or antagonists provides a potential therapy for autophagy-related diseases. This suggestion raises an attractive issue on drug discovery for exploring chemical modulators of autophagy. High throughput screening (HTS) is becoming a powerful tool for drug discovery that may accelerate screening specific autophagy modulators to clarify the role of autophagy in diseases. Herein, this review lays out current autophagy assays to specifically measure autophagy components such as LC3 (mammalian homologue of yeast Atg8) and Atg4. These assays are feasible or successful for HTS with certain chemical libraries, which might be informative for this intensively growing field as research tools and hopefully developing new drugs for autophagy-related diseases.",

Based on the structure of the ligand pocket of the target protein, we designed a negative image, which consists of virtual atoms whose radii are close to those of carbon atoms. The virtual atoms fit the pocket ideally and achieve an optimal Coulomb interaction. A protein-compound docking program calculates the protein-compound interaction matrix for many proteins and many compounds including the negative image, which can be treated as a virtual compound. With specific attention to a vector of docking scores for a single compound with many proteins, we selected a compound whose score vector was similar to that of the negative image as a candidate hit compound. This method was applied to representative target proteins and showed high database enrichment with a relatively quick procedure.",

        "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, is characterized by the selective degeneration of lower motor neurons, leading to muscle atrophy and, in the most severe cases, paralysis and death. Deletions and point mutations cause reduced levels of the widely expressed survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which has been implicated in a range of cellular processes. The mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis are unclear, and there is no effective treatment. Several animal models have been developed to study SMN function including the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, in which a large deletion in the gene homologous to SMN, smn-1, results in neuromuscular dysfunction and larval lethality. Although useful, this null mutant, smn-1(ok355), is not well suited to drug screening. We report the isolation and characterization of smn-1(cb131), a novel allele encoding a substitution in a highly conserved residue of exon 2, resembling a point mutation found in a patient with type IIIb SMA. The smn-1(cb131) animals display milder yet similar defects when compared with the smn-1 null mutant. Using an automated phenotyping system, mutants were shown to swim slower than wild-type animals. This phenotype was used to screen a library of 1040 chemical compounds for drugs that ameliorate the defect, highlighting six for subsequent testing. 4-aminopyridine, gaboxadol hydrochloride and N-acetylneuraminic acid all rescued at least one aspect of smn-1 phenotypic dysfunction. These findings may assist in accelerating the development of drugs for the treatment of SMA.",

        "abstract": "Flexible electronics are the next generation of sensors for mobile health and implantation. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an emergent strategy for pre-clinical drug development and toxicity testing. To address the confounding effects from sedation of fish and removal from the aquatic habitat for micro-electrocardiogram (\u03bcECG) measurements, we developed waterproof and wearable sensors to uncover the circadian variation in heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) (Massin et al., 2000). The parylene-C based ECG sensor consisted of an ultra-soft silicone integrated jacket designed to wrap around the fish during swimming. The Young's modulus of this silicone jacket matched with the fish surface, and an extended parylene cable connected the underwater chest electrodes with the out-of water electronics. In addition, embedded micro-glass spheres in the silicone effectively reduced the effective density of the jacket to ~1gcm<sup>-3</sup>. These innovations enabled physiological ECG telemetry in the fish's natural habitat without the need for sedation. Furthermore, a set of non-linear signal processing techniques filtered out the breathing and electromagnetic artifacts from the recorded signals. We observed a reduction in mean HR and an increase in HRV over 24h at 10dpa, accompanied by QT prolongation as well as diurnal variations, followed by normalization in mean HR and QT intervals at 26 days post ventricular amputation (dpa). We revealed Amiodarone-mediated QTc prolongation, HR reduction and HRV increase otherwise masked by sedation. The novel features of the flexible silicon jacket for \u03bcECG telemetry unraveled the biological clock and normalization of QT intervals at 26dpa, providing the first evidence of new physiological phenomena during cardiac injury and repair as well as cardiac drug-mediated aberrant rhythms. Thus, the light weight and waterproof design holds promise to advance the next generation of mobile health and drug discovery.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: kas operon locus was delineated in M. aurum, a fast growing nonpathogenic strain. Cloning and sequencing all the genes of the operon showed similar organization and sequence similarities with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv) orthologues. Further, we cloned the upstream region of M. tuberculosis kas operon in fusion with lacZ reporter gene and put it in M. aurum. Recombinant M. aurum strain showed continued expression of reporter gene throughout the growth while an increased expression of the reporter gene was noticed only after treatment with FAS-II pathway inhibitors. Swapping of the regulatory sequence aborts the increased reporter gene expression after same antibiotic treatments. CONCLUSIONS: kas operon genes are similarly organized in M. tuberculosis and M. aurum. H37Rv kas operon promoter upregulates the reporter gene expression in M. aurum only upon treatment with drugs inhibiting FAS-II pathway. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It would serve as a good second-line screen for characterization of compounds showing antimycobacterial activity in a first-line screen.

        "abstract": "The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key regulator of neuronal development and plasticity. BDNF is a major pharmaceutical target in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. However, pharmacological modulation of this neurotrophin is challenging because BDNF is generated by multiple, alternatively spliced transcripts with different 5'- and 3'UTRs. Each BDNF mRNA variant is transcribed independently, but translation regulation is unknown. To evaluate the translatability of BDNF transcripts, we developed an in vitro luciferase assay in human neuroblastoma cells. In unstimulated cells, each BDNF 5'- and 3'UTR determined a different basal translation level of the luciferase reporter gene. However, constructs with either a 5'UTR or a 3'UTR alone showed poor translation modulation by BDNF, KCl, dihydroxyphenylglycine, AMPA, NMDA, dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, or serotonin. Constructs consisting of the luciferase reporter gene flanked by the 5'UTR of one of the most abundant BDNF transcripts in the brain (exons 1, 2c, 4, and 6) and the long 3'UTR responded selectively to stimulation with the different receptor agonists, and only transcripts 2c and 6 were increased by the antidepressants desipramine and mirtazapine. We propose that BDNF mRNA variants represent \"a quantitative code\" for regulated expression of the protein. Thus, to discriminate the efficacy of drugs in stimulating BDNF synthesis, it is appropriate to use variant-specific in vitro screening tests.",

        "abstract": "Rationale: Viral myocarditis is a life-threatening illness that may lead to heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias. A major causative agent for viral myocarditis is the B3 strain of coxsackievirus, a positive-sense RNA enterovirus. However, human cardiac tissues are difficult to procure in sufficient enough quantities for studying the mechanisms of cardiac-specific viral infection. Objective: This study examined whether human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) could be used to model the pathogenic processes of coxsackievirus-induced viral myocarditis and to screen antiviral therapeutics for efficacy. Methods and Results: Human iPSC-CMs were infected with a luciferase-expressing coxsackievirus B3 strain (CVB3-Luc). Brightfield microscopy, immunofluorescence, and calcium imaging were utilized to characterize virally-infected hiPSC-CMs for alterations in cellular morphology and calcium handling. Viral proliferation in hiPSC-CMs was quantified using bioluminescence imaging. Antiviral compounds including interferon beta 1 (IFN\u03b21), ribavirin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and fluoxetine were tested for their capacity to abrogate CVB3-Luc proliferation in hiPSC-CMs in vitro. The ability of these compounds to reduce CVB3-Luc proliferation in hiPSC-CMs was consistent with reported drug effects in previous studies. Mechanistic analyses via gene expression profiling of hiPSC-CMs infected with CVB3-Luc revealed an activation of viral RNA and protein clearance pathways after IFN\u03b21 treatment. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that hiPSC-CMs express the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, are susceptible to coxsackievirus infection, and can be used to predict antiviral drug efficacy. Our results suggest that the hiPSC-CM/CVB3-Luc assay is a sensitive platform that can screen novel antiviral therapeutics for their effectiveness in a high-throughput fashion.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. The hallmark of PD is the appearance of neuronal protein aggregations known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, of which \u03b1-synuclein forms a major component. Familial PD is rare and is associated with missense mutations of the SNCA gene or increases in gene copy number resulting in SNCA overexpression. This suggests that lowering SNCA expression could be therapeutic for PD. Supporting this hypothesis, SNCA reduction was neuroprotective in cell line and rodent PD models. We developed novel cell lines expressing SNCA fused to the reporter genes luciferase (luc) or GFP with the objective to enable high-throughput compound screening (HTS) for small molecules that can lower SNCA expression. Because SNCA expression is likely regulated by far-upstream elements (including the NACP-REP1 located at 8852 bp upstream of the transcription site), we employed zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) genome editing to insert reporter genes in-frame downstream of the SNCA gene in order to retain native SNCA expression control. This ensured full retention of known and unknown up- and downstream genetic elements controlling SNCA expression. Treatment of cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) resulted in significantly increased SNCA-luc and SNCA-GFP expression supporting the use of our cell lines for identifying small molecules altering complex modes of expression control. Cells expressing SNCA-luc treated with a luciferase inhibitor or SNCA siRNA resulted in Z'-scores \u2265 0.75, suggesting the suitability of these cell lines for use in HTS. This study presents a novel use of genome editing for the creation of cell lines expressing \u03b1-synuclein fusion constructs entirely under native expression control. These cell lines are well suited for HTS for compounds that lower SNCA expression directly or by acting at long-range sites to the SNCA promoter and 5'-UTR.",

Based on the photocurrent amplification of light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS), the constant voltage detection mode was introduced to enhance the detection sensitivity to replace the conventional constant current mode with the slow feedback rate. The photocurrent amplification of LAPS was improved by developing the sensor structure and fabrication processes. The sensor unit with microfluidic system was designed to detect the concentration change of cellular acidic metabolites in the extracellular microenvironment rapidly. Characteristic test experiments and cellular metabolism experiments were carried out to determine the performance of microphysiometer. The result showed that sensitivity of microphysiometer is significantly enhanced to sense the fluctuation of cellular metabolism rapidly and sensitively in real-time detection of living cells under physiological condition. With these improvements, the novel microphysiometer holds promise as a utility platform for studying cellular metabolism and evaluating drug effect. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "title": "An aptasensor using DNA aptamer and white light common-path SPR spectral interferometry to detect cytochrome-c for anti-cancer drug screening",
        "abstract": "Liver cancer is a major health hazard and more than 6 million new cases are reported worldwide every year. It is a difficult cancer to treat because multi-drug resistance (MDR) is frequently developed during chemotherapy. Therefore, identifying new drugs to overcome MDR becomes an urgent need to cure the disease. It has been known for a while that cytochrome c (cyto-c) is a crucial death regulator that triggers apoptosis in cancer cells when released from the mitochondria. This makes cyto-c a good biomarker to report drug effect after treatment. In this study, we developed an aptasensor by using an aptamer against cyto-c and a common-path phase surface plasmon resonance (CPSPR) sensing technique for drug screening. Our cyto-c aptamer is a small (76-mer) single-stranded DNA selected from a synthetic DNA library by virtue of its high binding affinity and specificity based on its unique DNA sequence and 3D configuration after folding. The CPSPR is a novel technique that employs a white-light source (600\u2013800nm) for SPR excitation across the visible to near infrared spectrum with a fixed light incidence angle. It measures phase change in SPR at an optimized coupling wavelength in a label-free manner. Compared to other conventional laser based phase detecting schemes, this system offers an extended dynamic range of measurement (80nM to 80pM) and ultra-sensitivity (detection limit \u226550pM). After setting the groundwork, we used this aptasensor to test a number of agents (atractyloside, capsaicin, cordycepin, polyphyllin D (PD), veratridine) from the Chinese herbs for killing cancer. Among all agents tested, PD was found to release more cyto-c from a liver cancer line with MDR than its counterpart without MDR. The same was found from the isolated mitochondria indicating that our aptasensor can also be used for mechanistic studies. Since the detection process can be completed within minutes, our approach provides a simple, rapid and sensitive solution for the selection and development of novel anti-cancer agents.",

        "abstract": "Real-time monitoring of cell apoptosis could provide valuable insights into early detection of therapy efficiency and evaluation of disease progression. In this work, we designed and synthesized a new live-cell-permeable, fluorescent light-up probe for real-time cell apoptosis imaging. The probe is comprised of a hydrophilic caspase-specific Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) peptide and a hydrophobic tetraphenylethene (TPE) unit, a typical fluorogen with aggregation-induced emission characteristics. In aqueous solution, the probe is almost nonfluorescent but displays significant fluorescence enhancement in response to caspase-3/-7, which are activated in the apoptotic process and able to cleave the DEVD moieties. This fluorescence \"turn-on\" response is ascribed to aggregation of cleaved hydrophobic TPE residues, which restricts the intramolecular rotations of TPE phenyl rings and populates the radiative decay channels. The light-up nature of the probe allows real-time monitoring of caspase-3/-7 activities both in solutions and in living cells with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The probe provides a new opportunity to screen enzyme inhibitors and evaluate the apoptosis-associated drug efficacy.",

        "abstract": "In vitro growth inhibition assays were performed using human cancer cell lines at various concentrations with experimental anticancer drugs such as the cryptophycins and other cytotoxins. The effect of variations in assay parameters on the observed growth inhibition of these anticancer therapeutic agents was determined. The results demonstrated that the observed inhibitory activity of these compounds varied inversely with the cell concentrations used. The observed differences in activity between different cytotoxins were not necessarily proportionate. Thus, the relative activities of two toxins also varied with cell concentration. Furthermore, the sensitivity of these cell lines to the cytostatic purine analog, 6-mercaptopurine (used as a control), varied with cell concentration as well. The activity of this compound was dependent on the medium used for cell growth, yielding good activity in Eagle's minimum essential medium, but not in Ham's F-12 (Kaigin) medium. Moreover, growth inhibition by cryptophycin as well as 6-mercaptopurine was also dependent on the serum concentration in the medium. Finally, the sensitivity of the cancer cell lines to various organic solvents commonly used as drug vehicles for in vitro testing, such as ethanol, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide, was likewise found to vary inversely with cell concentration.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Previously, FTY720 was found to possess potent anticancer effects on various types of cancer. In the present study, we aimed to first verify the role of Runx2 in prostate cancer progression and metastasis, and, subsequently, assessed if FTY720 could modulate Runx2 expression, thus interfering downstream events regulated by this protein. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: First, the association between Runx2 and prostate cancer progression was assessed using localized prostate cancer specimens and mechanistic investigation of Runx2-induced cancer aggressiveness was then carried out. Subsequently, the effect of FTY720 on Runx2 expression and transcriptional activity was investigated using PC-3 cells, which highly expressed Runx2 protein. Last, the involvement of Runx2 in FTY720-induced anticancer effects was evaluated by modulating Runx2 expression in various prostate cancer cell lines. RESULTS: Runx2 nuclear expression was found to be up-regulated in prostate cancer and its expression could be used as a predictor of metastasis in prostate cancer. Further mechanistic studies indicated that Runx2 accelerated prostate cancer aggressiveness through promotion of cadherin switching, invasion toward collagen I, and Akt activation. Subsequently, we found that FTY720 treatment down-regulated Runx2 expression and its transcriptional activity, as well as inhibited its regulated downstream events. More importantly, silencing Runx2 in PC-3 enhanced FTY720-induced anticancer effects as well as cell viability inhibition, whereas overexpressing Runx2 in 22Rv1 that expressed very low endogenous Runx2 protein conferred resistance in the same events. CONCLUSION: This study provided a novel mechanism for the anticancer effect of FTY720 on advanced prostate cancer, thus highlighting the therapeutic potential of this drug in treating this disease.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we compare the biotransformation capacities of cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes cultivated in a liver microfluidic biochip and in plates. The hepatocytes were exposed to the CIME cocktail (Carte d'Identit?? MEtabolique), a mixture of seven probes (acetaminophen, amodiaquine, caffeine, dextromethorphan, midazolam, omeprazole and tolbutamide) for key enzymes involved in the xenobiotic metabolism and pharmacokinetics. The purpose of the cocktail was to give an overview of the metabolic profile of the hepatocytes due to concomitant exposure and a simultaneous mass spectrometric detection method of the metabolites. The results showed a greater activity for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 CYP2D6, CYP3A and UGT1A1 after 4 h of incubation in the microfluidic biochip when compared to the plate cultures. Furthermore, the metabolic ratio time-course measured at 1 h, 3 h and 4 h indicated that the enzymatic activity increased when the hepatocytes were cultivated in the microfluidic biochip, in contrast with their response in the plate cultures. These results illustrated the functional relevance of liver culture in the PDMS microfluidic biochip. The original method based on a microfluidic culture coupled with CIME cocktail analysis allowed the maintenance and the evaluation of the metabolic performances of the primary human hepatocytes through a new rapid assay. This metabolic analysis can thus become the reference situation when parallel studies of drug metabolism and toxicities are planned with functional hepatocytes in biochips. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "In order to obtain a better understanding of hematological malignancies and to develop improved therapeutic strategies, the generation of functional and reproducible in vivo models is widely pursued. Here, we report the establishment of transplantable PDX models of acute myeloid and acute lymphoid leukemia (AML, ALL) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) growing subcutaneously as well as in a disseminated fashion in immunocompromised mice. Bone marrow and peripheral blood cells from 18 AML/ALL patients were injected intratibially into NSG or NOG mice (n = 4-8/patient). Separately, tumor tissue from 27 prostate cancer patients and one lung cancer patient was transplanted either under the subrenal capsule or subcutaneously into NSG or NOG mice (n = 4-10/patient), leading to the outgrowth of nine NHLxenografts (eight from transplanted prostate cancer and one from transplanted lung cancer tissue). Tumor growth was monitored via determination of overall survival, flow cytometry analyses, caliper measurement where applicable and Immunohistochemistry (IHC). Transplantable models as well as primary in vivo cultures were further characterized by treatment with respective standard of care drugs (SoC). Six out of 18 AML/ALL patient-derived specimens engrafted in immunocompromised mice, following transplantation into murine bone marrow. Human leukemic cells were detected in murine peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen by flow cytometry as well as by IHC. One T-ALL and one AML could also be propagated when injected subcutaneously. Two transplantable AMLs and one transplantable ALL were treated with SoC drugs decitabine, cytarabine and dexamethasone. Efficacy tests using primary AML cells were feasible although availability of tumor material limited experiment size to maximally 25-30 mice. The eight NHL xenografts derived from prostate cancer tissue were all Epstein-Barr-Virus-positive. Seven were diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), one is T-cell-derived. The NHL excised from the lung was diagnosed as a MALT lymphoma. All lymphomas were transplantable and showed stable growth when propagated subcutaneously. Subtyping of the DLBCL lymphomas by IHC revealed that four of them were of the ABC-subtype. Our results confirm that PDX models of haematological malignancies replicate the heterogeneity and other important clinical characteristics of the respective disease, and are valuable tools for preclinical drug testing and investigation of tumour biology.",

        "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) remains a major challenge to global health made worse by the spread of multidrug resistance. We therefore examined whether stimulating intracellular killing of mycobacteria through pharmacological enhancement of macroautophagy might provide a novel therapeutic strategy. Despite the resistance of MTB to killing by basal autophagy, cell-based screening of FDA-approved drugs revealed two anticonvulsants, carbamazepine and valproic acid, that were able to stimulate autophagic killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis within primary human macrophages at concentrations achievable in humans. Using a zebrafish model, we show that carbamazepine can stimulate autophagy in vivo and enhance clearance of M. marinum, while in mice infected with a highly virulent multidrug-resistant MTB strain, carbamazepine treatment reduced bacterial burden, improved lung pathology and stimulated adaptive immunity. We show that carbamazepine induces antimicrobial autophagy through a novel, evolutionarily conserved, mTOR-independent pathway controlled by cellular depletion of myo-inositol. While strain-specific differences in susceptibility to in vivo carbamazepine treatment may exist, autophagy enhancement by repurposed drugs provides an easily implementable potential therapy for the treatment of multidrug-resistant mycobacterial infection.",

        "abstract": "The ability to manipulate drops with small volumes has many practical applications. Current microfluidic devices generally exploit channel geometry and/or active external equipment to control drops. Here we use a Teflon tube attached to a syringe pump and exploit the properties of interfaces between three immiscible liquids to create particular fluidic architectures. We then go on to merge any number of drops (with volumes of micro- to nano-liters) at predefined points in time and space in the tube; for example, 51 drops were merged in a defined order to yield one large drop. Using a different architecture, specified amounts of fluid were transferred between 2 nl drops at specified rates; for example, 2.5 pl aliquots were transferred (at rates of ~500 fl s(-1)) between two drops through inter-connecting nano-channels (width ~40 nm). One proof-of-principle experiment involved screening conditions required to crystallize a protein (using a concentration gradient created using such nano-channels). Another demonstrated biocompatibility; drugs were mixed with human cells grown in suspension or on surfaces, and the treated cells responded like those grown conventionally. Although most experiments were performed manually, moderate high-throughput potential was demonstrated by mixing ~1000 different pairs of 50 nl drops in ~15 min using a robot. We suggest this reusable, low-cost, and versatile methodology could facilitate the introduction of microfluidics into workflows of many experimental laboratories.",

        "abstract": "Background: In clinical trials of treatment for stimulant abuse, researchers commonly record both Time-Line Follow-Back (TLFB) self-reports and urine drug screen (UDS) results. Objectives: To compare the power of self-report, qualitative (use vs. no use) UDS assessment, and various algorithms to generate self-report-UDS composite measures to detect treatment differences via t-test in simulated clinical trial data. Methods: We performed Monte Carlo simulations patterned in part on real data to model self-report reliability, UDS errors, dropout, informatively missing UDS reports, incomplete adherence to a urine donation schedule, temporal correlation of drug use, number of days in the study period, number of patients per arm, and distribution of drug-use probabilities. Investigated algorithms include maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimates, self-report alone, UDS alone, and several simple modifications of self-report (referred to here as ELCON algorithms) which eliminate perceived contradictions between it and UDS. Results: Among the algorithms investigated, simple ELCON algorithms gave rise to the most powerful t-tests to detect mean group differences in stimulant drug use. Conclusions: Further investigation is needed to determine if simple, na\u00efve procedures such as the ELCON algorithms are optimal for comparing clinical study treatment arms. But researchers who currently require an automated algorithm in scenarios similar to those simulated for combining TLFB and UDS to test group differences in stimulant use should consider one of the ELCON algorithms. Scientific Significance: This analysis continues a line of inquiry which could determine how best to measure outpatient stimulant use in clinical trials (NIDA.

        "abstract": "Based on a recently reported ultra-sensitive bio-barcode (BBC) assay, we have developed an aptamer-based bio-barcode (ABC) alternative to detect a cell death marker cytochrome-c (Cyto-c) and its subsequent application to screen anti-cancer drugs. Aptamer is a short single-stranded DNA selected from a synthetic DNA library by virtue of its high binding affinity and specificity to its target based on its unique 3D structure from the nucleotide sequence after folding. In the BBC assay, an antigen (Ag) in analytes is captured by a micro-magnetic particle (MMP) coated with capturing antibodies (Abs). Gold nanoparticles (NPs) with another recognition Ab against the same target and hundreds of identical DNA molecules of known sequence are subsequently added to allow the formation of sandwich structures ([MMP-Ab1]-Ag-[Ab2-NP-DNA]). After isolating the sandwiches by a magnetic field, the DNAs hybridized to their complementary DNAs covalently bound on the NPs are released from the sandwiches after heating. Acting as an Ag identification tag, these bio-barcode DNAs with known DNA sequence are then amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and detected by fluorescence. In our ABC assay, we employed a Cyto-c-specific aptamer to substitute both the recognition Ab and barcode DNAs on the NPs in the BBC assay; and a novel isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification for the time-consuming PCR. The detection limit of our ABC assay for the Cyto-c was found to be 10 ng/mL and this new assay can be completed within 3 h. Several potential anti-cancer drugs have been tested in vitro for their efficacy to kill liver cancer with or without multi-drug resistance. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

To facilitate examination of early critical events in viral pathogenesis and to identify antiviral compounds, a recombinant Zaire ebolavirus was engineered to express a foreign protein, eGFP, to provide a rapid and sensitive means to monitor virus replication in infected cells. This genetically engineered virus represents the first insertion of a foreign gene into ebolavirus.

A safer in vitro system is desirable for conducting research on SARS-CoV and to screen for antiviral drugs against the virus. Based on the infectious cDNA clone of rSARS-CoV-DeltaE, in which the E gene has been deleted, a safe non-infectious replicon was constructed by replacing the S gene with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene. Successful replication was achieved as evident from continuous expression of eGFP detected by both fluorescence and Western blot. Treatment with antiviral drugs demonstrated that the replication could be significantly inhibited by 0.4 mg/ml of cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64D, but not by ribavirin. The same replicons containing further deletion of the coding regions for non-structural proteins (nsp) 1, 2 or 16 confirmed previous observation that nsp16, but not nsp1 or nsp2, was essential for efficient viral replication or transcription.",

        "abstract": "Cetyltrimethylammonim bromide coated gold nanorods (Au NRs) has a potential to become anti-cancer nano-drugs. Previously, the comparative responses of human alveolar adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) and normal bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) exposed to Au NRs have been characterized. It has been shown that Au NRs are translocated from the lysosome to the mitochondria in A549 cells but not in normal 16HBE cell lines. However, the molecular information during this cellular translocation remains largely undetermined. Here, we have used a metabonomic technique to comparatively analyze the time-dependent metabolic changes in Au NRs-induced A549 and 16HBE. We found that Au NRs exposure caused a disruption in the intracellular environment of both A549 and 16HBE cells, which metabolically manifested in the reduction of lactate levels in both cell lines. In addition, Au NRs induced oxidative stress in both cells lines. However, the 16HBE cells are more able to offset the oxidative stress than the A549 cells; this is because de novo GSH synthesis is triggered in Au NRs treated 16HBE cells but not in A549 cells, and the conversion of GSH to GSSG is more profound in 16HBE cells compared to A549 cells. The severe oxidative stress induces damage to mitochondria in A549 cells, leading to cell death, which is evident in the marked reduction in the levels of nucleosides and nucleotides. Furthermore, significantly elevated levels of amino acids are likely due to stress hormones being produced in Au NRs treated cells. These findings provide comprehensive molecular information on the distinctive intracellular localization, cellular uptake and translocation of Au NRs in normal and tumor cells, highlighting the value of metabonomics in assessing biological effects of nano-drugs. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

In this study, PfAdT was expressed in C43 (DE3) Escherichia coli strain under isopropyl beta-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG) induction to screen inhibitory molecules. PfAdT was integrated directly into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Whereas IPTG-induced bacterial cells imported radioactively labelled ATP, non-induced cells did not. The transporter bound specifically ADP and ATP, but not AMP. IPTG-induced cells preloaded with labelled ATP exported ATP after exogenous addition of unlabelled ADP or ATP, indicating a counter exchange transport mechanism. Bongrekic acid and atractyloside, two well-known specific inhibitors of mitochondrial ADP/ATP transporter, were tested.

        "abstract": "Despite recent therapeutic advancements, multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable and new therapies are needed, especially for the treatment of elderly and relapsed/refractory patients. We have screened a panel of 100 off-patent licensed oral drugs for anti-myeloma activity and identified niclosamide, an anti-helminthic. Niclosamide, at clinically achievable non-toxic concentrations, killed MM cell lines and primary MM cells as efficiently as or better than standard chemotherapy and existing anti-myeloma drugs individually or in combinations, with little impact on normal donor cells. Cell death was associated with markers of both apoptosis and autophagy. Importantly, niclosamide rapidly reduced free light chain (FLC) production by MM cell lines and primary MM. FLCs are a major cause of renal impairment in MM patients and light chain amyloid and FLC reduction is associated with reversal of tissue damage. Our data indicate that niclosamides anti-MM activity was mediated through the mitochondria with rapid loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and production of mitochondrial superoxide. Niclosamide also modulated the nuclear factor-\u03baB and STAT3 pathways in MM cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that MM cells can be selectively targeted using niclosamide while also reducing FLC secretion. Importantly, niclosamide is widely used at these concentrations with minimal toxicity.",

        "abstract": "In this study, an in vitro multicellular tumor spheroid model was developed using microencapsulation, and the feasibility of using the microencapsulated multicellular tumor spheroid (MMTS) to test the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs was investigated. Human MCF-7 breast cancer cells were encapsulated in alginate-poly-l-lysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules, and a single multicellular spheroid 150 mum in diameter was formed in the microcapsule after 5 days of cultivation. The cell morphology, proliferation, and viability of the MMTS were characterized using phase contrast microscopy, BrdU-labeling, MTT stain, calcein AM/ED-2 stain, and H&E stain. It demonstrated that the MMTS was viable and that the proliferating cells were mainly localized to the periphery of the cell spheroid and the apoptotic cells were in the core. The MCF-7 MMTS was treated with mitomycin C (MC) at a concentration of 0.1, 1, or 10 times that of peak plasma concentration (ppc) for up to 72 h. The cytotoxicity was demonstrated clearly by the reduction in cell spheroid size and the decrease in cell viability. The MMTS was further used to screen the anticancer effect of chemotherapeutic drugs, treated with MC, adriamycin (ADM) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 ppc for 24, 48, and 72 h. MCF-7 monolayer culture was used as control. Similar to monolayer culture, the cell viability of MMTS was reduced after treatment with anticancer drugs. However, the inhibition rate of cell viability in MMTS was much lower than that in monolayer culture. The MMTS was more resistant to anticancer drugs than monolayer culture. The inhibition rates of cell viability were 68.1%, 45.1%, and 46.8% in MMTS and 95.1%, 86.8%, and 91.6% in monolayer culture treated with MC, ADM, and 5-FU at 10 ppc for 72 h, respectively. MC showed the strongest cytotoxicity in both MMTS and monolayer, followed by 5-FU and ADM. It demonstrated that the MMTS has the potential to be a rapid and valid in vitro model to screen chemotherapeutic drugs with a feature to mimic in vivo three-dimensional (3-D) cell growth pattern.",

METHODS: To update its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned 2 studies: 1) a targeted systematic evidence review on 4 selected questions relating to test characteristics and benefits and harms of screening technologies, and 2) a decision analytic modeling analysis using population modeling techniques to compare the expected health outcomes and resource requirements of available screening modalities when used in a programmatic way over time. RECOMMENDATIONS: The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. The risks and benefits of these screening methods vary. (A recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against routine screening for colorectal cancer in adults 76 to 85 years of age. There may be considerations that support colorectal cancer screening in an individual patient. (C recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against screening for colorectal cancer in adults older than age 85 years. (D recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of computed tomographic colonography and fecal DNA testing as screening modalities for colorectal cancer.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Mycobacterium tuberculosis kills more people than any other bacterial pathogen. New drugs are required to shorten the treatment time and provide a viable therapy for drug-resistant and latent forms of tuberculosis. The tuberculosis field has advanced considerably since the publication of the M. tuberculosis genome sequence. Today, researchers can build a high definition map of the pathogen's traits and behavior and select individual targets for chemical disruption. Areas covered: This review examines the discovery of current clinical and candidate tuberculosis drugs. It outlines recent developments in the selection of molecular targets for the discovery of new anti-mycobacterial agents. It appraises techniques that incorporate target knowledge into the screening protocol. These techniques include in silico, in vitro enzyme-based, differential antisense sensitivity and gene expression screening systems. The review also looks ahead to further techniques that may be applied in tuberculosis drug discovery. Expert opinion: The adoption of an 'either/or' approach to targeted or random tuberculosis drug screening is not expected. The historical success of random screening in providing the tuberculosis drugs currently in clinical use is likely to ensure that non-targeted protocols retain an important role in drug screening. However, a number of M. tuberculosis inhibitors in lead optimization and preclinical development have been discovered using targeted methods. Realization of the first clinically-approved tuberculosis drugs derived from targeted screening and continued refinements in targeted screening technologies are likely to increase the adoption of targeted approaches in the future.",

The proposed screening designs allow consideration of multiple treatments simultaneously. In each period, new treatments can arise and currently considered treatments can be dropped. Once a treatment is removed from the phase II screening trial, a terminal decision is made about abandoning the treatment or recommending it for a future confirmatory phase III study. The decision about dropping treatments from the active set is a sequential stopping decision. We propose a solution based on decision boundaries in the space of marginal posterior moments for the unknown parameter of interest that relates to each treatment. We present a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm to implement the proposed approach.

For diseases in which it is rare that a new compound is active, we argue that more stringent type I error rates in the phase II setting may be more important relative to relaxing the type II error rates. The paper itself is more of a 'thought' experiment on this topic such that specific clinical trial settings will require specific applications of this approach. This is due in part to the fact that the real-world setting is more complex relative to overall decision process in terms of moving from phase II to phase III trials than our basic illustrative model.",

        "abstract": "\\nOver the last few years, there has been growing international concern about the risk of overdiagnosis in breast screening and about how to communicate this to women. There has also been an increasing policy drive to provide people with information to enable them to make an informed choice about screening. In response to this, a novel approach to developing the information about cancer screening has been adopted in England. This approach has integrated the perspectives of people eligible for screening, and experts in public engagement, informed choice, and communicating risk, as well as experts in screening. New information based on this approach has been provided to women invited for breast screening from September 2013. The new information explicitly sets out the choice to be made, and provides much more detail than previous information about overdiagnosis, the balance of benefits and harms, and the scientific uncertainties. The novel approach has also been adopted to develop new information for the bowel and cervical screening programmes in England, and could provide a model for communicating about cancer screening in other countries.",

        "abstract": "Although the pathophysiology and molecular basis of sickle cell disease (SCD) were described more than half a century ago, an effective and safe therapy is not yet available. This may be explained by the lack of a suitable high-throughput technique that allows rapid screening of thousands of compounds for their antisickling effect. The authors have thus developed a novel high-throughput screening (HTS) assay based on detecting the ability of red blood cells (RBC) to traverse a column of tightly packed Sephacryl chromatography beads. When deoxygenated, sickle RBC are rigid and remain on the top of the column. However, when deoxygenated and treated with an effective antisickling agent, erythrocytes move through the Sephacryl media and produce a red dot on the bottom of the assay tubes. This approach has been adapted to wells in a 384-well microplate. Results can be obtained by optical scanning: The size of the red dot is proportional to the antisickling effect of the test molecule. The new assay is simple, inexpensive, reproducible, requires no special reagents, and should be readily adaptable to robotic HTS systems. It has the potential to identify novel drug candidates, allowing the development of new therapeutic options for individuals affected with SCD. (Journal of Biomolecular Screening. 2009:330-336)",

        "title": "High throughput screening methodologies classified for major drug target classes according to target signaling pathways.",
        "abstract": "Over the years, many different high throughput screening technologies and subsequently follow-up methodologies have been developed. All of these can be categorized, for example according to measurement of analyte classes, assay mechanisms, readout principles, or screening of drug target classes. When categorized according to drug target class, assay formats can be subdivided into early hit stage assays (usually ligand-binding based) that are often straightforward and robust up to analysis of final cellular effects exerted by ligands. The latter do not only provide higher content data but also represent anticipated effects in the body more closely. These assay formats, however, are often also elaborate, non-robust, and very time consuming to conduct but become pivotal when going from the hit-to-lead discovery stage. Looking at the hit-to-lead process, new assay possibilities in terms of measured effects and readout principles are continuously reaching the screening arena. Furthermore, at the (early-) lead discovery stage other targets also have to be evaluated to study e.g. target selectivity and ADME(T). This review discusses many of the different assay formats used in the hit-to-lead discovery phase sorted by their use for screening major drug target classes for small molecule drug discovery. The receptor drug targets in this review are subdivided into GPCRs, nuclear receptors and ion channels, while for the enzyme drug targets the important protein kinases, proteases and the drug metabolism enzymes (CYPs; mainly important for drug metabolism and drug-drug interactions) are discussed in more detail. For every drug target, different assay formats used to analyze ligand mediated effects at specific points in the drug target's respective signal transduction cascade(s) are looked at. More specifically, assay methodologies for ligand binding and second messenger formation up to signal transduction cascades and analysis of eventual (cell based) effects are described. Furthermore, special attention is paid to less traditional (non-platereader based) state-of-the-art screening approaches such as LC-MS, microarrays, microfluidics and sensor based technologies.",

        "abstract": "The overexpression of P-glycoprotein, encoded by the ATP Binding Cassette B1 (ABCB1) gene, contributes to multidrug resistance (MDR) and is considered one of the major obstacles to successful cancer chemotherapy. The authors previously developed a T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell line that overexpresses ABCB1 and exhibits MDR to daunorubicin (DNR), prednisolone, and vincristine. Using this cell line and the fluorescent probe JC-1, they developed a flow cytometry-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay that quantifies ABCB1 efflux. They screened a library of 880 off-patent drugs for their ability to inhibit ABCB1 efflux and then measured the ability of 11 lead compounds to reverse in vitro DNR-mediated drug resistance and the toxic doses for each agent. Seven of the 11 drugs were able to reverse drug resistance at a concentration significantly below its toxic dose. Of the remaining 7, only 1 compound, mometasone furoate, has not been previously described as an ABCB1 antagonist to DNR-mediated drug resistance. On the basis of its high ABC modulator activity and relatively large in vitro therapeutic window, this drug warrants further investigation. In addition, the approach used in this study is useful for identifying off-patent drugs that may be repurposed for novel clinical indications.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of research on substance use in the pediatric trauma population. This study aims to describe trends in substance use and screening in the Canadian pediatric trauma population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the London Health Sciences Centre trauma database from April 1999 to January 2009 identified patients less than 18 years old admitted after major trauma [injury severity score (ISS) > 12]. Data extracted included age, gender, ISS, blood alcohol concentration (BAC), and results of toxicology screens. RESULTS: BAC data were available for 799 patients and toxicology screens for 761 patients. BAC testing was completed in 30% (21% positive). Toxicology screens were completed in 7% (44% positive). Increasing age was associated with screening for alcohol (odds ratio = 1.4; 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.5). Screening for drug use had a bimodal distribution, with no children aged 4-10 years screened. Those screened for drugs and alcohol had a significantly higher ISS than those not tested (BAC 28 versus 23, P < 0.001, toxin screening 29 versus 24, P = 0.003). The most common ingestions were alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, and opiates. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for drugs and alcohol is sporadic in the pediatric trauma population. Further study utilizing a universal approach to drug and alcohol screening is needed to further delineate the true prevalence of substance use in this population.",

Here, we describe a screen design and data analysis approach that allow for normalization not only between quadrants and plates but also between screens or batches in a robust, quantitative fashion, enabling hit selection from multiple data sets. We independently screened the MicroSource Spectrum and NCI Diversity Set II libraries using a cell-based phenotypic high-throughput screening (HTS) assay that uses an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)-driven luciferase-reporter assay to identify interferon (IFN) signal enhancers. Inclusion of a per-plate, per-quadrant IFN dose-response standard curve enabled conversion of ISRE activity to effective IFN concentrations. We identified 45 hits based on a combined z score \u22652.5 from the two libraries, and 25 of 35 available hits were validated in a compound concentration-response assay when tested using fresh compound. The results provide a basis for further analysis of chemical structure in relation to biological function. Together, the results establish an HTS method that can be extended to screening for any class of compounds that influence a quantifiable biological response for which a standard is available.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite progress in the development of combined antiretroviral therapies (cART), HIV infection remains a significant challenge for human health. Current problems of cART include multi-drug-resistant virus variants, long-term toxicity and enormous treatment costs. Therefore, the identification of novel effective drugs is urgently needed. METHODS: We developed a straightforward screening approach for simultaneously evaluating the sensitivity of multiple HIV gag-pol mutants to antiviral drugs in one assay. Our technique is based on multi-colour lentiviral self-inactivating (SIN) LeGO vector technology. RESULTS: We demonstrated the successful use of this approach for screening compounds against up to four HIV gag-pol variants (wild-type and three mutants) simultaneously. Importantly, the technique was adapted to Biosafety Level 1 conditions by utilising ecotropic pseudotypes. This allowed upscaling to a large-scale screening protocol exploited by pharmaceutical companies in a successful proof-of-concept experiment. CONCLUSIONS: The technology developed here facilitates fast screening for anti-HIV activity of individual agents from large compound libraries. Although drugs targeting gag-pol variants were used here, our approach permits screening compounds that target several different, key cellular and viral functions of the HIV life-cycle. The modular principle of the method also allows the easy exchange of various mutations in HIV sequences. In conclusion, the methodology presented here provides a valuable new approach for the identification of novel anti-HIV drugs.",

In this review, we summarize state of the art high throughput assays for screening of key physicochemical properties such as solubility, lipophilicity, pKa, drug-plasma protein binding and brain tissue binding as well as in vitro ADME profiling. We discuss two primary approaches for high throughput screening of solubility, i.e. an automated 96-well plate assay integrated with LC-MS and a rapid multi-wavelength UV plate reader. We address the advantages of newly developed miniaturized techniques for high throughput pKa screening by capillary electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry (CE-MS) with automated data analysis flow. Several new lipophilicity approaches other than octanol-water partitioning are critically reviewed, including rapid liquid chromatographic retention based approach, immobilized artificial membrane (IAM) partitioning and liposome, and potential microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEEKC) for accurate screening of LogP. We highlight the sample pooling (namely cassette dosing, all-in-one, cocktail) as an efficient approach for high throughput screening of physicochemical properties and in vitro ADME profiling with emphasis on the benefit of on-line quality control.

Furthermore, the paradox of high investment and low output, in terms of new drugs, highlights the need for more efficient and effective drug screening methods.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review summarizes non-radioactive assays assessing the ligand-receptor binding including: the fluorescence polarization assay, the TR-FRET assay and the surface plasmon resonance assay. It also looks at non-radioactive assays that assess receptor activation and signaling including: second messenger-based assays and \u03b2-arrestin recruitment-based assays. This review also looks at assays based on cellular phenotypic change.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: GPCR signaling pathways look to be more complicated than previously thought. The existence of receptor allosteric sites and multireceptor downstream effectors restricts the traditional assay methods.

        "abstract": "High-content screening (HCS) is a powerful tool for drug discovery being capable of measuring cellular responses to chemical disturbance in a high-throughput manner. HCS provides an image-based readout of cellular phenotypes, including features such as shape, intensity, or texture in a highly multiplexed and quantitative manner. The corresponding feature vectors can be used to characterize phenotypes and are thus defined as HCS fingerprints. Systematic analyses of HCS fingerprints allow for objective computational comparisons of cellular responses. Such comparisons therefore facilitate the detection of different compounds with different phenotypic outcomes from high-throughput HCS campaigns. Feature selection methods and similarity measures, as a basis for phenotype identification and clustering, are critical for the quality of such computational analyses. We systematically evaluated 16 different similarity measures in combination with linear and nonlinear feature selection methods for their potential to capture biologically relevant image features. Nonlinear correlation-based similarity measures such as Kendall's \u03c4 and Spearman's \u03c1 perform well in most evaluation scenarios, outperforming other frequently used metrics (such as the Euclidian distance). We also present four novel modifications of the connectivity map similarity that surpass the original version, in our experiments. This study provides a basis for generic phenotypic analysis in future HCS campaigns.",

        "abstract": "We explore a novel approach to spam based on economic rather than technological or regulatory screening mechanisms. Our first point is that mechanisms designed to promote valuable communication can often outperform those designed merely to block wasteful communication. Our second is to shift focus from the information in the message to the information known to the sender. We can then use principles of information asymmetry to cause people who knowingly misuse communication to incur higher costs than those who do not. In certain cases, though not all, we can show this approach leaves recipients better othan even an idealized or \\perfect\" lter that costs nothing and makes no mistakes. Our mechanism also accounts for individual differences in opportunity costs, and allows for bi-directional wealth transfers while facilitating both sender signaling and recipient screening.",

        "title": "Screening methods for influenza antiviral drug discovery",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Influenza antiviral high-throughput screens have been extensive, and yet no approved influenza antivirals have been identified through high-throughput screening. This underscores the idea that development of successful screens should focus on the exploitation of the underrepresented viral targets and novel, therapeutic host targets. AREAS COVERED: The authors review conventional screening applications and emerging technologies with the potential to enhance influenza antiviral discovery. Real-world examples from the authors' work in biocontained environments are also provided. Future innovations are discussed, including the use of targeted libraries, multiplexed assays, proximity-based endpoint methods, non-laboratory-adapted virus strains, and primary cells, for immediate physiological relevance and translational applications. EXPERT OPINION: The lack of successful anti-influenza drug discovery using high-throughput screening should not deter future efforts. Increased understanding of the functions of viral targets and host-pathogen interactions has broadened the target reservoir. Future screening efforts should focus on identifying new drugs against unexploited viral and host targets using currently developed assays, and on the development of novel, innovative assays to discover new drugs with novel mechanisms. Innovative screens must be designed to identify compounds that specifically inhibit protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions or other virus/host factor interactions that are crucial for viral replication. Finally, the use of recent viral isolates, increased biocontainment (for highly-pathogenic strains), primary cell lines, and targeted compound libraries must converge in efficient high-throughput primary screens to generate high-content, physiologically-relevant data on compounds with robust antiviral activity.",

Therefore, a new test method to obtain selective and active lead molecules has been developed. Recently, this novel screening strategy enabled a breakthrough in drug discovery in the field of herpes viruses. Here the authors report that this assay is a generally applicable screening test, which allows not only for identifying tolerable and potent antimicrobial agents in compound libraries, but also covers all potential in vitro targets of both the pathogen and the host simultaneously. The test system mimics the smallest unit of a natural infection. Host cells are incubated in the presence of the test sample and are infected with microbes, such as viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Analogous to (lethal challenge) animal models, cell survival is determined. This assay maximizes the chances of success of anti-infective drug discovery, is sensitive, robust, time- and cost-efficient, and especially effective in optimizing screening hits to lead structures and development candidates. In addition to the minimal inhibitory concentration or dose, this test system simultaneously provides the selectivity index, a measure of tolerability in vitro. The authors propose the activity selectivity assay format as a new standard in anti-infective drug discovery and clinical development.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy (PN) and its correlation with cryoglobulinemia (CG) in an unselected, untreated referral hepatitis C virus (HCV) population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and thirty four patients (120 women and 114 men) with untreated HCV infection were consecutively enrolled by seven Italian centres. Clinical neuropathy was diagnosed when symptoms and signs of peripheral sensory or motor involvement were present. Median, ulnar, peroneal, and sural nerves were explored in all patients and distal symmetric polyneuropathy was diagnosed when all explored nerves or both lower limb nerves were affected. Mononeuropathy and mononeuropathy multiplex were diagnosed when one nerve or two non-contiguous nerves with asymmetrical distribution were affected. Screening for CG was done in 191 unselected patients. RESULTS: Clinical signs of PN were observed in 25 of the 234 patients (10.6%). Electrophysiological PN was found in 36 (15.3%). CG was present in 56/191 patients (29.3%). The prevalence of CG increased significantly with age (p<0.001) and disease duration (p<0.05). PN was present in 12/56 (21%) patients with CG and 18/135 (13%) without CG (p=NS). PN increased significantly with age (p<0.001) and logistic regression analysis confirmed age as the only independent predictor of PN (OR 1.10 for each year; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.15; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Electrophysiological examination detected subclinical neuropathy in 11 patients (4.7%). Statistical analysis showed that CG was not a risk factor for PN whereas PN prevalence increased significantly with age.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: To describe the development and evaluation of the Substances and Choices Scale (SACS), an adolescent alcohol and other drug (AOD) self-report instrument designed in a similar format to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). DESIGN: A literature review, extensive consultation and discriminant analysis on a pilot sample (n = 61) of adolescents informed the development of the SACS. The psychometric properties of the SACS were then tested in a larger community and clinical sample. SETTING: Three youth out-patient AOD treatment services and three secondary schools in Auckland, New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: 13-18-year-old males and females attending the services (n = 120) or schools (n = 531). MEASUREMENTS: The SACS was administered with the CRAFFT, the Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). FINDINGS: Reliability of the SACS was sound, with coefficient alpha 0.91 and 3-week test-retest correlation 0.88. Congruent validity coefficients of the SACS versus the CRAFFT and the POSIT were 0.79 and 0.91, respectively. A ROC curve demonstrated the SACS as having a predictive value of 92%. Repeat SACS scores in a treatment sample indicated that the SACS had utility in measuring change. Feedback from participants indicated that the SACS was highly acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: The SACS is a simple AOD instrument that is reliable, valid and acceptable to young people. It has utility in screening and measuring outcome and should enhance the identification and treatment of AOD difficulties in adolescents across a range of health settings.",

        "abstract": "High throughput screening is a core technology in drug discovery. During the past decade, several strategies have been developed to screen (poly)peptide libraries for diverse applications including disease diagnosis and profiling, imaging, as well as therapy. The recently established baculovirus display vector system (BDVS) represents a eukaryotic screening platform that combines the positive attributes of both cell and virus-based display approaches, allowing presentation of complex polypeptides on cellular and viral surfaces. Compared to microbial display systems, the BDVS has the advantage of correct protein folding and post-translational modifications similar to those in mammals, facilitating expression and analysis of proteins with therapeutic interest. The applicability of the system is further expanded by the availability of genetically engineered insect cell lines capable of performing e.g. mammalianized glycosylation in combination with high level of expression. In addition to insect cells, baculovirus can mediate delivery and expression of heterologous genes in a broad spectrum of primary and established mammalian cells. Currently, a variety of baculovirus-based assays aiming at routine high throughput identification of agents targeting cell surface receptors or studies on ligand-receptor interactions are under construction. Here, the advancements and future prospects of the baculovirus display technologies with emphasis on molecular screening and drug delivery applications using insect cell display, mammalian cell display, and virion display are described.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear Factor-kB (NF-kB) is a family of TNFa-inducible transcription factors regulated by stimulus-induced protein interactions. In the cytoplasm, the potent RelA transactivator is inactivated by binding inhibitory IkBs, whereas in its activated state, the serine-phosphorylated protein binds the p300 histone acetyltransferase. Here we describe the isolation of a ssDNA aptamer (termed P028F4) that binds to the activated (IkBa-dissociated) form of RelA with a KD of 6.4 X 10-10 and its application in an enrichment-mass spectrometric quantification assay for activated RelA. ssDNA P028F4 competes with cognate duplex high affinity NF-kB binding sites for RelA binding in vitro and also binds activated RelA in eukaryotic nuclei. P028F4 transfection into A549 cells reduces TNFa-stimulated endogenous NF-kB dependent gene expression. Incorporation of P028F4 as an affinity isolation step after initial enrichment with FLAG mAb enriches for Ser 536 phosphorylated- and p300 coactivator complexed RelA, simultaneously depleting IkBa-RelA complexes. A stable isotope dilution (SID)-SRM-MS assay for RelA was developed that produced a linear response over 1,000 fold dilution range of input protein and had a 200 amol lower limit of quantification (S/N 85, 10.2% CV). This multiplex SID-SRM RelA assay was used to quantify activated endogenous RelA in cytokine-stimulated eukaryotic cells isolated by single-step P028F4 enrichment. The aptamer-SID-SRM-MS assay quantified the fraction of activated RelA in subcellular extract, detecting the presence of an inert cytoplasmic RelA reservoir unresponsive to TNFa stimulation. We conclude that aptamer-SID-SRM-MS is a versatile tool for quantification of activated NF-kB/RelA and its associated complexes in response to pathway activation.",

        "abstract": "Several studies report that a substantial percentage of offenders arrested for impaired driving test positive for drugs of abuse besides alcohol. Current guidelines recommend screening offenders for both alcohol and other drug use, yet little is known about the accuracy of self-reports of drug use in this population. We compared drug abuse and dependence DSM-III-R diagnoses from an initial, court-ordered screening evaluation of 583 female and 495 male convicted drunk-driving offenders with diagnoses obtained via a voluntary, non-coerced interview 5 years later. At initial screening, fewer than 6% of offenders were diagnosed with drug abuse or dependence. Among offenders who did not receive an initial drug diagnosis, 28% subsequently reported having experienced drug use problems consistent with a retrospective diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence by the age at which they were screened. Half of those with a retrospective diagnosis of drug dependence reported their initial screening responses were \"very accurate\". We conclude that, although many drunk-driving offenders undergoing screening have diagnosable drug problems, a high proportion under-report their drug use. We suggest that certain modifications to screening procedures, such as urine drug screening, reducing barriers to treatment, and training counselors in motivational interviewing techniques, may increase accurate identification of drug use problems in this population. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

        "abstract": "There are substances that kill cancer cells, but induce T cell proliferation, like thalidomide. To find more of these, a new anticancer drug screening strategy is vital. In this study we report the development of a differential cytotoxicity screening or evaluation platform using the CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Annandale, NSW, Australia) luminescent cell viability assay (ATP assay) and also the CellTiter 96 AQueous (Promega) one solution cell proliferation assay [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay]. The results suggested the platform consisting of the combination of the ATP assay be used for quantifying peripheral blood mononuclear cells, while the more economic MTS colorimetric assay is well suited to be used detecting cell viability of cancer cells. In addition, we found paclitaxel (Taxol, MP Biomedicals Australasia Pty Ltd., Seven Hills, NSW, Australia) to be a useful control for this routine screening methodology. Taxol exhibits the desirable in vitro feature of differential cytotoxicity that spares the immunological cells, when used at a concentration that will kill the majority of the cancer cell population.",

        "abstract": "Depriving weaned rats of social contact by rearing them in isolation brings about a spectrum of behavioural and neuropathological changes in adulthood which resemble some of the characteristics observed in schizophrenia. Hence, isolation rearing provides a non-pharmacological means to induce in an animal model certain aspects of schizophrenia with a neurodevelopmental origin. We compared the prepulse inhibition and locomotor activity behaviours in group-reared and isolation-reared rats in the context of determining the robustness of any behavioural changes following a subchronic parenteral drug administration protocol. The expression of synaptic, myelin and GABA-related proteins was also assessed in the brains of these rats using semi-quantitative fluorescence immunohistochemistry. Compared to their group-reared counterparts, isolation-reared rats displayed disruption in prepulse inhibition which was lost after repeated testing and subchronic vehicle administration. However, isolation-reared rats showed open-field hyperlocomotion post-subchronic vehicle treatment compared to group-reared rats. Isolation rearing resulted in reduced expression of synaptophysin, synapsin I, myelin basic protein and GABA B1 receptor proteins, along with an increase in 2???,3???- cyclic nucleotide 3???-phosphodiesterase. Of the brain areas examined these observed changes were localised to the hippocampal regions and the substantia nigra. These results suggest an alteration in the synaptic, myelin and GABA-related functions in the brains of isolation-reared rats that displayed behavioural anomalies. Since dysfunction in these systems has also been implicated in schizophrenia, our findings provide additional evidence to support the use of isolation rearing for schizophrenia research; however, its use in the screening of putative antipsychotics following subchronic administration needs to be undertaken warily. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An isolate of Bacillus subtilis (EU07) identified by the 16s RNA region code genewas selected as the best antagonist and evaluated against FORL in vitro studies. Strain EU07 at 106 CFU ml\ue0021 was able to reduce disease incidence by 75%, when applied as an inoculant. It efficiently inhibited FORL compared to the control and QST 713 (AgraQuest, Davis, CA) whose inhibition ratio was only 52% in vivo. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analyses showed banding (wgenetic) differences between EU07 and QST 713 whereas there were no differences between DNAs of strains that have high homology to genes involved in the synthesis of antibiotics fengycin, bacillomycin and iturin when screened by oligonucleotide primers designed based on sequence information obtained from the NCBI database. Furthermore, one specific fragment in the EU07 genome showed the highest similarity to YrvN protein by 99% and AAA ATPase domain protein (72.2%) after amplifying oligonucleotide primers that are specific to the N-acyl-homoserine lactonase (HLS) gene as a biocontrol activity marker. These results suggested an effect of EU07 on control FORL by YrvN protein as subunit of protease enzyme. Furthermore, this fragment associated with HLS gene may be a potential molecular marker for selecting effective biological control agent belonging to Bacillus in order to control soilborne pathogens such as Fusarium, suggesting impairment in FORL invasion by signaling in the plant rhizophere. \ue002 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the validation and selection of primary screening assays are vital to guarantee a selection of extracts or molecules with relevant pharmacological action and worthy of following up. The assay must be rapid, simple, easy to implement, and produce quick results and preferably at a low cost. In this work, we developed and validated a colorimetric microtiter assay using the resazurin viability dye. The parameters of the resazurin method for high-throughput screening (HTS) using natural extracts against Aspergillus fumigatus were optimized and set up. The extracts plus RPMI-1640 modified medium containing the spores and 0.002% resazurin were added per well. The fluorescence was read after 24 to 30 h of incubation. The resazurin proved to be as suitable as Alamar Blue for determining the minimal inhibitory concentration of different antifungals against A. fumigatus and effective to analyze fungicidal and fungistatic compounds. An HTS of 12 000 microbial extracts was carried out against two A. fumigatus strains, and 2.7% of the extracts displayed antifungal activity. Our group has been the first to use this methodology for screening a collection of natural extracts to identify compounds with antifungal activity against the medically important human pathogen A. fumigatus.",

Over the past decade, great efforts have been made in developing platforms for patch clamp-based high-quality screening of ion channels in discovering new drug candidates as well for evaluating their safety profiles. Indeed, the automated patch clamp (APC) has recently reached the data throughput requirements of high-throughput screening (HTS) allowing for new screening strategies with ion channel active compounds. Areas covered: This editorial article comments on the past and present developments of APC-based drug screening. Furthermore, it also looks at the implications of APC technology meeting HTS-standards as well as its use in compound safety evaluation. Expert opinion: In the imminent future, we will see a paradigm shift in ion channel drug screening toward using APC-based platforms for primary drug library screens. This way, the redundancy of the drug discovery process and the risk of false-negatives could be drastically reduced. Furthermore, cardiac safety can be addressed early, avoiding late-phase withdrawals with promising drug candidates. It is our firm belief that APC-based ion channel HTS will facilitate the discovery of candidates, which otherwise would have not been found, and shorten the drug development cycle, saving time and cost.",

Thermodynamic characterization provides information about the balance of energetic forces driving binding interactions and is essential for understanding and optimizing molecular interactions. Areas covered: This review discusses the information that can be obtained from thermodynamic measurements and how this can be applied to the drug development process. Current approaches for the measurement and optimization of thermodynamic parameters are presented, specifically higher throughput and calorimetric methods. Relevant literature for this review was identified in part by bibliographic searches for the period 2004-2011 using the Science Citation Index and PUBMED and the keywords listed below. Expert opinion: The most effective drug design and development platform comes from an integrated process utilizing all available information from structural, thermodynamic and biological studies. Continuing evolution in our understanding of the energetic basis of molecular interactions and advances in thermodynamic methods for widespread application are essential to realize the goal of thermodynamically driven drug design. Comprehensive thermodynamic evaluation is vital early in the drug development process to speed drug development toward an optimal energetic interaction profile while retaining good pharmacological properties. Practical thermodynamic approaches, such as enthalpic optimization, thermodynamic optimization plots and the enthalpic efficiency index, have now matured to provide proven utility in the design process. Improved throughput in calorimetric methods remains essential for even greater integration of thermodynamics into drug design.",

        "abstract": "In most laboratories, the screening for leishmanicidal compounds is carried out with Leishmania promastigotes or axenic amastigotes. However, the best approach to identify leishmanicidal compounds is the use of amastigotes residing in macrophages. Reporter gene-based assays are relatively new tools in the search for drugs against eucaryotic protozoa, permitting the development of faster, more automated assays. In this paper, we report on the establishment of a rapid screening assay in a 96-well format. A luciferase-transgenic (Luc-tg) Leishmania major strain was generated and used to infect bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). Amastigote-infected BMDM were treated with different compound concentrations. Cells were lysed with a luciferin-containing buffer, and the resulting luminescence was measured to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). To validate this new amastigote screening assay, a library of a new class of quinolinium salts was synthesized and tested for leishmanicidal activity. Some of the quinolinium salts showed very promising activities, with IC50s against intracellular amastigotes (IC50 < 1 \u03bcg/ml) and selectivity indices (SI > 20) that match the criteria of World Health Organization (WHO) for hits. Compound 21c (IC50 = 0.03 \u03bcg/ml; SI = 358) could become a new lead structure for the development of improved chemotherapeutic drugs against L. major. In summary, we describe the establishment of a new 96-well format assay with Luc-transgenic L. major for the rapid screening of compounds for leishmanicidal activity against intracellular amastigotes and its application to the identification of a new class of quinolinium salts with most promising leishmanicidal activity.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional atom- and bond-based TOMOCOMD-CARDD descriptors and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are used in this report to perform a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study of tyrosinase-inhibitory activity. A database of inhibitors of the enzyme is collected for this study, within 246 highly dissimilar molecules presenting antityrosinase activity. In total, 7 discriminant functions are obtained by using the whole set of atom- and bond-based 2D indices. All the LDA-based QSAR models show accuracies above 90% in the training set and values of the Matthews correlation coefficient (C) varying from 0.85 to 0.90. The external validation set shows globally good classifications between 89% and 91% and C values ranging from 0.75 to 0.81. Finally, QSAR models are used in the selection/identification of the 20 new dicoumarins subset to search for tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Theoretical and experimental results show good correspondence between one another. It is important to remark that most compounds in this series exhibit a more potent inhibitory activity against the mushroom tyrosinase enzyme than the reference compound, Kojic acid (IC(50) = 16.67 muM), resulting in a novel nucleus base (lead) with antityrosinase activity, and this could serve as a starting point for the drug discovery of novel tyrosinase inhibitor lead compounds.

        "abstract": "Developing reliable biomarkers of tumor cell drug sensitivity and resistance can guide hypothesis-driven basic science research and influence pre-therapy clinical decisions. A popular strategy for developing biomarkers uses characterizations of human tumor samples against a range of cancer drug responses that correlate with genomic change; developed largely from the efforts of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Sanger Cancer Genome Project (CGP). The purpose of this study is to provide an independent analysis of this data that aims to vet existing and add novel perspectives to biomarker discoveries and applications. Existing and alternative data mining and statistical methods will be used to a) evaluate drug responses of compounds with similar mechanism of action (MOA), b) examine measures of gene expression (GE), copy number (CN) and mutation status (MUT) biomarkers, combined with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), for hypothesizing biological processes important for drug response, c) conduct global comparisons of GE, CN and MUT as biomarkers across all drugs screened in the CGP dataset, and d) assess the positive predictive power of CGP-derived GE biomarkers as predictors of drug response in CCLE tumor cells. The perspectives derived from individual and global examinations of GEs, MUTs and CNs confirm existing and reveal unique and shared roles for these biomarkers in tumor cell drug sensitivity and resistance. Applications of CGP-derived genomic biomarkers to predict the drug response of CCLE tumor cells finds a highly significant ROC, with a positive predictive power of 0.78. The results of this study expand the available data mining and analysis methods for genomic biomarker development and provide additional support for using biomarkers to guide hypothesis-driven basic science research and pre-therapy clinical decisions.",

Objective: To assess the impact of virtual screening on drug discovery. Method: Such cases as can be found in the public domain at the current time are reviewed. Additionally, some of the current challenges in structure- and ligand-based virtual screening are discussed. Conclusion: It is concluded that virtual screening has contributed to the discovery of several compounds that have either reached the market or entered clinical trials.

However, screening tests are underused for many segments of the population and are ordered in a manner inconsistent with guidelines. The primary goal of colorectal cancer screening is to reduce mortality through the reduction of advanced disease.

        "abstract": "Over half of BRAFV600E melanomas display intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors, in part due to adaptive signaling responses. In this communication we ask whether BRAFV600E melanomas share common adaptive responses to BRAF inhibition that can provide clinically relevant targets for drug combinations. We screened a panel of 12 treatment-na\u00efve BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines with MAP Kinase pathway inhibitors in pairwise combination with 58 signaling inhibitors, assaying for synergistic cytotoxicity. We found enormous diversity in the drug combinations that showed synergy, with no two cell lines having an identical profile. Although the 6 lines most resistant to BRAF inhibition showed synergistic benefit from combination with lapatinib, the signaling mechanisms by which this combination generated synergistic cytotoxicity differed between the cell lines. We conclude that adaptive responses to inhibition of the primary oncogenic driver (BRAFV600E) are determined not only by the primary oncogenic driver but also by diverse secondary genetic and epigenetic changes (\"back-seat drivers\") and hence optimal drug combinations will be variable. Because upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases is a major source of drug resistance arising from diverse adaptive responses, we propose that inhibitors of these receptors may have substantial clinical utility in combination with inhibitors of the MAP Kinase pathway.",

        "abstract": "An important role of the clinical toxicology laboratory is to provide continuous diagnostic testing for patients with altered mental status and for other medical indications. To meet these needs, we have developed a new Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) platform that facilitates routine screening and automated reporting of 212 drugs by laboratory technologists around the clock without the need to sign out by an on-site mass spectrometry-trained toxicologist. The platform uses a programmable temperature vaporizer (PTV) injector for large sample volume injection and the free software Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS) for data reduction and spectral matching that facilitates rapid library searching and analyte identification. Method comparison with 118 patient samples demonstrated that this platform and data searching algorithm independently provided improvements in sensitivity compared to an established GC-MS platform. Further examination of the role of the data processing software and the in-house databases used in the established versus the new platform demonstrated that the improved analytical sensitivity of the new platform was attributed to both the technical superiority of the new GC-MS instrumentation and the use of AMDIS in conjunction with the newly generated in-house library for data processing.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Novel personalized therapeutic approaches are urgently needed for patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Methods and materials: We combined the development of a primary patient-derived ccRCC cell line with a phenotypic drug screen consisting of 101 approved anticancer compounds. Results: We identified the MNNG HOS transforming gene (MET)-anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) inhibitor crizotinib as the top hit of our drug screen, whereas compounds targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway showed no or only minor in vitro activity. Among the known major crizotinib targets MET, ALK, and ROS-1, only MET was expressed in our ccRCC cell line. Subsequent sequence analysis revealed a heterozygous R988C mutation of the MET gene and a VHL deletion in both the primary tumor and the tumor-derived ccRCC cell line. However, we were unable to show an activation of MET and, further, MET knockdown did not result in increased apoptosis or cytotoxicity. Therefore, our results suggest that MET R988C does not function as a major oncogenic driver mutation but rather represents a sequence variant. However, we provide evidence that the cytotoxic effect of crizotinib in our cell line model correlates with its ability to inhibit P-glycoprotein (ABCB1)-associated transport functions. Conclusions: Our study shows that a phenotypic screen of a patient-derived tumor cell line can identify compounds with antitumor activity but with an unexpected mode of action. Our results underscore that target validation and phenotype-genotype correlations remain a major experimental challenge. The implications of our findings for a personalized management of patients with cancer are discussed. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Deciphering the effects of compounds on molecular events within living cells is becoming an increasingly important component of drug discovery. In a model application of the industrial drug discovery process, the authors profiled a panel of 22 compounds using hierarchical cluster analysis of multiparameter high-content screening measurements from nearly 500,000 cells per microplate. RNAi protein knockdown methodology was used with high-content screening to dissect the effects of 2 anticancer drugs on multiple target activities. Camptothecin activated p53 in A549 lung carcinoma cells pretreated with scrambled siRNA, exhibited concentration-dependent cell cycle blocks, and induced moderate microtubule stabilization. Knockdown of camptothecin-induced p53 protein expression with p53 siRNA inhibited the G1/S blocking activity of the drug and diminished its microtubule-stabilizing activity. Paclitaxel activated p53 protein at low concentrations but exhibited G2/M cell cycle blocking activity at higher concentrations where microtubules were stabilized. In cells treated with p53 siRNA, paclitaxel failed to activate p53 protein, but the knockdown did not have a significant effect on the ability of paclitaxel to stabilize microtubules or induce a G2/M cell cycle block. Thus, this model application of the use of RNAi technology within the context of high-content screening shows the potential to provide massive amounts of combinatorial cell biological information on the temporal and spatial responses that cells mount to treatment by promising therapeutic candidates.",

Results were compared to those obtained on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.\\n\\nRESULTS: The dynamic range varied depending on compounds and instruments and was similar between the MRM on QqQ and full TOF scan mode on QqTOF. Linear or quadratic regression and 1/x(2) weighting were used. Resolution on the QqTOF instrument was around 32000 and mass accuracy was within 4.4\u2009ppm.

A prism-coupled SPRi system with smart images processing software and a 5 x 5 polypeptide microarray was developed. The modeling analysis was performed to optimize the system and the materials of prism and chip, looking for the optimal incident wavelength and angle of incidence for dynamic SPRi detection in solution. The system can dynamically monitor 25 tunnels of biomolecule interactions in solution without secondary tag reactants. In addition, this system can determine the specific profile of antibody-polypeptide binding in each tunnel and yield a visual three-dimensional histogram of dynamic combinations in all microarray tunnels. Furthermore, the detection limit of the label-free antibody-polypeptide binding reached 1 pg/muL in a one-step binding test, and an ultrasensitive detection of 10 fg/muL was obtained using three-step cascade binding. Using the peptide microarray, the amount of sample and reagents used was reduced to 80 nL per tunnel, and 20 x 20 tunnels of biomolecule interactions could be analyzed in parallel in a 7 mm x 7 mm microreaction cells. This device and method offer a potential platform for high-throughput and label-free dynamic monitoring multiple biomolecule interactions for drug discovery and basic biomedical research.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To generate and examine evidence in support of diagnosing cystic fibrosis (CF) early through newborn screening (NBS). STUDY DESIGN: Using a randomized controlled trial with unique unblinding/surveillance, we evaluated patients with CF receiving similar treatment after assignment to an early diagnosis (screened) group or to a control group. Outcomes studied at diagnosis and longitudinally included measures of nutritional status and lung disease. RESULTS: Assessment of patients with CF without meconium ileus who had pancreatic insufficiency revealed marked differences in age and condition at diagnosis-screened patients had significantly better length/height, weight, and head circumference. Follow-up evaluation for 16 years showed that height and weight differences persisted long term. Although screened patients had better chest x-ray scores at diagnosis, our trial suggests that the effects of confounders such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections led to deterioration of their scores after 10 years, but there were no significant differences between the 2 CF/pancreatic insufficiency subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis of CF and aggressive nutritional management can prevent malnutrition and growth failure. Although CF NBS provides a potential opportunity for better pulmonary outcomes, it appears that other factors can predominate over time in pulmonary prognosis. Overall, the Wisconsin trial is positive and provides enough evidence for routine CF NBS.",

The size and the complexity of the screens have been steadily increasing. This is reflected in the fact that the major challenges facing the field at the present are data mining and data storage due to the large amount of data generated during HCS. On the one hand, technological progress of fully automated image acquisition platforms, and on the other hand advances in the field of automated image analysis have made this technology more powerful and more accessible to less specialized users. Image analysis solutions for many biological problems exist and more are being developed to increase both the quality and the quantity of data extracted from the images acquired during the screens. We highlight in this review some of the major challenges facing automatic high throughput image analysis and present some of the software solutions available on the market or from academic open source solutions.",

        "abstract": "Drug metabolism can have profound effects on the pharmacological and toxicological profile of therapeutic agents. In the pharmaceutical industry, many in vitro techniques are in place or under development to screen and optimize compounds for favorable metabolic properties in the drug discovery phase. These in vitro technologies are meant to address important issues such as: (1) is the compound a potent inhibitor of drug metabolising enzymes (DMEs)? (2) does the compound induce the expression of DMEs? (3) how labile is the compound to metabolic degradation? (4) which specific enzyme(s) is responsible for the compound's biotransformation? and (5) to which metabolites is the compound metabolized? Answers to these questions provide a basis for judging whether a compound is likely to have acceptable pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. To address these issues on the increasing number of compounds inundating the drug discovery programs, high throughput assays are essential. A combination of biochemical advances in the understanding of the function and regulation of DMEs (in particular, cytochromes P450, CYPs) and automated analytical technologies are revolutionizing drug metabolism research. Automated LC-MS based metabolic stability, fluorescence, radiometric and LC-MS based CYP inhibition assays are now in routine use. Automatible models for studying CYP induction based on enzyme activity, quantitative RT-PCR and reporter gene systems are being developed. We will review the utility and limitations of these HTS approaches and highlight on-going developments and emerging technologies to answer metabolism questions at the different stages of the drug discovery process.",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE Drug discovery samples are routinely analyzed using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) methods on triple quadrupole mass spectrometers employing multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). In order to improve analysis throughput, quantitation of small molecules on a quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF) instrument using TOF scan and high-resolution MRM (MRM-HR) modes was evaluated in this study. METHODS Cassette dosed plasma and brain samples from nine compounds were extracted using a protein precipitation method. Separation was achieved by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using TOF scan and high-resolution MRM approaches on a QqTOF mass spectrometer with turbo-ionspray ionization. Results were compared to those obtained on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. RESULTS The dynamic range varied depending on compounds and instruments and was similar between the MRM on QqQ and full TOF scan mode on QqTOF. Linear or quadratic regression and 1/x2 weighting were used. Resolution on the QqTOF instrument was around 32000 and mass accuracy was within 4.4?ppm. The MRM-HR method showed better sensitivity compared to the TOF scan method, and was comparable to the MRM on a QqQ mass spectrometer. Assay accuracy was within +/- 25%. CONCLUSIONS A TOF scan method allowed the use of the generic method without compound-specific optimization and was an alternative choice for routine high-throughput quantitation of small molecules. The MRM-HR method on the QqTOF showed good sensitivity which was comparable to that obtained by the MRM method on the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Current approaches for the measurement and optimization of thermodynamic parameters are presented, specifically higher throughput and calorimetric methods.

Continuing evolution in our understanding of the energetic basis of molecular interactions and advances in thermodynamic methods for widespread application are essential to realize the goal of thermodynamically-driven drug design. Comprehensive thermodynamic evaluation is vital early in the drug development process to speed drug development towards an optimal energetic interaction profile while retaining good pharmacological properties. Practical thermodynamic approaches, such as enthalpic optimization, thermodynamic optimization plots and the enthalpic efficiency index, have now matured to provide proven utility in design process. Improved throughput in calorimetric methods remains essential for even greater integration of thermodynamics into drug design.",

        "abstract": "The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor is a key regulator of insulin secretion and a major therapeutic target for treatment of diabetes. However, GLP-1 receptor function is complex, with multiple endogenous peptides that can interact with the receptor, including full-length (1-37) and truncated (7-37) forms of GLP-1 that can each exist in an amidated form and the related peptide oxyntomodulin. We have investigated two GLP-1 receptor allosteric modulators, Novo Nordisk compound 2 (6,7-dichloro2-methylsulfonyl-3-tert-butylaminoquinoxaline) and quercetin, and their ability to modify binding and signaling (cAMP formation, intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation) of each of the naturally occurring endogenous peptide agonists, as well as the clinically used peptide mimetic exendin-4. We identified and quantified stimulus bias across multiple endogenous peptides, with response profiles for truncated GLP-1 peptides distinct from those of either the full-length GLP-1 peptides or oxyntomodulin, the first demonstration of such behavior at the GLP-1 receptor. Compound 2 selectively augmented cAMP signaling but did so in a peptide-agonist dependent manner having greatest effect on oxyntomodulin, weaker effect on truncated GLP-1 peptides, and negligible effect on other peptide responses; these effects were principally driven by parallel changes in peptide agonist affinity. In contrast, quercetin selectively modulated calcium signaling but with effects only on truncated GLP-1 peptides or exendin and not oxyntomodulin or full-length peptides. These data have significant implications for how GLP-1 receptor targeted drugs are screened and developed, whereas the allosterically driven, agonist-selective, stimulus bias highlights the potential for distinct clinical efficacy depending on the properties of individual drugs.",

        "abstract": "Background Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), a recessive neurodegenerative disorder commonly associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is caused by silencing of the frataxin (FXN) gene encoding the mitochondrial protein involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. Methods Application of our previously established FRDA human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived cardiomyocytes model as a platform to assess the efficacy of treatment with either the antioxidant coenzyme Q10 analog, idebenone (IDE) or the iron chelator, deferiprone (DFP), which are both under clinical trial. Results DFP was able to more significantly suppress synthesis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than IDE at the dosages of 25 \u03bcM and 10 nM respectively which agreed with the reduced rate of intracellular accumulation of iron by DFP treatment from 25 to 50 \u03bcM. With regard to cardiac electrical-contraction (EC) coupling function, decay velocity of calcium handling kinetics in FRDA-hiPSC-cardiomyocytes was significantly improved by DFP treatment but not by IDE. Further mechanistic studies revealed that DFP also modulated iron induced mitochondrial stress as reflected by mitochondria network disorganization and decline level of respiratory chain protein, succinate dehydrogenase (CxII) and cytochrome c oxidase (COXIV). In addition, iron-response protein (IRP-1) regulatory loop was overridden by DFP as reflected by resumed level of ferritin (FTH) back to basal level and the attenuated transferrin receptor (TSFR) mRNA level suppression thereby reducing further iron uptake. Conclusions DFP modulated iron homeostasis in FRDA-hiPSC-cardiomyocytes and effectively relieved stress-stimulation related to cardiomyopathy. The resuming of redox condition led to the significantly improved cardiac prime events, cardiac electrical-coupling during contraction.",

It is therefore important to develop small molecule inhibitors of NATs as molecular tools to study the function of NATs in various organisms. Such inhibitors may also prove useful in future drug design, for example in the development of anti tubercular agents.

        "title": "Feasibility of Implementing Cell-Based Pathway Reporter Assays in Early High-Throughput Screening Assay Cascades for Antibody Drug Discovery",
        "abstract": "Implementing functional cell-based screens in early antibody discovery has become increasingly important to select antibodies with the desired profile. However, this is limited by assay tolerance to crude antibody preparations and assay sensitivity. The current study aims to address this challenge and identify routes forward. Two common types of high-throughput screening (HTS) antibody sample, derived from either phage display or hybridoma techniques, have been screened across a wide range of CellSensor beta-lactamase reporter assays in a variety of cell backgrounds to more extensively characterize assay tolerance. Pathway-, sample-, and cell background-specific effects were observed. Reporter assays for agonism were less affected by crude antibody preparations, with 8 of 21 sample tolerant, and the potential to implement an additional 8 assays by choosing the best-tolerated sample type. Antagonist mode assays exhibited more complexity, with potentiating as well as inhibitory effects. However, 5 of 24 antagonist assays were fully tolerant, with the potential to implement an additional 11 assays. Different subsets of assays were affected in agonist versus antagonist mode, and hybridoma sample sets were better tolerated overall. The study clearly demonstrates the potential to use cell-based reporter assays in biologics HTS, particularly if the method of antibody production is considered in the context of the required assay mode (agonist/antagonist).",

        "abstract": "There has been a resurgence of interest in the use of phenotypic screens in drug discovery as an alternative to target-focused approaches. Given that oncology is currently the most active therapeutic area, and also one in which target-focused approaches have been particularly prominent in the past two decades, we investigated the contribution of phenotypic assays to oncology drug discovery by analysing the origins of all new small-molecule cancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the past 15 years and those currently in clinical development. Although the majority of these drugs originated from target-based discovery, we identified a significant number whose discovery depended on phenotypic screening approaches. We postulate that the contribution of phenotypic screening to cancer drug discovery has been hampered by a reliance on 'classical' nonspecific drug effects such as cytotoxicity and mitotic arrest, exacerbated by a paucity of mechanistically defined cellular models for therapeutically translatable cancer phenotypes. However, technical and biological advances that enable such mechanistically informed phenotypic models have the potential to empower phenotypic drug discovery in oncology.",

        "abstract": "Cortical neurons of the superficial layers (II-IV) represent a pivotal neuronal population involved in the higher cognitive functions of the human and are particularly affected by psychiatric diseases with developmental manifestations such as schizophrenia and autism. Differentiation protocols of human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) into cortical neurons have been achieved, opening the way to in vitro modeling of neuropsychiatric diseases. However, these protocols commonly result in the asynchronous production of neurons typical for the different layers of the cortex within an extended period of culture, thus precluding the analysis of specific subtypes of neurons in a standardized manner. Addressing this issue, we have successfully captured a stable population of self-renewing late cortical progenitors (LCPs) that synchronously and massively differentiate into glutamatergic cortical neurons of the upper layers. The short time course of differentiation into neurons of these progenitors has made them amenable to high-throughput assays. This has allowed us to analyze the capability of LCPs at differentiating into post mitotic neurons as well as extending and branching neurites in response to a collection of selected bioactive molecules. LCPs and cortical neurons of the upper layers were successfully produced from patient-derived-induced PSC, indicating that this system enables functional studies of individual-specific cortical neurons ex vivo for disease modeling and therapeutic purposes.",

        "title": "The N-terminal cytoplasmic region of NCBE displays features of an intrinsic disordered structure and represents a novel target for specific drug screening",
        "abstract": "The sodium dependent bicarbonate transporter NCBE/NBCn2 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). The highest protein concentrations are found in the choroid plexus. The primary function of this integral plasma membrane transport protein is to regulate intracellular neuronal pH and also probably to maintain the pH homeostasis across the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. NCBE is predicted to contain at least 10 transmembrane helices. The N- and C- termini are both cytoplasmic, with a large N-terminal domain (Nt-NCBE) and a relatively small C-terminal domain (Ct-NCBE). The Nt-NCBE is likely to be involved in bicarbonate recognition and transport and contains key areas of regulation involving pH sensing and protein-protein interactions. Intrinsic disordered protein regions (IDPRs) are defined as protein regions having no rigid three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. They are believed to be involved in signaling networks in which specific, low affinity, protein-protein interactions play an important role. We predict that NCBE and other SoLute Carrier 4 (SLC4) family members have a high level of intrinsic disorder in their cytoplasmic regions. To provide biophysical evidence for the IDPRs predicted in Nt-NCBE, we produced pure (>99%), recombinant Nt-NCBE using E. coli as the expression host. The protein was used to perform differential scanning fluorescence spectroscopy (DSF), in order to search for small molecules that would induce secondary or tertiary structure in the IDPRs. We expect this to assist the development of selective pharmaceutical compounds against individual SLC4 family members. We have also determined a low resolution (4 \u00c5) X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal core domain. The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (cdb3) of anion exchanger 1 (AE1) shares a similar fold with the N-terminal core domain of NCBE. Crystallization conditions for the full-length N-terminal domain have been sought, but only the core domain yields diffracting crystals.",

        "abstract": "Epigenetic aberrations are increasingly regarded as key factors in cancer progression. Recently, deregulation of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) has been linked to several types of cancer. Monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (MOZ) is a member of the MYST family of HATs, which regulate gene expression in cell proliferation and differentiation. Deregulation of these processes through constitutively active MOZ fusion proteins gives rise to the formation of leukemic stem cells, rendering MOZ an excellent target for treating myeloid leukemia. The authors implemented a hit discovery campaign to identify small-molecule inhibitors of MOZ-HAT activity. They developed a robust, homogeneous assay measuring the acetylation of synthetic histone peptides. In a primary screening campaign testing 243 000 lead-like compounds, they identified inhibitors from several chemical classes. Secondary assays were used to eliminate assay-interfering compounds and prioritize confirmed hits. This study establishes a new high-throughput assay for HAT activity and could provide the foundation for the development of a new class of drugs for the treatment of leukemias.",

This article describes computational techniques for end to end analysis of large drug discovery screening sets. The analysis proceeds in three stages: In stage 1 the initial screening set is filtered to remove compounds that are unsuitable as lead compounds. In stage 2 local structural neighborhoods around active compound classes are identified, including similar but inactive compounds. In stage 3 the structure-activity relationships within local structural neighborhoods are analyzed. These processes are illustrated by analyzing two large, publicly available databases.",

        "abstract": "The construction and characterization of potentiometric membrane electrodes are described for the quantification of alfuzosin, a drug used in a mono- and combined therapy of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The membranes of these electrodes consist of alfuzosin hydrochloride-tetraphenyl borate, (Az-TPB), chlorophenyl borate (Az-ClPB), and phosphotungstate (Az(3)-PT) ion associations as molecular recognition reagent dispersed in PVC matrix with dioctylpthalate as plasticizer. The performance characteristics of these electrodes, which were evaluated according to IUPAC recommendations, revealed a fast, stable and liner response for alfuzosin over the concentration ranges of 8.3 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-2) M, 3.8 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-2) M, 7.5 x 10(-7) to 1.0 x 10(-2) M AzCl with cationic slopes of 57.0, 56.0 and 58.5 mV/decade, respectively. The solubility product of the ion-pair and the formation constant of the precipitation reaction leading to the ion-pair formation were determined conductometrically. The electrodes, fully characterized in terms of composition, life span and usable pH range, were applied to the potentiometric determination of alfuzosin hydrochloride ion in different pharmaceutical preparations and biological fluids without any interference from excipients or diluents commonly used in drug formulations. The potentiometric method was also used in the determination of alfuzosin hydrochloride in pharmaceutical preparations in four batches with different expiration dates. Validation of the method showed suitability of the proposed electrodes for use in the quality control assessment of alfuzosin hydrochloride. This potentiometric method offers the advantages of high-throughput determination, simplicity, accuracy, automation feasibility, and applicability to turbid and colored sample solutions.",

        "abstract": "African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease are 3 neglected tropical diseases for which current therapeutic interventions are inadequate or toxic. There is an urgent need to find new lead compounds against these diseases. Most drug discovery strategies rely on high-throughput screening (HTS) of synthetic chemical libraries using phenotypic and target-based approaches. Combinatorial chemistry libraries contain hundreds of thousands of compounds; however, they lack the structural diversity required to find entirely novel chemotypes. Natural products, in contrast, are a highly underexplored pool of unique chemical diversity that can serve as excellent templates for the synthesis of novel, biologically active molecules. We report here a validated HTS platform for the screening of microbial extracts against the 3 diseases. We have used this platform in a pilot project to screen a subset (5976) of microbial extracts from the MEDINA Natural Products library. Tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that 48 extracts contain potentially new compounds that are currently undergoing de-replication for future isolation and characterization. Known active components included actinomycin D, bafilomycin B1, chromomycin A3, echinomycin, hygrolidin, and nonactins, among others. The report here is, to our knowledge, the first HTS of microbial natural product extracts against the above-mentioned kinetoplastid parasites.",

The identification of the proteins that a drug can bind is thus valuable for evaluating its side-effects. We established a system based on PDB database for screening for proteins a drug could bind. Firstly, all complexes in the PDB database were sorted by species; then, a ligand database was established by extracting ligands from the structure data files. Secondly, all proteins were clustered according to their sequence similarity with the protein originally bound with the ligand in PDB. To search the potential target proteins of a drug, the query drug structure is compared with all ligands in the database to obtain similar scores. Ligands with similar sores greater than a certain threshold were flagged. Protein clusters associating with these ligands would be considered as potential targets of the query drug. To test the reliability of this approach, three drugs from DrugBank were used to search for their binding proteins by our method. The results showed that all the corresponding target proteins were found. The method presented here was rapid, scalable and could be used for high efficient drug side-effects analysis.",

Secondary analysis: projection of the data, based on conservative assumptions, to indicate likely cost effectiveness at 10 years.\\n\\nSETTING: Four centres in the United Kingdom. Screening delivered in primary care settings with follow up and surgery offered in the main hospitals Participants: Population based sample of 67 800 men aged 65-74 years.\\n\\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality from and costs (screening, follow up, elective and emergency surgery) related to abdominal aortic aneurysm; cost per life year gained.\\n\\nRESULTS: Over four years there were 47 fewer deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysms in the screening group than in the control group, but the additional costs incurred were pound 2.2m. After adjustment for censoring and discounted at 6% the mean additional cost of the screening programme was pound 63.39 ($97.77, euro;100.48) (95% confidence interval pound 53.31 to pound 73.48) per patient. The hazard ratio for abdominal aortic aneurysm was 0.58 (0.42 to 0.78). Over four years the mean incremental cost effectiveness ratio for screening was pound 28 400 ( pound 15 000 to pound 146 000) per life year gained, equivalent to about pound 36 000 per quality adjusted life year. After 10 years this figure is estimated to fall to around pound 8000 per life year gained.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Even at four years the cost effectiveness of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms is at the margin of acceptability according to current NHS thresholds. Over a longer period the cost effectiveness will improve substantially, the predicted ratio at 10 years falling to around a quarter of the four year figure.",

        "abstract": "There is now a tremendous potential for the discovery of novel mechanism-based agents for the clinical management of cancer. These agents are being targeted to the cellular proteins and pathways that are causally involved with oncogenesis, cell proliferation, and disease progression. Combined with the out- put of the Human Genome Project, our increasing knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer will continue to provide a range of tractable targets for drug discovery. The application of new technologies, including functional genomics, combinato- rial chemistry, high throughput biological techniques, microar- ray analysis, and proteomics, will lead to a stream of innova- tive compounds for clinical evaluation. This chapter concentrates on the role of mechanism-based high-throughput screening (HTS) in contemporary drug discovery of small molecule ecule cancer drugs. During the last decade, HTS has rapidly developed into a technology-dependent scientific discipline that relies heavily on the use of miniaturized automated assays to achieve huge screening rates. Here we show how HTS has evolved to achieve these throughputs and we describe the most widely used technologies that have facilitated the use of highly miniaturized screens suitable for automation. These include scintillation proximity and fluorescent energy transfer assays that can be carried out in a completely homogeneous \u201cmix- and-measure\u201d format. The importance of the quality and di- versity of the compound libraries, whether derived from archiv- ing or combinatorial chemistry, is discussed. We also provide some examples of novel mechanism-based compounds that have been identified at least in part by a mechanism-based screening approach and that are currently being evaluated clin- ically as the post-genomic medicines of the future.",

        "title": "Virtual Screening of Drugs: Score Functions, Docking, and Drug Design",
        "abstract": "The computational approach for new drug design and/or identification, was initially proposed in mid 70\u2019s. The virtual screening of chemical libraries against a biological target has proven its reliability on structure-based drug design, for instance, for many HIV virus protein inhibitors and for the development of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase inhibitors. Tar- get-based virtual screening, allied to docking studies, enables searches on larger data set of probable ligands, with less costs than the traditional experimental screening. The increasing availability of small molecules databases and its free on- line distribution is now allowing not only pharmaceutical industries, but independent research labs as well, to apply this methodology on early stages of drug discovery. When the protein target structure is available, and a chemical virtual li- brary is accessible, following questions need to be answered: how the target and the ligand interact and how these interac- tions may be evaluated? Several docking algorithms for the identification of the molecular features responsible for bind- ing specificity are available. While such algorithms are very robust and accurate, the scoring functions remain more ques- tionable in the sense of what parameters should be considered when defining protein-ligand binding affinity when ranking candidates pointed-out by the virtual screening to the next step on drug testing. Aside conformational and chemical infor- mation, pharmacokinetics properties should be considered as well when selecting potential new drugs. Along with struc- tural well-match, appropriate molecular features that define desired kinetics characteristics should be consistently ad- dressed for usefulness of virtual screening results. The present review is focused on these questions and their implication for virtual screening.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the relationships between drugs and symptoms has broad medical consequences, yet a comprehensive description of the drug-symptom associations is currently lacking. Here, 1441 FDA-approved drugs were collected, and PCA was used to extract 122 descriptors which explained 91% of the variance. Then, a k-means++ method was employed to partition the drug dataset into 3 clusters, and 3 corresponding SVDD models (drug-likeness screening models) were constructed with an overall accuracy of up to 95.6%. Furthermore, 6878 herbal molecules from the TcmSP\u2122 database were screened by the above 3 SVDD model to obtain 5309 candidate drug molecules with highly accept classification of 77.19%. To assess the accuracy of the SVDD models, 8559 herbal molecule-symptom co-occurrences were mined from Pubmed abstracts, involving 697 herbal molecules and 314 symptoms. Most of the 697 herbal molecules could be found in the accepted SVDD data (5309 molecules), showing the potential of the SVDD for the screening of drug candidates. Moreover, a herbal molecule-herbal molecule network and a herbal molecule-symptom were constructed. Overall, the results provided a new drug-likeness screening approach independent to abnormal training data, and the comprehensive collection of herbal molecule-symptom associations formed a new data resource for systematic characterization of the symptom-oriented medicines.",

These advantages also pose new challenges to primary care pediatricians, both educationally and in response to the management of affected infants. Primary care pediatricians require immediate access to clinical and diagnostic information and guidance and have a proactive role to play in supporting the performance of the newborn screening system. Primary care pediatricians must develop office policies and procedures to ensure that newborn screening is conducted and that results are transmitted to them in a timely fashion; they must also develop strategies to use should these systems fail. In addition, collaboration with local, state, and national partners is essential for promoting actions and policies that will optimize the function of the newborn screening systems and ensure that families receive the full benefit of them.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Virtual screening (VS) has emerged as an important tool in identifying bioactive compounds through computational means, by employing knowledge about the protein target or known bioactive ligands. VS has appeared as an adaptive response to the massive throughput synthesis and screening paradigm as necessity has forced the computational chemistry community to develop tools that screen against any given target and/or property millions or perhaps billions of molecules in short period of time. AREAS COVERED: This editorial review attempts to catalog most commonly exercised VS methods, available databases for screening, advantages of VS methods along with pitfalls and technical traps with the aim to make VS as one of the most effective tools in drug discovery process. Finally, several case studies are cited where the VS technology has been applied successfully. EXPERT OPINION: In recent times, many successful examples have been demonstrated in the field of computer-aided VS with the objective of increasing the probability of finding novel hit and lead compounds in terms of cost-effectiveness and commitment in time and material. Despite the inherent limitations, VS is still the best option now available to explore a large chemical space.",

In this review, we document the evolution and maturation of VS from a rather exotic, stand-alone method toward a versatile hit and lead identification technology. VS campaigns have become fully integrated into drug discovery campaigns, evenly matched and complementary to high-throughput screening (HTS) methods. Here, we propose a novel classification of VS applications to help to monitor the advances in VS and to support future improvement of computational hit and lead identification methods. Several relevant VS studies from recent publications, in both academic and industrial settings, were selected to demonstrate the progress in this area. Furthermore, we identify challenges that lie ahead for the development of integrated VS campaigns.",

A brief, four-item screening instrument, called the rapid drug problems screen (RDPS), was developed from a similar instrument for alcohol use disorders, the rapid alcohol problems screen (RAPS). Performance of the RDPS was evaluated against DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for drug dependence and for dependence or abuse in a sample of 703 emergency department patients in Mexico City. Among males, sensitivity and specificity were 91 and 96%, respectively, for dependence and 93 and 96%, respectively, for dependence or abuse. Neither of the two females meeting diagnostic criteria for dependence or abuse were identified by the RDPS. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve indicates an optimum cut point of 1. The data suggest that the RDPS may hold promise as a brief screening instrument for substance use among males, but should be tested in larger populations of females meeting diagnostic criteria for drug use disorders, and across ethnic subgroups in other geographic locales. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The cell-induced regeneration of tissues and organs is achieved by making use of the tissue engineering technology or methodology.

The basic idea is to promote the cell proliferation and differentiation as well as the secretion of biological signal molecules for tissue regeneration from cells by gene transfection. For successful gene transfection and expression, it is important to develop drug delivery system (DDS) which allows a therapeutic gene to be delivered specifically to the target cell at an appropriate timing for a certain time period.

        "abstract": "Changes in technology can often affect society and models of industry. The broad expectations for 'genomics' that were highly publicized during the previous decade have not materialized at the rate predicted. However, with the completion of the human genome, it is now possible to identify individual subject DNA profiles using platforms that measure thousands of genetic variants simultaneously and at a diminishing cost. Genome-wide screening affects two important components for success of the pharmaceutical industry. The first is drug discovery with the identification and selection of the right target for a disease or medical indication. The second involves crucial decisions required during drug development, related to proof of efficacy sufficient enough to support the enormous cost commitment for drug development. Using Alzheimer's disease as an example, the combined application of genome-wide screening, candidate gene analyses and efficacy pharmacogenetics is presented. The drivers for the industry for an evolution of present drug development come from the economic and regulatory environments, each of which are changing. The anticipated successes are effective and safe medicines for unmet medical needs, with a framework for sustaining drug pipelines. \u00a9 2007 Informa UK Ltd.",

HCS has since evolved into an integrated solution for accelerated drug discovery by encompassing the workflow components of assay and reagent design, robust instrumentation for automated fixed-end-point and live cell kinetic analysis, generalized and specific BioApplication software (Cellomics, Pittsburgh, PA) modules that produce information on drug responses from cell image data, and informatics/bioinformatics solutions that build knowledge from this information while providing a means to globalize HCS throughout an entire organization.

Label-free MSI offers advantages over label-based assays, such as quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA), in the ability to simultaneously differentiate and monitor both drug and drug metabolites. Such discrimination is not possible by label-based assays if a drug metabolite still contains the radiolabel. Here, we present data exemplifying the advantages of MSI analysis.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the field of addiction, assessment of psychoactive substance use is a key element. Nevertheless, self-reports and clinical examination underestimate the use of psychoactive substances. The implementation of urine drug screening tests (UDS) should improve this assessment. While the diagnostic value of UDS is well demonstrated, the consequences of carrying out UDS on medical management have not been established. Our aim was to summarize the evidence pertaining to the efficacy of UDS for medical management. METHODS: A systematic review of clinical trials, quasi-randomized and observational studies was performed using PubMed, Cochrane database of systematic review, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, PsycINFO, National Institute on Drug Abuse, ISI Web of Science. The methodological quality was assessed with the score developed by Starrels et al.; the report quality using the CONSORT and the STROBE checklists. The main outcome was medical management or consequences of management for patients in terms of psychoactive substance consumption and its complications, be they medical, social or professional. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria: one randomized clinical trial, two quasi-randomized studies, one cohort, and four cross-sectional studies. The methodological quality was judged to be poor, with the exception of the randomized clinical trial (fair quality). The value of UDS in managing patients was not clearly indicated in these studies. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies, with poor quality, have assessed the value of UDS in managing patients using psychoactive substances; though with insufficiency to demonstrate the interest of carrying out UDS. Therefore, pragmatic intervention studies are necessary.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Bacterial riboswitches are structured RNA domains usually residing at the 5' untranslated region of messenger RNAs that can directly bind specific metabolites. They serve as logic gates regulating gene expression. As a result, riboswitches enable mRNAs to regulate their own expression without the need for any regulatory proteins. The first riboswitches were found just 10 years ago. Over the last decade, more than dozen different riboswitch classes were identified in many bacterial species, and their number is still growing. These findings indicate that bacteria widely use RNA switches to sense changes in cell physiology and to regulate metabolic pathways. Areas covered: The authors discuss the main mechanisms for riboswitch control of gene expression in bacteria. Various riboswitch classes were found in human bacterial pathogens to control the synthesis of essential cell metabolites as discussed in this review. Some riboswitches can be used as novel targets for antibacterial drug discovery. This review presents the current and possible future high-throughput screening approaches for targeting riboswitches in the process of drug development. Expert opinion: Bacterial riboswitches of 17 different classes are discovered in 36 human bacterial pathogens that can be targeted for addressing the ever-growing need for new antibiotics. In this regard, the adaptation of various in silico, in vitro, and in vivo high-throughput screening methods for probing specific RNA switches are crucial for the success of antibacterial drug discovery process.",

        "abstract": "Drug screening is a long and costly process confronted with low productivity and challenges in using animals, which limit the discovery of new drugs.\u00a0 To improve drug screening efficacy and minimize animal testing, recent efforts have been dedicated to developing cell-based high throughput screening (HTS) platforms that can provide more relevant  in vivo  biological information than biochemical assays and thus reduce the number of animal tests and accelerate the drug discovery process. Today, cell-based assays are used in more than half of all high-throughput drug screenings for target validation and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity) in the early stage of drug discovery. In this review, we discuss the uses of different types of cells and cell culture systems, including 2D, 3D and perfusion cell cultures, in cell-based HTS for drug discovery. Optical and electrochemical methods for online, non-invasive detection and quantification of cells or cellular activities are discussed. Recent progresses and applications of 3D cultures and microfluidic systems for cell-based HTS are also discussed, followed with several successful examples of using cell-based HTS in commercial development of new drugs. Finally, a brief discussion on potential applications of cell-based HTS for screening phytochemicals and herbal medicines is provided in this review.",

        "abstract": "Hair analysis in forensic and clinical toxicology has been strongly focused on drugs of abuse, and comprehensive, drug class-independent screening methods based on mass spectrometric detection have not been applied to date. In this study, a qualitative drug screening method by liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry, earlier developed and evaluated for forensic toxicological urine analysis, was adapted for screening of basic drugs in hair. The method included alkaline hydrolysis, purification with mixed-mode solid phase extraction, and analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry with automated data analysis and reporting. Identification was based on accurate mass, isotopic pattern fit, and retention time, if available. Analysis of 32 hair samples from deceased drug addicts revealed 35 different drugs. The drug classes identified included antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, amphetamines, opioids, beta-blockers, a benzodiazepine, a hypnotic, a local anesthetic, an antiemetic, and an antipyretic analgesic. The findings were in good agreement with the findings in blood and urine by other methods. Moreover, information about previous drug use not evident in the analysis of other matrices was obtained in the majority (72%) of the cases. Tramadol was an especially predominant finding, suggesting tramadol abuse as an opioid substitute. One apparent false-positive finding was identified. The mean and median mass accuracies of positive findings were 2.3 and 1.8 ppm, corresponding to 0.5 and 0.4 mDa, respectively. Cutoff values for tramadol and methamphetamine in hair were 100 and 200 pg/mg, respectively. The method proved to be a simple and straightforward tool for comprehensive screening of basic drugs in hair.",

This demand resulted in the use of cell-based screening as a method of choice in drug discovery. High content screening (HCS) is multiplexed, functional cell-based screening. HCS can be used in all aspects of drug discovery as an engine for driving lead discovery. The biological applications of HCS have been implemented in research in signaling, cell shape changes and toxicology. HCS has enabled an insight in the cellular effects of our clinical candidates in multiple cellular phenomena like dual reporter assay, subcellular target translocation and cellular morphology. Discovery of therapeutic protein and small molecule converge on diseases in therapeutic areas such neurological disorders and autoimmune diseases. HCS is used for assay development, primary, secondary screening and toxicology testing. In this chapter, the use of HCS assays in drug discovery is described and highlight the necessary step to set-up successfully these assays for screening.",

The authors describe a procedure in which multicellular spheroids are used to screen for compounds that induce tumor cell apoptosis. Multicellular spheroids were generated in 96-well plates, and apoptosis was determined using the M30-Apoptosense enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. A Z' factor of approximately 0.5 was observed for HCT116 colon carcinoma spheroids using staurosporine to induce apoptosis.

        "abstract": "The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (PDSP) is a resource that provides free screening of novel compounds to academic investigators. This program differs from other public-sector screening programs in that compounds are screened against a large panel of transmembrane receptors, channels, and transporters, a selection that currently includes a large portion of the whole neuro-receptorome. This review discusses the research areas that can profit from this resource, exemplified by recent findings. The first area is the identification of side effects of medications. Examples include the identification of the histamine H(1) receptor as being responsible for weight gain under antipsychotic treatment and the association of 5 HT(2B) receptor agonism with cardiac valvulopathy, which led to the removal of several medications. A second area is the identification of mechanisms of actions of medications and natural products. Examples are the finding that the kappa opioid receptor is the pharmacological target of the potent hallucinogen salvinorin A, that ephedrine and related compounds are not acting through direct sympathomimetic action, the identification of a strong dopaminergic action of WAY 100635, a compound that had been used as a selective 5 HT(1A) antagonist, and the discovery that the metabolite desmethylclozapine activates M(1) muscarinic receptors, an activity that might contribute to the clinical efficacy of the antipsychotic drug clozapine. A third, relatively new area is the identification of inert compounds as agonists for engineered designer receptors that no longer respond to their natural ligand (DREADDs) but exhibit unchanged signaling properties.",

        "abstract": "The liver plays a key role in fat metabolism, and excessive lipid accumulation in liver cells is characterised by a large spectrum of lesions, e.g., steatosis and phospholipidosis. Steatosis is increased lipid accumulation, mainly as triglycerides, in the liver, while phospholipidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder characterised by intracellular accumulation of phospholipids. These alterations can be induced by several factors, including exposure to certain drugs. Drug-induced steatosis is often reversible, and prolonged exposure to certain drugs can cause macrovacuolar steatosis, a benign hepatic lesion, that can evolve into steatohepatitis and cirrhosis in some patients. Some drugs may acutely induce microvesicular steatosis which, despite having a good short-term prognosis, can lead to chronic lipid peroxidation and to the development of steatohepatitis lesions with time. Over 50 marketed drugs have been reported to induce phospholipidosis in different tissues, including the liver. Although drug-induced phospholipidosis is often reversible and there is no definitive evidence for its toxicological implications, it is considered an adverse side finding by regulatory agencies. As developing new drugs is a complex, lengthy and expensive process that aims to identify pharmacologically active, low-toxicity drug candidates among closely related compounds, it could be advantageous to determine which drugs are able to induce lipid metabolic disorders in early developmental stages. To this end, in vitro predictive screening assays, particularly cell-based approaches in which many drug candidates are evaluated, have been developed to identify and rule out compounds with a strong liver steatosis and/or phospholipidosis-inducing potential.",

        "abstract": "The development of stents has been a major advancement over balloon angioplasty, improving vessel revascularization in obstructive coronary artery disease. The development of drug-eluting stents (DES) was the next breakthrough, designed to prevent the development of neointimal hyperplasia (restenosis) following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Several DES are currently in various stages of clinical development; these DES use different stent platforms, different antiproliferative drugs and different polymeric coatings that carry the drugs and control their delivery kinetics. Following DES implantation, when the entire drug is released, the polymeric coating is still retained on the stent and can influence subsequent tissue response and vascular healing. Therefore, the biocompatibility of the polymeric coatings is an important component of DES safety and needs to be thoroughly evaluated. Here we describe the development of a high-throughput screening platform for the evaluation of polymer biocompatibility, assaying whether a polymeric coating triggers inflammation in vascular cells. The data generated by these assays provides a structure-activity relationship (SAR) that can guide polymer chemists in polymer design. We have also applied this methodology to evaluate the components of a novel polymer system (BioLinx polymer system) designed in-house. In addition, we assayed other polymeric coatings similar to those currently used on various DES. The results of this evaluation reveal a remarkable correlation between polymer hydrophobicity and its ability to provoke inflammatory response.",

In the system, a tapered capillary connected with a syringe pump was used for multistep droplet manipulations. An oil-covered two-dimensional droplet array chip fixed in an x-y-z translation stage was used as the platform for cell culture and analysis. Complex multistep operations for drug combination screening involving long-term cell culture, medium changing, schedule-dependent drug dosage and stimulation, and cell viability testing were achieved in parallel in the semiopen droplet array, using multiple droplet manipulations including liquid metering, aspirating, depositing, mixing, and transferring. Long-term cell culture as long as 11 days was performed in oil-covered 500 nL droplets by changing the culture medium in each droplet every 24 h. The present system was applied in parallel schedule-dependent drug combination screening for A549 nonsmall lung cancer cells with the cell cycle-dependent drug flavopiridol and two anticancer drugs of paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil. The highest inhibition efficiency was obtained with a schedule combination of 200 nM flavopiridol followed by 100 \u03bcM 5-fluorouracil. The drug consumption for each screening test was substantially decreased to 5 ng-5 \u03bcg, corresponding to 10-1000-fold reductions compared with traditional drug screening systems with 96-well or 384-well plates. The present work provides a novel and flexible droplet-based microfluidic approach for performing cell-based screening with complex and multistep operation procedures.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The performance of cervical cancer (CC) screening can be improved by combining Pap smear with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing or visual methods, addressing local demographic, clinical and economic characteristics. OBJECTIVES: To examine the performance of standalone and combined screening tools in populations with variable prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and CC. METHODS: Merged data-sets from the Latin American Screening Study and New Independent States cohorts provided results for 15,000 women, screened using Pap smear, HPV testing and visual inspection with acetic acid, in Brazil, Argentina, Russia, Belarus and Latvia. Bayesian correction for verification bias was used. RESULTS: At CIN2+ cut-off, HPV detection alone was the most sensitive technique. There was an improvement (88.5% to 92.7%) in Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) sensitivity among women \u226535 years old. Using HPV detection alone was the least specific screening tool, regardless of the age group (69.9% [95% CI 66.5-72.8%] and 86.4% [95% CI 84.6-88.2%], in < or \u226535 years, respectively). Of the test combinations, Pap smear (LSIL threshold) with HC2 had the highest specificity (98.7%; 95% CI 98.3-99.0%). However, in women \u226535 years, the sensitivity of Pap alone was superior to that of the combination. CONCLUSIONS: The Pap test is a highly specific screening option in populations with medium-range CC prevalence. Combined testing for HPV in this scenario may yield slightly better positive predictive values in women \u226535 years of age with LSIL, but at a high incremental cost.",

        "abstract": "Background: People who consume unhealthy amounts of alcohol are more likely to use illicit drugs. We tested the ability of a screening test for unhealthy alcohol use to simultaneously detect drug use. Methods: Adult English speaking patients (n= 286) were enrolled from a primary care waiting room. They were asked the screening question for unhealthy alcohol use \"How many times in the past year have you had X or more drinks in a day?\", where X is 5 for men and 4 for women, and a response of one or more is considered positive. A standard diagnostic interview was used to determine current (past year) drug use or a drug use disorder (abuse or dependence). Oral fluid testing was also used to detect recent use of common drugs of abuse. Results: The single screening question for unhealthy alcohol use was 67.6% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.2-82.0%) and 64.7% specific (95% CI, 58.4-70.6%) for the detection of a drug use disorder. It was similarly insensitive for drug use detected by oral fluid testing and/or self-report. Conclusions: Although a patient with a drug use disorder has twice the odds of screening positive for unhealthy alcohol use compared to one without a drug use disorder, suggesting patients who screen positive for alcohol should be asked about drug use, a single screening question for unhealthy alcohol use was not sensitive or specific for the detection of other drug use or drug use disorders in a sample of primary care patients. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The squamous cell carcinoma HeLa cell line and an epithelial cell line hTERT-RPE with a nonmalignant phenotype were interrogated for HeLa cell selectivity in response to 1267 annotated compounds representing 56 pharmacological classes. Selective cytotoxic activity was observed for 14 of these compounds dominated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, which tended to span a representation of the chemical descriptor space of the library. The PDE inhibitors induced delayed cell death with features compatible with classical apoptosis. The PDE inhibitors were largely inactive when tested against a cell line panel consisting of hematological and nonsquamous epithelial phenotypes. In a genome-wide DNA microarray analysis, PDE3A and PDE2A were found to be significantly increased in HeLa cells compared to the other cell lines. The pathway analysis software PathwayAssist was subsequently used to extract a list of proteins and small molecules retrieved from Medline abstracts associated with the hit compounds. The resulting list consisted of major parts of the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway linking to ERK, P38, and AKT.

The value of virtual compound screening for drug discovery is often debated, in particular, given the large investments made in experimental high-throughput screening technologies. The current state-of-the-art in the VS field is discussed. Despite its limitations, VS applications have often succeeded in identifying novel hits including first-in-class active compounds and novel chemotypes. VS has its place in pharmaceutical research, but there is still much room for further improvements including method evaluation and drug discovery applications. The potential of VS is currently underutilized because its complementarity to high-throughput screening is not sufficiently exploited.

        "abstract": "There are no effective antivirals currently available for the treatment of flavivirus infection in humans. As such, the identification and characterization of novel drug target sites are critical to developing new classes of antiviral drugs. The flavivirus NS5 N-terminal capping enzyme (CE) is vital for the formation of the viral RNA cap structure, which directs viral polyprotein translation and stabilizes the 5' end of the viral genome. The structure of the flavivirus CE has been solved, and a detailed understanding of the CE-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and CE-RNA cap interactions is available. Because of the essential nature of the interaction for viral replication, disrupting CE-GTP binding is an attractive approach for drug development. The authors have previously developed a robust assay for monitoring CE-GTP binding in real time. They adapted this assay for high-throughput screening and performed a pilot screen of 46 323 commercially available compounds. A number of small-molecule inhibitors capable of displacing a fluorescently labeled GTP in vitro were identified, and a second functional assay was developed to identify false positives. The results presented indicate that the flavivirus CE cap-binding site is a valuable new target site for antiviral drug discovery and should be further exploited for broad-spectrum anti-flaviviral drug development.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) contribute significantly to patient morbidity and mortality, as well as to costs for healthcare systems. Our aim was to evaluate the type and incidence of ADRs in a paediatric hospital population, comparatively ascertained by two different methodological approaches. METHODS: Our prospective study enrolled all patients admitted to two of the general children wards (46 beds) and the paediatric intensive care unit (6 beds) at the HELIOS Klinikum Wuppertal teaching hospital in Germany, over the study period of 3 months. We used two methods to detect ADRs. The intensified surveillance system relied on a trained physician conducting ward rounds and assessing patient charts. The computer-assisted screening of pathological laboratory parameters used values slightly below or above the age-specific normal range as a trigger signal for a potential ADR, which was subsequently assessed by trained personnel. RESULTS: By applying both methods simultaneously we observed that 14.1% of children experienced an ADR while they were hospitalised and 2.7% of children were admitted to hospital because of the ADR. Intensified surveillance resulted in the detection of 101 ADRs in 11.9% of patients, predominantly presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms, skin and CNS disorders; computer-assisted screening identified 45 ADRs in 5.7% of patients, mainly with drug-induced blood dyscrasia and liver damage. Furthermore, the ADRs detected by the intensified method were more severe, affected younger children and showed a closer causal attributability to the reaction than the ADRs observed by the computerised method. The spectra of drugs involved were similar, with the anti-infectives being suspected most frequently. The sensitivities of the intensified surveillance system and the computerised surveillance screening came to 67.2% and 44.8%, respectively, with computer-assisted screening having a specificity of 72.8%. The mean positive predictive value of the pathological laboratory values under surveillance by computer-assisted screening was 18.6%. Approximately 25% of ADR-related drugs administered were used for off-label indications. CONCLUSION: Using the published literature for comparison, we found that ADRs occur as frequently in paediatric patients as in adult patients. Intensified surveillance and computerised surveillance applied in the paediatric setting show substantial differences in their detection specificities. A higher number of and more severe ADRs can be detected by intensified surveillance than by computerised surveillance, but require higher personnel resources.",

        "title": "Advantages of cell-based high-volume screening assays to assess nuclear receptor activation during drug discovery.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adverse drug effects and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can be elicited by the activation of several nuclear receptors (NRs). Of the NRs that regulate expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters and alter cellular processes, the most important are pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor and aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Screening for the activation of these receptors can be achieved during drug discovery by using various high-throughput analyses including ligand binding and transactivation assays.\\n\\nAREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the importance of screening for NR activation during drug discovery and includes a discussion of the various assays to evaluate activation of NRs by xenobiotics. It also describes screening for species-specific NR activation to attenuate the use of animals in toxicology studies and to identify complications associated with drug metabolism and clearance that may occur during pharmacokinetic analyses.\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: Given the potential for adverse drug effects and DDIs during all phases of drug elimination, NR screening should occur early in drug discovery. Such screening could be used in structure-activity relationship studies to guide chemists in altering compound structures to eliminate the NR-binding and activation properties on priority compounds. Early screening can also reduce the risk of adverse drug effects, identify novel therapeutic agents and decrease the number of animals used in drug development. Overall, performing these types of assays described here could decrease drug development costs, alleviate the liability associated with drugs that activate NR and prevent unsafe drugs from entering the marketplace.",

METHODS: A comprehensive drug screening was carried out in plasma or urine, or both, of 310 patients combining an HPLC multidrug profiling system and a fluorescence polarisation immunoassay. RESULTS: In 64.2% of cases the screening confirmed the diagnosis of drug poisoning, in 13.9% suspected drugs were measurable at non-toxic concentrations, and in 21.9% no drugs were found. The suspected drugs were fully confirmed in a minority of cases, (symptomatic patients: 28.2% compared with asymptomatic: 16.5%). Symptomatic patients were less likely to have at least one suspected drug (29.6% compared with 57.7%; p<0.001), and more likely to have at least one unsuspected drug found at analysis (17.4% compared with 3.1%; p = 0.005). In 5% of patients, asymptomatic when first observed, one or more unsuspected drugs were found. In 6 of 29 patients, with suspected poisoning of an unspecified drug, the screening identified the specific drug and excluded acute intoxication in the remaining cases. CONCLUSION: A rapid comprehensive drug screening adds to the diagnosis of patients with suspected drug poisoning, identifying unsuspected drugs in symptomatic patients and excluding drugs in asymptomatic subjects.",

        "abstract": "Many clinical and forensic toxicology laboratories establish criteria for identifying a random urine specimen submitted for drug screening as being \"normally concentrated\" or \"dilute\" by incorporating creatinine analysis and/or specific gravity measurement into their testing protocols. The objective of this study is to describe the importance of urine creatinine analysis and specific gravity measurements in the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) drug-testing program. The CSC program uses the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) creatinine cutoff value (20 mg/dL) mandated for workplace drug testing in the United States. In the CSC program, urine specimens must have a creatinine concentration <20 mg/dL and specific gravity value </=1.003 to be considered dilute. The CSC program also incorporates lower drug/drug metabolite screening and confirmation cutoff values (dilution protocol) for specimens that are administratively defined as dilute. Seventy-nine hundred and twelve urine specimens from 2000 to 2002 (6.8% of total workload) were defined as dilute. Twenty-six percent of all dilute specimens (n = 2054) screened positive for one or more drugs using the SAMHSA cutoff values. The screening-negative dilute specimens were taken through the dilution protocol scheme with lower screening cutoff values and confirmation cutoff concentrations at the lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) for each method. Over 1100 of the 5858 dilute urine specimens (18.8%) confirmed positive for one or more drugs in 2000 to 2002 when taken through the dilution protocol scheme. CSC workload is separated based on whether specimens are referred from institutions or from community settings (such as parolee programs). The positive rate for dilute specimens averaged 18.2% from CSC institutions and 22.3% from specimens collected from parolee specimens in 2000 to 2002. The drugs most often confirmed in dilute specimens from institutions were cannabinoids (annual positive rate ranged from 13.7 to 18%) and codeine and/or morphine (ranged from 0.2 to 2.8%). The drugs most often confirmed in dilute urine specimens from community settings in 2000-2002 were cannabinoids (annual positive rate ranged from 10.3 to 12.5%) and cocaine metabolite (ranged from 6.6 to 10.3%). In conclusion, one can reduce the false-negative rate for drugs of abuse in urine drug testing programs by incorporating lower screening and confirmation cutoff (eg, LLOQ) concentrations for dilute specimens that screen negative for drugs of abuse when using the SAMHSA mandated screening and confirmation cutoff concentrations.",

        "abstract": "This guidance describes how the FDA evaluates patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments used as effectiveness endpoints in clinical trials. It also describes our current thinking on how sponsors can develop and use study results measured by PRO instruments to support claims in approved product labeling (see appendix point 1). It does not address the use of PRO instruments for purposes beyond evaluation of claims made about a drug or medical product in its labeling. By explicitly addressing the review issues identified in this guidance, sponsors can increase the efficiency of their endpoint discussions with the FDA during the product development process, streamline the FDA's review of PRO endpoint adequacy, and provide optimal information about the patient's perspective of treatment benefit at the time of product approval. A PRO is a measurement of any aspect of a patient's health status that comes directly from the patient (i.e., without the interpretation of the patient's responses by a physician or anyone else). In clinical trials, a PRO instrument can be used to measure the impact of an intervention on one or more aspects of patients' health status, hereafter referred to as PRO concepts, ranging from the purely symptomatic (response of a headache) to more complex concepts (e.g., ability to carry out activities of daily living), to extremely complex concepts such as quality of life, which is widely understood to be a multidomain concept with physical, psychological, and social components. Data generated by a PRO instrument can provide evidence of a treatment benefit from the patient perspective. For this data to be meaningful, however, there should be evidence that the PRO instrument effectively measures the particular concept that is studied. Generally, findings measured by PRO instruments may be used to support claims in approved product labeling if the claims are derived from adequate and well-controlled investigations that use PRO instruments that reliably and validly measure the specific concepts at issue. The glossary defines many of the terms used in this guidance. In particular, the term instrument refers to the actual questions or items contained in a questionnaire or interview schedule along with all the additional information and documentation that supports the use of these items in producing a PRO measure (e.g., interviewer training and instructions, scoring and interpretation manual). The term conceptual framework refers to how items are grouped according to subconcepts or domains (e.g., the item walking without help may be grouped with another item, walking with difficulty, within the domain of ambulation, and ambulation may be further grouped into the concept of physical ability). FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended but not required.

The screening attrition rate in the current drug discovery protocols suggests that one marketable drug emerges from approximately one million screened compounds. This leads to pressure to screen larger libraries in order to continue the pipeline and to the development of High Throughput Screening. HTS is only a name for specific developments in laboratory automation to collect a large amount of experimental data in a relatively short time. HTS can test hundreds of thousands of compounds per day, however, if fewer compounds could be tested without compromising the probability of success, the cost and time would be greatly reduced. To that end, new developments in large-scale cell biology and compound library design in silico have evolved to obtain data with higher predictability of clinical efficacy.",

Although the traditional equilibrium dialysis method is well established and widely used for drug-protein binding measurement, this assay suffers from its low throughput. Recent efforts have been made in developing and implementing high throughput assays for drug-protein screening in drug discovery. The present review highlights high-throughput assays, as well as potential new approaches for drug-protein binding screening in drug discovery. These primarily include automated 96-well plate, sample pooling based equilibrium dialysis combined with LCMS, immobilized HSA column HPLC, and electrodriven techniques such as frontal analysis combined with capillary electrophoresis (FACE), and affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE). Fundamental drug-protein binding models are also discussed in order to (1) compare and discriminate HSA (human serum albumin) and AGP (alpha 1-acid glycoprotein) binding with regard to the whole plasma protein binding; and (2) elucidate the applicability of high throughput screening (HTS) from the viewpoint of a simplified binding model. Some strategies and recommendations are proposed in dealing with applications of high throughput assays in different situations.",

        "abstract": "Many drug discovery screening programs employ immortalized cells, recombinantly engineered to express a defined molecular target. Several technologies are now emerging that render it feasible to employ more physiologically, and clinically relevant, cell phenotypes. Consequently, numerous approaches use primary cells, which retain many functions seen in vivo, as well as endogenously expressing the target of interest. Furthermore, stem cells, of either embryonic or adult origin, as well as those derived from differentiated cells, are now finding a place in drug discovery. Collectively, these cells are expanding the utility of authentic human cells, either as screening tools or as therapeutics, as well as providing cells derived directly from patients. Nonetheless, the growing use of phenotypically relevant cells (including primary cells or stem cells) is not without technical difficulties, particularly when their envisioned use lies in high-throughput screening (HTS) protocols. In particular, the limited availability of homogeneous primary or stem cell populations for HTS mandates that novel technologies be developed to accelerate their adoption. These technologies include detection of responses with very few cells as well as protocols to generate cell lines in abundant, homogeneous populations. In parallel, the growing use of changes in cell phenotype as the assay readout is driving greater use of high-throughput imaging techniques in screening. Taken together, the greater availability of novel primary and stem cell phenotypes as well as new detection technologies is heralding a new era of cellular screening. This convergence offers unique opportunities to identify drug candidates for disorders at which few therapeutics are presently available.",

Pharmaceutical companies are discovering increasing numbers of both promiscuous drugs and drug targets. Hence, polypharmacology is now recognized as an important aspect of drug design. Here, we describe a new and fast way to predict polypharmacological relationships between drug classes quantitatively, which we call Gaussian Ensemble Screening (GES). This approach represents a cluster of molecules with similar spherical harmonic surface shapes as a Gaussian distribution with respect to a selected center molecule. Calculating the Gaussian overlap between pairs of such clusters allows the similarity between drug classes to be calculated analytically without requiring thousands of bootstrap comparisons, as in current promiscuity prediction approaches. We find that such cluster similarity scores also follow a Gaussian distribution. Hence, a cluster similarity score may be transformed into a probability value, or \"p-value\", in order to quantify the relationships between drug classes. We present results obtained when using the GES approach to predict relationships between drug classes in a subset of the MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) database. Our results indicate that GES is a useful way to study polypharmacology relationships, and it could provide a novel way to propose new targets for drug repositioning.",

For newcomers to the field of screening data management in particular, the problem is compounded by a lack of literature covering the practical aspects of managing screening data. The authors provide some practical advice based on their experience of using a commercially available software suite. They discuss issues ranging from the organizational aspects to examples of how the form and content of metadata can have a big impact on whether results can be easily queried, pivoted, and reported. It is also hoped that their experiences might provide an opportunity for reflection to data management practitioners operating in established environments.",

        "abstract": "Importance of the field: Osteoporosis affects nearly 100 million people in Europe, Japan and the US, and the number is increasing due to aging of the population. Preclinical efficacy studies performed according to regulatory guidelines are large, long and expensive, and there is a need for guidance and recommendations on how to perform preliminary studies prior to the regulatory studies. Areas covered in this review: We review research models that can be used for preclinical efficacy testing of new drug candidates for osteoporosis. Our focus is on testing compounds targeted to directly decrease osteoclastic bone resorption or increase osteoblastic bone formation. What the reader will gain: We provide an overview of in vitro bone cell culture systems and osteoporosis animal models useful for preclinical efficacy studies and a step-by-step approach on how the most interesting compound can be selected from thousands of drug candidates. Different approaches for testing anti-catabolic and anabolic compounds are provided. Take home message: Efficacy of new osteoporosis drug candidates can be first proven conveniently using in vitro bone cell cultures and then confirmed in short-term animal studies, followed by more extensive animal studies, and finally a regulatory study performed according to the guidelines of regulatory authorities.",

        "abstract": "The genomics revolution has unveiled a wealth of poorly characterized proteins. Scientists are often able to produce milligram quantities of proteins for which function is unknown or hypothetical, based only on very distant sequence homology. Broadly applicable tools for functional characterization are essential to the illumination of these orphan proteins. An additional challenge is the direct detection of inhibitors of protein-protein interactions (and allosteric effectors). Both of these research problems are relevant to, among other things, the challenge of finding and validating new protein targets for drug action. Screening collections of small molecules has long been used in the pharmaceutical industry as 1 method of discovering drug leads. Screening in this context typically involves a function-based assay. Given a sufficient quantity of a protein of interest, significant effort may still be required for functional characterization, assay development, and assay configuration for screening. Increasingly, techniques are being reported that facilitate screening for specific ligands for a protein of unknown function. Such techniques also allow for function-independent screening with better characterized proteins. ThermoFluor, a screening instrument based on monitoring ligand effects on temperature-dependent protein unfolding, can be applied when protein function is unknown. This technology has proven useful in the decryption of an essential bacterial enzyme and in the discovery of a series of inhibitors of a cancer-related, protein-protein interaction. The authors review some of the tools relevant to these research problems in drug discovery, and describe our experiences with 2 different proteins.",

The present investigation determined whether the DUSI-R's items can be aggregated into scales that implicate current and future psychiatric disorders. Scales were derived to screen for attention deficit, conduct, antisocial, anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders in a longitudinally tracked cohort of 328 boys. Evaluations were conducted when the boys were 12-14, 16, 19, and 22 years of age. All of the scales identified youths qualifying for current DSM-IV diagnosis with excellent accuracy. Predictive validity of the scales ranged from good to excellent. Accordingly cut-off scores were determined for each scale for use in practical settings to identify youths who require comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. Thus in addition to its utility for detecting problems that precede and correlate with substance abuse, the DUSI-R is cost-efficient for screening youths for mental disorders.",

        "abstract": "A method of assessing the risk of drug-drug interaction (DDI) caused by mechanism-based inhibition (MBI) was developed for early-stage drug development using cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibition screening data. CYP3A4 inhibition was evaluated using a fluorescent substrate with or without preincubation containing an inhibitor. The results showed that five well-known mechanism-based inhibitors, but not the competitive inhibitor ketoconazole, had lower IC(50) after preincubation, suggesting the utility of the IC(50) shift by preincubation to discern mechanism-based inhibitors. A method to approximately predict the change in the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of a co-administered drug by MBI was found using IC(50) shift data and the unbound mean plasma concentration of the inhibitor. From our predictions of change in the AUC for 38 drugs using this method, all mechanism-based inhibitors causing change in the AUC of more than 200% were predicted to be high risk. In conclusion, our method provides a simple assessment of the risk of DDI from mechanism-based inhibitors, especially in the early stages of drug development.",

        "abstract": "The mitochondrion plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism in eukaryotic cells. The electrochemical potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane is regulated to cope with cellular energy needs and thus reflects the bioenergetic state of the cell. Traditional assays for mitochondrial membrane potential are not amenable to high-throughput drug screening. In this paper, I describe a high-throughput assay that measures the mitochondrial membrane potential of living cells in 96- or 384-well plates. Cells were first treated with test compounds and then with a fluorescent potentiometric probe, the cationic-lipophilic dye tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM). The cells were then washed to remove free compounds and probe. The amount of TMRM retained in the mitochondria, which is proportional to the mitochondrial membrane potential, was measured on an LJL Analyst fluorescence reader. Under optimal conditions, the assay measured only the mitochondrial membrane potential. The chemical uncouplers carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone and dinitrophenol decreased fluorescence intensity, with IC(50) values (concentration at 50% inhibition) similar to those reported in the literature. A Z' factor of greater than 0.5 suggests that this cell-based assay can be adapted for high-throughput screening of chemical libraries. This assay may be used in screens for drugs to treat metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes, as well as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.",

Typically, these screening technologies are considered distinct approaches, as one is experimental and the other is theoretical in nature. However, given their similar tasks and goals, these approaches are much more complementary to each other than often thought. Various statistical, informatics and filtering methods have recently been introduced to foster the integration of experimental and in silico screening and maximize their output in drug discovery. Although many of these ideas and efforts have not yet proceeded much beyond the conceptual level, there are several success stories and good indications that early-stage drug discovery will benefit greatly from a more unified and knowledge-based approach to biological screening, despite the many technical advances towards even higher throughput that are made in the screening arena.",

Among them, IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction is a new target validated in recent years. Emergence of drug-resistant virus strains makes this target appealing to pharmacologists. Compared with the traditional screening methods such as AlphaScreen and cell-based screening developed for IN inhibitor discovery, virtual screening is a powerful technique in modern drug discovery. Here we summarized the recent advances of virtual-screening targeting IN-LEDFG/p75 interaction.

        "abstract": "Ion channels represent the third largest class of targets in drug discovery after G-protein coupled receptors and kinases. In spite of this ranking, ion channels continue to be under exploited as drug targets compared with the other two groups for several reasons. First, with 400 ion channel genes and an even greater number of functional channels due to mixing and matching of individual subunits, a systematic collection of ion channel-expressing cell lines for drug discovery and safety screening has not been available. Second, the lack of high-throughput functional assays for ion channels has limited their use as drug targets. Now that automated electrophysiology has come of age and provided the technology to assay ion channels at medium to high throughput, we have addressed the need for a library of ion channel cell lines by constructing the Ion Channel Panel (ChanTest Corp., Cleveland, OH). From 400 ion channel genes, a collection of 82 of the most relevant human ion channels for drug discovery, safety, and human disease has been assembled.Each channel has been stably overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 or Chinese hamster ovary cells. Cell lines have been selected and validated on automated electrophysiology systems to facilitate cost-effective screening for safe and selective compounds at earlier stages in the drug development process. The screening and validation processes as well as the relative advantages of different screening platforms are discussed.",

Such features lower quality of life for both patients and carers, and often result in transfer to residential care and higher costs. Currently, no drugs are licensed in the UK specifically for behavioural changes and psychological symptoms in patients with dementia. Nevertheless, antipsychotic medications have been used in people with dementia, both for psychotic symptoms and also for less specific problems such as agitation and aggression. There have been long-standing concerns about the inappropriate use of these drugs in such settings. In 2004, following worries over an increased likelihood of stroke with risperidone and olanzapine, the former UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) advised that these drugs \"should not be used for the treatment of behavioural symptoms of dementia\". However, this led to reports of unsuitable interpretation of the guidance, with groups of patients having their medication withdrawn inappropriately or being switched to other, potentially more harmful, drugs. Here we assess the safety of antipsychotic medication in people with dementia.;",

Conversely, impaired biosynthesis of H2S is associated with important diseases. This paves the way to exciting pharmacological perspectives for drugs acting on the \"H2S system\". Areas covered: This paper attempts to overview the most representative compounds acting as sources of exogenous H2S and are promising drugs for a number of serious disorders: hypertension, heart diseases, asthma, neurodegenerations, etc. Fewest H2S-releasing drugs have been evaluated in models of human diseases, with truly exciting results. Natural H2S-donors are also present in edible plants and the release of H2S accounts for the beneficial effects on the human health. A limited number of other compounds showing heterogeneous H2S-releasing moieties have been reported, but poorly characterized by pharmacological point of view. Expert opinion: The rate of H2S generation, the physicochemical characteristics and the bioavailability greatly affect the overall pharmacological profile of each H2S-releasing compound. Therefore, the development of widest collections of original moieties endowed with heterogeneous rates/mechanisms of H2S-release and a variety of physicochemical, biological and pharmacological features is the most timely and compelling issue in the field of H2S-based drug discovery.",

An internal ribosome entry site and neomycin resistance genes were placed upstream and next to the NS1 gene. The recombinant plasmids were propagated in a mammalian cell line. A stable cell line with the brightest green fluorescent protein and the highest viral protein and RNA expression was selected from six clones. The clone was then examined for effectiveness in an antiviral drug screening assay with compounds isolated from the local plants using two known antiviral agents as controls. Two novel flavones, PMF and TMF, were discovered having DENV-inhibitory properties. The data were validated by a conventional plaque titration assay.

        "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment can profoundly affect tumor cell survival as well as alter antitumor drug activity. However, conventional anticancer drug screening typically is performed in the absence of stromal cells. Here, we analyzed survival of myeloma cells co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) using an automated fluorescence microscope platform, ScanR. By staining the cell nuclei with DRAQ5, we could distinguish between BMSC and myeloma cells, based on their staining intensity and nuclear shape. Using the apoptotic marker YO-PRO-1, the effects of drug treatment on the viability of the myeloma cells in the presence of stromal cells could be measured. The method does not require cell staining before incubation with drugs, and less than 5000 cells are required per condition. The method can be used for large-scale screening of anticancer drugs on primary myeloma cells. This study shows the importance of stromal cell support for primary myeloma cell survival in vitro, as half of the cell samples had a marked increase in their viability when cultured in the presence of BMSC. Stromal cell-induced protection against common myeloma drugs is also observed with this method.",

Among them, biomolecular NMR has been used for structure determination of biomolecules and analyzing the interaction between a target protein and its inhibitors. In the context of fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), NMR has been known as a fragment screening technique, because NMR is good at detecting a weak binding compound in an accurate manner. Generally, the NMR technique for fragment screening is classified into two families: the ligand-based technique and the protein-based technique. The latter technique requires stable isotope labeled protein and also can be applied to a relatively small MW protein target. In the ligand-based technique such as saturation transfer difference (STD) and WaterLOGSY, only the NMR signals of the ligands are observed. The disadvantage of STD and WaterLOGSY is that the non-specific binding is also observed and a competition experiment is required in order to select the specific binding compound. Due to the difference in the consumption of the protein sample, the ligand-based technique has generally been used recently as a primary screening.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hSCCM)-based assays in the cardiovascular (CV) drug discovery sphere requires the development of improved systems for interrogating the rich information that these cell models have the potential to yield. We developed a new analytical framework termed SALVO (synchronization, amplitude, length, and variability of oscillation) to profile the amplitude and temporal patterning of intra- and intercellular calcium signals in hSCCM. SALVO quantified drug-induced perturbations in the calcium signaling \"fingerprint\" in spontaneously contractile hSCCM. Multiparametric SALVO outputs were integrated into a single index of in vitro cytotoxicity that confirmed the rank order of perturbation as astemizole > thioridazine > cisapride > flecainide > valdecoxib > sotalol > nadolol approximately control. This rank order of drug-induced Ca(2+) signal disruption is in close agreement with the known arrhythmogenic liabilities of these compounds in humans. Validation of the system using a second set of compounds and hierarchical cluster analysis demonstrated the utility of SALVO to discriminate drugs based on their mechanisms of action. We discuss the utility of this new mechanistically agnostic system for the evaluation of in vitro drug cytotoxicity in hSCCM syncytia and the potential placement of SALVO in the early stage drug screening framework.",

        "abstract": "Ion channels are attractive targets for drug discovery with recent estimates indicating that voltage and ligand-gated channels account for the third and fourth largest gene families represented in company portfolios after the G protein coupled and nuclear hormone receptor families. A historical limitation on ion channel targeted drug discovery in the form of the extremely low throughput nature of the gold standard assay for assessing functional activity, patch clamp electrophysiology in mammalian cells, has been overcome by the implementation of multi-well plate format cell-based screening strategies for ion channels. These have taken advantage of various approaches to monitor ion flux or membrane potential using radioactive, non-radioactive, spectroscopic and fluorescence measurements and have significantly impacted both high-throughput screening and lead optimization efforts. In addition, major advances have been made in the development of automated electrophysiological platforms to increase capacity for cell-based screening using formats aimed at recapitulating the gold standard assay. This review addresses the options available for cell-based screening of ion channels with examples of their utility and presents case studies on the successful implementation of high-throughput screening campaigns for a ligand-gated ion channel using a fluorescent calcium indicator, and a voltage-gated ion channel using a fluorescent membrane potential sensitive dye.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We propose three concepts of sensitivity in cancer screening and apply to data on prostate cancer. Conceptual entities: Sensitivity is the indicator on the ability of screening to find cancer in the detectable preclinical phase (DPCP). The ability is usually specified as to the screening test. We call this entity the test sensitivity. Test positivity with histological confirmation refers to the full diagnostic process and we call the corresponding entity as episode sensitivity. Ultimately, a screening programme identifies a proportion of cancers in the DPCP in the total target population, that we call programme sensitivity. We derive the formulae for these three sensitivities consistent with the incidence method. EXAMPLE: Our example on estimation of the three sensitivities is from a randomized screening trial for prostate cancer in Finland. The estimates by incidence method were substantially different, 85% for test sensitivity, 48% for episode sensitivity and 36% for programme sensitivity. CONCLUSION: More than one concept of sensitivity with standard method of estimation is needed to describe the ability of screening to identify the disease in the DPCP.",

        "abstract": "Ion channel dysfunction is known to underlie several acute and chronic disorders and, therefore, ion channels have gained increased interest as drug targets. During the past decade, ion channel screening platforms have surfaced that enable high throughput drug screening from a more functional perspective. These two factors taken together have further inspired the development of more refined screening platforms, such as the automated patch clamp platforms described in this article. Approximately six years ago, Nanion introduced its entry level device for automated patch clamping - the Port-a-Patch. With this device, Nanion offers the world's smallest patch-clamp workstation, whilst greatly simplifying the experimental procedures. This makes the patch clamp technique accessible to researchers and technicians regardless of previous experience in electrophysiology. The same flexibility and high data quality is achieved in a fully automated manner with the Patchliner, Nanion's higher throughput patch clamp workstation. The system utilizes a robotic liquid handling environment for fully automated application of solutions, cells and compounds. The NPC-16 chips come in a sophisticated, yet simplistic, microfluidic cartridge, which allow for fast and precise perfusion. In this way, full concentration response curves are easily obtained. The Port-a-Patch and Patchliner workstations from Nanion are valuable tools for target validation, secondary screening and safety pharmacology (for example hERG and Nav1.5 safety screening). They are widely used in drug development efforts by biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies, as well as in basic and applied biophysical research within academia.",

        "abstract": "Objectives\u2014Alcohol screening and brief interventions in medical settings can significantly reduce alcohol use. Corresponding data for illicit drug use is sparse. A Federally funded Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) service program, the largest of its kind to date, was initiated by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in a wide variety of medical settings. We compared illicit drug use at intake and six months after drug screening and interventions were administered. Design\u2014SBIRT services were implemented in a range of medical settings across six states. A diverse patient population (Alaska Natives, American Indians, African-Americans, Caucasians, Hispanics), was screened and offered score-based progressive levels of intervention (brief intervention, brief treatment, referral to specialty treatment). In this secondary analysis of the SBIRT service program, drug use data was compared at intake and at a six month follow-up, in a sample of a randomly selected population (10%) that screened positive at baseline. Results\u2014Of 459,599 patients screened, 22.7% screened positive for a spectrum of use (risky/ problematic, abuse/addiction). The majority were recommended for a brief intervention (15.9%), with a smaller percentage recommended for brief treatment (3.2%) or referral to specialty treatment (3.7%). Among those reporting baseline illicit drug use, rates of drug use at 6 month follow-up (4 of 6 sites), were 67.7% lower (p < 0.001) and heavy alcohol use was 38.6% lower (p < 0.001), with comparable findings across sites, gender, race/ethnic, age subgroups. Among persons recommended for brief treatment or referral to specialty treatment, self-reported improvements in general health (p < 0.001), mental health (p < 0.001), employment (p < 0.001), housing status (p < 0.001), and criminal behavior (p < 0.001) were found. Conclusions\u2014SBIRT was feasible to implement and the self-reported patient status at six months indicated significant improvements over baseline, for illicit drug use and heavy alcohol use, with functional domains improved, across a range of health care settings and a range of patients.",

        "abstract": "The 3-dimensional (3-D) pannus model for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is based on the interactive co-culture of cartilage and synovial fibroblasts (SFs). Besides the investigation of the pathogenesis of RA, it can be used to analyze the active profiles of antirheumatic pharmaceuticals and other bioactive substances under in vitro conditions. For a potential application in the industrial drug-screening process as a transitional step between 2-dimensional (2-D) cell-based assays and in vivo animal studies, the pannus model was developed into an in vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) assay. Using the CyBitrade mark-Disk workstation for parallel liquid handling, the main cell culture steps of cell seeding and cultivation were automated. Chondrocytes were isolated from articular cartilage and seeded directly into 96-well microplates in high-density pellets to ensure formation of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix (ECM). Cell seeding was performed automatically and manually to compare both processes regarding accuracy, reproducibility, consistency, and handling time. For automated cultivation of the chondrocyte pellet cultures, a sequential program was developed using the CyBio Control software to minimize shear forces and handling time. After 14 days of cultivation, the pannus model was completed by coating the cartilage pellets with a layer of human SFs. The effects due to automation in comparison to manual handling were analyzed by optical analysis of the pellets, histological and immunohistochemical staining, and real-time PCR. Automation of this in vitro model was successfully achieved and resulted in an improved quality of the generated pannus cultures by enhancing the formation of cartilage-specific ECM. In addition, automated cell seeding and media exchange increased the efficiency due to a reduction of labor intensity and handling time.",

        "abstract": "Novel fluorescent derivatives of serotonin have been synthesized and used as tracers for the development of a 5-HT2C fluorescence polarization assay. Serotonin analogs that feature a fluorescent probe attached through an ether linkage at the tryptamine 5-position have high affinity for the 5-HT2C receptor, and affinity is dependent on both linker length and pendent dye. These variables have been optimized to generate Cy3B derivative 5a, which has 10-fold higher 5-HT2C affinity relative to serotonin (Kd=0.23 nM). In receptor activation experiments, 5a acts as a full agonist of 5-HT2C. Upon binding to 5-HT2C cell membranes, 5a shows a robust increase in fluorescence polarization (FP) signal. In an FP binding assay using 5a as a tracer ligand, Ki values for known 5-HT2C agonists and antagonists showed excellent agreement with Ki values from radioligand binding (r2=0.93). The FP ligand assay is suitable for high-throughput drug screening applications with respect to speed of analysis, displaceable signal, precision, and sensitivity to various reagents. A 384-well-based high-throughput assay that is rapid, economical, and predictive of test compounds' ability to bind to the 5-HT2C receptor has been compiled and validated.",

However, related natural lines differentially expressing the therapeutic target of choice are rare. Here the authors report a strategy for drug screening employing isogenic human cell lines in which the expression of the target protein is regulated by a gene-specific engineered zinc-finger protein (ZFP) transcription factor (TF). To demonstrate this approach, a ZFP TF activator of the human parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTHR1) gene was identified and introduced into HEK293 cells (negative for PTHR1). Following induction of ZFP TF expression, this cell line produced functional PTHR1 protein, resulting in a robust and ligand-specific cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response. Reciprocally, the natural expression of PTHR1 observed in SAOS2 cells was dramatically reduced by the introduction of the appropriate PTHR1-specific ZFP TF repressor. Moreover, this ZFP-driven PTHR1 repression selectively eliminated the functional cAMP response invoked by known ligands of PTHR1. These data establish ZFP TF-generated isogenic lines as a general approach for the identification of therapeutic agents specific for the target gene of interest.",

However, 2D culture induces cellular characteristics different from tumors invivo, resulting in inefficient drug development. Here, we report an innovative high-throughput screening system using nanoimprinting 3D culture to simulate invivo conditions, thereby facilitating efficient drug development. We demonstrated that cell line-based nanoimprinting 3D screening can more efficiently select drugs that effectively inhibit cancer growth invivo as compared to 2D culture. Metabolic responses after treatment were assessed using positron emission tomography (PET) probes, and revealed similar characteristics between the 3D spheroids and invivo tumors. Further, we developed an advanced method to adopt cancer cells from patient tumor tissues for high-throughput drug screening with nanoimprinting 3D culture, which we termed Cancer tissue-Originated Uniformed Spheroid Assay (COUSA). This system identified drugs that were effective in xenografts of the original patient tumors. Nanoimprinting 3D spheroids showed low permeability and formation of hypoxic regions inside, similar to invivo tumors. Collectively, the nanoimprinting 3D culture provides easy-handling high-throughput drug screening system, which allows for efficient drug development by mimicking the tumor environment. The COUSA system could be a useful platform for drug development with patient cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "A whole cell high-throughput screening assay was developed and tested against > 2,000 structurally and functionally diverse drug-like small molecules to identify lead compounds capable of cell permeability and selective silencing of ErbB2 transcription. Screening employed reporter sublines clonally selected from ErbB2-negative MCF7 breast cancer cells after stable genomic integration of the ErbB2 proximal promoter driving a luciferase reporter; anti-ErbB2 activities (50% inhibitory concentration values) were compared to inhibition of control MCF7 sublines bearing integrated reporters driven by either a mutated ErbB2 promoter or the cyclin D1 promoter. Of the seven resulting lead compounds, four emerged from the National Cancer Institute (NCI)/ Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) Structural Diversity Set (NSC-131547, NSC-176328, NSC-259968, and NSC-321237); three others emerged from a panel of anticancer compounds with known mechanistic actions and included a minor groove DNA-binding antibiotic (NSC-58514, chromomycin A3), a hydroxamic acid inhibitor of histone deacetylases (NSC-709238, trichostatin A), and a tripeptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor (MG-132). For optimization, 58 scaffold analogs of the four NCI/DTP structural leads and nine functional analogs of the mechanistic leads were secondarily screened to identify seven compounds with comparable or superior activity relative to the leads, including an approved anticancer drug, PS-341 (bortezomib). PS-341 activity was validated against cultured ErbB2-positive breast cancer cell lines (SKBr3 and BT474) and a trastuzumab-resistant ErbB2-positive breast cancer xenograft model (B585), in which PS-341 antitumor activity correlated with selective down-regulation of ErbB2 mRNA and protein levels, confirming the ErbB2- silencing potential of proteasome inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Virtual screening methods are now widely used in early stages of drug discovery, aiming to rank potential inhibitors. However, any practical ligand set (of active or inactive compounds) chosen for deriving new virtual screening approaches cannot fully represent all relevant chemical space for potential new compounds. In this study, we have taken a retrospective approach to evaluate virtual screening methods for the leukemia target kinase ABL1 and its drug-resistant mutant ABL1-T315I. 'Dual active' inhibitors against both targets were grouped together with inactive ligands chosen from different decoy sets and tested with virtual screening approaches with and without explicit use of target structures (docking). We show how various scoring functions and choice of inactive ligand sets influence overall and early enrichment of the libraries. Although ligand-based methods, for example principal component analyses of chemical properties, can distinguish some decoy sets from active compounds, the addition of target structural information via docking improves enrichment, and explicit consideration of multiple target conformations (i.e. types I and II) achieves best enrichment of active versus inactive ligands, even without assuming knowledge of the binding mode. We believe that this study can be extended to other therapeutically important kinases in prospective virtual screening studies.",

        "title": "Cardiac Arrhythmia: In vivo screening in the zebrafish to overcome complexity in drug discovery.",
        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Cardiac arrhythmias remain a major challenge for modern drug discovery. Clinical events are paroxysmal, often rare and may be asymptomatic until a highly morbid complication. Target selection is often based on limited information and though highly specific agents are identified in screening, the final efficacy is often compromised by unanticipated systemic responses, a narrow therapeutic index and substantial toxicities. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Our understanding of complexity of arrhythmogenesis has grown dramatically over the last two decades, and the range of potential disease mechanisms now includes pathways previously thought only tangentially involved in arrhythmia. This review surveys the literature on arrhythmia mechanisms from 1965 to the present day, outlines the complex biology underlying potentially each and every rhythm disturbance, and highlights the problems for rational target identification. The rationale for in vivo screening is described and the utility of the zebrafish for this approach and for complementary work in functional genomics is discussed. Current limitations of the model in this setting and the need for careful validation in new disease areas are also described. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: An overview of the complex mechanisms underlying most clinical arrhythmias, and insight into the limits of ion channel conductances as drug targets. An introduction to the zebrafish as a model organism, in particular for cardiovascular biology. Potential approaches to overcoming the hurdles to drug discovery in the face of complex biology including in vivo screening of zebrafish genetic disease models. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: In vivo screening in faithful disease models allows the effects of drugs on integrative physiology and disease biology to be captured during the screening process, in a manner agnostic to potential drug target or targets. This systematic strategy bypasses current gaps in our understanding of disease biology, but emphasizes the importance of the rigor of the disease model.",

While numbers of excellent studies have used mammalian models to discover new compounds, the time and effort involved with screening large numbers of candidates is prohibitive. Cultured mammalian neurons are of often used to perform high through-put screens (HTS) however, cell culture lacks the organismal complexity involved in AD. To address these issues a number of researchers are turning to the round worm, C. elegans. C. elegans has numerous models of both Tau and Abeta induced toxicity; the two prime components observed to correlate with AD pathology. These models have lead to the discovery of numerous AD modulating candidates. Further, the ease of performing RNAi for any gene in the C. elegans genome allows for identification of proteins involved in the mechanism of drug action. These attributes make C. elegans well positioned to aid in the discovery of new AD therapies.",

Bioinformatics data mining of microbial genomes has revealed numerous previously unexploited essential open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown biochemical function. The potential of these proteins as screening targets is not readily apparent because most screening technologies rely on knowledge of biological function. To address this problem, the authors employed affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) to identify antimicrobial compounds that bound the novel target YihA. Screening a small-molecule library of 44,000 compounds initially identified 115 binders, of which 76% were confirmed. Furthermore, the ACE assay distinguished diverse compounds that possessed drug-like properties and antimicrobial activity against drug-resistant clinical isolates. These data validate ACE as a valuable tool for the fast, efficient detection of specific binding molecules that possess biological activity.",

Flux assays to detect functional ionic flux through ion channels are becoming increasingly popular as tools for screening compounds. In an optimized flux assay, modulation of ion channel activity may produce readily detectable changes in radiolabeled or nonradiolabeled ionic flux. Technologies based on flux assays are currently available in a fully automated high throughput format for efficient screening. This application offers sensitive, precise, and reproducible measurements giving accurate drug rank orders matching those of patch clamp data. Conveniently, the flux assay is amenable to adaptation for different ion channels, such as potassium, sodium, calcium, and chloride channels, by using suitable tracer ions. The nonradiolabeled rubidium-based flux assay coupled with the ion channel reader (ICR) technology has become very successful in ion channel activity analysis and is emerging as a popular technique in modern drug discovery.",

Techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance, surface plasmon resonance, and isothemal titration calorimetry, with their own pros and cons, have been employed for screening fragment libraries. As an alternative approach, screening based on high-performance liquid chromatography separation has been developed. In this work, we present weak affinity LC/MS as a method to screen fragments under high-throughput conditions. Affinity-based capillary columns with immobilized thrombin were used to screen a collection of 590 compounds from a fragment library. The collection was divided into 11 mixtures (each containing 35 to 65 fragments) and screened by MS detection. The primary screening was performed in <4 h (corresponding to >3500 fragments per day). Thirty hits were defined, which subsequently entered a secondary screening using an active site-blocked thrombin column for confirmation of specificity. One hit showed selective binding to thrombin with an estimated dissociation constant (K (D)) in the 0.1 mM range. This study shows that affinity LC/MS is characterized by high throughput, ease of operation, and low consumption of target and fragments, and therefore it promises to be a valuable method for fragment screening.",

Validation of the in vitro systems is still in a rather elementary stage, but some tentative conclusions about their performance for predicting various important in vivo characteristics of drugs can be attempted. So far, prediction of drug-drug interactions on the basis of in vitro screens has been advanced to a relatively reliable level. Prediction of other important characteristics, such as metabolic stability and consequent half-life and dosage schedule, or induction potential, is less reliable. Although metabolite profiles and participating enzymes are predicted quite accurately with advanced analytical techniques, an important problem here is the lack of reliable methods to detect reactive metabolites or products, which may be of significance regarding toxicity.",

HTS primarily uses two basic approaches, cell-based and in vitro target-directed screening. Both of these approaches have problems; for example, cell-based screening does not reveal the target or targets that are hit, whereas in vitro methodologies lack a cellular context. Furthermore, both can be technically challenging, expensive, and difficult to miniaturize for ultra-HTS [(u)HTS]. The application of yeast-based systems may overcome some of these problems and offer a cost-effective platform for target-directed screening within a eukaryotic cell context. Here, we review the advantages and limitations of the technologies that may be used in yeast cell-based, target-directed screening protocols, and we discuss how these are beginning to be used in NTD drug discovery.",

Hierarchical combination of ligand and structure-based virtual screening approaches has received noteworthy success in numerous drug discovery campaigns. In hierarchical virtual screening, several filters using ligand and structure-based approaches are sequentially applied to reduce a large screening library to a number small enough for experimental testing. In this review, we focus on different hierarchical virtual screening strategies and their application in the discovery of small molecule modulators of important drug targets. Several virtual screening studies are discussed to demonstrate the successful application of hierarchical virtual screening in small molecule drug discovery.",

The fact that these complexes may display differential pharmacology through, for example, the formation of a new binding pocket or signalling properties, as well as different functions or regulation in physiological tissues, offers novel opportunities for drug discovery. As a consequence, it seems necessary to develop new approaches suitable for GPCR heterodimer identification and selective ligand screening. Areas covered in this review: This review gives an overview of new strategies that have been developed in an effort to incorporate the possibilities added by GPCR hetero-oligomerisation on the screening of compounds as drug candidates. What the reader will gain: The reader will gain a wider knowledge about how the current understanding of GPCR oligomeric structure and function has mandated that hetero-oligomeric receptors must be considered as novel targets in the identification of future lead compounds. Take home message: For the improvement of novel drug discovery, more structural and functional information on the process of receptor oligomerisation is needed, and the realisation that the function of GPCRs can be greatly influenced by other interacting receptors or proteins also demands consideration in the lead-compound developing process in order to achieve better therapeutic agents.",

Formulations were prepared and SMEDDS formulations were chosen by the HTFS system. A HS with the largest number of SMEDDS formulations was selected. In the selected HS system, a LS with the largest number of SMEDDS formulations was selected. Formulations with minimum turbidity at each ratio of the selected HS/LS were chosen as optimized formulations.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 2455 formulations were prepared and SMEDDS formulations were selected using the HTFS system. From the screening data, HCO60 was selected as a superior emulsifiable HS, and Plurol (PLUROL OLEIQUE CC497) was selected as a suitable LS to HCO60. Five optimized formulations were chosen from the HCO60/Plurol system. The formulations formed fine microemulsions (<33.6 nm) without phase separation and drug precipitation. These formulation designs were conducted using 600 mg of the drug at a rate of 400 formulations/person/day.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: SMEDDS formulations could be rapidly and efficiently designed using the HTFS system.",

        "abstract": "High-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screening has opened up a path to investigating functional genomics in a genome-wide pattern. However, such studies are often restricted to assays that have a single readout format. Recently, advanced image technologies have been coupled with high-throughput RNAi screening to develop high-content screening, in which one or more cell image(s), instead of a single readout, were generated from each well. This image-based high-content screening technology has led to genome-wide functional annotation in a wider spectrum of biological research studies, as well as in drug and target discovery, so that complex cellular phenotypes can be measured in a multiparametric format. Despite these advances, data analysis and visualization tools are still largely lacking for these types of experiments. Therefore, we developed iScreen (image-Based High-content RNAi Screening Analysis Tool), an R package for the statistical modeling and visualization of image-based high-content RNAi screening.

        "abstract": "Although advancements in the preventive and therapeutic strategies of cardiac diseases have successfully improved the prognosis of many types of cardiac diseases, they are still challengeable targets because of their high mortality and large medical expenses. Moreover, because heart function is tightly associated with quality of life, it is important to elucidate the genetic and molecular basis of disease progression. One of the recent advances for assessing protein function is reverse chemical genetics, which has the advantages that complement classical reverse genetics and should advance efforts at drug discovery for many diseases. Toward that end an appropriate biological assay system is required to describe specific heart phenotypes. Recent studies have shown that many aspects of Drosophila heart development and function are similar to those observed in the human heart, making Drosophila a useful model system with the advantage of a simpler genetic organization and shorter life span. Here we describe several assay systems that can be used to characterize Drosophila heart function. The first method is an external electrical pacing assay that is used to assess the response to stress in the adult fly. The incidence of pacing-induced heart dysfunction measured by this method strongly correlates with natural aging and mutation in genes known to be involved in human cardiac dysfunction. Consequently, this method can be used to identify unapparent heart failure phenotypes. This procedure is applicable for both genetic and pharmacological screening. The second method is an image-based heart performance assay. This method provides details of the dynamics of heart contraction in real time similar to clinical echocardiography. This method may be used for secondary drug screening as well as for more detailed analysis of the genetic and pharmacological phenotypes of Drosophila hearts.",

        "abstract": "The Brazilian translation of the Drug Use Screening Inventory (DUSI) was applied to 213 Brazilian teenagers who were classified according to their alcohol and/or drug dependence level (DSM-III-R) as: 71 nondrug users (Group 1), 71 with light/moderate dependence (Group 2) and 71 with severe dependence (Group 3). The DUSI was applied and the absolute density in each of 10 areas was calculated. The three groups presented statistically significant differences (p < .001) in the 'substance use' area, with the following values (medians ?? interquartile range): Group 1: 0 ?? 7; Group 2: 20 ?? 33 and Group 3: 80 ?? 33. The groups also presented significant differences in behavior pattern, social competency, family system, work adjustment, peer relationships and leisure/recreation. Other differences detected among the groups indicated an important relationship between drug use and school delay. A good Spearman rank correlation (0.86, p < .0001) was observed between Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) diagnosis and DUSI, indicating that this instrument can be useful in the screening of substance use among Brazilian teenagers.

        "abstract": "Tankyrase, a member of human PARP protein superfamily, catalyzes a covalent post-translational modification of substrate proteins. This modification, poly(ADP-ribos)ylation, leads to changes in protein interactions and modifies downstream signaling events. Tankyrase 1 is a potential drug target due to its functions in telomere homeostasis and in Wnt signaling. We describe here optimization and application of an activity-based homogenous assay for tankyrase inhibitors in a high-throughput screening format. The method measures the consumption of substrate by the chemical conversion of the remaining NAD(+) into a stable fluorescent condensation product. Conditions were optimized to measure the enzymatic auto-modification of a recombinant catalytic fragment of tankyrase 1. The fluorescence assay is inexpensive, operationally easy and performs well according to the statistical analysis (Z'= 0.7). A validatory screen with a natural product library confirmed suitability of the assay for finding new tankyrase inhibitors. Flavone was the most potent (IC(50)=325 nM) hit from the natural compounds. A flavone derivative, apigenin, and isopropyl gallate showed potency on the micromolar range, but displayed over 30-fold selectivity for tankyrase over the studied isoenzymes PARP1 and PARP2. The assay is robust and will be useful for screening new tankyrase inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "A penalized expectation of determinant (ED)-optimal design with a discrete parameter distribution was used to find an optimal experimental design for assessment of enzyme kinetics in a screening environment. A data set for enzyme kinetic data (V(max) and K(m)) was collected from previously reported studies, and every V(max)/K(m) pair (n = 76) was taken to represent a unique drug compound. The design was restricted to 15 samples, an incubation time of up to 40 min, and starting concentrations (C(0)) for the incubation between 0.01 and 100 muM. The optimization was performed by finding the sample times and C(0) returning the lowest uncertainty (S.E.) of the model parameter estimates. Individual optimal designs, one general optimal design and one, for laboratory practice suitable, pragmatic optimal design (OD) were obtained. In addition, a standard design (STD-D), representing a commonly applied approach for metabolic stability investigations, was constructed. Simulations were performed for OD and STD-D by using the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation, and enzyme kinetic parameters were estimated with both MM and a monoexponential decay. OD generated a better result (relative standard error) for 99% of the compounds and an equal or better result [(root mean square error (RMSE)] for 78% of the compounds in estimation of metabolic intrinsic clearance. Furthermore, high-quality estimates (RMSE < 30%) of both V(max) and K(m) could be obtained for a considerable number (26%) of the investigated compounds by using the suggested OD. The results presented in this study demonstrate that the output could generally be improved compared with that obtained from the standard approaches used today.",

Methods: Six hundred and fifty-five Brazilian students (5th to 11th graders) from a public school of S??o Paulo participated in the study. One third of them were instructed to put their names on the questionnaire, one third answered it anonymously and the remaining ones were partially identified according to a code list that was kept by one student who represented his classmates. The answers of the identified groups of students were compared with those from the anonymous group. According to their scores in the Lie Scale, the students were divided into two groups: low and high score groups. Results and conclusions: No significant differences were found among anonymous, identified and partially identified groups regarding alcohol or drug consumption report, or in the density of problems in all drug use screening inventory (DUSI) areas. Regarding the Lie Scale, the high score group reported lower alcohol or drug consumption and fewer alcohol or drug related problems in all DUSI areas when compared to the low score group. The results suggest that identification or anonymity does not affect the students' answers to the DUSI and point out the usefulness of the Lie Scale of DUSI-R. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Some studies have adapted this assay for use in monitoring enzymatic reactions and have suggested its potential use in high throughput screening (HTS). With the increasing availability of laboratory automation, some studies are starting to explore the possibility of conducting limited, semi-automated versions of the assay. Here we report the optimization and complete adaptation of the malachite green assay to a fully automated, HTS platform that can be performed unattended with standard, commercially available, automated liquid-handling systems. The assay is universal for the majority of enzymes that release phosphate or pyrophosphate. Moreover, the assay is fully scalable from smaller drug screening efforts ( approximately 20,000 wells per day) to ultra-high throughput environments ( approximately 200,000 wells per day). The assay uses cost-effective, commercially available reagents, and can be used to perform automated IC50 value and kinetic parameter determination. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the assay via the initial, primary screening of 100,080 compounds against two target enzymes from Bacillus anthracis, O-succinylbenzoyl-CoA synthetase and nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase.",

        "abstract": "Background: Co-occurring drug use disorders are under-detected in psychiatrically ill populations highlighting the need for more efficient screening tools. Objectives: This study compares a single-item screening tool, previously validated in a primary care setting, to the 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) for identifying co-occurring drug use disorders among patients with severe psychiatric illness. Methods: A total of 395 patients attending a psychiatric partial hospital program completed both the single-item screen and DAST-10. A subsample of consecutive patients ( n = 67) was also administered the Structure Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) as a diagnostic reference standard. Results: Concordance between screening measures was moderate (\u03ba = 0.4, p < 0.01). Sensitivity and specificity of the single-item screen and DAST-10 as compared to the SCID-IV were comparable, while area under the receiver operating curve showed better discriminatory power for the identification of drug use disorders with the single-item screen. Conclusions: In comparison to the DAST-10, the single-item screen appears to be a more efficient tool to identify co-occurring drug use disorders in a psychiatric treatment setting among patients with a range of psychiatric diagnoses.

        "abstract": "Since the cloning of its first member in 1998, transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels have become one of the most studied ion channel families in drug discovery. These channels, almost all calcium permeant, have been studied in many different (patho)-physiological and therapeutic areas as diverse as pain; neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and inflammatory diseases; and cancer. At the same time, implementation of automated electrophysiology screening platforms has significantly increased the tractability of ion channels, mainly voltage gated, as drug targets. The work presented in this article shows the design and validation of TRP screening assays using the IonWorks Quattro platform (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), allowing a significant increase in throughput to support drug discovery programs. This new player has a direct impact on resources and timelines by prioritizing potential candidates and reducing the number of molecules requiring final testing by manual patch-clamp, which is still today the gold standard technology for this challenging drug target class.",

        "abstract": "The in vitro pharmacological profiling of drugs using a large panel of cloned receptors (e.g., G protein-coupled receptors, ligand-gated ion channels, Na(+)-dependent monoamine transporters), an approach that has come to be known as 'receptorome screening', has unveiled novel molecular mechanisms responsible for the actions and/or side effects of certain drugs. For instance, receptorome screening has been employed to uncover novel molecular targets involved in the actions of antipsychotic medications and the hallucinogenic mint extract salvinorin A. This review highlights the recent application of receptorome screening to discover why the anorexigen fenfluramine causes serious cardiopulmonary side effects. Receptorome screening has implicated N-deethylation of fenfluramine and serotonin 5-hydroxy-t-ryptamine 2B receptors in the adverse effects of the drug; subsequent studies corroborated this finding. The results discussed highlight the utility of determining the potential activity of drugs -- and, importantly, of their in vivo metabolites -- at as many molecular targets as possible in order to reliably predict side effect profiles. Receptorome screening represents one of the most effective methods for identifying potentially serious drug-related side effects at the preclinical stage, thereby avoiding significant economic and human health consequences.",

        "abstract": "The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) is a randomized multicenter study comparing low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) with chest radiography in the screening of older current and former heavy smokers for early detection of lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Five-year survival rates approach 70% with surgical resection of stage IA disease; however, more than 75% of individuals have incurable locally advanced or metastatic disease, the latter having a 5-year survival of less than 5%. It is plausible that treatment should be more effective and the likelihood of death decreased if asymptomatic lung cancer is detected through screening early enough in its preclinical phase. For these reasons, there is intense interest and intuitive appeal in lung cancer screening with low-dose CT. The use of survival as the determinant of screening effectiveness is, however, confounded by the well-described biases of lead time, length, and overdiagnosis. Despite previous attempts, no test has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality, an endpoint that circumvents screening biases and provides a definitive measure of benefit when assessed in a randomized controlled trial that enables comparison of mortality rates between screened individuals and a control group that does not undergo the screening intervention of interest. The NLST is such a trial. The rationale for and design of the NLST are presented.\u00a9 RSNA, 2010Clinical trial registration no.

        "abstract": "The proteasome is a new, interesting target in cancer drug therapy, and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has shown an effect in myeloma patients. It is of interest to efficiently discover and evaluate new proteasome inhibitors. The authors describe the development of an image-based screening assay for the identification of compounds with proteasome-inhibiting activity. The stably transfected human embryo kidney cell line HEK 293 ZsGreen Proteasome Sensor Cell Line expressing the ZsProSensor-1 fusion protein was used for screening and evaluation of proteasome inhibitors. Inhibition of the proteasome leads to accumulation of the green fluorescent protein ZsGreen, which is measured in the ArrayScan High Content Screening system, in which cell morphology is studied simultaneously. When screening the LOPAC(1280) substance library, several compounds with effect on the proteasome were found; among the hits were disulfiram and ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC). Cytotoxic analysis of disulfiram and PDTC showed that the compounds induced cytotoxicity in the myeloma cell line RPMI 8226. The average Z' value for the assay was 0.66. The results indicate that the assay rapidly identifies new proteasome-inhibiting substances, and it will be further used as a tool for image-based screening of other chemically diverse compound libraries.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the FDA guidelines for studies to be performed to rule out potential cardiac toxicity, many drugs have nevertheless entered the market only to be later withdrawn from the market owing to cardiac toxicity. Cardiac toxicity may result from drugs causing impaired function or death of cardiomyocytes, valvular damage, myocardial ischemia and/or ventricular arrhythmias. Negative cardiovascular events have been implicated in 28% of drug withdrawals in the USA. The significance for patients, regulators and the pharmaceutical industry is immense. OBJECTIVE: We address whether a more rigorous and integrative approach is needed for cardiovascular safety screening of all new drug candidates. Furthermore, we will present a cardionomics approach that looks at several in vitro and in vivo models that can be applied to all drugs independent of category, therapeutic area or class. METHODS: We present examples of drugs demonstrating cardiac toxicity and provide an in-depth review of how calcium homeostasis may be a unifying theme in clinically observed cardiotoxic events. We introduce a cardionomics approach that detects clinical cardiac toxicity early in the drug discovery process, thus, preventing costly late attrition. CONCLUSION: The consequences of a failure to detect potential cardiovascular safety issues before clinical launch can have an enormous cost for the pharmaceutical industry, when major drugs are withdrawn due to lawsuits as well as loss of time and resources. An integrated cardionomics approach may reduce the risk of drug withdrawals as a result of unexpected clinical cardiac safety issues.",

        "abstract": "The increasing awareness and the rising importance of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in the pharmacokinetics of drugs have evoked a need to develop more powerful tools for studying the role of UGTs in the metabolism of drug candidates. To this end, we have developed a fluorescent high-throughput screening assay for screening potential inhibitors and/or substrates for recombinant human UGTs-here, for the UGT1A6. The assay is based on the increase in fluorescence intensity when 1-naphthol is glucuronidated. The formation of the highly fluorescent product, 1-naphthylglucuronide, is followed at excitation wavelengths of 295 and 300 nm with fixed emission (335 nm) in real time directly from the reaction mixture. A probe concentration of 5 \u03bcM with 2.5 \u03bcg of total protein in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide resulted in optimal linearity and acceptable signal separation (signal-to-base, 3.0) for the probe reaction. The interactions of test compounds with the enzyme are detected as lower rate of 1-naphthylglucuronide formation and thus lower rate of fluorescence increase. The success of the assay was first demonstrated with the known UGT1A6 substrates 4-hydroxyindole and scopoletin (Z' factor \u22650.5) and later with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and salicylate derivatives. Diclofenac, 5-methylsalicylic acid, 5-bromosalicylic acid, 5-chlorosalicylic acid, and 5-fluorosalicylic acid decreased the probe glucuronidation rate at 500\u2009\u03bcM by >50%. Further, the results gained with the high-throughput screening assay correlated well with the results obtained, in parallel, with the reference high-performance liquid chromatography method.",

        "title": "Acceleration of the drug discovery process: A combinatorial approach using NMR spectroscopy and virtual screening",
        "abstract": "The continued implementation of NMR-based approaches in hit-through-lead drug discovery in academic and corporate settings is founded upon NMR applications that assess structure activity relationships. A very recent application of NMR spectroscopy to these discovery initiatives involves fraganomics, in which NMR is used to iteratively \"guide\" the assembly of several weakly interacting fragments or small molecules through chemical links. Moreover, several groups have recently reported the potential of integrating NMR spectroscopy with in silico, virtual screens of large chemical repositories possessing diverse collections of small molecules. Importantly an improved understanding of the intermolecular forces that mediate protein-protein/protein-ligand interactions has been integral to improving these virtual screening approaches, resulting in the identification of novel ligands for several therapeutic targets. Recent success of these structure-based discovery initiatives in targeting protein-protein interactions that are responsible for the non-covalent assembly and/or regulation of macromolecular complexes and are a critical paradigm in many disease pathologies will be discussed. The atomic details of these requisite interactions are the cornerstone of NMR and crystallographic \"structure-guided\", drug discovery initiatives aimed at disrupting complex formation. This review will predominantly focus on the recent advances in structure based computational screening approaches, highlighting the successful integration of in silico virtual screens with NMR-based techniques. The application of this powerful, combinatorial approach for the evaluation of well-characterized target space as well as its application to unique chemical space such as the protein-protein interaction inhibition (2P2I) that has recently been shown to be tractable to small molecule intervention will be discussed. \u00a9 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

Despite this, there are low rates of detection of co-occurring disorders across alcohol and other drug (AOD) services within Australia. This paper describes the development, implementation and evaluation of a mental health screening tool and training programme within the youth AOD sector. Thirty youth AOD workers received training in mental health screening, and the screening tool was subsequently piloted on 84 young people accessing two youth AOD services. Training was evaluated using measures of the trainee's mental health knowledge, attitudes, skills and confidence in mental health screening at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Feedback from young people supported the feasibility, acceptability and relevance of the screening tool. Evaluation of the associated training programme indicated improvements in AOD workers' mental health knowledge, skills and confidence in mental health screening. These findings provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility and acceptability of the mental health screening tool to young people and the effectiveness of the training package within the youth AOD sector.",

Methods such as differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and differential static light scattering (DSLS) have been employed in the 384-well format and have been useful in identifying ligands that promote crystallization and 3D structure determination of proteins. However, finding a generic method that is applicable to membrane proteins has been a challenge as the high hydrophobicity of membrane proteins and the presence of detergents essential for their solubilization interfere with fluorescence-based detections. Here the authors used MsbA (an adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter), CorA (a Mg++ channel), and CpxA (a histidine kinase) as model proteins and show that DSLS is not sensitive to the presence of detergents or protein hydrophobicity and can be used to monitor thermodenaturation of membrane proteins, assess their stability, and detect ligand binding in a 384-well format.

        "abstract": "The Bliss independence model is widely used to analyze drug combination data when screening for candidate drug combinations. The method compares the observed combination response (YO ) with the predicted combination response (YP ), which was obtained based on the assumption that there is no effect from drug-drug interactions. Typically, the combination effect is declared synergistic if YO is greater than YP . However, this method lacks statistical rigor because it does not take into account the variability of the response measures and can frequently cause false-positive claims. In this article, we introduce a two-stage response surface model to describe the drug interaction across all dose combinations tested. This new method enables robust statistical testing for synergism at any dose combination, thus reducing the risk of false positives. The use of the method is illustrated through an application describing statistically significant \"synergy regions\" for candidate drug combinations targeting epidermal growth factor receptor and the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor.",

Positive scores were given for higher measured biological activities, for testing negative in toxicity-related literature, and for good overlap when profiled against drug-related properties. Particular emphasis is placed on estimating aqueous solubility to prioritize in vivo experiments. This empirical scheme is given as an illustration to assist the decision-making process in selecting chemotypes and individual compounds for further experimentation, when confronted with multiple hits from high-throughput experiments.

More recently, these activities have also been embraced by the academic community as a major tool for chemical genomic activities. High-throughput screening (HTS) activities constitute a major step in the initial drug discovery efforts and involve the use of large quantities of biological reagents, hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds, and the utilization of expensive equipment. All these factors make it very important to evaluate in advance of the HTS campaign any potential issues related to reproducibility of the experimentation and the quality of the results obtained at the end of these very costly activities. In this article, the authors describe how GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has addressed the need of a true validation of the HTS process before embarking in full HTS campaigns. They present 2 different aspects of the so-called validation process: (1) optimization of the HTS workflow and its validation as a quality process and (2) the statistical evaluation of the HTS, focusing on the reproducibility of results and the ability to distinguish active from nonactive compounds in a vast collection of samples. The authors describe a variety of reproducibility indexes that are either innovative or have been adapted from generic medical diagnostic screening strategies. In addition, they exemplify how these validation tools have been implemented in a number of case studies at GSK.",

Unlike gene-specific assays, phenotypic assays interrogate multiple molecular targets and signaling pathways in a target \u201cagnostic\u201d fashion, which may reveal novel functions for well-studied proteins and discover new pathways of therapeutic value. Significantly, existing compound libraries may not have sufficient chemical diversity to fully leverage a phenotypic strategy. To address this issue, Eli Lilly and Company launched the Phenotypic Drug Discovery Initiative (PD2), a model of open innovation whereby external research groups can submit compounds for testing in a panel of Lilly phenotypic assays. This communication describes the statistical validation, operations, and initial screening results from the first PD2 assay panel. Analysis of PD2 submissions indicates that chemical diversity from open source collaborations complements internal sources. Screening results for the first 4691 compounds submitted to PD2 have confirmed hit rates from 1.6% to 10%, with the majority of active compounds exhibiting acceptable potency and selectivity. Phenotypic lead generation strategies, in conjunction with novel chemical diversity obtained via open-source initiatives such as PD2, may provide a means to identify compounds that modulate biology by novel mechanisms and expand the innovation potential of drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "The traditional drug discovery pipeline for the identification and development of compounds that selectively target specific molecules to ameliorate disease remains a major focus for medical research. However, the zebrafish is increasingly providing alternative strategies for various components of this pipeline. Zebrafish and their embryos are small, easily accessible and relatively low cost, making them applicable to high-throughput, small molecule screening. Zebrafish can also be manipulated by a range of forward and reverse genetics techniques to facilitate gene discovery and validation studies. Moreover, their physiological and developmental complexity provides accurate models of human disease to underpin mechanism of action and in vivo validation studies. Finally, several of these biological characteristics make zebrafish eminently suitable for toxicity testing, including eco-toxicology. Here we review the application of zebrafish to pre-clinical drug development and toxicity testing, including recent advances in mutant generation, drug screening and toxicology that serve to further enhance the capabilities of this valuable model organism in drug discovery.",

Virtual screening uses computer based methods to discover new ligands on the basis of biological structures. Virtual screening is divided into structural based screening (docking) and screening using active compounds as templates (ligand based virtual screening). Ligand based screening techniques mainly focus on comparing molecular similarity analyses of compounds with known and unknown moiety, regardless of the methods of the used algorithm. Docking is a computational tool of structure based drug design to predict protein ligand interaction geometries and binding affinities. In this review we provide an overview of the already used ligand based virtual screening and the docking with various databases, filters, scores and applications in the recent research in the pharmaceutical field.",

        "title": "Drug, brains, and behavior. The science of addiction",
        "abstract": "For much of the past century, scientists studying drug abuse labored in the shadows of powerful myths and misconceptions about the nature of addiction. When scientists began to study addictive behavior in the 1930s, people addicted to drugs were thought to be morally flawed and lacking in willpower. Those views shaped society\u2019s responses to drug abuse, treating it as a moral failing rather than a health problem, which led to an emphasis on punishment rather than prevention and treatment. Today, thanks to science, our views and our responses to addiction and other substance use disorders have changed dramatically. Groundbreaking discoveries about the brain have revolutionized our understanding of compulsive drug use, enabling us to respond effectively to the problem. As a result of scientific research, we know that addiction is a disease that affects both the brain and behavior. We have identified many of the biological and environmental factors and are beginning to search for the genetic variations that contribute to the development and progression of the disease. Scientists use this knowledge to develop effective prevention and treatment approaches that reduce the toll drug abuse takes on individuals, families, and communities. Despite these advances, many people today do not understand why people become addicted to drugs or how drugs change the brain to foster compulsive drug use. This booklet aims to fill that knowledge gap by providing scientific information about the disease of drug addiction, including the many harmful consequences of drug abuse and the basic approaches that have been developed to prevent and treat substance use disorders. At the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), we believe that increased understanding of the basics of addiction will empower people to make informed choices in their own lives, adopt science-based policies and programs that reduce drug abuse and addiction in their communities, and support scientific research that improves the Nation\u2019s well-being.",

In most cases, imaging is carried out by automated microscopes, often assisted by automated liquid handling and cell culture. Image processing, computer vision, and machine learning are used to automatically process high-dimensional image data into meaningful cell biological results. The key is creating automated analysis pipelines typically consisting of 4 basic steps: (1) image processing (normalization, segmentation, tracing, tracking), (2) spatial transformation to bring images to a common reference frame (registration), (3) computation of image features, and (4) machine learning for modeling and interpretation of data.

It allows for screening of more than 100,000 compounds a day per screen and requires effective procedures for quality control. The authors have developed a method for evaluating a background surface of an HTS assay; it can be used to correct raw HTS data. This correction is necessary to take into account systematic errors that may affect the procedure of hit selection. The described method allows one to analyze experimental HTS data and determine trends and local fluctuations of the corresponding background surfaces. For an assay with a large number of plates, the deviations of the background surface from a plane are caused by systematic errors. Their influence can be minimized by the subtraction of the systematic background from the raw data. Two experimental HTS assays from the ChemBank database are examined in this article. The systematic error present in these data was estimated and removed from them. It enabled the authors to correct the hit selection procedure for both assays.",

Drug companies and researchers would thus like to have methods of predicting biopharmaceutical properties accurately. The intestinal permeability to a lead compound is one such property which is particularly important. Therefore, access to methods to accurately predict biopharmaceutical properties, such as the intestinal permeability of a large series of compounds, is of particular importance. This review deals with new theoretical methods used to predict intestinal drug permeability. There are several possible transport routes across the intestine, but theoretical methods generally deal with only one of them, the passive transcellular route. Therefore, this review will also discuss the relative importance of passive and active drug transport and efflux routes using recent data generated in cell cultures, animal models and human subjects.

Optical biosensors developed for drug analysis generally exploit the high selectivity of the antigen-antibody and drug-protein interaction. Optical biosensors can be made based on optical diffraction or electro-chemiluminescence. High throughput screening, (HTS) which includes automated preparation of a large number of samples and then screening of their properties in multi-well plates, improves the efficiency of research in many scientific areas, e.g., catalyst screening, food processing, chemical synthesis, drug discovery, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and toxicological and cell based screening. The three most common detection techniques used in HTS are UV-VIS absorbance, fluorescence and luminescence. In this review, we summarize some recent trends and developments in the construction of optical chemical biosensors used in high throughput screening of drugs.

        "abstract": "Drug induced toxicity remains one of the major reasons for failures of new pharmaceuticals, and for the withdrawal of approved drugs from the market. Efforts are being made to reduce attrition of drug candidates, and to minimize their bioactivation potential in the early stages of drug discovery in order to bring safer compounds to the market. Therefore, in addition to potency and selectivity; drug candidates are now selected on the basis of acceptable metabolism/toxicology profiles in preclinical species. To support this, new approaches have been developed, which include extensive in vitro methods using human and animal hepatic cellular and subcellular systems, recombinant human drug metabolizing enzymes, increased automation for higher-throughput screens, sensitive analytical technologies and in silico computational models to assess the metabolism aspects of the new chemical entities. By using these approaches many compounds that might have serious adverse reactions associated with them are effectively eliminated before reaching clinical trials, however some toxicities such as those caused by idiosyncratic responses, are not detected until a drug is in late stages of clinical trials or has become available to the market. One of the proposed mechanisms for the development of idiosyncratic drug toxicity is the bioactivation of drugs to form reactive metabolites by drug metabolizing enzymes. This review discusses the different approaches to, and benefits of using existing in vitro techniques, for the detection of reactive intermediates in order to minimize bioactivation potential in drug discovery.",

Parameters of assay robustness, including Z'-value, coefficient variation (CV), and signal-to-background (S/B) ratio, were determined. The LOPAC(1280) small-compound library was used to validate this assay. Our results demonstrated that this assay is robust and reliable, with an average Z'-value of >0.7 and CV of <10%. Moreover, this assay showed a very low background, with the S/B ratio up to 71. Further, identified hits were selected and confirmed using a SYBR Green I-based confirmatory assay.

        "abstract": "Measuring the impacts of invasive species on recipient biotic communities can be challenging because standard ecological field experiments may be impossible, undesirable or inaccurate due to limitations of scale. Many studies therefore rely on a comparative observational approach, in which invaded areas are compared to similar nearby uninvaded areas, but this approach suffers from reduced inferential power because of the inability to randomly assign treatments. When possible, the best solution may be to incorporate comparative sampling over time, from before and after invasion, as a means of validating comparisons across space. We used this approach to assess the impacts of Argentine and big-headed ants on arthropod communities at two natural area sites in the Hawaiian Islands. Two sampling events, separated by 2 years, indicated that invaded plots at each site were significantly different from uninvaded plots in terms of overall community composition and distributions of certain indicator species. This compositional change associated with ant invasion was accompanied by a significant decrease in arthropod species richness at one site, but not at the second site. Changes in arthropod communities from before invasion to after invasion in separate before-after plots at each site were qualitatively consistent with the aforementioned changes measured across the invasion boundaries, but were smaller in magnitude because the invasion processes were still in early stages. Together, these findings support the inference that carefully planned studies of biological invasions that use a comparative observational approach can provide an accurate picture of resultant community level changes, and illustrate an effective method for validating such studies.",

Unusual prostate hypertrophy or CA? - R Posted by: \"Michael Uzick, N.D.\" druzick@comcast.net druzick Mon Jul 25, 2011 9:36 pm (PDT) Hi Davis, I think some basic things would be very helpful, such as his % free PSA. But probably the most useful would be to simply run a PCA3 test. I do them through Lab corp. It's very easy to collect, you just do a DRE with 3 swipes to each lobe and collect a small amount of urine. The test isn't just extremely specific for prostate cancer, the results may also tells about tumor size and aggressiveness of disease. Exactly the things you would like to know. Another basic thing to do is use this <http://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=ASURE_Calc>PSA<http://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=ASURE_Calc> kinetics calculator This is the same calculator used in the largest and longest running Active Surveillance cohort - they followed some patients over 15 years.

        "abstract": "Optical biosensors have been commercially available since the early 1990s, and have been used extensively in many areas of research in the life sciences. Optical biosensors developed for drug analysis generally exploit the high selectivity of the antigen-antibody and drug-protein interaction. Optical biosensors can be made based on optical diffraction or electro-chemiluminescence. High-throughput screening, (HTS) which includes automated preparation of a large number of samples and then screening of their properties in multi-well plates, improves the efficiency of research in many scientific areas, e.g., catalyst screening, food processing, chemical synthesis, drug discovery, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and toxicological and cell based screening. The three most common detection techniques used in HTS are UV-VIS absorbance, fluorescence and luminescence. In this review, we summarize some recent trends and developments in the construction of optical chemical biosensors used in high-throughput screening of drugs. Also, we have included environmental, biological and other medical applications of biosensors.",

Transporters may act as physiological 'gatekeepers' in the regulation of the pharmacological and/or toxicological effects of drugs by limiting distribution to tissues responsible for their effect and/or toxicity. This review will first provide a brief outline of the characteristics of membrane bound drug transporter families and their respective roles in regulating drug pharmacokinetics. This background then provides the context for a discussion of the characterization of a drug candidate as a substrate, inhibitor and/or inducer of drug transporter(s), followed by an assessment of the in vitro and in vivo preclinical methods used in drug discovery and development for screening molecules to identify potential transporter interactions. Finally, specific examples of the translation of in vitro findings to the in vivo effects are discussed to link the current understanding of the impact of drug transporters to clinical pharmacology. Thus, the goal is to provide the drug discovery scientist with a cadre of concepts, strategies, and tools for ultimately making rational decisions in drug design and delivery resulting in the optimization of drug concentrations at the target of pharmacology.",

        "abstract": "A review.  In this review we describe progress in docking and esp. high-throughput docking (HTD) for applications in drug design and in silico screening.  Computational methods that are used in HTD to assist drug design involve two steps: docking and scoring.  Several current docking programs have the ability to generate protein-ligand configurations that are close to the correct structure, as revealed by x-ray crystallog., in many cases.  Recent comparison studies of docking and scoring methods have shown that the choice of the best docking (and scoring) tool is to a large extent target-dependent.  Most of the docking programs treat the ligand as flexible, but the protein conformation is kept rigid.  We review algorithmic advances that allow for partial treatment of protein flexibility.  The estn. of binding affinities (scoring) is, from a theor. point of view, the most challenging part of ligand design.  Despite significant progress, a fast and accurate computational prediction of binding affinities is still beyond the limits of current methods.  We discuss multivariate statistical methods that have been proposed recently for improving HTD results and briefly outline simplified free energy calcns. based on mol. dynamics simulations.  Recent applications, in particular those based on end-point free energy models, are re-establishing the interest in this approach and we present an example from our research work.  Finally, we discuss new application scenarios of HTD, including chemogenomics docking on entire protein families and docking of natural products. [on SciFinder(R)]",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To establish the reliability and validity of an automated hearing screening test system for preschoolers and to investigate the risk factors for hearing loss.\\n\\nMETHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design in a comparative study of subjects. The automated hearing screening test was performed in 6231 preschoolers (3-7 years old) from 41 kindergartens in Shanghai, China. Sensitivity and specificity of the automated test were investigated with subjects who failed the screening test and a group of control subjects.\\n\\nRESULTS: Six hundred and forty-seven children were referred for diagnostic audiological assessment after the automated pure-tone screening test. Using the conventional pure-tone audiometry as the \"gold standard,\" the sensitivity and specificity of the automated hearing screening test increased from 0.33 and 0.15 in the youngest age group to 0.95 and 1.00 in the oldest age group, respectively. There was no statistically significant gender effect, but there was an age effect (\u03c7(2\u2009)=\u200922.96, p\u2009<\u20090.01). In the univariate analysis of 104 cases and 201 controls, significantly elevated odds ratios (OR) for hearing loss were correlated with universal newborn hearing screening test results (OR\u2009=\u200928.15, p\u2009<\u20090.01), parental suspicion of hearing loss (OR\u2009=\u200910.10, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and attendance at preschool before the age of five (OR\u2009=\u20090.51, p\u2009<\u20090.05).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the automated hearing screening test system can be used in screening programmes for preschoolers aged older than five years.",

        "abstract": "Study objective: Previous studies have shown that brief interventions for at-risk alcohol and drug use are significantly more likely to occur if patients are screened with a standardized, validated instrument, but high screening rates have traditionally been difficult to attain. Use of very brief screens can enable brief intervention specialists to focus their efforts on assessing and assisting patients most likely to need a brief intervention or more intensive treatment. This study describes the results of integrating brief substance abuse screens into an urban emergency department's (ED's) triage process. Methods: As part of a comprehensive initiative to increase alcohol and drug screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), 3 single-item screening questions were programmed into the electronic triage tool used in the ED to detect tobacco use, at-risk alcohol use, illicit drug use, or prescription drug misuse. Project staff conducted training sessions with nurses to ensure the questions were asked properly and ED supervisors provided ongoing performance feedback. Names of patients with positive responses to the alcohol or drug questions automatically populated a list forwarded to health education specialists, who provided assessments, brief interventions, and referrals. Results: Screening was conducted with 145,394 of 151,597 eligible patients, a 96% screening rate. Electronic reports revealed an 89% screening rate 30 days postimplementation and gradually increasing and stabilizing at approximately 97%. The overall percentage of patients screening positive for alcohol or drug use was similar to that of other ED-based studies (22%) but varied substantially by patient demographics. Conclusion: High rates of screening can be achieved if properly integrated into a clinical setting's existing patient care processes with well-planned information technology support. ?? 2013 American College of Emergency Physicians.",

        "title": "Telling people about screening programmes and screening test results: how can we do it better?",
        "abstract": "To make an informed choice about whether to be screened, people need information that allows them to weigh up the benefits and harms of screening. To understand their screening test results they require even more information. Yet currently, people attending a screening programme or considering a screening test may only be told that the test can detect disease or risk factors for disease, and that early intervention improves outcomes. When given their test results, people are generally only told the test was abnormal (\"positive\") or normal (\"negative\"). We believe that information given before and after the screening test can, and should, be improved. This will probably require information that includes both the benefits and harms of screening and is probabilistic. Indeed, we believe the traditional dichotomisation of screening test results into positive and negative is problematic, and could be replaced by standard use of risks or probabilistic data before and after screening. The relevant risk data could be explained in a range of ways, for example, quantitatively, qualitatively, and/or by \"anchoring\" to everyday experiences. In this paper we explore why dichotomisation of screening test results is problematic and look at the adverse consequences of presenting test results in terms of true and false, positive and negative. We present some ideas on alternative ways of providing information on screening programmes and screening test results. Our aim is to stimulate debate about these issues and to provide some starting points which could be further developed and evaluated in a wide range of screening programmes.",

IDO1 has been clinically validated as a small-molecule drug target for cancer, while preclinical studies indicate that TDO may be a target for cancer immunotherapy and neurodegenerative disease. We have developed a high-throughput screening assay for IDO1 and TDO based on a novel chemical probe, NFK Green, that reacts specifically with NFK to form a green fluorescent molecule with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. We provide the first side-by-side comparison of a number of published inhibitors of IDO1 and TDO and reveal that the preclinical IDO1 inhibitor Compound 5l shows significant cross-reactivity with TDO, while the relative selectivity of other published inhibitors was confirmed. The suitability for high-throughput screening of the assays was demonstrated by screening a library of 87,000 chemical substances in 384- or 1536-well format. Finally, we demonstrate that the assay can also be used to measure the capacity of cells to metabolize tryptophan and to measure the cellular potency of IDO1 and TDO inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we describe two complementary data-mining approaches used to characterize the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) natural-products set (NPS) based on information from the high-throughput screening (HTS) databases. Both methods rely on the aggregation and analysis of a large set of single-shot screening data for a number of biological assays, with the goal to reveal natural-product chemical motifs. One of them is an established method based on the data-driven clustering of compounds using a wide range of descriptors,(1) whereas the other method partitions and hierarchically clusters the data to identify chemical cores.(2,3) Both methods successfully find structural scaffolds that significantly hit different groups of discrete drug targets, compared with their relative frequency of demonstrating inhibitory activity in a large number of screens. We describe how these methods can be applied to unveil hidden information in large single-shot HTS data sets. Applied prospectively, this type of information could contribute to the design of new chemical templates for drug-target classes and guide synthetic efforts for lead optimization of tractable hits that are based on natural-product chemical motifs. Relevant findings for 7TM receptors (7TMRs), ion channels, class-7 transferases (protein kinases), hydrolases, and oxidoreductases will be discussed.",

Functional deficiencies in lysosomal proteins due to genetic mutations have been found in more than 50 lysosomal storage diseases that exhibit characteristic lipid/macromolecule accumulation and enlarged lysosomes. Recently, the lysosome has emerged as a new therapeutic target for drug development for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases. However, a suitable assay for compound screening against the diseased lysosomes is currently unavailable. We have developed a Lysotracker staining assay that measures the enlarged lysosomes in patient-derived cells using both fluorescence intensity readout and fluorescence microscopic measurement. This phenotypic assay has been tested in patient cells obtained from several lysosomal storage diseases and validated using a known compound, methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, in primary fibroblast cells derived from Niemann Pick C disease patients. The results demonstrate that the Lysotracker assay can be used in compound screening for the identification of lead compounds that are capable of reducing enlarged lysosomes for drug development.",

Neonatal screening for SCD was added to the Dutch screening programme in January 2007. We here evaluated three high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems for application in neonatal screening for haemoglobinopathies, and present the results of a subsequent pilot screening programme.\\n\\nMETHODS: The Variant NewBorn Screening (Vnbs) HPLC system (Bio-Rad) was validated by analysing 131 blood samples and blood mixtures. Subsequently, the performance of the G7 (Tosoh BioScience) and Ultra (Primus Corporation) was compared with the Vnbs. The three HPLC analysers were tested in a pilot screening programme on 21,969 dried blood spot samples from the routine Dutch neonatal screening programme.\\n\\nRESULTS: The pilot screening resulted in 188 abnormal patterns. The three HPLC devices presented comparable within- and between-run precision and detected the abnormal samples similarly. The high throughput, sampling systems, presentation of results, and integration of the chromatograms, however, were different.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: All three analysers detected the same abnormal haemoglobins satisfactorily, but integrated the chromatograms with variable imprecision. Comparison of the results suggested that the Bio-Rad Vnbs was the preferred system. However, software adjustments were required to improve the diagnostic potential of this device for screening for beta- and alpha-thalassaemia.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the effect of anticancer drug-loaded functional polymeric nanoparticles on drug resistance of three-dimensional (3D) breast tumor spheroids. 3D tumor models were built using concave microwells with different diameters (300-700\u03bcm) and nanoparticles were prepared using thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM)-co-acrylic acid (AA). Upon culturing with doxorubicin-loaded PNIPAM-co-AA nanoparticles for 96hours, the smallest tumor spheroids were extensively disrupted, resulting in a reduction in spheroid diameter. In contrast, the sizes of the largest tumor spheroids were not changed. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the circular shape of 3D spheroids treated with doxorubicin-loaded PNIPAM-co-AA nanoparticles had collapsed severely. Cell viability assays also demonstrated that the largest tumor spheroids cultured with doxorubicin-loaded PNIPAM-co-AA nanoparticles were highly resistant to the anticancer drug. We confirmed that tight cell-cell contacts within largest tumor spheroids significantly improved the anticancer drug resistance. Therefore, this uniform-sized 3D breast tumor model could be a potentially powerful tool for anticancer drug screening applications.",

        "abstract": "The successful introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops has created a revolutionary transformation of the agricultural industry with GM crops currently planted on some 130 million acres. Historically, agricultural companies were involved in the discovery of conventional insecticide chemistries in processes that were very similar to those in the pharmaceutical industry. With the introduction of GM technologies, the process has radically changed. The new process is best described as the pharmaceutical equivalent of a very large-scale limited clinical trial conducted at the discovery stage. For example, unlike pharmaceutical screens, GM crop discovery screens frequently involve live insects challenged with complex protein containing soups. Furthermore, the nature of the potential avenues for discovery mandates that assay models also support protein engineering, proteomics, and genomics efforts. The range in sample demand ranges from ultra-low to high throughput. Finally, regulatory and good business stewardship demands that data integrity and tractability is in place, from discovery through varietal introduction, to manage the information generated in support of a commercialized GM plant variety. The authors describe their discovery workflow and detail how they have customized a commercially available database software package to achieve an optimum configuration for entomology screening.",

        "abstract": "Drug screening and profiling is an important phase in drug discovery, development, and marketing. However, some profiling tests are not routinely done because of the needed additional technical skills and costly maintenance, which leads to cases of unexpected side effects or adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This study presents the design and operation of a microfluidic chip for single-cell level drug screening and profiling as an alternative platform for this purpose. Centrifugation was utilized to trap isolated single and groups of primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in the same chip. In the off-spin operation of the chip, the cells can be observed under a microscope and movies of the beat motion can be recorded. The beat profiles of the cells were generated by image correlation analysis of the recorded video to study the contractile characteristics (beating rate, beating strength, and inter-beat duration). By utilizing this non-invasive tool, long term continuous monitoring, right after trapping, was made possible and cell growth and dynamics were successfully observed in the chip. Media and liquid replacement does not require further centrifugation but instead utilizes capillary flow only. The effect of carbachol (100 \u03bcM) and isoproterenol (4 \u03bcg mL\u22121) on single cells and groups of cells was demonstrated and the feature for immunostaining (\u03b2-actin) applicability of the chip was revealed. Furthermore, these findings can be helpful for the headway of non-invasive profiling of cardiomyocytes and for future chip design and operation of high-throughput lab-on-a-chip devices.",

        "title": "Evaluation of frequently used drug interaction screening programs",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) screening programs are an important tool to check prescriptions of multiple drugs. The objective of the current study was to critically appraise several DDI screening programs. METHODS: A DDI screening program had to fulfil minimal requirements (information on effect, severity rating, clinical management, mechanism and literature) to be included into the final evaluation. The 100 most frequently used drugs in the State Hospital of Baden, Switzerland, were used to test the comprehensiveness of the programs. Qualitative criteria were used for the assessment of the DDI monographs. In a precision analysis, 30 drugs with and 30 drugs without DDIs of clinical importance were tested. In addition, 16 medical patient profiles were checked for DDIs, using Stockley's Drug Interactions as a reference. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Suitability of DDI screening program (quality of monographs, comprehensiveness of drug list, statistical evaluation). RESULTS: Out of nine programs included, the following four fulfilled the above mentioned criteria: Drug Interaction Facts, Drug-Reax, Lexi-Interact and Pharmavista. Drug Interaction Facts contained the smallest number of drugs and was therefore the least qualified program. Lexi-Interact condenses many DDIs into one group, resulting in less specific information. Pharmavista and Drug-Reax offer excellent DDI monographs. In the precision analysis, Lexi-Interact showed the best sensitivity (1.00), followed by Drug-Reax and Pharmavista (0.83 each) and Drug Interaction Facts (0.63). The analysis of patient profiles revealed that out of 157 DDIs found by all programs, only 18 (11%) were detected by all of them. No program found more than 50% of the total number of DDIs. A further evaluation using Stockley's Drug interactions as the gold standard revealed that Pharmavista achieved a sensitivity of 0.86 (vs Drug Interaction Facts, Lexi-Interact and Drug-Reax with a sensitivity of 0.71 each) and a positive predictive value of 0.67. CONCLUSION: None of the four DDI screening programs tested is ideal, every program has its strengths and weaknesses, which are important to know. Pharmavista offers the highest sensitivity of the programs evaluated with a specificity and positive predictive value in an acceptable range.",

In this work, we concurrently screened mixtures of stereoisomers and estimated their affinities to a protein target (thrombin) using weak affinity chromatography-mass spectrometry (WAC-MS). Affinity determinations by WAC showed that minor changes in stereoisomeric configuration could have a major impact on affinity. The ability of WAC-MS to provide instant information about stereoselectivity and binding affinities directly from analyte mixtures is a great advantage in fragment library screening and drug lead development.",

The technique (termed BD ACTOne) offers measurement of cAMP-dependent calcium influx or membrane depolarization with conventional fluorescent methods both in kinetic and in endpoint modes, optimal for high-throughput and subsequent compound screening. The utility of the technique is reported here based on assay development and high-throughput screening for small-molecule antagonists of the peptide parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2R). The dual-signaling properties of the receptor were retained in the recombinant system, and the observed pharmacological profile corresponded to data from radiolabeled cAMP determination. The membrane-potential-based high-throughput assay produced reproducible actives and led to the identification of several chemical scaffolds with potential utility as PTH2R ligands.",

Phenotypic screens have the advantage of the whole organism being exposed to the compound and thus all the targets and biological pathways associated with it. Cell penetration and access to targets in their \"natural\" environment are taken into account. Unless utilizing a genetically modified organism with an additional target associated indicator, elucidation of specific target(s) of active compounds is necessary. Target discovery is desirable to allow development of chemical entities based upon knowledge of the target structure. Phenotypic drug discovery has successfully identified new molecular entities for neglected protozoan disease research.

As a novel development, in silico methods that identify T cell epitopes have been coming on line. These methods are relatively inexpensive and allow the mapping of epitopes from virtually all human leukocyte antigen molecules derived from a wide genetic background. In vitro assays remain important, but guided by in silico data they can focus on selected peptides and human leukocyte antigen haplotypes, thereby significantly reducing time and cost.",

However, several screening programmes do not have full registration of cancers submerging after screening, and increased use of opportunistic screening over time can raise questions regarding the quality of interval cancer registration. Methods/settings Based on the earlier used Markov model, formulas for expected number of cases given time since former screening activity was developed. Using questionnaire data for 336,533 women in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Programme (NBCSP), mean square regression estimates of MST and STS were calculated.\\n\\nRESULTS: In contrast to the previously used method, the new approach gave satisfactory model fit. MST was estimated to 5.6 years for women aged 50-59 years, and 6.9 years for women aged 60-69 years, and STS was estimated to 55% and 60%, respectively. Attempts to add separate parameters for breast cancer incidence without screening, or previous STS, resulted in wide confidence intervals if estimated separately, and non-identifiably if combined.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Previously published results of long MST and low screen test sensitivity were confirmed with the new approach. Questionnaire data on time since previous screening can be used to estimate MST and STS, but the approach is sensitive to relaxing the assumptions regarding the expected breast cancer incidence without screening and constant STS over time.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Over the past decade, zebrafish have been tasked to play important roles from modeling human diseases to finding cures for them. Inadvertently, these fish now find themselves swimming along the drug development pipeline. A number of studies have been conducted to see if these small fish are up to the task of drug toxicity testing, an important rite of passage along the pharmaceutical pipeline. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the recent publications (2008 - 2010) on the state-of-the-art applications that couple advanced technologies with the unique advantages of zebrafish for drug toxicity screening. The paper looks at the several automated high-throughput platforms that have been developed for zebrafish teratogenicity, cardiotoxicity and neuro-sensory organ toxicity assays over the past 3 years as well as the important studies related to metabolism and biotransformation of selected drugs that have been initiated. This paper also reviews their mechanistic and predictive omics applications. EXPERT OPINION: While there have been a number of developments over the past 3 years and indeed over the last 10 years, challenges and limitations still exist, which, unless overcome, will prevent zebrafish from truly reaching their full potential as a drug toxicological model. That being said, recent developments have suggested that zebrafish could play a role in bridging the gap between in vitro cell-based models and in vivo mammalian models.",

Secondary outcomes included other self-reported measures of drug use, drug use according to hair testing, ASSIST scores (severity), drug use consequences, unsafe sex, mutual help meeting attendance, and health care utilization.\\n\\nRESULTS: At baseline, 63% of participants reported their main drug was marijuana, 19% cocaine, and 17% opioids. At 6 months, 98% completed follow-up. Mean adjusted number of days using the main drug at 6 months was 12 for no brief intervention vs 11 for the BNI group (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.77-1.22) and 12 for the MOTIV group (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.32; P = .81 for both comparisons vs no brief intervention). There were also no significant effects of BNI or MOTIV on any other outcome or in analyses stratified by main drug or drug use severity.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Brief intervention did not have efficacy for decreasing unhealthy drug use in primary care patients identified by screening. These results do not support widespread implementation of illicit drug use and prescription drug misuse screening and brief intervention.\\n\\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00876941.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To investigate the consequences of different cancer screening trial designs and follow-up options for accuracy of the estimate of the effect of screening on disease-specific mortality.Methods We consider a randomized trial of breast cancer screening with a screening phase in which the intervention group is offered screening and the control group is not, and optional further follow-up after this screening phase. Postulating a lead time effect similar to that observed in breast cancer screening trials, we calculate the observed relative risk of disease-specific mortality and compare this with the true relative risk, for four design options: (1) no follow-up beyond the screening phase, ie. the screening phase and the observation period are identical; (2) follow-up continuing beyond the screening phase, all cancer-specific deaths counted, including those diagnosed after the screening phase; (3) follow-up continuing beyond the screening phase, but with only deaths from cancers diagnosed during the screening phase included; and (4) follow-up continuing beyond the screening phase, a single screen of the control group conducted at the end of the screening phase, and only deaths from cancers diagnosed during the screening phase in both arms up to completion of the single control screen included.Results All designs in which follow-up for mortality continues beyond the screening phase incurred a bias against screening. The design in which the control group undergoes a single screen at the end of the screening phase was least biased in the example used.Conclusions The expedient of a single screen of the control group at the end of the screening phase has acceptable accuracy, but is still slightly conservatively biased.",

        "abstract": "Compound handling is a fundamental and critical step in compound screening throughout the drug discovery process. Although most compound-handling processes within compound management facilities use 100% DMSO solvent, conventional methods of manual or robotic liquid-handling systems in screening workflows often perform dilutions in aqueous solutions to maintain solvent tolerance of the biological assay. However, the use of aqueous media in these applications can lead to suboptimal data quality due to compound carryover or precipitation during the dilution steps. In cell-based assays, this effect is worsened by the unpredictable physical characteristics of compounds and the low DMSO tolerance within the assay. In some cases, the conventional approaches using manual or automated liquid handling resulted in variable IC(50) dose responses. This study examines the cause of this variability and evaluates the accuracy of screening data in these case studies. A number of liquid-handling options have been explored to address the issues and establish a generic compound-handling workflow to support cell-based screening across our screening functions. The authors discuss the validation of the Labcyte Echo reformatter as an effective noncontact solution for generic compound-handling applications against diverse compound classes using triple-quad liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The successful validation and implementation challenges of this technology for direct dosing onto cells in cell-based screening is discussed.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to analyse cervical screening coverage data over time. METHODS: Routinely collected cervical screening statistics, in England, on the proportion of women who have undergone cervical screening with cytology during the preceding five years. The participants included all women residents eligible for cervical screening. RESULTS: Overall coverage remained at about 82% or over between 1995 and 2000. Since 2000, however, coverage has drifted slowly down to just over 80% in 2005. Coverage has long been observed to be related to age. In 2005, the coverage rate was 71% in women aged 25-29, 83% in those aged 35-54 and 75% in those aged 55-64. Comparing coverage by age in the three years--1995, 2000 and 2005--shows broad conformity with this pattern in each of the three years, but overlaid is the fact that at ages below 50, the rate has been falling while at ages above 55, the rate has been rising. The fall in screening coverage appears to be largely a cohort effect, with women born in the 1960s and later being increasingly less likely to participate. CONCLUSIONS: No specific reason for this effect is evident. Action could be targeted at women aged 25-34 to address falling coverage.",

Data from this national clinical programme can also be used for research. Awareness of the impact of such studies on screening participation is important.\\n\\nAIMS: To investigate the effect on screening uptake of adding a research questionnaire to the postal screening invitation.\\n\\nMETHODS: People invited for screening in 2008-10 in two areas of England were randomized to receive or not to receive an additional research study questionnaire, consent form and study information, either with their test kit or 2-3 days later. Uptake of screening was examined in relation to study mailings.\\n\\nRESULTS: Among 11,579 people invited for screening by the Midlands and North West Bowel Cancer Screening Hub, screening uptake was significantly lower in those who received study documents with their FOBt kit than in those who did not (48.6% vs 53.5% respectively: p\u2009<\u20090.001). The reduction in uptake was similar in men and women, and was greater in people living in more deprived areas. Among a further 36,195 people invited for screening by the Midlands and North West and Southern Hubs, sending study documents by separate mailing 2-3 days after the FOBt kit did not affect screening uptake (uptake with and without additional study mailing: Midlands and North West, 56.7% and 56.2% respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.6; Southern, 52.0% and 51.4% respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.5).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Researchers planning studies that include contact with potential participants within the NHS Bowel Cancer and similar screening programmes should be aware of the potential impact on uptake.",

        "abstract": "The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) has been under investigation for several years as a pharmaceutical drug target. Clinical studies have shown that fusion proteins consisting of human recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO) and the Fc-part of IgG can be transported after pulmonary administration via FcRn across the airway epithelium to the blood stream. So far, no clinically approved pharmaceutical formulation of EPO-Fc is available. Since various forms of recombinant erythropoietins have been frequently misused by athletes as performance-enhancing agents, EPO-Fc might play a similar role in sports in the future. In order to investigate the detectability of EPO-Fc in human blood, different strategies were tested and developed. Only two of them fulfilled the necessary requirements regarding sensitivity and specificity. A rapid protocol useful for screening purposes first enriches EPO-Fc from human serum via high capacity protein A beads and subsequently detects EPO-Fc in the eluate with a commercial EPO ELISA kit. The limit of detection (LOD) of the method is about 5 pg (45 amol) EPO-Fc and is independent of the serum volume used. For screening and/or confirmation purposes a second protocol was evaluated, which consists of a fast EPO immunopurification step followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate or sarcosyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, SAR-PAGE) and Western double-blotting with chemiluminescence detection - a method already established in routine EPO anti-doping control. The latter strategy allows the detection of EPO-Fc in serum together with all other recombinant erythropoietins and with an identical LOD (5 pg/45 amol) as for the rapid screening protocol.",

METHODS: The sample of 422 patients, ages 18-91, completed a self-administered questionnaire. Measures included 30-day, one-year, and lifetime substance use and alcohol-related problems. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of patients completed electronic intakes during the study period. Prior-month alcohol use was reported by 90 men (70%) and 180 women (62%). Of these patients, heavy drinking (five or more drinks on one occasion) was reported by 37 men (41%) and 41 women (23%). Prior-month cannabis use was reported by 17 men (13%) and 32 women (11%). CONCLUSIONS: Computerized intake systems that include alcohol and drug screening can be integrated into outpatient psychiatric settings. Heavy drinking and use of nonprescribed drugs are commonly reported, which provides an important intervention opportunity.",

This has led to a rapid increase of available screening data both within pharmaceutical companies and the public domain. We have used the BioAssay Ontology (BAO) 2.0 for assay annotation within AstraZeneca to enable comparison with external HTS methods. The annotated assays have been analyzed to identify technology gaps, evaluate new methods, verify active hits, and compare compound activity between in-house and PubChem assays. As an example, the binding of a fluorescent ligand to formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1, involved in inflammation, for example) in an in-house HTS was measured by fluorescence intensity. In total, 155 active compounds were also tested in an external ligand binding flow cytometry assay, a method not used for in-house HTS detection. Twelve percent of the 155 compounds were found active in both assays. By the annotation of assay protocols using BAO terms, internal and external assays can easily be identified and method comparison facilitated. They can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different assay methods, design appropriate confirmatory and counterassays, and analyze the activity of compounds for identification of technology artifacts.",

        "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipokine secreted by adipocytes and plays a role in the suppression of metabolic disorders that can result in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. Several studies have shown that upregulation of adiponectin has a number of therapeutic benefits. Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonists are known to increase adiponectin secretion both in cultured adipocytes and humans, they have several side effects, such as weight gain, congestive heart failure, and edema. Therefore, adiponectin secretion modulators that do not possess PPAR\u03b3 agonistic activity seem to promising for a number of conditions. Here, the authors report on the development of a reporter-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay using insulin-resistant-mimic 3T3-L1 adipocytes for discovery of adiponectin secretion modulators. They screened a library of approximately 100 000 small-molecule compounds using this model, performed several follow-up screens, and identified six hit compounds that increase adiponectin secretion without having PPAR\u03b3 agonistic activity. These compounds may be useful drug candidates for diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, and other metabolic syndromes. This HTS assay might be applicable to screening for other adipokine modulators that can be useful for the treatment of other conditions.",

        "abstract": "Target-directed drug design, although a conceptually rational approach, is only one strategy for drug discovery. In the case of neurodegenerative diseases where molecular targets and disease mechanisms are unknown, even when specific genes are known to trigger the disease, phenotypic screening offers another approach. This review describes the establishment of phenotypic screening assays using primary neurons subjected to a disease-relevant pathophysiological stress and measuring the most important functional outcome, survival. Although a challenge both to screening teams to reproducibly produce the cells and chemists to interpret structure-activity relationships, such systems have historically identified or produced effective drugs. The primary screening assay is only the start; once hits are validated, they must be characterized using traditional target-directed or mechanism-based secondary assays to establish their selectivity, lack of side-effect liability, and eventually be shown to produce the desired effects in a preclinical animal model of the disease. These compounds then provide valuable pharmacological tools to identify neurodegenerative disease targets and mechanisms, whether or not they have all the properties required of a drug candidate.",

There is the concern that screening of fragments at high \u00b5M concentrations in biochemical assays results in increased false-positive and false-negative rates. Here the authors systematically compare the data quality of FBS obtained by enzyme activity-based fluorescence intensity, fluorescence lifetime, and mobility shift assays with the data quality from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. The serine protease trypsin and the matrix metalloprotease MMP12 were selected as model systems. For both studies, 352 fragments were selected each. From the data generated, all 3 biochemical protease assay methods can be used for screening of fragments with low false-negative and low false-positive rates, comparable to those achieved with the SPR-based assays. It can also be concluded that only fragments with a solubility higher than the screening concentration determined by means of NMR should be used for FBS purposes. Extrapolated to 10,000 fragments, the biochemical assays speed up the primary FBS process by approximately a factor of 10 and reduce the protease consumption by approximately 10,000-fold compared to NMR protein observation experiments.",

        "abstract": "Both combinatorial chemistry and parallel synthesis provide a valuable means for the production of large numbers of compounds with diverse molecular architectures that become available for various drug discovery experiments. In both the lead optimization and lead selection stages, one requirement that is common for many processes is the need for bioanalytical support. This review summarizes current high throughput strategies and efficient methodologies that are employed for drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) screens for a series of drug discovery compounds. For these types of assays, high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS) has now become the technique of choice. The major high throughput strategies including sample reduction and cassette dosing are discussed. The methods for increasing the speed of HPLC-MS/MS-based analyses, such as fast chromatography, direct sample injection, parallel technologies and combined ionization interfaces are also presented in this review. In addition, the special challenges when performing HPLC-MS/MS bioanalysis, such as the choice of ionization sources, matrix ionization suppression and the potential for endogenous interferences, are addressed.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of an experience of a benign mammographic result on intention to seek medical help immediately in the case of breast abnormalities, and on intentions and thoughts about future participation in screening. SETTING: The Dutch Breast Cancer Screening Programme for women aged 50-69. METHODS: Subjects were women who were invited for an initial breast examination: 223 women filled out a questionnaire about 10 days before and about 6 weeks after their initial breast examination. To be able to control for possible test effects, another group of 293 women filled out a questionnaire only after mammography. Changes in thoughts and intentions were examined. RESULTS: Most women were very satisfied with the course of their initial breast examination, although pain or discomfort was often mentioned. No clues to suggest false reassurance were found: more than 99% of the women would consider the possibility of breast cancer if they felt a lump in one of their breasts. In such a situation, most women intended to seek medical help within a week. These variables were not influenced by the experience of mammography with a benign result. In general, women were very positive about (repeat) participation, both before and after screening. After screening, the average woman perceived fewer costs in participating, and perceived her own ability to engage in future screening as higher. However, the experience of pain and anxiety during the initial screening did lead to reverse effects. Women who were less satisfied about their treatment by the staff were more likely to change their intentions to reparticipate in a negative way. CONCLUSIONS: As, in general, women became more positive about regular participation after they had attended breast cancer screening, efforts to improve first round attendance must be continued. At the same time, the screening organisations must continue to prioritise the high level of client friendliness throughout the screening. No evidence for detrimental effects of screening through false reassurance among participants was found.",

The separation conditions were as follows: capillary, 80.5 cm (75 mu m id, 72 cm effective length for UV detection 58 cm, effective length for fluorescence detection); 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.8); 28 kV (80 mu A) applied voltage; UV, 260 nm; fluorescence detection, excitation wavelength, 310 nm, emission wavelength, 418 nm; capillary temperature, 25 degrees C. For UV detection, the incubation conditions were as follows: CYP3A4: 20 pmol/mL; NADPH: 1 mM; EDTA: 1 mM; concentration of the substrate: 5-10 times its reported literature K-m value; temperature: 37 degrees C; incubation time: 15 min. For fluorescence detection, the concentrations were reduced to CYP3A4: 4 pmol/mL, NADPH: 20 mu M, EDTA: 20 mu M and substrate: 10 mu M. Blank incubations were performed in the absence of substrate. Compared with the blank, significant differences were found for the consumption of NADPH and the production of NADP. The development of this assay system allows rapid assessment of metabolic stability relative to standard compounds, as well as potential identification of the major CYP involved in the metabolism. It would reduce the backlog of compounds that require LC/MS analysis, and thereby expedite the process of metabolic stability screening.",

The authors have applied microARCS (microarrayed compound screening) technology to develop a high-throughput screen for finding inhibitors of the p56lck tyrosine kinase. Initial assay development was performed in a homogeneous time-resolved (LANCE) format in 96-well microplates and then converted into the gel-based microARCS format. The microARCS methodology is a well-less screening format in which 8640 compounds are arrayed on a microplate-sized piece of polystyene and subsequently assayed by placing reagents cast in agarose gels in contact with these compound sheets. A blotting paper soaked with adenosine triphosphate is applied on the gel to initiate the kinase reaction in the gel. Using this screening methodology, 300,000 compounds were screened in less than 40 h. Substantial reagent reduction was achieved by converting this tyrosine kinase assay from a 96-well plate assay to microARCS, resulting in significant cost savings.",

        "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic fungus that causes meningitis worldwide,  particularly in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Although amphotericin B is the \"gold standard\" treatment for cryptococcal meningitis, the toxicity and inconvenience of intravenous injection emphasize a need for development of new anticryptocccal drugs. Recent data from humans and animal studies suggested that a nutrient-deprived host environment may exist in cryptococcal meningitis. Thus, a screening assay for identifying fungicidal compounds under nutrient-deprived conditions may provide an alternative strategy to develop new anticryptococcal drugs for this disease. A high-throughput fungicidal assay was developed using a profluorescent dye, alamarBlue, to detect residual metabolic activity of C. neoformans under nutrient-limiting conditions. Screening the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC) with this assay identified a potential chemical scaffold, 10058-F4, that exhibited fungicidal activity in the low micromolar range. These results thus demonstrate the feasibility of this alamarBlue-based assay for high-throughput screening of fungicidal compounds under nutrient-limiting conditions for new anticryptococcal drug development.",

        "abstract": "Drug discovery is a highly complex and costly process, which demands integrated efforts in several relevant aspects involving innovation, knowledge, information, technologies, expertise, R&D investments and management skills. The shift from traditional to genomics- and proteomics-based drug research has fundamentally transformed key R&D strategies in the pharmaceutical industry addressed to the design of new chemical entities as drug candidates against a variety of biological targets. Therefore, drug discovery has moved toward more rational strategies based on our increasing understanding of the fundamental principles of protein-ligand interactions. The combination of available knowledge of several 3D protein structures with hundreds of thousands of small-molecules have attracted the attention of scientists from all over the world for the application of structure- and ligand-based drug design approaches. In this context, virtual screening technologies have largely enhanced the impact of computational methods applied to chemistry and biology and the goal of applying such methods is to reduce large compound databases and to select a limited number of promising candidates for drug design. This review provides a perspective of the utility of virtual screening in drug design and its integration with other important drug discovery technologies such as high-throughput screening (HTS) and QSAR, highlighting the present challenges, limitations, and future perspectives in medicinal chemistry.",

The DAST-A, derived from a modification of the original adult version called the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST; Skinner, 1982), was psychometrically tested in a study group of adolescent inpatients. The DAST-A demonstrated good internal consistency, high test-retest reliability, unidimensional factor structure, and good concurrent validity. Using the classification system of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association 1994), DAST-A scores of greater than 6 yielded sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive powers of 78.6%, 84.5%, and 82.3%, respectively, in differentiating adolescent psychiatric inpatients with and without drug-related disorders. These findings suggest that the DAST-A holds promise as a drug abuse screening measure in psychiatrically impaired adolescent populations. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

SETTING: From 2010 to 2012, the entire target female population (aged 25-64) was invited to the first HPV screening round in an area where Pap test screening had been active since 2002. METHODS: For HPV-negative women, the interval was three years. For HPV-positive women, a cytological smear was stained and interpreted. Positive cytologies were referred to colposcopy; negatives were referred to repeat HPV after one year. If HPV was persistently positive, women were referred to colposcopy; if negative, to normal screening. RESULTS: In 2010-12 18728 women were screened, slightly higher participation than with Pap test (18233 64.7%); 1633 were HPV-positive (8.7%); 843 were positive at cytology triage (referral rate at baseline 4.5%). Of those referred at the one year HPV test, 84% complied (660/780); 356 were persistently positive (1.9%). The total referral rate was 6.4% compared with 3.7% for the Pap test. The detection rate was 9.2/1000 compared with 5.0% for the Pap test. The HPV positivity rate during the second round in women previously negative was 3.9% and the detection rate in HPV-positive cytology-positive women was 0.8/1000. CONCLUSIONS: HPV-based screening increases colposcopies at the first round, but also strongly increases the detection rate. At the second round, HPV prevalence was much lower and the detection rate also fell, corroborating the need for longer screening intervals in HPV-negative women.",

RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of self-reported prostate cancer screening was 55.8% (23.7% DRE only). The highest prevalence was observed in the age group of 60-69 years with 68.8% (28.1% DRE only). The highest prevalence of PSA tests was observed in the age group 70-79 years (40.9%). About 75% of the screening tests were performed by urologists. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the target population (men aged 40-79 years) have had at least one prostate cancer screening test.

NBS is conducted by state public health departments to identify infants with certain genetic, metabolic, and endocrine disorders. Screening is performed in the first few days of life through blood testing. Several drops of blood are taken from the baby's heel and placed on a filter paper card. The dried blood, on the filter cards, is sent from the newborn nursery to the state health department laboratory, or a commercial partner, where the blood is analyzed. Scientific and technological advances have lead to a significant expansion in the number of tests-from an average of 6 to more than 50--and there is a national trend to further expand the NBS program. This rapid expansion has created significant ethical, legal, and social challenges for the health care system and opportunity for scholarly inquiry to address these issues. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the NBS programs and to provide an in-depth examination of two significant concerns raised from expanded newborn screening, specifically false-positives and lack of information for parents.

        "abstract": "Most mitochondrial messenger RNAs in trypanosomatid pathogens undergo a unique type of posttranscriptional modification involving insertion and/or deletion of uridylates. This process, RNA editing, is catalyzed by a multiprotein complex (~1.6 MDa), the editosome. Knockdown of core editosome proteins compromises mitochondrial function and, ultimately, parasite viability. Hence, because the editosome is restricted to trypanosomatids, it serves as a unique drug target in these pathogens. Currently, there is a lack of editosome inhibitors for antitrypanosomatid drug development or that could serve as unique tools for perturbing and characterizing editosome interactions or RNA editing reaction stages. Here, we screened a library of pharmacologically active compounds (LOPAC1280) using high-throughput screening to identify RNA editing inhibitors. We report that aurintricarboxylic acid, mitoxantrone, PPNDS, and NF449 are potent inhibitors of deletion RNA editing (IC50 range, 1-5 \u00b5M). However, none of these compounds could specifically inhibit the catalytic steps of RNA editing. Mitoxantrone blocked editing by inducing RNA-protein aggregates, whereas the other three compounds interfered with editosome-RNA interactions to varying extents. Furthermore, NF449, a suramin analogue, was effective at killing Trypanosoma brucei in vitro. Thus, new tools for editosome characterization and downstream RNA editing inhibitor have been identified.",

        "abstract": "Introduction This study aimed at a comparative evaluation of two Clinical Decision Support Software (CDSS) programs regarding their sensitivity and specificity to identify clinically relevant interactions. Materials and Methods Cross-sectional study that identified drug interactions using the CDSS MediQ and ID PHARMA CHECK in 484 neurological inpatients. Interactions were reclassified according to the Zurich Interaction System (ZHIAS), a multidimensional classification that incorporates the Operational Classification of Drug Interactions (ORCA). Results In 484 patients with 2,812 prescriptions MediQ and ID PHARMA CHECK generated a total of 1,759 and 1,082 alerts, respectively. MediQ identified 658 specific combinations, 8 classified as 'high danger', 164 as 'average danger' and 486 as 'low danger'. ID PHARMA CHECK detected 336 combinations assigned to one or several of 12 risk and management categories. Altogether both CDSS issued alerts relating to 808 specific interacting drug combinations. According to ZHIAS, 7 of these were contraindicated, 24 provisionally contraindicated, 190 carried a conditional risk, and 587 a minimal risk of adverse events. Only 186 interacting drug pairs were identified by both programs, with only a weak correlation (r = 0.21) in their severity grading. Most alerts missing from either of the two CDSS were of questionable clinical relevance according to ZHIAS, whereas most interactions identified by both programs had a higher relevance. Conclusion CDSS showed major differences in the identification and grading of interactions. Many interactions were only identified by one of the two CDSS, but overlap was higher for (provisionally) contraindicated combinations. For both CDSS only a small proportion of all identified interactions appeared clinically relevant according to ZHIAS.",

        "abstract": "Objective - To estimate the costs of a quality management (QM) system as proposed by the Quality Management for Screening report for a future national colorectal cancer screening programme. Methods - Estimates of the costs of the QM system, including the associated costs of education and training and information provision, were based on expert opinion, the existing literature, and the experience of the current National Health Service (NHS) breast cancer screening programme (BSP) and the NHS cervical cancer screening programme (CSP). Results-The cost of a QM system to support a national colorectal cancer programme in the UK was estimated as approximately (L)3.8 million a year. Further annual costs related to QM will include (L)500 000 for education and training and (L)200 000 for information provision. Adding these additional costs to a previously published UK economic evaluation of colorectal cancer screening increases the cost-utility ratio to approximately (L)6500 per quality adjusted life year gained (over an eight year follow up period). Conclusions - Any new screening programme, or an existing one, must have QM to ensure that the quality of screening is high and to maintain the right balance between benefit and harm. The significant costs of such a QM system should be included in any economic evaluation of a screening programme.",

        "title": "The benefits and harms of breast cancer screening: an independent review.",
        "abstract": "Whether breast cancer screening does more harm than good has been debated extensively. The main questions are how large the benefit of screening is in terms of reduced breast cancer mortality and how substantial the harm is in terms of overdiagnosis, which is defined as cancers detected at screening that would not have otherwise become clinically apparent in the woman's lifetime. An independent Panel was convened to reach conclusions about the benefits and harms of breast screening on the basis of a review of published work and oral and written evidence presented by experts in the subject. To provide estimates of the level of benefits and harms, the Panel relied mainly on findings from randomised trials of breast cancer screening that compared women invited to screening with controls not invited, but also reviewed evidence from observational studies. The Panel focused on the UK setting, where women aged 50-70 years are invited to screening every 3 years. In this Review, we provide a summary of the full report on the Panel's findings and conclusions. In a meta-analysis of 11 randomised trials, the relative risk of breast cancer mortality for women invited to screening compared with controls was 0\u00b780 (95% CI 0\u00b773-0\u00b789), which is a relative risk reduction of 20%. The Panel considered the internal biases in the trials and whether these trials, which were done a long time ago, were still relevant; they concluded that 20% was still a reasonable estimate of the relative risk reduction. The more reliable and recent observational studies generally produced larger estimates of benefit, but these studies might be biased. The best estimates of overdiagnosis are from three trials in which women in the control group were not invited to be screened at the end of the active trial period. In a meta-analysis, estimates of the excess incidence were 11% (95% CI 9-12) when expressed as a proportion of cancers diagnosed in the invited group in the long term, and 19% (15-23) when expressed as a proportion of the cancers diagnosed during the active screening period. Results from observational studies support the occurrence of overdiagnosis, but estimates of its magnitude are unreliable. The Panel concludes that screening reduces breast cancer mortality but that some overdiagnosis occurs. Since the estimates provided are from studies with many limitations and whose relevance to present-day screening programmes can be questioned, they have substantial uncertainty and should be regarded only as an approximate guide. If these figures are used directly, for every 10,000 UK women aged 50 years invited to screening for the next 20 years, 43 deaths from breast cancer would be prevented and 129 cases of breast cancer, invasive and non-invasive, would be overdiagnosed; that is one breast cancer death prevented for about every three overdiagnosed cases identified and treated. Of the roughly 307,000 women aged 50-52 years who are invited to begin screening every year, just over 1% would have an overdiagnosed cancer in the next 20 years. Evidence from a focus group organised by Cancer Research UK and attended by some members of the Panel showed that many women feel that accepting the offer of breast screening is worthwhile, which agrees with the results of previous similar studies. Information should be made available in a transparent and objective way to women invited to screening so that they can make informed decisions.",

Here we present a stratified screening deck with accompanying plating design for use with very large corporate compound collections.  The deck is plated as a whole, but copies for screening can be downsized flexibly and quickly on the fly, without the need for repicking of physical samples.  We show that such downsized sets maximize returns and yield results superior to randomly picked subsets of the same size.  For the proposed stratified plating design, structurally diverse subsets that cover the full collection in terms of compound diversity and favorable compound properties can be produced economically and quickly from the full set of master plates.  The design was implemented globally at AstraZeneca in 2009 and has enabled substantial cost-saving in screening campaigns, as set size requirements can be met on a per-screen basis, using a single, preplated master deck.[on SciFinder (R)]",

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) from trial participants indicate high acceptability and no adverse physical or psychological consequences, but this may not generalize to routine screening in the community. This study examined PROMs in a community-based FS screening programme. Methods Eligible adults aged 58-59 (n = 2016) registered at 34 London general practices were mailed a National Health Service-endorsed invitation to attend FS screening. Pain and side-effects were assessed in a 'morning-after' questionnaire, and satisfaction was assessed in a three-month follow-up questionnaire. Anxiety, self-rated health and colorectal symptoms were assessed at prescreening and follow-up. Results In total, 1020 people attended screening and were included in the current analyses, of whom 913 (90%) returned the morning-after questionnaire, and 674 (66%) the follow-up questionnaire. The prescreening questionnaire had been completed by 751 (74%) of those who attended. The majority (87%) of respondents reported no pain or mild pain, and the most frequent side-effect (wind) was only experienced more than mildly by 16%. Satisfaction was extremely high, with 98% glad they had the test; 97% would encourage a friend to have it. From prescreening to follow-up there were no changes in anxiety or self-rated health, and the number of colorectal symptoms declined. Satisfaction and changes in wellbeing were not moderated by gender, deprivation, ethnicity or screening outcome. Conclusions PROMs indicate high acceptability of FS screening in 58-59 year olds, with no adverse effects on colorectal symptoms, health status or psychological wellbeing.",

        "abstract": "Antenatal sickle and thalassaemia screening programmes are now established in most high prevalence areas in England. Although screening reliably detects beta-thalassaemia trait, in many cases, results state that alpha-thalassaemia trait cannot be excluded. The detection of couples at risk of a child with hydrops fetalis is one of the aims of the national programme. We, therefore, performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the common alpha-thalassaemia gene deletions to assess the usefulness of this technique in routine screening practice. Between August 2001 and August 2002, of the 5092 women booked at the antenatal clinic, 425 were found to have a mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) <27 pg in the absence of beta-thalassaemia trait; 189 (44.5%) had an MCH <25 pg. All 425 patients underwent PCR analysis for the common deletions: -SEA (South-East Asian), -MED (Mediterranean), -alpha(20.5), -FIL (Filipino), -alpha 3.7 and -alpha 4.2 genotypes. In total, 130 (31%) women were positive for alpha-thalassaemia deletion; 86 (24.7%) were heterozygous for -alpha 3.7, 19 (4.4%) were homozygous for -alpha 3.7, 12 (2.8%) were heterozygous for -alpha 4.2, 1 (0.2%) was homozygous for -alpha 4.2, 11 (2.6%) were heterozygous for -SEA and one (0.2%) was heterozygous for the -MED genotype. Although the detection rate for alpha(+)-thalassaemia was high, a strategy of selective screening using MCH <25 pg and ethnic group (SEA, Middle East or Eastern MED) would have identified all individuals heterozygous for alpha(0)-thalassaemia. Routine molecular screening for all forms of alpha-thalassaemia trait is unjustified in antenatal screening.",

        "abstract": "Major progress in studying the biology of schistosomes had been achieved since the late 1960s with the successful laboratory cultivation of the parasite's life cycle stages in the vertebrate (in vivo animal models) and snail hosts. This was followed by establishment of in vitro culture techniques for cultivation of the different life cycle stages to understand the mechanisms regulating the parasite's growth, development, transformation, pathogenicity and survival, with prospects to develop and identify relevant candidate diagnostic, immunological and chemotherapeutic targets. Chemotherapeutic measures have been the mainstay in the control of schistosomiasis. The use of praziquantel, a relatively safe and orally administered drug, in targeted or mass treatment programmes had significantly reduced the prevalence of schistosomiasis in disease-endemic countries. However, with only one drug of choice for treatment, parasite resistance remains a major concern. Thus, new drug discovery against schistosomes cannot be overemphasised. Undoubtedly, this will require an integrated system that includes not only rational chemical synthesis and lead optimisation, but also appropriate drug screening strategies. This paper reviews the present state of in vitro and in vivo drug screening strategies against schistosomes. It also highlights the best practices for compound screening in the TDR-designated compound screening centres and details some of the challenges involved in in vitro and in vivo compound screening.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - To evaluate the impact of a sub-regional training course in pharmacovigilance on participants' attitudes to ADR reporting, and self-reported application of knowledge gained. Method - The study involved a cross-sectional survey during a sub-regional pharmacovigilance training course in Zimbabwe. Eighteen participants from 10 African countries attended and were asked to complete self-administered pre-course and post-course questionnaires. A follow-up questionnaire was also posted to each participant 2 months after the workshop. Results - After the course, there was a marked difference in the perceived factors discouraging a participant from reporting an ADR with only a few respondents unsure how to report ADRs or worried about confidentiality and legal issues. Only 5.4% of responses were inappropriate after the training when asked what should be reported to a voluntary ADR reporting scheme compared to 19.8% before the course. Half of the respondents to the follow-up questionnaire expected a pharmacovigilance centre to be established in their countries as a result of the training. Conclusion - The training course had a positive effect on attitudes and knowledge of pharmacovigilance and may lead to establishment of pharmacovigilance centres in some of the participating countries. There would be value in holding more of these workshops within the region. Copyright (c) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "By adding high concentrations of test drugs to an Ussing chamber with rat jejunum, we established a system that yields very high correlations between the rat absorption percentage and the membrane permeability, and that can accurately predict the absorption percentage for rats. An advantage of this technique is that, unlike the results obtained using Caco-2, the slope of the absorption/membrane-permeability curve is gentle, which facilitates a more exact prediction of the absorption percentage. In addition, the results obtained with this technique demonstrated that it could be used to evaluate the absorption percentage of drugs with an affinity for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which cannot be assessed using Caco-2. This method also allows for cassette screening, which would facilitate evaluation of the contribution of P-gp to absorption in the small intestine. Cassette screening showed that absorption of fexofenadine was unaffected by combination with the P-gp substrate ketoconazole. Consistent with this finding, in vivo studies showed that ketoconazole did not affect the Fa Fg for fexofenadine, a pharmacokinetic parameter that reflects absorption and bioavailability in the small intestine. This confirms the usefulness of the Ussing chamber for cassette screening and also suggests that intestinal P-gp has a minimal contribution to drug absorption.",

More recently, additional probes from Invitrogen have been used. Vivid 2C9 Green is the largest of the probes and has had limited prior characterization. The new series of probes differ significantly from MFC and were examined for their ability to identify interactions with 19 CYP2C9 substrates/inhibitors. The inhibition profiles depend largely on the physical differences between the fluorescent probe substrates. Cytochrome b5 (cyt b5) was also investigated for the ability to alter the inhibition profile of a given compound. The stoichiometric addition of cyt b5 caused an increase in V max of MFC and Vivid 2C9 Green 4.4 and 1.7 times, respectively. Furthermore, cyt b5 imposes a steric component to the active site as the inhibition profiles were significantly affected in incubations with MFC. The addition of cyt b5 had limited impact on the inhibition profiles generated with Vivid 2C9 Green. The K(m) of Vivid 2C9 Green increased from 1.2+/-0.2 micro M to 4.8+/-0.3 micro Mas a result of cyt b5 addition. These results illustrate that multiple substrate probes may be necessary for screening drug-drug interaction in CYP2C9 and that cyt b5 effects can impart steric restraints on the CYP2C9 active site.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the use of the Bayesian network as an alternative to existing tools for similarity-based virtual screening has received noticeable attention from researchers in the chemoinformatics field. The main aim of the Bayesian network model is to improve the retrieval effectiveness of similarity-based virtual screening. To this end, different models of the Bayesian network have been developed. In our previous works, the retrieval performance of the Bayesian network was observed to improve significantly when multiple reference structures or fragment weightings were used. In this article, the authors enhance the Bayesian inference network (BIN) using the relevance feedback information. In this approach, a few high-ranking structures of unknown activity were filtered from the outputs of BIN, based on a single active reference structure, to form a set of active reference structures. This set of active reference structures was used in two distinct techniques for carrying out such BIN searching: reweighting the fragments in the reference structures and group fusion techniques. Simulated virtual screening experiments with three MDL Drug Data Report data sets showed that the proposed techniques provide simple ways of enhancing the cost-effectiveness of ligand-based virtual screening searches, especially for higher diversity data sets.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adolescent involvement with alcohol and other drugs is rising in Brazil, and there is an increasing need for psychometrically sound assessment tools to detect early drug involvement. METHODS: The psychometric properties of the Brazilian version of the Drug Use Screening Inventory (DUSI) were examined in a sample composed of 71 non-drug-dependent adolescents and 142 adolescents who met DSM-III-R criteria for drug dependence. RESULTS: With a cutoff score of 13% or lower for the absolute density index of the substance use area, DUSI correctly classified 80% of the drug-dependent adolescents and 90% of the non-drug-dependent adolescents, thus correctly classifying 83.6% of the sample. Factor analysis applied to each of the 10 DUSI areas indicated their unidimensionality, with substantial percentages of variance on the first factor. The Brazilian version of DUSI presented strong internal consistency reliability for the whole sample (drug-dependents and non-drug-dependent adolescents) with an average across all 10 scales for Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient of 0.96 (standard deviation = 0.02) and for the split-half reliability coefficient of 0.88 (standard deviation = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the Brazilian version of DUSI preserves its original psychometric properties and is a sensitive and useful screening instrument for drug use.",

While numbers of excellent studies have used mammalian models to discover new compounds, the time and effort involved with screening large numbers of candidates is prohibitive. Cultured mammalian neurons are often used to perform high-throughput screens (HTS); however, cell culture lacks the organismal complexity involved in AD. To address these issues several researchers are turning to the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans has numerous models of both Tau and Ab induced toxicity, the two prime components observed to correlate with AD pathology. These models have led to the discovery of numerous AD modulating candidates. Further, the ease of performing RNA interference for any gene in the C. elegans genome allows for identification of proteins involved in the mechanism of drug action. These attributes make C. elegans well positioned to aid in the discovery of new AD therapies.",

For this purpose, the authors have developed an original type of peptide array as a high-throughput screening assay for quantitatively evaluating kinase activity. A volume of 2 nL of peptide solution was spotted onto a formyl group-modified glass slide by using an arrayer, which was designed for use with protein chip technology. The phosphorylation was recognized by fluorescence-label antibody and detected with an automatic microarray scanner widely used in DNA chip technology. The system needs low sample volume, provides a high-density peptide array, and supplies high reproducibility. It provided enough sensitivity for inhibitor screening, even though a relatively low concentration of purified kinase was employed. The assay also proved useful for the detection of intracellular kinase activity as well as for the measurement of the fluctuations of intracellular protein kinase activity with drug stimulation. Thus, this peptide array would be applicable for kinase-targeted diagnosis, cell-based drug screening, and signal pathway investigation.",

However, data on the comparative performance of different CDSS to detect and appropriately classify interactions in real-life prescription datasets is limited.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the results from two different CDSS analysing the pharmacotherapy of a large population of psychiatric inpatients for drug interactions.\\n\\nMETHODS: We performed mass analyses of cross-sectional patient-level prescriptions from 84,625 psychiatric inpatients using two CDSS - MediQ and ID PHARMA CHECK(\u00ae). Interactions with the highest risk ratings and the most frequent ratings were reclassified according to the Zurich Interaction System (ZHIAS), a multidimensional classification that incorporates the OpeRational ClassificAtion of Drug Interactions (ORCA) and served as a reference standard.\\n\\nRESULTS: MediQ reported 6,133 unique interacting combinations responsible for 270,617 alerts affecting 63,454 patients. ID PHARMA CHECK(\u00ae) issued 5,400 interactions and 157,489 alerts in 48,302 patients. Only 2,154 unique interactions were identified by both programmes, but overlap increased with higher risk rating. MediQ reported high-risk interactions in 2.5 % of all patients, compared with 5 % according to ID PHARMA CHECK(\u00ae). The positive predictive value for unique major alerts to be (provisionally) contraindicated according to ORCA was higher for MediQ (0.63) than for either of the two ID PHARMA CHECK(\u00ae) components (0.42 for hospINDEX and 0.30 for ID MACS). MediQ reported more interactions, and ID PHARMA CHECK(\u00ae) tended to classify interactions into a higher risk class, but overall both programmes identified a similar number of (provisionally) contraindicated interactions according to ORCA criteria. Both programmes identified arrhythmia as the most frequent specific risk associated with interactions in psychiatric patients.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: CDSS can be used for mass-analysis of prescription data and thereby support quality management. However, in clinical practice CDSS impose an overwhelming alert burden on the prescriber, and prediction of clinical relevance remains a major challenge. Only a small subset of yet to be determined alerts appears suitable for automated display in clinical routine.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate yeast as a high-throughput cell-based system for screening chemicals that may lead to drug development, 10,302 full-length human cDNAs (~50% of the total cDNAs) were introduced into yeast. Approximately 5.6% (583 clones) of the cDNAs repressed the growth of yeast. Notably, ~25% of the repressive cDNAs encoded uncharacterized proteins. Small chemicals can be readily surveyed by monitoring their restorative effects on the growth of yeast. The authors focused on protein kinases because protein kinases are involved in various diseases. Among 263 protein kinase cDNAs (~50% of the total) expressed in yeast, 60 cDNAs (~23%), including c-Yes, a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family, inhibited the growth of yeast. Known inhibitors for protein kinases were examined for whether they reversed the c-Yes-induced inhibition of the yeast growth. Among 85 inhibitors tested, 6 compounds (PP2, PP1, SU6656, purvalanol, radicicol, and geldanamycin) reversed the inhibition, indicating a high specificity sufficient for validating this screening system. Human c-Yes was found to interact with Hsc82, one of the yeast chaperones. Radicicol and geldanamycin probably exerted their actions through interactions with Hsc82. These results indicate that when human proteins requiring molecular chaperones for their activities are subjected to the yeast screening system, 2 groups of chemicals may be found. The actions of one group are exerted through direct interactions with the human proteins, whereas those of the other group are mediated through interactions with chaperones.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess double reading effectiveness in mammography screening. DESIGN: Retrospective study of 177,631 consecutive mammograms double read during 1998-2003. SETTING: The Florence screening programme, involving 11 trained radiologists. Abnormalities reported by at least one reader prompted assessment. RESULTS: The referral rate was 2.89% for the first reader, 3.15% for the second reader, and 3.59% for either reader. Of 713 total cancers detected, 43 were suspected only by the second reader (6.4% relative, 0.024% increase in absolute detection rate) and had a lower stage compared to the first reader (pTis-pT1b = 65.7 versus 52.0%): 41 were reviewed and classified (error type) as \"minimal sign\" in six, and \"screening error\" in 35 cases, or as BI-RADS 3 in one, 4a in 20, 4b in 13, and 4c in three cases. The second reading cost was 2.70 per woman examined, or 11,168 per additional cancer detected (versus 11,585 at a single reading). DISCUSSION: Second reading is effective in detecting a limited number of additional cancer cases. Tumour stage (one-third over 1 cm in diameter) and review findings (high rate of \"screening errors\" and BI-RADS R4b-c categories) suggest that second reading detects small \"difficult cases\" as well as larger cancers missed due to fatigue or loss of attention. Second reading reduces screening specificity to a minor extent, and since cancer detection at second reading seems cost-effective the procedure is recommendable in routine practice.",

        "abstract": "To identify small-molecule modulators of biologic systems, academic scientists are beginning to use high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches that have traditionally been used only in industry. The HTS laboratories that are being established in universities, while differing in details of staffing, equipment, and size, have all been created to attain 1 or more of 3 principal goals: drug discovery, chemical genetics, or training. This article will examine the role that these activities play in 4 HTS laboratories that have been created within the academic community of Harvard Medical School and its affiliated institutions. First, the 3 activities will be defined with special attention paid to describing the impact they are having on how academic biologic science is conducted today. Next, the histories and operations of the 4 Harvard laboratories are reviewed. In the course of these summaries, emphasis is placed on understanding the motivational role that the 3 activities initially played in the creation of the 4 Harvard facilities and the roles that the activities continue to play in their day-to-day operations. Finally, several concerns are identified that must be attended to for the successful establishment and operation of an academic biologic science that has yet to be fully determined. HTS has the ability to provide the tools to test previously untestable hypotheses and can thereby allow the discovery of the unanticipated and the truly novel.",

DESIGN: A prospective study nested within a multicentre randomised controlled trial of the efficacy of FS screening for the prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer (the UK flexible sigmoidoscopy trial). SETTING: Glasgow, Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: 55-64 year old adults, registered with general practitioners participating in the FS trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Screening participation measured at three levels: questionnaire return; interest in screening; attendance at screening. RESULTS: Socioeconomic deprivation was a strong predictor of participation. Return of the screening questionnaire, expression of interest in screening, and attendance at the test, were all lower in more deprived groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the need to consider ways to reduce inequalities in screening uptake, in parallel with the introduction of any new screening programmes, to avoid exacerbating social gradients in cancer mortality.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the frequency and type of adverse drug events (ADEs) identified in intensive care unit (ICU) transfer summaries and in the hospital discharge summaries to demonstrate the effectiveness of ICU transfer summary surveillance in the identification of ADEs., METHODS: A retrospective electronic medical record review was conducted for medical ICU patients admitted between January 2009 and April 2009 to a large, academic medical center. The Harvard Practice Scale and the modified Leonard Assessment Scale were used to evaluate the presence of an ADE from the ICU transfer and hospital discharge summaries., RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-four patients were identified for inclusion with a median medical ICU length of stay of 4.5days and hospital length of stay of 13days. The ICU transfer summary review revealed 173 ADEs among 124 unique patients with a rate of 33.9 ADEs per 1000 hospital patient days. Sixty-nine ADEs among 63 unique patients were identified through the hospital discharge summary with a rate of 13.5 ADEs per 1000 hospital patient days. Only 23.1% of ADEs discussed in the ICU transfer summary were also discussed in the hospital discharge summary., CONCLUSIONS: The use of ICU transfer summaries is an effective tool to increase ADE detection. The use of an ICU transfer summary should be considered as an adjunct method to an existing ADE surveillance system for heightened pharmacovigilance.Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening for colorectal cancer will be introduced into the National Cancer Screening Programmes in England in 2013. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) from trial participants indicate high acceptability and no adverse physical or psychological consequences, but this may not generalize to routine screening in the community. This study examined PROMs in a community-based FS screening programme. METHODS: Eligible adults aged 58-59 (n = 2016) registered at 34 London general practices were mailed a National Health Service-endorsed invitation to attend FS screening. Pain and side-effects were assessed in a 'morning-after' questionnaire, and satisfaction was assessed in a three-month follow-up questionnaire. Anxiety, self-rated health and colorectal symptoms were assessed at prescreening and follow-up. RESULTS: In total, 1020 people attended screening and were included in the current analyses, of whom 913 (90%) returned the morning-after questionnaire, and 674 (66%) the follow-up questionnaire. The prescreening questionnaire had been completed by 751 (74%) of those who attended. The majority (87%) of respondents reported no pain or mild pain, and the most frequent side-effect (wind) was only experienced more than mildly by 16%. Satisfaction was extremely high, with 98% glad they had the test; 97% would encourage a friend to have it. From prescreening to follow-up there were no changes in anxiety or self-rated health, and the number of colorectal symptoms declined. Satisfaction and changes in wellbeing were not moderated by gender, deprivation, ethnicity or screening outcome. CONCLUSIONS: PROMs indicate high acceptability of FS screening in 58-59 year olds, with no adverse effects on colorectal symptoms, health status or psychological wellbeing.",

Multiplexing, defined as the screening of multiple targets within the same experiment, is an example of this strategy. Here, the authors describe a technique that allows multiplexing of a common assay type used to study G-protein-coupled receptors: changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels as measured by Molecular Device's fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR). The multiplexed FLIPR assays showed the expected pharmacological properties of single assays, with good reproducibility and Z* factors. The authors used them to screen large compound libraries in 2 multiplexed assay designs. The 1st used a single-cell line expressing 2 different receptors and the 2nd a mixture of 2 cell lines of the same type each expressing distinct receptors. Screening using these multiplexed assays produced significant savings in reagents, time, and human resources and allowed the authors to quickly identify specific and selective hits.",

RESULTS: 11 of 1074 patients screened had a popliteal aneurysm between 15 and 26 mm, a prevalence of 1.0%. Five years later no increase in aneurysm size had occurred and no related complications were reported.

First, 32 women who reported use of alcohol or other drugs during pregnancy at initial screening were then asked to complete a full substance use survey. Second, data were collected from charts of 349 new clients who attended the antenatal clinic during the study period. Both sensitivity (86%, 67%) and positive predictive value (100%, 92%) for alcohol and other drug use respectively, were high.

STUDY DESIGN: a survey of clients and audit of clinical charts. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: clients attending an antenatal clinic of a large tertiary hospital in Queensland, Australia, from October to December 2009. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: data were collected from two sources. First, 32 women who reported use of alcohol or other drugs during pregnancy at initial screening were then asked to complete a full substance use survey. Second, data were collected from charts of 349 new clients who attended the antenatal clinic during the study period. Both sensitivity (86%, 67%) and positive predictive value (100%, 92%) for alcohol and other drug use respectively, were high. Only 15% of surveyed women were uncomfortable about being screened for substance use in pregnancy, yet the chart audit revealed poor staff compliance. During the study period, 25% of clients were either not screened adequately or not at all. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTISE: despite recommended universal screening in pregnancy and the apparent acceptance by our participants, alcohol and other drug (A&OD) screening in the antenatal setting remains problematic.

HCS integrates high-throughput methodologies with automated multicolor fluorescence microscopy to collect quantitative morphological and molecular data from complex biological systems.

The adaptation of these complex in vitro assay systems to high-throughput HCS formats with automated image acquisition enables large-scale chemical library screening campaigns. These HCS principles can be extended further to allow small molecule compounds in in vivo model organisms such as zebrafish. In this review we discuss the latest developments within automated image-based high-throughput screening of chemical libraries for anti-angiogenic compounds.",

        "title": "Screening for positive allosteric modulators: assessment of modulator concentration-response curves as a screening paradigm.",
        "abstract": "Targeting allosteric binding sites represents a powerful mechanism for selectively modulating receptor function. The advent of functional assays as the screening method of choice is leading to an increase in the number of allosteric modulators identified. These include positive allosteric modulators that can increase the affinity of the orthosteric agonist and potentiate the evoked response. A common method for screening for positive allosteric modulators is to examine a concentration-response (C/R) curve to the putative modulator in the presence of a single, low concentration of agonist. The study reported here has used data simulations for positive allosteric modulators according to the allosteric ternary complex model to generate modulator C/R curves. The results are then compared to the mechanistic parameters used to simulate the data. It is clear from the simulations that the potency of a positive modulator C/R curve in a screening assay is the product of both its affinity and positive cooperativity. However, it is often difficult to tell which parameter dominates the response; not knowing the actual affinity or cooperativity of a ligand may have consequences for receptor selectivity. Further modeling demonstrates that the use and choice of single agonist concentration, as well as changes in the agonist curve Hill slope, can have significant effects on the modulator C/R curve. Finally, the quantitative relationship between modulator C/R curves and the allosteric ternary complex model is explored. These simulations emphasize the importance of careful interpretation of screening data and of conducting full mechanism of action studies for positive allosteric modulators.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Age trial was a randomized controlled trial to study the effect on breast cancer mortality of invitation to annual mammography from age 40 to 41. Uptake of invitation to screening mammography in UK women aged below 50 is of interest, particularly in the light of the recent announcement that the national breast screening programme will begin inviting women from age 47.\\n\\nMETHODS: The trial took place in 23 National Health Service breast screening units in England, Wales and Scotland between 1991 and 2004. Data on invitation and attendance during 13 years of trial fieldwork were analysed. The participants were 53,884 women in the intervention arm of the Age trial who were randomized to receive annual invitation to mammography from age 40 or 41 up to age 48. The trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN24647151.\\n\\nRESULTS: Uptake of invitation to routine screening was 68% at first round and 69% at subsequent rounds. A total of 43,709 women in the intervention arm (81%) attended at least one routine screen and 23,262 (43%) attended at least seven screens; 31,392 women attended 75% or more of all routine invitations they were offered. Previous trial attendance was a predictor of subsequent uptake; attendance was inversely related to Townsend deprivation score.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Uptake in this trial was comparable with that in the UK screening programme for women aged over 50. There was an inverse relationship between deprivation level and the number of screens attended.",

The authors have previously developed a BioAssay Ontology (BAO) and curated more than 350 assays with standardized BAO terms. Here they describe the use of BAO annotations to analyze a large set of assays that employ luciferase- and \u03b2-lactamase-based technologies. They identified promiscuous chemotypes pertaining to different subcategories of assays and specific mechanisms by which these chemotypes interfere in reporter gene assays. Results show that the data in PubChem can be used to identify promiscuous compounds that interfere nonspecifically with particular technologies. Furthermore, they show that BAO is a valuable toolset for the identification of related assays and for the systematic generation of insights that are beyond the scope of individual assays or screening campaigns.",

In addition, this approach also enables the rapid evaluation of the mode of binding of new drug candidates with respect to thiol reactivity and metabolism by glutathione. Herein, we describe the development of a fluorescence-based high-throughput assay that allows the identification of thiol-reactive compounds. A thiol-containing fluorescent probe, MSTI, was synthesized and used to evaluate small molecules from the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC) collection of bioactive molecules. LOPAC compounds that are known to react with sulfur nucleophiles were identified with this assay, for example, irreversible protease inhibitors, nitric oxide-releasing compounds, and proton-pump inhibitors. The results confirm that both electrophilic and redox reactive compounds can be quickly identified in a high-throughput manner, enabling the assessment of screening libraries with respect to thiol-reactive compounds.",

        "abstract": "To expedite G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) drug screening studies, cell lines amenable to transfection (e.g. CHO cells) have been widely used as cellular models. These cells can be frozen in a ready-to-use format, allowing screening of a single batch of cells and validation of the cellular material prior to the screening run. A common method used to deliver frozen cells to screening programs is to \u03b3-irradiate the cells, abrogating cell division after thawing and ensuring consistency in the number of cells analyzed per well. With the recognition that signaling proteins such as ERK and Akt are important markers of GPCR activation, along with the availability of suitable assays for their measurement, these outputs have become important for GPCR screening programs. Here we show that several \u03b3-irradiated and frozen CHO-K1 cell lines expressing transfected GPCRs, initially optimized for performing cAMP or AequoScreen calcium flux assays, can be used for the measurement of GPCR-mediated ERK and Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, CHO-K1 cells transfected with NOP or GAL(1) receptors show pharmacology for a number of agonists and antagonists that is consistent with non-irradiated cultured lines. These data indicate that \u03b3-irradiated CHO-K1 cells can be reliably used for the measurement of GPCR-mediated kinase signaling outputs.",

The ability of high-content imaging to detect dysplastic cervical cells was assessed using keratinocytes spiked with immunopositive SiHa cells and a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) LBC sample. The percentages of Ki-67- and ProExC-immunopositive objects correlated significantly with the percentages of spiked SiHa cells. The dysplastic cells of the HSIL sample could be detected using high-content cell analysis.

However, an understanding of mechanism is not required for regulatory approval. This paradox is particularly relevant to the role of phenotypic assays in drug discovery. A recent analysis revealed that phenotypic drug discovery strategies were more successful for first-in-class medicines, whereas target-based molecular strategies were more successful for followers (Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011, 10, 507-519). The rationale for the success of phenotypic screening was the unbiased identification of the molecular mechanism of action. In this follow-up analysis, the format and mechanistic information used to establish the phenotypic assays that led to the first-in-class small-molecule new molecular entities approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration between 1999 and 2008 were analyzed and compared with those approved in 2012. Not surprisingly, some level of mechanistic understanding was used to select the assay formats and chemicals screened. It is concluded that mechanism takes on different connotations depending on context and perspective and that a target need not always be the exclusive definition of mechanism.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To present results from the NHS breast screening programme (NHSBSP) from 1994 through to 1999 and to examine the extent to which interim targets are being achieved. METHODS: Data were collated from all screening programmes in the UK on standard statistical returns. Performance of the screening programme was evaluated using calculated targets based on comparison with the Swedish two counties (STC) randomised controlled trial. RESULTS: In the early years of screening (1988-1993), the NHS programme was detecting more DCIS but considerably less invasive cancers than expected, based on the STC trial. Since the screening year 1993/94 (1 April to 31 March) the standardised detection ratio (SDR) measure of the detection of invasive cancers has increased by 36% from 0.83 to 1.13. The SDR has been greater than 1 since 1996197 suggesting that the NHSBSP has only been screening as efficiently as the STC trial since this date. Uptake for screening has been relatively stable over time at approximately 75%. CONCLUSIONS: The NHSBSP has made considerable advances in performance since its inception in 1988 and screening uptake and age standardised invasive cancer detection rates are (by 1999) well in excess of targets. The early years of screening were characterised by good uptake but a low sensitivity for the detection of invasive cancers. It is anticipated that the screening programme will have an increasing impact on breast cancer mortality, particularly in the 55-69 year age group over the coming years.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine ethnic differences in participation in colorectal cancer screening by flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS). It assessed both intentions to be screened and actual screening uptake, and considered whether demographic, health and psychosocial factors mediated the ethnic differences. The setting of this study follows a subset of participants from the UK FS Trial. METHODS: A postal questionnaire assessed ethnicity, demographic characteristics, health, attitudes to screening and FS screening intentions. Data on screening intentions were available for 17,333 adults aged 55-64 years (Sample 1). Screening uptake was recorded in a subsample of 4303 respondents who were subsequently randomized to receive an invitation to screening (Sample 2). RESULTS: Screening intentions in Sample 1 were equally high across all the ethnic groups (>80% [13,724/17,042] reported they were interested). In contrast, attendance (Sample 2) was considerably lower among Asians (54% [43/79]) compared with White (69% [2843/4123]) or Black (80% [33/41]) respondents. Multivariate analysis showed that potential explanatory factors, including socioeconomic deprivation, poor health and fearful and fatalistic attitudes did not account for the lower screening attendance among Asians. CONCLUSION: Further research is required to identify explanations for the gap between intentions and behaviour in UK Asians if any future FS screening programme is to be introduced equitably.",

Given the importance of GPCRs as drug targets and the de-orphanization of novel targets, GPCRs are likely to remain the frequent targets of many drug discovery programs. With recent advances in instrumentation and understanding of cellular mechanisms for the signals measured, biosensor-centered label-free cell assay technologies become a very active area for GPCR screening.

Our previous research indicates that recall for further tests following newborn hearing screening can have a negative impact on the emotional well being of mothers, but it is not known if this is greater than that caused by recall following the distraction test. OBJECTIVE: To compare the impact on maternal anxiety and satisfaction of recall following newborn hearing screening and the HVDT. METHODS: Four groups participated: 27 mothers of babies receiving a satisfactory result and 21 mothers of babies recalled after the HVDT 26 mothers of babies receiving a satisfactory result and 16 mothers of babies recalled after newborn hearing screening. Questionnaires assessing maternal anxiety, worry and certainty about the babies' hearing, satisfaction with and attitudes towards the screening test were sent to mothers three weeks and six months following screening. RESULTS: Comparison of the effects of receipt of different results showed no significant differences in maternal anxiety, worry and certainty between the two tests. Those mothers whose babies had a newborn hearing screening test were significantly more satisfied, regardless of the result received. Those who received a satisfactory result on the newborn hearing screening programme also had more positive attitudes towards that screening test than those receiving a satisfactory result following the HVDT. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that newborn hearing screening does not have a more negative emotional impact than the HVDT.",

        "abstract": "Transport of ADP and ATP across mitochondria is one of the primary points of regulation to maintain cellular energy homeostasis. This process is mainly mediated by adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) located on the mitochondrial inner membrane. There are four human ANT isoforms, each having a unique tissue-specific expression pattern and biological function, highlighting their potential as drug targets for diverse clinical indications, including male contraception and cancer. In this study, we present a novel yeast-based high-throughput screening (HTS) strategy to identify compounds inhibiting the function of ANT. Yeast strains generated by deletion of endogenous proteins with ANT activity followed by insertion of individual human ANT isoforms are sensitive to cell-permeable ANT inhibitors, which reduce proliferation. Screening hits identified in the yeast proliferation assay were characterized in ADP/ATP exchange assays employing recombinant ANT isoforms expressed in isolated yeast mitochondria and Lactococcus lactis as well as by oxygen consumption rate in mammalian cells. Using this approach, closantel and CD437 were identified as broad-spectrum ANT inhibitors, whereas leelamine was found to be a modulator of ANT function. This yeast \"knock-out/knock-in\" screening strategy is applicable to a broad range of essential molecular targets that are required for yeast survival.",

The preliminary development and validation of a novel methodology for the high-throughput screening of antimicrobial compounds and inhibitors of bacterial motility is described. This method uses a bacterial motility swarming agar assay, combined with the use of offset inoculation of the wells in a standard, clear, 96-well plate, to enable rapid screening of compounds for potential antibiotic and antimotility properties with a standard absorbance microplate reader. Thus, the methodology should be compatible with 96-well laboratory automation technology used in drug discovery and chemical biology studies. To validate the screening method, the Genesis Plus structurally diverse library of 960 biologically active compounds was screened against a motile strain of the gram-negative bacterial pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. The average Z' value for the positive and negative motility controls on all 12 compound plates was 0.67 +/- 0.14, and the signal-to-baseline ratio calculated from the positive and negative controls was 5.9 +/- 1.1. A collection of 70 compounds with well-known antimicrobial properties was successfully identified using this assay.",

        "abstract": "Lead compounds for antifungal drug development are urgently needed because invasive fungal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Here, a high-throughput screening assay for small molecules that cause yeast cell lysis is described. The assay is based on the detection of the intracellular enzyme adenylate kinase in the culture medium as a reporter of yeast cell lysis. Features of the assay protocol include 1) the ability to detect cell lysis at drug concentrations that cause no apparent growth defect, 2) specificity for fungicidal molecules, 3) a simple 1-plate, add-and-read protocol using a commercially available adenylate kinase assay kit, 4) short, 5-h incubation time, and 5) low cost. The assay is applicable to the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to Candida albicans, the most common human fungal pathogen. The adenylate kinase assay is validated in a pilot screen of 4505 compounds. Consistent with its specificity for fungicidal molecules, the largest class of molecules identified in 2 libraries of known bioactive molecules targeted the plasma membrane. Fungistatic compounds are not detected by the assay. Adenylate kinase-based screening appears to be a useful approach to the direct identification of small molecules that kill yeast cells.",

        "abstract": "A major hurdle for cardiovascular disease researchers has been the lack of robust and physiologically relevant cell-based assays for drug discovery. Derivation of cardiomyocytes from human-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells at high purity, quality, and quantity enables the development of relevant models of human cardiac disease with source material that meets the demands of high-throughput screening (HTS). Here we demonstrate the utility of iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes as an in vitro model of cardiac hypertrophy. Exposure of cardiomyocytes to endothelin 1 (ET-1) leads to reactivation of fetal genes, increased cell size, and robust expression of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Using this system, we developed a suite of assays focused on BNP detection, most notably a high-content imaging-based assay designed for phenotypic screening. Miniaturization of this assay to a 384-well format enabled the profiling of a small set of tool compounds known to modulate the hypertrophic response. The assays described here provide consistent and reliable results and have the potential to increase our understanding of the many mechanisms underlying this complex cardiac condition. Moreover, the HTS-compatible workflow allows for the incorporation of human biology into early phases of drug discovery and development.",

Drug users attending treatment centres during the presence of the study team. Liver stiffness measurements (LSM) by transient elastography using the Fibroscan device; blood tests for viral hepatitis, HIV infection and hyaluronic acid (HA) levels; and routine liver tests. Individuals with LSM > 8 kPa were referred to the hospital for treatment evaluation. Individuals with LSM > 12 kPa were recommended a liver biopsy. Among 175 drug users negative for hepatitis C, 13% had LSM = 8-11.9 kPa and 4% had LSM > 12 kPa; elevated LSM was associated with a body mass index (BMI) > 30. Among 128 drug users with chronic hepatitis C, 19.5% had LSM = 8-11.9 kPa and 21.1% had LSM > 12 kPa (P < 0.001). Repeat LSM at liver biopsy performed a median 3 months after screening showed a significant decrease (<12 kPa) among 30% (six of 20), and this was independent of alcohol consumption, BMI, age and gender. In 29 patients where liver biopsy was performed a LSM > 16 kPa predicted cirrhosis with 88.9% sensitivity and 90% specificity.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: this study examined the clinical utility and precision of routine screening for alcohol and other drug use among women attending a public antenatal service. STUDY DESIGN: a survey of clients and audit of clinical charts. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: clients attending an antenatal clinic of a large tertiary hospital in Queensland, Australia, from October to December 2009. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: data were collected from two sources. First, 32 women who reported use of alcohol or other drugs during pregnancy at initial screening were then asked to complete a full substance use survey. Second, data were collected from charts of 349 new clients who attended the antenatal clinic during the study period. Both sensitivity (86%, 67%) and positive predictive value (100%, 92%) for alcohol and other drug use respectively, were high. Only 15% of surveyed women were uncomfortable about being screened for substance use in pregnancy, yet the chart audit revealed poor staff compliance. During the study period, 25% of clients were either not screened adequately or not at all. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTISE: despite recommended universal screening in pregnancy and the apparent acceptance by our participants, alcohol and other drug (A&OD) screening in the antenatal setting remains problematic. Investigation into the reasons behind, and ways to overcome, the low screening rate could improve health outcomes for mothers and children in this at-risk group. Targeted education and training for midwives may form part of the solution as these clinicians have a key role in implementing prevention and early intervention strategies.",

        "abstract": "Tumor drug delivery is a complex phenomenon affected by several elements in addition to drug or delivery vehicle's physico-chemical properties. A key factor is tumor microvasculature with complex effects including convective transport, high interstitial pressure and enhanced vascular permeability due to the presence of \"leaky vessels\". Current in vitro models of the tumor microenvironment for evaluating drug delivery are oversimplified and, as a result, show poor correlation with in vivo performance. In this study, we report on the development of a novel microfluidic platform that models the tumor microenvironment more accurately, with physiologically and morphologically realistic microvasculature including endothelial cell lined leaky capillary vessels along with 3D solid tumors. Endothelial cells and 3D spheroids of cervical tumor cells were co-cultured in the networks. Drug vehicle screening was demonstrated using GFP gene delivery by different formulations of nanopolymers. The synthetic tumor network was successful in predicting in vivo delivery efficiencies of the drug vehicles. The developed assay will have critical applications both in basic research, where it can be used to develop next generation delivery vehicles, and in drug discovery where it can be used to study drug transport and delivery efficacy in realistic tumor microenvironment, thereby enabling drug compound and/or delivery vehicle screening.",

        "abstract": "Over the past few years, establishment and adaptation of cell-based assays for drug development and testing has become an important topic in high-throughput screening (HTS). Most new assays are designed to rapidly detect specific cellular effects reflecting action at various targets. However, although more complex than cell-free biochemical test systems, HTS assays using monolayer or suspension cultures still reflect a highly artificial cellular environment and may thus have limited predictive value for the clinical efficacy of a compound. Today's strategies for drug discovery and development, be they hypothesis free or mechanism based, require facile, HTS-amenable test systems that mimic the human tissue environment with increasing accuracy in order to optimize preclinical and preanimal selection of the most active molecules from a large pool of potential effectors, for example, against solid tumors. Indeed, it is recognized that 3-dimensional cell culture systems better reflect the in vivo behavior of most cell types. However, these 3-D test systems have not yet been incorporated into mainstream drug development operations. This article addresses the relevance and potential of 3-D in vitro systems for drug development, with a focus on screening for novel antitumor drugs. Examples of 3-D cell models used in cancer research are given, and the advantages and limitations of these systems of intermediate complexity are discussed in comparison with both 2-D culture and in vivo models. The most commonly used 3-D cell culture systems, multicellular spheroids, are emphasized due to their advantages and potential for rapid development as HTS systems. Thus, multicellular tumor spheroids are an ideal basis for the next step in creating HTS assays, which are predictive of in vivo antitumor efficacy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the diversity in paediatric vision and hearing screening programmes in Europe. METHODS: Themes for comparison of screening programmes derived from literature were used to compile three questionnaires on vision, hearing, and public health screening. Tests used, professions involved, age, and frequency of testing seem to influence sensitivity, specificity, and costs most. Questionnaires were sent to ophthalmologists, orthoptists, otolaryngologists, and audiologists involved in paediatric screening in all EU full-member, candidate, and associate states. Answers were cross-checked. RESULTS: Thirty-nine countries participated; 35 have a vision screening programme, 33 a nation-wide neonatal hearing screening programme. Visual acuity (VA) is measured in 35 countries, in 71% of these more than once. First measurement of VA varies from three to seven years of age, but is usually before age five. At age three and four, picture charts, including Lea Hyvarinen, are used most; in children over four, Tumbling-E and Snellen. As first hearing screening test, otoacoustic emission is used most in healthy neonates, and auditory brainstem response in premature newborns. The majority of hearing testing programmes are staged; children are referred after 1-4 abnormal tests. Vision screening is performed mostly by paediatricians, ophthalmologists, or nurses. Funding is mostly by health insurance or state. Coverage was reported as >95% in half of countries, but reporting was often not first-hand. CONCLUSION: Largest differences were found in VA charts used (12), professions involved in vision screening (10), number of hearing screening tests before referral (1-4), and funding sources (8).",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cumulative risk of a false-positive screening result in European mammographic screening programmes, and examine the rates and procedures of further assessment.\\n\\nMETHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify studies of the cumulative risk of a false-positive result in European screening programmes (390,000 women). We then examined aggregate data, cross-sectional information about further assessment procedures among women with positive results in 20 mammographic screening programmes from 17 countries (1.7 million initial screens, 5.9 million subsequent screens), collected by the European Network for Information on Cancer project (EUNICE).\\n\\nRESULTS: The estimated cumulative risk of a false-positive screening result in women aged 50-69 undergoing 10 biennial screening tests varied from 8% to 21% in the three studies examined (pooled estimate 19.7%). The cumulative risk of an invasive procedure with benign outcome ranged from 1.8% to 6.3% (pooled estimate 2.9%). The risk of undergoing surgical intervention with benign outcome was 0.9% (one study only). From the EUNICE project, the proportions of all screening examinations in the programmes resulting in needle biopsy were 2.2% and 1.1% for initial and subsequent screens, respectively, though the rates differed between countries; the corresponding rates of surgical interventions among women without breast cancer were 0.19% and 0.07%.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The specific investigative procedures following a recall should be considered when examining the cumulative risk of a false-positive screening result. Most women with a positive screening test undergo a non-invasive assessment procedure. Only a small proportion of recalled women undergo needle biopsy, and even fewer undergo surgical intervention.",

        "abstract": "To compare the performance of screening mammography in the USA and the UK, a consecutive sample of screening mammograms was obtained in women aged 50 and older from 1996 to 1999 who participated in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium in the USA (n = 978,591) and the National Health Service Breast Cancer Screening Program in the UK (n = 3.94 million), including 6943 diagnosed with breast cancer within 12 months of screening. Recall rates were defined as the percentage of screening mammograms with a recommendation for further evaluation including diagnostic mammography, ultrasound, clinical examination or biopsy, and cancer detection rates including invasive cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed within 12 months of a screening mammogram. All results were stratified by whether examinations were first or subsequent and adjusted to a standard age distribution. Among women who underwent a first screening mammogram, 13.3% of women in the USA versus 7.2% of women in the UK were recalled for further evaluation (relative risk for recall 1.9; 95% CI 1.8-1.9). For subsequent examinations recall rates were approximately 50% lower, but remained twice as high in the USA as in the UK. A similar percentage of women underwent biopsy in each setting, but rates of percutaneous biopsy were lower and rates of open surgical biopsy were higher in the USA. Women undergo screening approximately every 18 months in the USA and every 36 months in the UK. Based on a 20-year period of screening, the estimated percentage of women who would be recalled for additional testing was nearly threefold higher in the USA. The number of cancers detected was also higher in the USA (55 versus 43), and most of the increase was in the detection of small invasive and in situ cancers. The numbers of large cancers detected ( > 2 cm) were very similar between the two countries. Recall rates are approximately two to three times higher in the USA than in the UK. Importantly, despite less frequent screening in the USA, there are no substantial differences in the rates of detection of large cancers. Efforts to improve mammographic screening in the USA should target lowering the recall rate without reducing the cancer detection rate.",

To identify the main barriers to achieving comprehensive population coverage. To analyse referrals to ophthalmology and their outcome as a measure of previously unmet need. To assess the influence of modality of screening. SETTING: Three local health board areas in North Wales. METHODS: Establishment of a district diabetes register to hold records of all patients and subserve call-recall of general practitioner (GP) sole-care patients for screening by optometrists or digital photography. Hospital attenders were screened in diabetic clinic by direct ophthalmoscopy. Data were collected for years 1 and 2 of operation of the scheme. RESULTS: The system held a screening record for 86% of diabetic patients after year 1 and 93% after year 2. Failure to attend was the major barrier to comprehensive population screening, but this improved in year 2 (P<0.001). Both optometrists and photography identified substantial unmet need: 1% of all GP sole-care patients required immediate laser treatment. Photography was more sensitive than optometrist screening, but the additional retinopathy identified was mostly minor not requiring treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of screening is much more important than modality of screening as a cause of missed sight-threatening retinopathy. A central, district-based patient register system identifies those patients not screened for further follow-up and can produce a high level of population coverage, close to NSC targets. Such schemes are needed, particularly to support primary care diabetes management.",

        "abstract": "Contemporary small-molecular drug discovery frequently involves the screening of large compound files as a core activity. Subsequently cost, speed, and safety become critical issues. In order to meet this need. numerous technologies have been developed to allow mix and measure approaches.. facilitate miniaturization, and to increase speed and to minimize the use of potentially hazardous reagents such as radioactive materials. However, despite the on-paper advantages of these new technologies, risks can remain undefined. For example, the question of whether the novel method will facilitate identification of active chemical series in a way that is comparable with conventional methods arises. In order to address this question, we have taken the approach of carrying out experiments to directly compare the Output Of high-throughput screens using a given novel approach and a traditional method. The concordance between the screening methods call then be determined via comparison of the numbers and structures of the active molecules identified. This article describes the approach taken in our laboratory to minimize variability in such experiments and shows data that exemplifies the general result of lower than expected concordance. Statistical modeling was Subsequently used to facilitate this interpretation. The model used beta-distribution function to Generate a real-activity frequency relationship with added normal random error and occasional outliers to represent assay variability. Hence, the effect of assay parameters such as the threshold, the number of real actives, and the number Of Outliers and the standard deviation Could readily be explored. The model was found to describe the data reasonably and moreover was found to be of great utility when it came to planning further optimal experiments. A key conclusion from the model was that concordance between screening methods could appear poor even when one approach is compared with itself. This occurs simply because the result is a function of assay threshold, standard deviation and the true Compound % activity. In response to this finding we have adopted alternative experimental designs that more reliably measure the concordance between screening methods.",

The N-terminal inhibitors of Hsp90 that are in ongoing clinical trials as antitumor agents have unfortunately shown disappointing efficacies in the clinic. Thus, novel inhibitors of the Hsp90 machine with a different mechanism of action are urgently needed. We report here the development of a novel high-throughput screening assay platform to identify small-molecule inhibitors of Hsp90 and its co-chaperones. This assay quantitatively measures the ability of Hsp90 and its co-chaperones to refold/protect the progesterone receptor, a physiological client of Hsp90, in a 96-well plate format. We screened the National Institutes of Health clinical collection drug library and identified capsaicin as a hit molecule. Capsaicin is a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for topical use in pain management. Cell survival assays showed that capsaicin selectively kills cancer cells and destabilizes several Hsp90 client proteins. Thus, our data may explain the seemingly pleotropic effect of capsaicin.",

Virtual high throughput screening (VHTS) is one of the efficient approaches to obtain lead structures for a given target. Strategic application of different screening filters like pharmacophore mapping, shape-based, ligand-based, molecular similarity etc., in combination with other drug design protocols provide invaluable insights in lead identification and optimization. Screening of large databases using these computational methods provides potential lead compounds, thus triggering a meaningful interplay between computations and experiments. In this review, we present a critical account on the relevance of molecular modelling approaches in general, lead optimization and virtual screening methods in particular for new lead identification. The importance of developing reliable scoring functions for non-bonded interactions has been highlighted, as it is an extremely important measure for the reliability of scoring function. The lead optimization and new lead design has also been illustrated with examples. The importance of employing a combination of general and target specific screening protocols has also been highlighted.",

The core of the system consisted of a chip-based platform for automated sample delivery from a 96-well plate and subsequent analysis based on noncovalent interactions. Human fatty acid binding protein, H-FABP (heart) and A-FABP (adipose), with small potential ligands was analyzed. The technique has been compared with a previously reported method based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and excellent correlation with the found hits was obtained. In the current MS screening method, the cycle time per sample was 1.1 min, which is approximately 50 times faster than NMR for single compounds and approximately 5 times faster for compound mixtures. High reproducibility was achieved, and the protein consumption was in the range of 88 to 100 picomoles per sample. Futhermore, a novel protocol for preparation of A-FABP without the natural ligand is presented. The described screening approach is suitable for ligand screening very early in the drug discovery process before conventional high-throughput screens (HTS) are developed and/or used as a secondary screening for ligands identified by HTS.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Blood from the umbilical cord (cord blood) is screened for haemoglobinopathies in several neonatal screening programmes, as well as before banking as a source of stem cells. We investigated the pre-analytical and analytical aspects of neonatal screening for haemoglobinopathies on liquid cord blood using the Sebia Haemoglobin kit. We give an interpretation of the results as well as a proposed scheme for reporting of the results. METHODS: A neonatal screening programme on liquid cord blood has been performed in all labour wards in Brussels since 1994. Using that material, the screening methods of isoelectric focusing and capillary zone electrophoresis were compared using 962 cord blood samples. From December 2008 to December 2010, 47,388 neonatal samples were analysed by capillary electrophoresis as the first-line method for neonatal screening. High-performance liquid chromatography was used as the second-line method. RESULTS: Capillary zone electrophoresis on liquid cord blood enabled the detection of all clinically significant haemoglobin variants, significant levels of Hb Bart's, and \u03b2-thalassaemia major. Among the 47,388 neonatal samples tested, 362 (0.7%) were suspected to be contaminated with maternal blood, but no diagnostic error was reported retrospectively for a major haemoglobinopathy. Recommendations for the interpretation and reporting of results of neonatal screening for haemoglobinopathies using the Sebia Haemoglobin kit are proposed. CONCLUSIONS: A routine capillary electrophoresis kit adapted to neonatal screening and liquid cord blood is reliable for screening for haemoglobinopathies. It enables early detection and reporting of all major haemoglobinopathies and most minor ones. It also enables use of a simple scheme to report the results.",

        "title": "Effect of a pre-screening survey on attendance in colorectal cancer screening: A double-randomized study in Finland.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To explore effects of a pre-screening life style survey on the subsequent attendance proportion in colorectal cancer screening. SETTING: Finnish colorectal cancer screening programme in 2011. DESIGN: Double randomized and controlled follow-up design. METHODS: The study population comprised of 31,951 individuals born in 1951. In 2010 to a random sample of every sixth (n = 5,312) person we sent a 7-paged life style questionnaire, and to another random sample of every sixth person (n = 5,336) a 10-paged life style and quality of life questionnaire. One year later, in 2011, 31,484 individuals of the original cohort were independently randomized (1:1) for colorectal cancer screening (n = 15,748) or control group (n = 15,736). Of those who were invited for screening, 5185 had received a questionnaire during the previous year. RESULTS: 5870 individuals (55.1 %) responded to the questionnaire in 2010. The overall attendance at screening in 2011 was 59.0 % in those born in 1951 (i.e. the 60-year-olds). In those who had been sent the survey the attendance in screening was 56.6% (57.3% for the short and 56.0% for the long questionnaire) and in those who had not received the questionnaire it was 60.2% (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the observed reduction in attendance in those who had been sent a questionnaire earlier is generally true. Thus, if any survey is enclosed in the screening invitation, this finding should be taken into account when planning the programme. Any extra effort requested may reduce the attendance proportion for screening, reducing the population level impact of screening.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To design a high drug loading formulation of self-microemulsifying/micelle system.\\n\\nMETHODS: A poorly-soluble model drug (CH5137291), 8 hydrophilic surfactants (HS), 10 lipophilic surfactants (LS), 5 oils, and PEG400 were used. A high loading formulation was designed by a following stepwise approach using a high-throughput formulation screening (HTFS) system: (1) an oil/solvent was selected by solubility of the drug; (2) a suitable HS for highly loading was selected by the screenings of emulsion/micelle size and phase stability in binary systems (HS, oil/solvent) with increasing loading levels; (3) a LS that formed a broad SMEDDS/micelle area on a phase diagram containing the HS and oil/solvent was selected by the same screenings; (4) an optimized formulation was selected by evaluating the loading capacity of the crystalline drug. Aqueous solubility behavior and oral absorption (Beagle dog) of the optimized formulation were compared with conventional formulations (jet-milled, PEG400).\\n\\nRESULTS: As an optimized formulation, d-\u03b1-tocopheryl polyoxyethylene 1000 succinic ester: PEG400\u2009=\u20098:2 was selected, and achieved the target loading level (200\u2009mg/mL). The formulation formed fine emulsion/micelle (49.1\u2009nm), and generated and maintained a supersaturated state at a higher level compared with the conventional formulations. In the oral absorption test, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of the optimized formulation was 16.5-fold higher than that of the jet-milled formulation.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The high loading formulation designed by the stepwise approach using the HTFS system improved the oral absorption of the poorly-soluble model drug.",

        "abstract": "The quality of the compound library is a critical success factor in every high-throughput screening campaign. Screening solutions have to be prepared with a high level of process control to ensure the correct identity and initial concentration of each compound. However, even under optimized storage conditions, a certain level of degradation in solution cannot be avoided. Therefore, regular quality control and eventual removal of solutions from the screening deck is necessary. Because solution preparation, especially the weighing of compounds, is a tedious and often manual task, a regular resolubilization of compounds is difficult to achieve. By complete automation of the solution preparation, the authors have laid the foundation for a life cycle management of screening solutions. They demonstrate how a combination of quality and process control leads to a continuous improvement of the screening library. In presenting an automation concept, they show how a series of innovative process optimizations led to a high-performance system that achieves full industrialization of solution preparation.",

        "abstract": "We describe here RepurposeVS for the reliable prediction of drug-target signatures using X-ray protein crystal structures. RepurposeVS is a virtual screening method that incorporates docking, drug-centric and protein-centric 2D/3D fingerprints with a rigorous mathematical normalization procedure to account for the variability in units and provide high-resolution contextual information for drug-target binding. Validity was confirmed by the following: (1) providing the greatest enrichment of known drug binders for multiple protein targets in virtual screening experiments, (2) determining that similarly shaped protein target pockets are predicted to bind drugs of similar 3D shapes when RepurposeVS is applied to 2,335 human protein targets, and (3) determining true biological associations in vitro for mebendazole (MBZ) across many predicted kinase targets for potential cancer repurposing. Since RepurposeVS is a drug repurposing-focused method, benchmarking was conducted on a set of 3,671 FDA approved and experimental drugs rather than the Database of Useful Decoys (DUDE) so as to streamline downstream repurposing experiments. We further apply RepurposeVS to explore the overall potential drug repurposing space for currently approved drugs. RepurposeVS is not computationally intensive and increases performance accuracy, thus serving as an efficient and powerful in silico tool to predict drug-target associations in drug repurposing.",

        "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum causes severe malaria infections in millions of people every year. The parasite is developing resistance to the most common antimalarial drugs, which creates an urgent need for new therapeutics. A promising and attractive target for antimalarial drug design is the bifunctional enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-6-phosphogluconolactonase (PfGluPho) of P. falciparum, which catalyzes the key step in the parasites' pentose phosphate pathway. In this study, we describe the development of a high-throughput screening assay to identify small-molecule inhibitors of recombinant PfGluPho. The optimized assay was used to screen three small-molecule compound libraries-namely, LOPAC (Sigma-Aldrich, 1280 compounds), Spectrum (MicroSource Discovery Systems, 1969 compounds), and DIVERSet (ChemBridge, 49 971 compounds). These pilot screens identified 899 compounds that inhibited PfGluPho activity by at least 50%. Selected compounds were further studied to determine IC(50) values in an orthogonal assay, the type of inhibition and reversibility, and effects on P. falciparum growth. Screening results and follow-up studies for selected PfGluPho inhibitors are presented. Our high-throughput screening assay may provide the basis to identify novel and urgently needed antimalarial drugs.",

The recent development and availability of devices capable of performing high-throughput electrophysiology-based screening have brought the need to validate these tools by producing data that are consistent with results obtained with conventional electrophysiological methods. In this study, we compared the response properties of h\u03b13\u03b24 and h\u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors to their endogenous ligand acetylcholine (ACh) using three separate electrophysiology platforms: Dynaflow (low-throughput, manual system), PatchXpress 7000A (medium-throughput automated platform), and IonWorks Barracuda (high-throughput automated platform). We found that despite the differences in methodological approaches between these technologies, the EC(50) values from the ACh dose-response curves were consistent between all three platforms. In addition, we have validated the IonWorks Barracuda for both competitive and uncompetitive inhibition assays by using the competitive nicotinic antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidin (DH\u03b2E) and uncompetitive nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the utility of a custom-written algorithm for generating dose-response curves from multiple extrapolated current metrics that allows for discriminating between competitive and uncompetitive inhibition while maintaining high-throughput capacity. This study provides validation of the consistency of results using low-, medium-, and high-throughput electrophysiology platforms and supports their use for screening nicotinic compounds.",

Here, the authors examine the interaction of regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins with the G-protein Galphao, using a flow cytometry protein interaction assay (FCPIA). FCPIA accurately measures nanomolar binding constants of this protein-protein interaction and has been used in high-throughput screening. This report focuses on 5 RGS proteins (4, 6, 7, 8, and 16). To increase the content of screens, the authors assessed high-throughput screening of these RGS proteins in multiplex, by establishing binding constants of each RGS with Galphao in isolation, and then in a multiplex format with 5 RGS proteins present. To use this methodology as a higher-content multiplex protein-protein interaction screen, they established Z-factor values for RGS proteins in multiplex of 0.73 to 0.92, indicating this method is suitable for screening using FCPIA. To increase throughput, they also compressed a set of 8000 compounds by combining 4 compounds in a single assay well. Subsequent deconvolution of the compounds mixtures verified the identification of active compounds at specific RGS targets in their mixtures using the polyplexed FCPIA method.",

        "abstract": "Gliomas are the most devastating of primary adult malignant brain tumors. These tumors are highly infiltrative and can arise from cells with extensive self-renewal capability and chemoresistance, frequently termed glioma-propagating cells (GPCs). GPCs are thus the plausible culprits of tumor recurrence. Treatment strategies that eradicate GPCs will greatly improve disease outcome. Such findings support the use of GPCs as in vitro cellular systems for small-molecule screening. However, the nuances in using GPCs as a cellular screening platform are not trivial. These slow-growing cells are typically cultured as suspension, spheroid structures in serum-free condition supplemented with growth factors. Consequently, replenishment of growth factors throughout the screening period must occur to maintain cells in their undifferentiated state, as the more lineage-committed, differentiated cells are less tumorigenic. We present a case study of a small-molecule screen conducted with GPCs and explain how unique sphere activity assays were implemented to distinguish drug efficacies against the long-term, self-renewing fraction, as opposed to transient-amplifying progenitors, the latter of which are detected in conventional viability assays. We identified Polo-like kinase 1 as a regulator of GPC survival. Finally, we leveraged on public glioma databases to illustrate GPC contribution to disease progression and patient survival outcome.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Early detection through regular screening is a measure used in certain cancer prevention strategies. This approach has been advocated for the prevention of oral cancers in the UK. The objective of this study was to assess whether people at higher risk of oral cancer in the UK visit dentists on a regular basis, and thereby afford opportunities for oral cancer screening.\\n\\nMETHODS: Data from two large national surveys were used. Firstly, data from the Health Survey for England, 2001, were used to assess the relationship between dental attendance (the outcome measure) and recognized oral cancer risk factors; there were 13,784 participants with complete data. We used known risk factors for oral cancer (age >40 years, male sex, alcohol intake >28 units per week, cigarettes >20 per day, and fruit and vegetables <5 times a day) to generate a risk score for oral cancer. Logistic regression was used to compute the odds ratios for regular dental attendance according to risk score. All analyses used education and social class as covariates. We also used data from the British Household Panel Survey to assess whether dental attendance behaviour is sustained over a set period of time (5,547 participants with complete data).\\n\\nRESULTS: In persons in the higher risk category (as defined above) of the five risk factors, age, sex, alcohol, smoking, and fruit/vegetables, 68%, 56%, 52%, 43% and 60%, respectively reported regular dental check-ups. In persons with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of these risk factors, the odds ratio for regular dental check-ups was 1.00, 0.93, 0.81, 0.64, 0.50 and 0.28, respectively. The probability of regular dental attendance was low in all groups with a higher risk of oral cancer. In the longitudinal sample, the low probability of visiting a dentist regularly was stable over time.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Opportunistic screening for oral cancer in general dental practice in the UK is unlikely to be an effective preventive strategy.",

Methods: A specialist nurse obtained details of living first-degree relatives from 227 adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia currently or previously attending Oxford lipid clinic after excluding 79 adults without relatives living in Oxfordshire and 48 children. Index cases were asked to invite relatives resident in Oxfordshire for testing. RESULTS: A total of 227 index cases had 1075 first-degree relatives, including 442 adults and 117 children aged < 18 years resident in Oxfordshire. We excluded 171 previously screened adults and 46 for other reasons. Among 225 eligible adult relatives, 28 responders (12%) planned to consult their general practitioner and 52 (23%) attended the clinic for testing. Parents of 113 children (97%) wanted them tested. The positive diagnostic rate was 29% (15/52) in adults and 32% (36/113) in children. Screening increased prevalence by 14.4%, from 0.58/1000 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.52-0.65) to 0.67/1000 (95% CI 0.60-0.73), representing 33.5% of predicted cases. CONCLUSIONS: Cascade screening conducted by a specialist hospital clinic within its population catchment area did not substantially increase the prevalence of diagnosed familial hypercholesterolaemia. To maximize response rates, clinic staff need to approach relatives directly. Validated age, sex and country-specific diagnostic criteria should be defined, possibly with access to DNA-based tests, to help resolve diagnostic uncertainty.",

The ability to fabricate complex microfluidic architectures has allowed scientists to create new experimental formats for processing ultra-small analytical volumes in short periods and with high efficiency. The development of such microfluidic systems has been driven by a range of fundamental features that accompany miniaturization. These include the ability to handle small sample volumes, ultra-low fabrication costs, reduced analysis times, enhanced operational flexibility, facile automation, and the ability to integrate functional components within complex analytical schemes.

        "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are one of the most popular and proven target classes for therapeutic intervention. The increased appreciation for allosteric modulation, receptor oligomerization, and biased agonism has led to the development of new assay platforms that seek to capitalize on these aspects of GPCR biology. High-content screening is particularly well suited for GPCR drug discovery given the ability to image and quantify changes in multiple cellular parameters, to resolve subcellular structures, and to monitor events within a physiologically relevant environment. Focusing on the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P1) receptor, we evaluated the utility of high-content approaches in hit identification efforts by developing and applying assays to monitor \u03b2-arrestin translocation, GPCR internalization, and GPCR recycling kinetics. Using these approaches in combination with more traditional GPCR screening assays, we identified compounds whose unique pharmacological profiles would have gone unnoticed if using a single platform. In addition, we identified a compound that induces an atypical pattern of \u03b2-arrestin translocation and GPCR recycling kinetics. Our results highlight the value of high-content imaging in GPCR drug discovery efforts and emphasize the value of a multiassay approach to study pharmacological properties of compounds of interest.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Screening assays have traditionally utilized reporter labels to quantify biological responses relevant to the disease state of interest. However, there are limitations associated with the use of labels that may be overcome with temporal measurements possible with label-free. AREAS COVERED: This review comprises general and system-specific information from literature searches using PubMed, published books and the authors' personal experience. This review highlights the label-free approaches in the context of various applications. The authors also note technical issues relevant to the development of label-free assays and their application to HTS. EXPERT OPINION: The limitations associated with the use of transfected cell lines and the use of label-based assays are gradually being realized. As such, greater emphasis is being placed on label-free biophysical techniques using native cell lines. The introduction of 96- and 384-well plate label-free systems is helping to broker a wider acceptance of these approaches in high-throughput screening. However, potential users of the technologies remain skeptical, primarily because the physical basis of the signals generated, and their contextual relevance to cell biology and signal transduction, has not been fully elucidated. Until this is done, these new technology platforms are more likely to complement, rather than replace, traditional screening platforms.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate provincial, regional and national newborn screening coverage throughout China. METHOD: Information about newborn screening was collected using a survey questionnaire from neonatal screening laboratories in China in 2006-2007. The total number of live births at the provincial and national levels was obtained from the Maternal and Child Health Information System (MCHIS) and the State Statistics Bureau (SSB), respectively, and was used to calculate the neonatal screening coverage at the provincial, regional and national levels. RESULTS: There were 185 laboratories providing neonatal screening services in China in 2007. The rates of national screening coverage in 2006 and 2007 were 31.27% and 39.96%, respectively, based on live birth numbers reported by the SSB. Both of these estimates are lower than those calculated from live birth numbers reported by the MCHIS. The rates of coverage in the Eastern, Middle and Western regions were about 84.90%, 30.41% and 19.82%, respectively, based on the live birth numbers reported by the MCHIS. CONCLUSION: There are disparities in screening coverage between regions and between provinces throughout China, but the extent of this is difficult to ascertain because of the different systems of reporting live births. To calculate nationwide screening coverage it is probably appropriate to use the SSB data on live births. However, for provincial screening coverage the calculation is probably best based on the number of live births reported by the MCHIS once the validity of the MCHIS data is verified.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To provide reliable estimates of the long-term cost-effectiveness of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in men.\\n\\nMETHODS: A Markov health economic decision model for screening is described and extrapolated to 30 years. The strategy modelled involves a one-off scan at age 65 years, with annual and three-monthly follow-up scans for small and medium aneurysms, respectively. Referral for elective surgery occurs at an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm. Model parameters are estimated from patient-level data from the UK Multi-centre Aneurysm Screening Study. Model structure is validated on this trial's data, and input parameter uncertainty is addressed by probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Costs and life-years gained are obtained for both screening and no systematic screening strategies.\\n\\nRESULTS: Cost-effectiveness improves dramatically when considered over longer timescales. Taking a 30-year perspective, screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in men is highly cost-effective at 2320 pounds per life-year gained (95% uncertainty interval: 1600 pounds to 4240 pounds). Adjusting life-years for the age-specific health-related quality of life experienced in this population gave a figure of 2970 pounds (95% uncertainty interval: 2030 pounds to 5430 pounds) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The additional cost of screening the UK male population is estimated to be 19 m pounds per year.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The long-term cost-effectiveness of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in men is highly attractive and this evidence provides further support for a national screening programme in the UK.",

        "abstract": "Fragment-based screening is an emerging technology which is used as an alternative to high-throughput screening (HTS), and often in parallel. Fragment screening focuses on very small compounds. Because of their small size and simplicity, fragments exhibit a low to medium binding affinity (mM to &#956;M) and must therefore be screened at high concentration in order to detect binding events. Since some issues are associated with high-concentration screening in biochemical assays, biophysical methods are generally employed in fragment screening campaigns. Moreover, these techniques are very sensitive and some of them can give precise information about the binding mode of fragments, which facilitates the mandatory hit-to-lead optimization. One of the main advantages of fragment-based screening is that fragment hits generally exhibit a strong binding with respect to their size, and their subsequent optimization should lead to compounds with better pharmacokinetic properties compared to molecules evolved from HTS hits. In other words, fragments are interesting starting points for drug discovery projects. Besides, the chemical space of low-complexity compounds is very limited in comparison to that of drug-like molecules, and thus easier to explore with a screening library of limited size. Furthermore, the &#8220;combinatorial explosion&#147; effect ensures that the resulting combinations of interlinked binding fragments may cover a significant part of &#8220;drug-like&#147; chemical space. In parallel to experimental screening, virtual screening techniques, dedicated to fragments or wider compounds, are gaining momentum in order to further reduce the number of compounds to test. This article is a review of the latest news in both experimental and in silico virtual screening in the fragment-based discovery field. Given the specificity of this journal, special attention will be given to fragment library design.",

        "abstract": "The present study describes a novel methodology for the detection of reactive compounds using in vitro peptide-trapping and liquid chromatography-high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Compounds that contain electrophilic groups can covalently bind to nucleophilic moieties in proteins and form adducts. Such adducts are thought to be associated with drug-mediated toxicity and therefore represent potential liabilities in drug discovery programs. In addition, reactive compounds identified in biological screening can be associated with data that can be misinterpreted if the reactive nature of the compound is not appreciated. In this work, to facilitate the triage of hits from high-throughput screening (HTS), a novel assay was developed to monitor the formation of covalent peptide adducts by compounds suspected to be chemically reactive. The assay consists of in vitro incubations of test compounds (under conditions of physiological pH) with synthetically prepared peptides presenting a variety of nucleophilic moieties such as cysteine, lysine, histidine, arginine, serine, and tyrosine. Reaction mixtures were analyzed using full-scan LC-HRMS, the data were interrogated using postacquisition data mining, and modified amino acids were identified by subsequent LC-HRMS/mass spectrometry. The study demonstrated that in vitro nucleophilic peptide trapping followed by LC-HRMS analysis is a useful approach for screening of intrinsically reactive compounds identified from HTS exercises, which are then removed from follow-up processes, thus obviating the generation of data from biochemical activity assays.",

This study aimed to evaluate LSM as an outreach screening tool for cirrhosis among drug users. Methods. In a cross-sectional study among drug users attending treatment centres, LSM was performed using the Fibroscan device and blood collected for serological testing. Individuals with LSM >8 kPa were referred to the hospital for treatment evaluation and individuals with LSM >2 kPa were recommended a liver biopsy. Results. Among 175 drug users negative for hepatitis C, 13% had an LSM of 8-11.9 kPa and 4% had an LSM of >12 kPa; elevated LSM was associated with a body mass index of >30. Among 128 drug users with chronic hepatitis C, 20% had an LSM of 8-11. 9 kPa and 21% had an LSM of >12 kPa (P < 0. 001). Repeat LSM at liver biopsy performed median 3 months after screening showed significant decrease (<12 kPa) among 30% (6 of 20). In 29 patients where liver biopsy was performed, an LSM of >16 kPa predicted cirrhosis with 88. 9% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Conclusions. The LSM is a feasible screening tool for cirrhosis among drug users, but management of these patients should not be based on a single elevated LSM.",

The X-ray crystal structure of agonist-bound \u03b1(7) acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) has been recognized as the most appropriate template to model the ligand-binding domain of nAChR for studying the molecular mechanism of the receptor-ligand interactions. Virtual screening of the National Cancer Institute diversity set, a library of 1990 compounds with nonredundant pharmacophore profiles, using AutoDock against AChBPs revealed 51 potential candidates. In vitro radioligand competition assays using [(3)H] epibatidine against the AChBPs from the freshwater snails, Lymnaea stagnalis, and from the marine species, Aplysia californica and the mutant (AcY55W), revealed seven compounds from the list of candidates that had micromolar to nanomolar affinities for the AChBPs. Further investigation on \u03b1(7)nAChR expressing in Xenopus oocytes and on the recombinant receptors with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based calcium sensor expressing in HEK cells showed that seven compounds were antagonists of \u03b1(7)nAChR, only one compound (NSC34352) demonstrated partial agonistic effect at low dose (10 \u00b5M), and two compounds (NSC36369 and NSC34352) were selective antagonists on \u03b1(7)nAchR with moderate potency. These hits serve as novel templates/scaffolds for development of more potent and specific in the AChR systems.",

        "abstract": "Natural products (NPs) are combinatorial chemical libraries with diversities in chemical structures and pharmacological activities. Screening active compounds is in many cases an important factor in drug discovery. It was not easy to screen out the bioactive compounds from complex extracts consisting of many NPs. Development of rapid, effective and accurate methods is in high demand. During last decades, mass spectrometry (MS)-based strategies, combining isolation, structures, and bioactivity in a single run, were programmed in the NPs screening. The current article reviews different assay formats and applications of MS-based methods for screening of active NPs. This review is divided into three sections based on methods classification. The first part introduces binding-based screening methods that directly assess the binding characteristics of a candidate molecule to its target. The second part describes function-based screening methods that monitor the functional output of a target-dependent biochemical reaction. The third part briefly discusses serum pharmacochemistry-based screening methods that analyze absorbed components and metabolites in plasma after oral administration of NPs extracts.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To improve the effective use of screening appointment time on mobile units and even out the daily workload. Setting Ten sites screened by three Breast Test Wales mobile units between January and August 1999. Methods Women who had never attended for screening in previous screening rounds were identified and block booked into dedicated sessions at a rate of up to eight women per five minute slot. After piloting in the first site, the number in each slot was varied depending on how many rounds of screening these women had failed to attend. The numbers of women attending the remaining days were compared before and after the introduction of the new booking system. Results There was a noticeable difference in uptake rates for previous non-attenders depending on how many screening rounds they had missed. The uptake rate for women who had missed one round of screening was found to average 20%. For those who had missed two previous rounds it averaged 9% and for those who had missed three it averaged 3%. Before the change in booking procedure, the average attending each day was 51 (median 51), but after the change, the average was 57 (median 59). The overall time needed was decreased. Conclusions Booking dedicated sessions for previous non-attenders results is a more effective use of resources, reducing screening time in every site and levelling out attendance.",

DESIGN: A retrospective, new-user cohort study (between July 1, 2004, and June 30, 2006) using Medicaid claims data. SETTINGS: California, Missouri, and Oregon. PATIENTS: A total of 5370 children (aged 6-17 years) without diabetes mellitus taking SGA drugs and 15,000 children without diabetes taking albuterol (control) but no SGA drugs. INTERVENTION: Findings 1 year after recommendations from the American Diabetes Association and American Psychiatric Association called for metabolic screening of patients receiving SGA drugs. OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum glucose and lipid testing, 6-month incidence of diabetes, and dyslipidemia disturbances. RESULTS: Glucose screening was performed in 1699 (31.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 30.4%-32.9%]) SGA-treated children vs 1891 (12.6% [12.1%-13.2%]) control individuals. Lipid testing was performed in 720 (13.4% [95% CI, 12.5%-14.4%]) SGA-treated children vs 458 (3.1% [2.8%-3.3%]) controls. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, children with serious and/or multiple psychiatric diagnoses and those who used health care services more intensively were more likely to receive metabolic screening. The case incidence of glucose and lipid disorders was higher in SGA-treated vs albuterol-treated children (8.9 per 1000 children [95% CI, 6.6%-11.8%] vs 4.9 per 1000 children [3.9%-6.2%]; and 9.7 per 1000 children [95% CI, 7.2%-12.7%] vs 4.6 per 1000 children [95% CI, 3.6%-5.8%], respectively). CONCLUSION: Most children starting treatment with SGA medications in this public sector sample did not receive recommended glucose and lipid screening.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Universal newborn hearing screening has become standard practice in many countries. The primary goal of this study was to assess the impact of early identification of permanent childhood hearing loss on oral communication development. SETTING: Participants were recruited from three clinical programmes in two cities in the province of Ontario, Canada. The study sample was born during two consecutive periods of newborn hearing screening. The first period, prior to 2002, was targeted on high-risk infants only, and the second, from 2002, included both high- and standard-risk infants (universal newborn hearing screening - UNHS). All children were enrolled in rehabilitation programmes focused on oral language development. METHODS: In this multicentre observational study, 65 children under the age of five years with onset of hearing loss before six months of age, 26 identified through systematic newborn screening (14 through targeted screening and 12 through UNHS) and 39 without screening, were assessed with an extensive battery of child- and parent-administered speech and language measures. The degree of hearing loss ranged from mild to profound with 22 children in the mild, moderate and moderately severe categories and 43 in the severe and profound categories. Data are reported for the three-year study period. RESULTS: The screened group of children was identified at a median age of 6.6 (interquartile range, 3.0-8.2) months and children referred from sources other than newborn screening were diagnosed at a median age of 16.5 (interquartile range, 10.2-29.0) months. Assessment of oral communication development showed no significant difference between the screened and unscreened groups. The communication outcomes for children identified before 12 months of age did not differ from those of later identified children. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic screening of newborn hearing results in earlier identification and intervention for children with permanent hearing loss. Superior language outcome following newborn screening was not demonstrable in the setting of this study.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of selective screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) based on identification of a target group of manageable size defined by risk factors for AAA. SETTING: Male residents of Perth, Western Australia, aged 65-83 years, who participated in a randomised controlled trial of ultrasound screening for AAA. METHODS: Eligible men were identified from the electoral roll and invited to attend a screening clinic. Those who attended completed a questionnaire, had a limited physical examination, and underwent an ultrasound examination to identify the maximum diameter of the infrarenal aorta. Data on risk factors collected from the first 8995 men seen were used to calculate a multivariate risk score for the remaining 2755 men who were screened. Centiles of the risk score were used to define potential target groups for screening and the sensitivity and specificity of each of these selective screening strategies were calculated. We repeated the calculation separately for AAAs of at least 30 mm, 40 mm, and 50 mm in diameter. RESULTS: We found that screening half of the male population aged 65-83 years would find approximately 75% of AAAs, regardless of their size, whereas screening only current smokers in this population would find approximately 20% of AAAs. CONCLUSIONS: Selective screening for AAA using easily recognisable risk factors is feasible but is not worthwhile as approximately 25% ofclinically significant cases would be missed.",

Multiple logistic regression analysis yielded a final model that included nine independent predictors of attendance. Patients with the following characteristics were more likely to attend: men; home owners; non-smokers; those who had regular check ups at the dentist; those with better subjective health; those who minded less about having medical tests; those who said they would definitely rather than probably take up the offer of sigmoidoscopy screening; and those who perceived less barriers and more benefits to having the test.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings are broadly consistent with previous studies of screening participation, although subjective health emerged as an important predictor in this study. There was no evidence for \"reverse targeting\": attenders were not at lower (or higher) risk for colorectal cancer compared with non-attenders. The findings relating to attitudes and beliefs could be used in efforts to improve attendance, for example by developing information leaflets that address barriers to screening. Other findings could be used to target interventions to subgroups that have relatively low rates of screening participation.",

This is partly the result of incomparable overdiagnosis estimates in scientific literature, as a variety of denominators are used to calculate the percentage of overdiagnosis in cancer screening. We propose to use the following denominator to calculate the percentage of overdiagnosis: \u2018all cancers detected during the screening period, both interval and screen-detected, in participants of a screening programme\u2019. This denominator is more appropriate than existing denominators because it presents overdiagnosis as a real percentage, is unaffected by attendance percentages, is applicable to all observational study designs, and can be easily recalculated to absolute numbers. This denominator can be widely applied and increases comparability between overdiagnosis estimates, which is needed to correctly present the balance between the benefits and harms of screening.",

        "abstract": "Dietary long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) uptake across cell membranes is mediated principally by fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs). Six subtypes of this transporter are differentially expressed throughout the human and rodent body. To facilitate drugs discovery against FATP subtypes, the authors used mammalian cell lines stably expressing the recombinant human FATP4 and 5 and developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay using a 96-well fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR). LCFA uptake signal-to-background ratios were between 3- and 5-fold. Two 4-aryl-dihydropyrimidinones, j3 and j5, produced inhibition of FATP4 with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (Ic50) of 0.21 and 0.63 M, respectively, and displayed approximately 100-fold selectivity over FATP5. The US Drug Collection library was screened against the FATP5. A hit rate of around 0.4% was observed with a Z' factor of 0.6 {+/-} 0.2. Two confirmed hits are bile acids, chenodiol and ursodiol with an IC50 of 2.4 and 0.22 M, respectively. To increase throughput, a single time point measurement in a 384-well format was developed using the Analyst HT, and the results are comparable with the 96-well format. In conclusion, the FATP4 and 5 cell-based fluorescence assays are suitable for a primary drug screen, whereas differentiated cell lines are useful for a secondary drug screen.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: A computerised model of the Swedish two county trial of mammographic screening was built to explore the applicability of deterministic group modelling for health policy analysis and to examine trade offs between screening interval and population coverage on breast cancer mortality.\\n\\nMETHODS: Powersim system dynamics modelling software running on a PC was used. Model inputs were published data on the populations and screening regimens used in the trial, a Swedish female population life table, incidence of breast cancer in Sweden, 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for mean sojourn time and screening sensitivity, and survival after diagnosis.\\n\\nRESULTS: The model's output--cumulative mortality from breast cancer--agreed closely with trial results. This was robust to uncertainties in key input variables. Furthermore, with hypothetical screening regimes that had a fixed total number of mammograms over a fixed period a positive association was found between more even distribution of mammograms among a population and reduction in breast cancer mortality. For example, screening 50% of a hypothetical population annually produced a 33% reduction in breast cancer mortality, whereas screening 100% of the population every 2 years produced a 48% reduction.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Deterministic group simulation modelling can be used to build reliable, evidence based quantitative models for policy analysis. This opens health policy simulation modelling to epidemiological researchers and will assist them in identifying important information needs--such as breast cancer survival according to sojourn time (the time between cancer being detectable by screening and becoming symptomatic). Scenarios examining reductions in mortality for a given number of mammograms showed that the more equitable the distribution of screening mammograms, the greater the reduction in deaths from breast cancer.",

        "title": "An advance notification letter increases participation in colorectal cancer screening.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of novel invitation strategies on population participation in faecal immunochemical test (FIT)-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. SETTING: A community screening programme in Adelaide, South Australia. METHODS: In total, 2400 people aged 50-74 years were randomly allocated to one of four CRC screening invitation strategies: (a) Control: standard invitation-to-screen letter explaining risk of CRC and the concept, value and method of screening; (b) Risk: invitation with additional messages related to CRC risk; (c) Advocacy: invitation with additional messages related to advocacy for screening from previous screening programme participants and (d) Advance Notification: first, a letter introducing Control letter messages followed by the standard invitation-to-screen. Invitations included an FIT kit. Programme participation rates were determined for each strategy relative to control. Associations between participation and sociodemographic variables were explored. RESULTS: At 12 weeks after invitation, participation was: Control: 237/600 (39.5%); Risk: 242/600 (40.3%); Advocacy: 216/600 (36.0%) and Advance Notification: 290/600 (48.3%). Participation was significantly greater than Control only in the Advance Notification group (Relative risk [RR] 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.43). This effect was apparent as early as two weeks from date of offer; Advance Notification: 151/600 (25.2%) versus Control: 109/600 (18.2%, RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.11-1.73). CONCLUSIONS: Advance notification significantly increased screening participation. The effect may be due to a population shift in readiness to undertake screening, and is consistent with the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change. Risk or lay advocacy strategies did not improve screening participation. Organized screening programmes should consider using advance notification letters to improve programme participation.",

Natural sources present an array of anticoagulants that can be developed as antithrombotic drugs. High-resolution, online screening techniques have been developed for the identification of drug leads from complex mixtures. In this study, we have developed and optimized a microfluidic online screening technique coupled to nano-liquid chromatography (LC) and in parallel with a mass spectrometer for the identification of thrombin and FXa inhibitors in mixtures. Inhibitors eluting from the nano-LC were split postcolumn in a 1:1 ratio; half was fed into a mass spectrometer (where its mass is detected), and the other half was fed into a microfluidic chip (which acts as a microreactor for the online assays). With our platform, thrombin and FXa inhibitors were detected in the assay in parallel with their mass identification. These methods are suitable for the identification of inhibitors from sample amounts as low as sub-microliter volumes.",

DESIGN: Prospective survey of women attending for screening within a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: University Hospital in Teesside. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: 54 women completed a questionnaire immediately after their first transvaginal ultrasound scan. RESULTS: 52 of 54 (96%) questionnaires were suitable for full analysis. The women were unlikely to find the scan was painful, 47 vs three (p<0.001), or embarrassing 45 vs five (p<0.001). Women were more likely to find both a smear, 42 vs eight (p<0.001) and a mammogram, 47 vs two (p<0.001) was more uncomfortable than transvaginal ultrasonography. CONCLUSIONS: Transvaginal ultrasonography is an acceptable tool for screening for ovarian cancer. It is better tolerated than other screening tools such as cervical smear and mammography.",

The role of this ectonucleotidase and its production of adenosine are linked with immune function, angiogenesis, and cancer. NT5E activity is typically assayed either by chromatographic quantification of substrates and products using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or by quantification of free phosphate using malachite green. These methods are not suitable for robust screening assays of NT5E activity. HPLC is not readily suitable for the rapid and efficient assay of multiple samples and malachite green is highly sensitive to the phosphate-containing buffers common in various media and sample buffers. Here the development and validation of a novel high-throughput ectonucleotidase screening assay are described, which makes use of a luciferase-based assay reagent, the Promega CellTiter-Glo kit, to measure the catabolism of AMP by NT5E. This multiwell plate-based assay facilitates the screening of potential ectonucleotidase antagonists and is unaffected by the presence of contaminating phosphate molecules present in screening samples.",

We also provide the readers with a list of resources, from chemoinformatics packages to compound collections, which could be helpful to implement a structure-based virtual screening platform. Then we discuss seventeen recent success stories obtained with various receptor-based in silico methods, performed on experimental structures (X-ray crystallography, 12 cases) or homology models (5 cases) and concerning different target classes, from the design of catalytic site inhibitors to drug-like compounds impeding macromolecular interactions.

However by taking advantages of technologies originally developed for high-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry and applying them to processes considered as bottlenecks in classical natural products chemistry (purification, structure elucidation, sample availability) it is our opinion that natural products can still contribute to the effective discovery of novel bioactive and pharmaceutically relevant metabolites. We describe here several such strategies that if universally implemented, will demonstrate i) whether chemical diversity is truly being accessed, ii) that novel metabolites can be formatted in a manner appropriate for modern screening paradigms, and iii) that natural products can be rapidly identified not only for novelty and pharmaceutical relevance but to assess their true biological origin.",

METHODS: In this paper we review the issues in communication of benefits and harms of medical interventions and discuss these in terms of the principles of the balance sheet proposed in this supplement. RESULTS: The balance sheet can be seen as a tool to convey estimates based on the best available evidence and addressed to a readership wider than just potential screening participants. It reflects a re-assessment of screening efficacy, showing again that screening is effective and brings more benefits than harms. It can be viewed as an opportunity to re-affirm some basic principles of good evidence-based communication. Further research is needed to improve communication strategy, to assess the impact of this communication on women's awareness and to evaluate its utility in the informed decision-making process. CONCLUSION: The balance sheet could be a starting point for a broader vision of informed decision-making in screening, which should also recognize the role played by 'non-numerical' factors on women's choice of participating in breast cancer screening.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To summarize participation and coverage rates in population mammographic screening programmes for breast cancer in Europe. METHODS: We used the European Network for Information on Cancer (EUNICE), a web-based data warehouse (EUNICE Breast Cancer Screening Monitoring, EBCSM) for breast cancer screening, to obtain information on programme characteristics, coverage and participation from its initial application in 10 national and 16 regional programmes in 18 European countries. RESULTS: The total population targeted by the screening programme services covered in the report comprised 26.9 million women predominantly aged 50-69. Most of the collected data relates to 2005, 2006 and/or 2007. The average participation rate across all programmes was 53.4% (range 19.4-88.9% of personally invited); or 66.4% excluding Poland, a large programme that initiated personal invitations in 2007. Thirteen of the 26 programmes achieved the European Union benchmark of acceptable participation (>70%), nine achieved the desirable level (>75%). Despite considerable invitation coverage across all programmes (79.3%, range 50.9-115.2%) only 48.2% (range 28.4-92.1%) of the target population were actually screened. The overall invitation and examination coverage excluding Poland was 70.9% and 50.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the feasibility of European-wide screening monitoring using the EBCSM data warehouse, although further efforts to refine the system and to harmonize standards and data collection practices will be required, to fully integrate all European countries. The more than three-fold difference in the examination coverage should be taken into account in the evaluation of service screening programmes.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of screening for scoliosis has not been established. This study investigated whether patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis detected by screening are detected in an earlier stage of the clinical course, and whether these patients have better outcome than otherwise detected patients. SETTING: The study is a retrospective follow-up study of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis who had completed treatment with a brace, by surgery, or with a brace followed by surgery. Of the 143 patients (born on or after 1 January 1984) consecutively recruited from 12 hospitals in the Netherlands, 125 (87%) agreed to participate. Of these, 51 patients were treated with a brace only and 74 patients were operated on. Screening for scoliosis is carried out in 80% of Dutch children. METHODS: Data on being screen detected or otherwise detected and Cobb angle at diagnosis were collected using youth health-care files, medical files and interviews by telephone with the patients. RESULTS: About 55% of the patients were detected by screening (programme sensitivity). Screen-detected patients had a significantly smaller Cobb angle at diagnosis (28 degrees versus 40 degrees ; P<0.01) and had a 73% lower chance of having had surgery (45% versus 75%; P<0.01) than otherwise-detected patients. CONCLUSION: In the present study, two essential prerequisites necessary for a screening programme for scoliosis to be effective have been met. However, definite proof of the effectiveness of screening still needs to be established because length bias and over-treatment bias cannot be ruled out using this design.",

        "abstract": "There is a pressing need to develop rapid yet accurate screening assays for the identification of genotoxic liability and for early hazard assessment in drug discovery. The GADD45a-GFP human cell-based genotoxicity assay (GreenScreen HC) has been reformatted to test 12 compounds per 96-well microplate in a higher throughput, automated screening mode and the protocol applied to the analysis of 1266 diverse, pharmacologically active compounds. Testing from a fixed starting concentration of 100 AmicroM and over 3 serial dilutions, the hit rates for genotoxicity (7.3%) and cytotoxicity (33%) endpoints of the assay have been determined in a much wider chemical space than previously reported. The degree of interference from color, autofluorescence, and low solubility has also been assessed. The assay results have been compared to an in silico approach to genotoxicity assessment using Derek for Windows software. Where carcinogenicity data were available, GreenScreen HC demonstrated a higher specificity than in silico methods while identifying genotoxic species that were not highlighted for genotoxic liability in structure-activity relationship software. Higher throughput screening from a fixed, low concentration reduces sensitivity to less potent genotoxins, but the maintenance of the previously reported high specificity is essential in early hazard assessment where misclassification can lead to the needless rejection of potentially useful compounds in drug development.",

The new generation of GABAA modulators is targeting subtype selectivity and low/partial efficacy on the receptor to potentially overcome the adverse effects described for drugs with full agonist profile. We evaluated a screening approach to measure the relative efficacy of GABAA positive allosteric modulators (PAM) using automated patch clamp and fluorescence membrane potential assays. We determined that the use of an internal comparator (zolpidem), tested on each cell in parallel to the test compound, provides a reliable approach to measure and compare the relative efficacy of PAM ligands. Patch clamp recordings on recombinant GABAA receptors, using a multiple drug addition protocol, allows us to rank PAM ligands with different levels of efficacies. We observed that fluorescence membrane potential assays are not predictive of the relative efficacies of GABAA PAM ligands.",

Molecular specificity based on fluorescence was a central element of the platform taking advantage of the growing list of reagent classes and the ability to multiplex. In addition, image analysis coupled to data management, data mining, and data visualization created a tool that focused on biological information and knowledge to begin exploring the functions of genes identified in the genomics revolution. This overview looks at the development of HCS, the evolution of the technologies, and the market up to the present day. In addition, the options for adopting uniform definitions is suggested along with a perspective on what advances are needed to continue building the value of HCS in biomedical research, drug discovery, and development and diagnostics.",

In this study, the authors propose a new measure of endpoint reliability, based on the concept of desirability first introduced by Harrington. The solution is not dependent on the application used to analyze the experimental data, provided a number of parameters to characterize the dose-response curve are available. The authors show how this score can be used as an objective and consistent measure to rank screening results, combine information from groups of experiments, and determine optimal levels of characterization of a compound's biological activity.",

The analysis and interpretation of data is rapid, with sensitivity for protein stability comparable to differential scanning calorimetry.

While effective, these approaches can be affected by certain experimental limitations, such as conformational restrictions imposed by the selected label or compound fluorescence/quenching. Label-free approaches potentially address many of these issues by allowing researchers to investigate more native systems without fluorescence- or luminescence-based readouts. However, due to throughput and expense constraints, label-free methods have been largely relegated to a supporting role as the basis of secondary assays. In this review, we describe recent improvements in impedance-based, optical biosensor-based, automated patch clamp and mass spectrometry technologies that have enhanced their ease of use and throughput and, hence, their utility for primary screening of small- to medium-sized compound libraries. The ultimate maturation of these techniques will enable drug discovery researchers to screen large chemical libraries against minimally manipulated biological systems.",

        "abstract": "Voltage-gated K(+) channels are potential drug targets for an increasing number of disease indications. Searching for compounds that modulate K(+) channel activities by high-throughput screening (HTS) is becoming a standard approach in the drug discovery effort. Here the authors report an improved fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) membrane potential assay for Kv1.3 K(+) channel HTS. They have found that the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have endogenous membrane electrogenic transporters that contribute to maintaining membrane potential. Blocking the recombinant K(+) channels in the overexpressing CHO cell line hardly changed the membrane potential. Inhibition of the endogenous transporters is essential to achieve the required assay robustness. The authors identified the optimal assay conditions and designed a simple assay format. After an HTS campaign using this assay, various chemical series of Kv1.3 channel blockers have been identified and confirmed by the automated electrophysiological IonWorks assay. The correlation in dose response between FLIPR and IonWorks was established by biophysical modeling and experimental data. After characterization using patch-clamp recording, both use-dependent and use-independent compounds were identified. Some compounds possess nanomolar potency, indicating that the FLIPR assay is effective for successfully identifying K(+) channel blockers as novel drug candidates.",

        "abstract": "A screening procedure was developed that takes advantage of the cellular normalization by micropatterning and a novel quantitative organelle mapping approach that allows unbiased and automated cell morphology comparison using black-box statistical testing. Micropatterns of extracellular matrix proteins force cells to adopt a reproducible shape and distribution of intracellular compartments avoiding strong cell-to-cell variation that is a major limitation of classical culture conditions. To detect changes in cell morphology induced by compound treatment, fluorescently labeled intracellular structures from several tens of micropatterned cells were transformed into probabilistic density maps. Then, the similarity or difference between two given density maps was quantified using statistical testing that evaluates differences directly from the data without additional analysis or any subjective decision. The versatility of this organelle mapping approach for different magnifications and its performance for different cell shapes has been assessed. Density-based analysis detected changes in cell morphology due to compound treatment in a small-scale proof-of-principle screen demonstrating its compatibility with high-throughput screening. This novel tool for high-content and high-throughput cellular phenotyping can potentially be used for a wide range of applications from drug screening to careful characterization of cellular processes.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To illustrate visually the lifetime probabilities of the principal outcomes of the UK breast screening programme in a readily understandable format. METHODS: We derived prognostic data from a modelling exercise using published effectiveness data and routine data sources. We calculated the probability that a woman will survive to the age of 75 if she chooses to participate fully in breast screening from age 50 to 64 and if she chooses not to participate. We also calculated her probability of being referred for assessment, undergoing fine-needle biopsy and undergoing open biopsy. We present these data in two alternative decision aid formats. These alternative formats illustrate visually the outcomes for 1000 women and 100 women choosing each alternative: breast screening or no breast screening. RESULTS: A woman participating in breast screening from age 50 to 64 increases her chances of surviving to age 75 by 0.6%. She has a 21.8% probability of surviving to age 75 and being referred for assessment but no further investigation. She has a 5.7% probability of undergoing core biopsy and a 0.9% probability of undergoing open biopsy. This information can easily be presented visually. CONCLUSIONS: We can provide realistic estimates of the effects of the breast screening programme on mortality in a readily understandable format. If we wish women to make an informed choice about breast screening they must be given this information.",

        "abstract": "Newborn hearing screening has been recognized as an essential component of public health care in early childhood in developed countries. However, such screening is yet to be widely embraced in the developing world. The new national health policy in Nigeria seeks, for the first time, to reduce the impact of permanent hearing loss on early childhood development through early detection and timely intervention services. The aim of this paper is to ascertain if newborn hearing screening satisfies the conventional criteria for a screening programme as an early detection strategy in this developing country. A review of the available literature shows that permanent childhood hearing loss is a significant health condition and its detection through screening with oto-acoustic emissions and/or auditory brainstem response is feasible in the target population. Amplification with hearing aids is an effective and preferred option for early intervention by parents. The risk of maternal anxiety from potential false-positives or the psychological cost of false assurance from false-negatives is unlikely to outweigh the benefit of screening. Newborn hearing screening is therefore a potential early detection strategy for permanent childhood hearing loss in Nigeria.",

        "abstract": "The thrust of early drug discovery in recent years has been toward the configuration of homogeneous miniaturized assays. This has allowed organizations to contain costs in the face of exponential increases in the number of screening assays that need to be run to remain competitive. Miniaturization brings with it an increasing dependence on instrumentation, which over the past several years has seen the development of nanodispensing capability and sophisticated detection strategies. To maintain confidence in the data generated from miniaturized assays, it is critical to ensure that both compounds and reagents have been delivered as expected to the target wells. The authors have developed a standard operating procedure for liquid-handling quality control that has enabled them to evaluate performance on 2 levels. The first level provides for routine daily testing on existing instrumentation, and the second allows for more rigorous testing of new dispensing technologies. The procedure has shown itself to be useful in identifying both method programming and instrumentation performance shortcomings and has provided a means to harmonizing instrumentation usage by assay development and screening groups. The goal is that this type of procedure be used for facilitating the exchange of liquid handler performance data across the industry.",

We introduce a series of cell-based evaluation metrics that have been implemented and validated in a mono-parametric HCS for regulators of the membrane trafficking protein caveolin 1 (CAV1) and have also proved useful for the development of a multiparametric phenotypic HCS for regulators of cytoskeletal reorganization. Imaging metrics evaluate imaging quality such as staining and focus, whereas cell biology metrics are fuzzy logic-based evaluators describing complex biological parameters such as sparseness, confluency, and spreading. The evaluation metrics were implemented in a data-mining pipeline, which first filters out cells that do not pass a quality criterion based on imaging metrics and then uses cell biology metrics to stratify cell samples to allow further analysis of homogeneous cell populations. Use of these metrics significantly improved the robustness of the monoparametric assay tested, as revealed by an increase in Z' factor, Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, and strict standard mean difference. Cell biology evaluation metrics were also implemented in a novel supervised learning classification method that combines them with phenotypic features in a statistical model that exceeded conventional classification methods, thus improving multiparametric phenotypic assay sensitivity.",

This report describes MScreen, a Web-based, open-source cheminformatics application for chemical library and siRNA plate management, primary HTS and dose-response data handling, structure search, and administrative functions. Each project in MScreen can be secured with passwords or shared in an open-information environment that enables collaborators to easily compare data from many screens, providing a useful means to identify compounds with desired selectivity. Unique features include compound, substance, mixture, and siRNA plate creation and formatting; automated dose-response fitting and quality control (QC); and user, target, and assay method administration. MScreen provides an effective means to facilitate HTS information handling and analysis in the academic setting so that users can efficiently view their screening data and evaluate results for follow-up.",

The probe was added at low concentrations (0.3 \u03bcM to 0.5 nM) to each sample containing a culture of cells in the wells of a standard 96-well plate. Analysis of oxygen consumption was initiated by applying a layer of mineral oil on top of each sample followed by monitoring of the phosphorescent signal on a prompt or time-resolved fluorescence plate reader. Rates of oxygen uptake could be determined on the basis of kinetic changes of the phosphorescence (initial slopes) and correlated with cell numbers (105 to 107 cells/mL for FL5.12 lymphoblastic cell line), cell viability, or drug/effector action using appropriate control samples. The assay is cell noninvasive, more simple, robust, and cost-effective than existing microplate-based cell viability assays; is compatible with existing instrumentation; and allows for high-throughput analysis of cell viability.

This review details phenotypic assays based on inhibition of microglial activation and their utility in primary and secondary screening, target validation, and pathway elucidation. The role of microglia, both in normal as well as in pathological conditions such as chronic neurodegenerative diseases, is reviewed. Methodologies to assess microglia activation in vitro are discussed in detail, and classes of therapeutic drugs known to decrease the proinflammatory and cytotoxic responses of activated microglia are appraised, including inhibitors of glutaminase, cystine/glutamate antiporter, nuclear factor \u03baB, and mitogen-activated protein kinases.",

        "abstract": "Transporter proteins are known to play a critical role in affecting the overall absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics of drug candidates. In addition to efflux transporters (P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, etc.) that limit absorption, there has been a renewed interest in influx transporters at the renal (OATs, OCTs) and hepatic (OATPs, BSEP, NTCP, etc.) organ level that can cause significant clinical drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Several of these transporters are also critical for hepatobiliary disposition of bilirubin and bile acid/salts, and their inhibition is directly implicated in hepatic toxicities. Regulatory agencies took action to address transporter-mediated DDI with the goal of ensuring drug safety in the clinic and on the market. To meet regulatory requirements, advanced bioassay technology and automation solutions were implemented for high-throughput transporter screening to provide structure-activity relationship within lead optimization. To enhance capacity, several functional assay formats were miniaturized to 384-well throughput including novel fluorescence-based uptake and efflux inhibition assays using high-content image analysis as well as cell-based radioactive uptake and vesicle-based efflux inhibition assays. This high-throughput capability enabled a paradigm shift from studying transporter-related issues in the development space to identifying and dialing out these concerns early on in discovery for enhanced mechanism-based efficacy while circumventing DDIs and transporter toxicities.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To calculate breast cancer detection to expected incidence ratios and standardised detection ratios (SDRs) for the New Zealand breast cancer screening programme.\\n\\nMETHOD: Breast cancer registrations for 1976-1999 were obtained from the New Zealand Cancer Registry. Using these registrations, the incidence in the absence of screening was projected for 1999 and 2000. These projections, and the invasive breast cancers detected in the New Zealand programme during 1999 and 2000, were used to calculate the detection to expected incidence ratios and SDRs.\\n\\nRESULTS: In 1999, the breast cancer detection rate was 5.6 per 1000 women screened. The expected incidence among these women in the absence of screening was 2.3 per 1000, a detection to expected incidence ratio of 2.4. The SDR was 0.84 (0.76-0.94). In 2000, the breast cancer detection rate was 6.0 per 1000 women screened. The expected incidence among these women in the absence of screening was 2.4 per 1000, a detection to expected incidence ratio of 2.5. The SDR was 0.90 (0.81 - 0.99).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: In the first two years of the national programme, detection to expected incidence ratios were less than 3.0, and the SDR results were below 1.0. It may be unrealistic to expect new screening programmes to achieve SDRs of 1.0 immediately. At a similar stage, the UK National Health Service Breast Cancer Screening Programme (NHSBSP) also reported SDRs of less than 1.0 and therefore lower than expected cancer detection rates compared with the Swedish Two-County trial. An encouraging finding was that SDRs in five of the six screening regions improved in the second year of the New Zealand screening programme.",

        "abstract": "Over the past three decades nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been developed into a mature technique for the characterization of interactions of small molecule ligands with their corresponding protein and nucleic acid receptors. In fact, a significant number of industrial and academic laboratories employ NMR for screening small molecule compound collections for binding to defined macromolecular targets, thus potentially providing initial, low affinity hits for a fragment-based approach in the drug discovery process. NMR is also applied to interrogate hits obtained by high throughput screening using biochemical assays and by virtual screening methods, for their ability to physically interact with the target receptor. In favorable cases a variety of NMR-based methods can also provide essential information to validate the hit, rank the different hits according to affinity, and to structurally analyze the ligand-target complex, thus providing essential information for structure-based optimization and medicinal chemistry. In this review a comprehensive overview of the large variety of NMR methods to study interactions between small molecule ligands and macromolecular receptors is provided, summarizing the physico-chemical bases of the different receptor- and ligand-observed experiments. The application of these methods for compound library screening and hit validation, with special emphasis on their contribution to fragment-based drug discovery strategies, is illustrated by recent examples selected from the literature and work in my laboratory.",

        "abstract": "High throughput technologies have the potential to affect all aspects of drug discovery. Considerable attention is paid to high throughput screening (HTS) for small molecule lead compounds. The identification of the targets that enter those HTS campaigns had been driven by basic research until the advent of genomics level data acquisition such as sequencing and gene expression microarrays. Large-scale profiling approaches (e.g., microarrays, protein analysis by mass spectrometry, and metabolite profiling) can yield vast quantities of data and important information. However, these approaches usually require painstaking in silico analysis and low-throughput basic wet-lab research to identify the function of a gene and validate the gene product as a potential therapeutic drug target. Functional genomic screening offers the promise of direct identification of genes involved in phenotypes of interest. In this review, RNA interference (RNAi) mediated loss-of-function screens will be discussed and as well as their utility in target identification. Some of the genes identified in these screens should produce similar phenotypes if their gene products are antagonized with drugs. With a carefully chosen phenotype, an understanding of the biology of RNAi and appreciation of the limitations of RNAi screening, there is great potential for the discovery of new drug targets.",

        "abstract": "In the last decade mass screening strategies became the main source of leads in drug discovery settings. Although high throughput (HTS) and virtual screening (VS) realize the same concept the different nature of these lead discovery strategies (experimental vs theoretical) results that they are typically applied separately. The majority of drug leads are still identified by hit-to-lead optimization of screening hits. Structural information on the target as well as on bound ligands, however, make structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening available for the identification of alternative chemical starting points. Although, the two techniques have rarely been used together on the same target, here we review the existing prominent studies on their true integration. Various approaches have been shown to apply the combination of HTS and VS and to better use them in lead generation. Although several attempts on their integration have only been considered at a conceptual level, there are numerous applications underlining its relevance that early-stage pharmaceutical drug research could benefit from a combined approach.",

        "abstract": "The pivotal role of kinases in signal transduction and cellular regulation has lent them considerable appeal as pharmacological targets across a broad spectrum of pathologies. Since the discovery that the v-Src oncogene encoded a protein kinase in 1978, kinases have remained a focus of research for pharmaceutical laboratories and academic groups alike. Many have sought to develop orally available low molecular weight synthetic kinase modulators (predominantly inhibitors) and thus capitalize on the links between aberrant regulation and disease. This interest in kinases as drug targets was fueled in recent years by the success of several kinase inhibitors in the clinic, primarily Gleevec for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and Iressa for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This review focuses on the development of small molecule drugs, most of them binding in or close to the ATP binding pocket. After some general considerations regarding the selection of a particular kinase for drug discovery, we will discuss the encouraging lessons learned from some of the kinase inhibitors currently in various stages of development. The majority of this review is dedicated to a detailed description and discussion of the various assay formats currently being employed for high throughput screening.",

As vertebrates, zebrafish maintain significant evolutionary proximity to humans and have been validated as robust models for drug research, studies of mechanism and behavioral genetics. Unlike higher vertebrate models, zebrafish are well-suited to high-throughput applications owing to their high fecundity, rapid extrauterine development and transparency during organogenesis enabling in vivo labeling and imaging.

        "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions involving cytochrome P450 (CYP) are an important factor in whether a new chemical entity will survive through to the development stage. Therefore, the identification of this potential as early as possible in vitro could save considerable future unnecessary investment. In vitro CYP interaction screening data generated for CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 were initially analyzed to determine the correlation of IC50 from 10- and 3-point determinations. A high correlation (r = 0.99) prompted the further assessment of predicting the IC50 by a single value of percent inhibition at either 10, 3, or 1 AM. Statistical analysis of the initial proprietary compounds showed that there was a strong linear relationship between log IC50 and percent inhibition at 3,M, and that it was possible to predict a compound's IC50 by the percent inhibition value obtained at 3 AM. Additional data for CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and the recombinant CYP2D6 were later obtained and used together with the initial data to demonstrate that a single statistical model could be applicable across different CYPs and different in vitro microsomal systems. Ultimately, the data for all five CYPs and the recombinant CYP2D6 were used to build a statistical model for predicting the IC50 with a single point. The 95% prediction boundary for the region of interest was about + 0.37 on log10 scale, comparable to the variability of in vitro determinations for positive control IC50 data. The use of a single inhibitor concentration would enable determination of more IC50 values on a 96-well plate and result in more economical use of compounds, human liver or expressed enzyme microsomes, substrates, and reagents. This approach would offer the opportunity to increase screening for CYP-mediated drug-drug interactions, which may be important given the challenges provided by the generation of orders of magnitude more new chemical entities in the field of combinatorial chemistry. In addition, the algorithmic approach we propose would obviously be applicable for other in vitro bioactivity and therapeutic target enzyme and receptor screens.",

METHODS: False negative tests were identified by tracing all patients with a ruptured aneurysm who were screened and then finding the number classified as normal on US. False positive tests were identified by calculating the number of aneurysmal aortas on US that were classified as normal on CT. Measurement variability of the infrarenal aortic diameter between US and CT was estimated. RESULTS: 14 out of 93 patients with a ruptured AAA since 1991 had been screened. No ruptured aneurysm had been classified as normal on US. All 64 patients with an AAA larger than 4.5 cm on US had their aneurysm confirmed on CT. The mean difference between CT and US measurements was 4 mm. The limit of variability between CT and US was 12 mm. CONCLUSION: No false negative scans were found using a cut off point of 3 cm as abnormal. No false positives were found if subjects with an AAA exceeding 4.5 cm were referred for further procedures.

Computerized practice records were searched for information, including reasons for testing, for men with elevated PSA test results in 2010. PSA results for 2007\ufffd2010 were obtained from community laboratories.

Incorporation of organotypic 3-dimensional (3-D) culture systems into mainstream drug development processes is increasingly discussed but severely limited by complex methodological requirements. The objective of this study was to explore a panel of standard assays to provide an easy-handling, standardized protocol for rapid routine analysis of cell survival in multicellular tumor spheroid-based antitumor drug testing. Spheroids of 2 colon carcinoma cell lines were characterized for evaluation. One of the assay systems tested could reliably be used to determine cell viability in spheroids. The authors verified that the acid phosphatase assay (APH) is applicable for single spheroids in 96-well plates, does not require spheroid dissociation, and is linear and highly sensitive for HT29 and HCT-116 spheroids up to diameters of 650 microm and 900 microm, consisting of 40,000 and 80,000 cells, respectively. Treatment of HT29 and HCT-116 cells with 5-fluorouracil, Irinotecan, and C-1311 revealed critically reduced drug efficacies in 3-D versus monolayer culture, which is discussed in light of literature data.

Women attending for antenatal care who accepted an offer of serum screening for Down's syndrome were tested between 15 and 20 weeks gestation. Down's risk estimates were calculated using maternal serum alphaFP and total hCG results as modifiers of the maternal age related risk. Outcome was determined in collaboration with the regional cytogenetics unit.\\n\\nRESULTS:In 7 years 66,631 women were screened, in whom 108 Down's syndrome pregnancies were identified. Risks for Down's syndrome were reported without a specified cut off recommendation; however, at a cut off of 1 in 250, 72 (66.7%) of the affected pregnancies were screen positive, the false positive rate was 5.8%, and the uptake of amniocentesis 71.2%.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare interval cancer rates from the Irish breast screening programme, BreastCheck, for the period 2000-2007 with those from other European countries. METHODS: Data from BreastCheck was linked to National Cancer Registry breast cancer registrations, to calculate numbers of women screened, screen-detected cancers, and interval cancers, by year of screening, in the first and second years after screening, and by initial or subsequent screen. Estimated underlying cancer incidence from the period 1996-1999 inclusive was used to calculate proportionate incidence. We calculated the interval cancer ratio as an alternative measure of the burden of interval cancers. RESULTS: There were 372,658 screening records for 178,147 women in the period 2000-2007. The overall interval rate was 9.6 per 10,000 screens. In the first year after screening, the interval cancer rate was 5.8 per 10,000 screens and this increased to 13.4 in the second year after screening. The screen detection rate for the period was 53.6 per 10,000 screened for all screens combined. Initial screens produced a higher detection rate at 66.9 per 10,000 screened compared with subsequent screens with a screen-detected rate of 41.4 per 10,000 screens. CONCLUSION: Interval breast cancer rates for the first years of the programme are within acceptable limits and are comparable with those in other European programmes. Nationwide roll-out together with the adoption of digital mammography may have an impact on interval cancer rates in future years.",

Phaedra was developed to support workflows for drug screening and target discovery, interact with several laboratory information management systems, and process data generated by a range of techniques including high-content imaging, multicolor flow cytometry, and traditional high-throughput screening assays. The application is modular and flexible, with an interface that can be tuned to specific user roles. It offers user-friendly data visualization and reduction tools for HCS but also integrates Matlab for custom image analysis and the Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) framework for data mining. Phaedra features efficient JPEG2000 compression and full drill-down functionality from dose-response curves down to individual cells, with exclusion and annotation options, cell classification, statistical quality controls, and reporting.",

        "abstract": "For drug discovery, cell-based assays are becoming increasingly complex to mimic more realistically the nature of biological processes and their diversifications in diseases. Multicellular co-cultures embedded in a three-dimensional (3D) matrix have been explored in oncology to more closely approximate the physiology of the human tumor microenvironment. High-content analysis is the ideal technology to characterize these complex biological systems, although running such complex assays at higher throughput is a major endeavor. Here, we report on adapting a 3D tumor co-culture growth assay to automated microscopy, and we compare various imaging platforms (confocal vs. nonconfocal) with correlating automated image analysis solutions to identify optimal conditions and settings for future larger scaled screening campaigns. The optimized protocol has been validated in repeated runs where established anticancer drugs have been evaluated for performance in this innovative assay.",

        "abstract": "The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are intracellular enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of 3', 5'-cyclic nucleotides, such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), to their corresponding 5'-nucleotide monophosphates. These enzymes play an important role in controlling cellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides and thus regulate a variety of cellular signaling events. PDEs are emerging as drug targets for several diseases including asthma, cardiovascular disease, ADHD, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Though biochemical assays with purified recombinant PDE enzymes and cAMP or cGMP substrate are commonly used for compound screening, cell-based assays would provide a better assessment of compound activity in a more physiological context. Here we report the development and validation of a new cell-based PDE4 assay using a constitutively active GPCR as a driving force for cAMP production and a cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) cation channel as a biosensor in 1536-well plates.",

To address this need in the area of oncology, we report the development of a multiparametric high-content screening assay panel at the level of single cells to dramatically accelerate understanding the mechanism of action of cell growth-inhibiting compounds on a large scale. Our approach is based on measuring 10 established end points associated with mitochondrial apoptosis, cell cycle disruption, DNA damage, and cellular morphological changes in the same experiment, across three multiparametric assays. The data from all of the measurements taken together are expected to help increase our current understanding of target protein functions, constrain the list of possible targets for compounds identified using phenotypic screens, and identify off-target effects. We have also developed novel data visualization and phenotypic classification approaches for detailed interpretation of individual compound effects and navigation of large collections of multiparametric cellular responses. We expect this general approach to be valuable for drug discovery across multiple therapeutic areas.",

Multidisciplinary, evidence-based guidelines for quality assurance in CRC screening and diagnosis have been developed by experts in a project co-financed by the European Union. The 450-page guidelines were published in book format by the European Commission in 2010. They include 10 chapters and over 250 recommendations, individually graded according to the strength of the recommendation and the supporting evidence. Adoption of the recommendations can improve and maintain the quality and effectiveness of an entire screening process, including identification and invitation of the target population, diagnosis and management of the disease and appropriate surveillance in people with detected lesions. To make the principles, recommendations and standards in the guidelines known to a wider professional and scientific community and to facilitate their use in the scientific literature, the original content is presented in journal format in an open-access Supplement of Endoscopy. The editors have prepared the present overview to inform readers of the comprehensive scope and content of the guidelines.",

The authors show that drug candidates with immediate value for biological preclinical evaluation can be identified directly through ultra-efficient affinity screening of kinase enzymes and random compound mixtures. The screening process comprises sampling and trapping equilibrium binding between candidate ligands and protein in solution, followed by removal of unbound ligands via 3 rounds of ultrafiltration and direct identification of bound ligands by mass spectrometry. Evaluation of significant peaks is facilitated by automated integration and collation of the mass spectral data and import into custom software for analysis. One Chk1-selective ligand found by using this process is presented in detail. The compound is potent in both enzymatic and Chk1-dependent cellular assays, and specific contacts in the Chk1 active site are shown by X-ray crystallography.",

We proposed to develop a robust screening system based on the use of yeast cells to identify new lead compounds for the pharmacological inhibition of IDO-the BLOCKADE platform. Yeast combines the advantages of a relevant surrogate model for eukaryotic cell processes with the amenity to miniaturization and automation. We brought added value to the system by increasing the stringency of our assay, as the BLOCKADE strain was not deleted for any efflux pump, thus creating additional challenges for test compounds to be identified as hits. Screening of a library of 50 080 small molecules led to the identification of 101 potential IDO inhibitors, a low hit rate of 0.2%, reflecting the stringent assay conditions imposed. Most important, secondary pharmacology assays in mammalian cells confirmed activity for 76% of the hits, whereas hepatotoxicity testing indicated that 87% of them displayed a safe profile. The high predictivity rates obtained using the BLOCKADE platform clearly validate our system as a powerful tool for drug discovery.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate 3 cytotoxicity assays in identifying novel antibacterial hits with desired safety margins. The endpoints in assays comprised adenylate kinase (AK) release rate as an indicator of membrane rupture (Toxilight), intracellular adenosine triphosphate (CellTiter-Glo), and reduction of resazurin (CellTiter-Blue) both as indicators of cell metabolic activity. In the CellTiter-Glo and the CellTiter-Blue assays, 7 of 8 selected compounds showed cytotoxicity, whereas in the Toxilight assay, 3 of 8 compounds significantly reduced cell viability in the ChoK1 and the JurkatE6.1 cell line. The CellTiter-Glo assay proved to be the most sensitive among the evaluated assays, and excellent Z' values were obtained in the 96-well plate (Z' > 0.83). The CellTiter-Glo assay was clearly superior to the CellTiter-Blue and the Toxilight assay for the initial cytotoxicity screening. Moreover, the application of the CellTiter-Glo assay to determine mammalian cell toxicity versus the antibacterial effect ratio contributed to early identification of antibacterial hits with desired safety margins. The chemical structures of these novel antibacterial hits are disclosed herein.",

We targeted T. brucei methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS), an aminoacyl-tRNA synthase (aaRS), which is considered an important drug target due to its role in protein synthesis, cell survival, and its significant differences in structure from its mammalian ortholog. Previous work using RNA interference of MetRS demonstrated growth inhibition of T. brucei, further validating it as an attractive target. We report the development and implementation of two orthogonal high-throughput screening assays to identify inhibitors of T. brucei MetRS. First, a chemiluminescence assay was implemented in a 1536-well plate format and used to monitor adenosine triphosphate depletion during the aminoacylation reaction. Hit confirmation then used a counterscreen in which adenosine monophosphate production was assessed using fluorescence polarization technology. In addition, a miniaturized cell viability assay was used to triage cytotoxic compounds. Finally, lower throughput assays involving whole parasite growth inhibition of both human and parasite MetRS were used to analyze compound selectivity and efficacy. The outcome of this high-throughput screening campaign has led to the discovery of 19 potent and selective T. brucei MetRS inhibitors.",

Inhibition of herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication at the early stages of infection minimizes cytotoxicity and immune suppression induced by HSV infection. In this report, quantitative reporter systems that use recombinant HSV and a stably transfected cell line were developed for the screening of agents targeting the early stages of HSV infection. The reporter genes in both systems were directed by HSV immediate-early (IE) promoters, so considerably less time was required for the quantification of HSV infection than the traditional plaque reduction assay. The results show that both reporter assays were sensitive to antiherpetic screening. Both assays were quantitative, rapid, easy to perform, and highly adaptable for automatic high-throughput screening. Exploiting the flexibility of these 2 assays, modified assays were also proposed for the detailed analysis of antiherpetic mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To measure the attendance and compliance rates in oral mucosal screening (OMS) offered as part of a general health screen (GHS) undertaken as an organised programme in Japan. METHODS: In 1996, all adults over the age of 40 years resident in Tokoname City were invited by letter to attend a free GHS annually, conducted by the municipal cooperation and the medical and dental societies of Tokoname City. In the later years only those who attended in 1996 were reinvited. Females aged less than 39 years were also allowed to attend if they wished to participate in the GHS. The GHS consisted of completion of a self administered questionnaire to identify past and current illnesses and any medications used by the screened population coupled with a routine physical check, chest x ray, ECG, and blood and urine examination. The GHS was programmed annually during the years 1996 to 1998. All those attending the GHS were invited to participate in an OMS conducted under the same roof by a visiting dentist (n=37). A referral pathway was established for screen positives requiring follow up. RESULTS: A total of 19 305 subjects (5955 males, 13350 females; mean age 59.2 years; 7033 in 1996, 6289 in 1997, and 5983 in 1998) attended the GHS. Of those who attended the GHS, 19 056 (98.7%) attended the OMS (1.3% refused). This rate was fairly constant over the three years. Excluding repeat examinations, new cases recruited for OMS over the three years were 8723. Of those participating in OMS, 4269 (60.7%) attended all three years. In the cohorts examined, screening dentists recorded oral mucosal lesions in 5.4% in 1996, in 4.0% in 1997, and in 2.6% in 1998. Overall, this amounted to a positive detection rate of 4.1%, or 4.9% excluding repeat examinations. A higher prevalence of oral pre-cancer was recorded among male smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The overall results suggest that although compliance with attending a free GHS was low (26.2%) among Japanese subjects over 40 years of age, of those who complied 74-76% reattended annually. Hence a satisfactory participation rate can be obtained in Japan for OMS when this is coupled to a GHS conducted at the same visit.",

        "title": "Does individual programme size affect screening performance? Results from the United Kingdom NHS breast screening programme",
        "abstract": "Objective: The size (number of women screened) of the 95 individual NHS breast screening programmes (NHSBSPs) varies by a factor of 10. This study investigates the impact of size on the performance of individual programmes. Method: Data were collated from the 95 United Kingdom screening programmes on the standard statistical returns for the past 5 years (1 April 1995-31 March 2000). Additional information was obtained from questionnaires. The number of women screened between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2000 determined the size of a programme. The bottom 25% were defined as small, the middle 50% as medium, and the top 25% as large. On average large programmes screened about four times as many women as small programmes and medium programmes about twice as many. Performance was evaluated using cancer detection rates, referral rates for assessment, and positive predictive value (PPV) of assessment using PPV referral diagrams. Results: The performance of smaller programmes was shown to be marginally poorer than medium and large sized programmes in that they detected fewer cancers and had a lower PPV. The smallest 25% of programmes had an invasive cancer detection rate 13% less than the medium and large programmes. However, if these programmes had an equivalent detection rate to the medium/large programmes the national detection rate would only increase by about 2%. This is because the 75% of programmes described as medium and large screen about 90% of all women. It is therefore important to place the clinical importance of these findings in context when considering any envisaged possible solutions. Conclusions: Although the performance of smaller programmes was shown to be poorer than that of the larger programmes, it is not clear from this study exactly why this is so. A likely contributory factor based on experience of evaluating the NHSBSP is that performance problems in larger programmes have been easier to detect by quality assurance staff. The size of the small programmes and the few screen detected cancers (and inherent statistical instability in detection rates) mean that problems are difficult to identify. As a consequence small programmes which are genuinely performing marginally below specific standards are likely to receive less attention than larger programmes, and even under close scrutiny the causes are less likely to be found.",

The method utilizes \u02dc100 \u00b5g of antibody per well and requires < 5 \u00b5g of ADC for characterization. We demonstrate the capabilities of this system using model antibodies. We also provide multiple examples applying this method to early-stage screening of maytansinoid ADCs. The method can greatly increase the throughput with which candidate ADCs can be screened in cell-based assays, and may be more generally applicable to high-throughput preparation and screening of different types of protein conjugates.",

METHODS: Review of clinical records, visual fields, fundus photographs, and fluorescein angiography of six patients from a retina referral practice. RESULTS: All cases arose because of failure by physicians to avoid dosing above published safe levels. Five cases developed despite accepted ophthalmologic patterns of screening for toxicity. All cases developed parafoveal retinal pigment epithelial atrophic changes and paracentral scotomas to threshold visual field testing. CONCLUSIONS: New cases of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine toxicity continue to develop in a screening environment. Increased ophthalmologic attention to dosing, awareness of location and nature of early visual field defects, and traditional attention to presence or absence of maculopathy can reduce the incidence of this avoidable condition. \u00a9 2002 by Elsevier Science Inc.

        "abstract": "More than 20% of bacterial proteins are noncytoplasmic, and most of these pass through the SecYEG channel en route to the periplasm, cell membrane, or surrounding environment. The Sec pathway, encompassing SecYEG and several associated proteins (SecA, SecB, YidC, SecDFYajC), is of interest as a potential drug target because it is distinct from targets of current drugs, is essential for bacterial growth, and exhibits dissimilarities in eukaryotes and bacteria that increase the likelihood of selectively inhibiting the microbial pathway. As a step toward validating the pathway as a drug target, we have adapted a mechanism-based whole-cell assay in a manner suitable for high-throughput screening (HTS). The assay uses an engineered strain of Escherichia coli that accumulates beta-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) in its cytoplasm if translocation through SecYEG is blocked. The assay should facilitate rapid identification of compounds that specifically block the Sec pathway because widely, toxic compounds and nonspecific protein synthesis inhibitors prevent \u03b2-gal production and thus do not register as hits. Testing of current antibiotics confirmed that they do not generally act through the Sec pathway. A mini-screen of 800 compounds indicated the assay's readiness for larger screening projects.",

Today, no specific therapy exists for FXS, and current treatments are only directed to improve behavioral symptoms. Neuronal progenitors derived from FXS patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent a unique model to study the disease and develop assays for large-scale drug discovery screens since they conserve the Fmr1 gene silenced within the disease context. We have established a high-content imaging assay to run a large-scale phenotypic screen aimed to identify compounds that reactivate the silenced Fmr1 gene. A set of 50,000 compounds was tested, including modulators of several epigenetic targets. We describe an integrated drug discovery model comprising iPSC generation, culture scale-up, and quality control and screening with a very sensitive high-content imaging assay assisted by single-cell image analysis and multiparametric data analysis based on machine learning algorithms. The screening identified several compounds that induced a weak expression of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and thus sets the basis for further large-scale screens to find candidate drugs or targets tackling the underlying mechanism of FXS with potential for therapeutic intervention.",

Compared to conventional high throughput screening techniques, in silico screening is fast and inexpensive, and is increasing in popularity in early-stage drug discovery endeavours. This paper reviews and discusses recent trends and developments in three-dimensional (3D) receptor-based and ligand-based VS methodologies. First, we describe the concept of accessible chemical space and its exploration. We then describe 3D structural ligand-based VS techniques, hybrid approaches, and new approaches to exploit additional knowledge that can now be found in large chemogenomic databases. We also briefly discuss some potential issues relating to pharmacokinetics, toxicity profiling, target identification and validation, inverse docking, scaffold-hopping and drug re-purposing. We propose that the best way to advance the state of the art in 3D VS is to integrate complementary strategies in a single drug discovery pipeline, rather than to focus only on theoretical or computational improvements of individual techniques. Two recent 3D VS case studies concerning the LXR-\u03b2 receptor and the CCR5/CXCR4 HIV co-receptors are presented as examples which implement some of the complementary methods and strategies that are reviewed here.",

        "abstract": "At present, high-throughput screening (HTS) programs in drug discovery rely mainly on compound libraries from combinational chemistry. Similarly, natural flora has been used as a prominent origin for new and potent herbal drugs. Herbal medicines have been used worldwide for thousands of years to cure many diseases. As such, herbal secondary metabolites show a remarkable structural diversity that supplements chemically synthesized compound analogs in drug discovery screening. Unfortunately, there is often a considerable deterioration in the quality of herbal drugs in such screening programs as there are time-consuming manual processes involved in the isolation of active ingredients from the highly complex mixtures of herbal plant products. The quality and quantity of herbal samples are critical for the success of HTS programs. In the recent past, there have been substantial improvements in HTS due to the miniaturization and integration of microchip (e.g., Herbochip((R)), DNA chip, protein chip, cell chip, etc.)-based technologies so as to design herbal drugs that compete with synthetic drug analogs. Here we will review various technologies used for HTS of herbal medicines. Finally, we will summarize our efforts to develop a novel chip-based HTS assay to explore the antioxidant and radioprotective properties of herbal plants.",

The state of affairs may be explained by the lack of simple and inexpensive screening tests., METHODS: In eleven healthy men, we tested the hypothesis that a simple Valsalva maneuver could detect drug-induced changes in baroreflex function that have previously been described using more elaborate and invasive methodologies. They performed Valsalva maneuvers after selective pharmacological inhibition of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, crossover fashion. Patients with severe autonomic failure served as positive controls., RESULTS: NET inhibition profoundly augmented the blood pressure decrease during phase II and attenuated the blood pressure overshoot in phase IV compared with placebo. Furthermore, NET inhibition increased the heart rate response during the Valsalva maneuver., INTERPRETATION: The Valsalva maneuver recapitulated complex alterations in baroreflex regulation during NET inhibition. Thus, this simple and inexpensive test could be employed as a screening tool for drug-induced baroreflex dysfunction.",

METHODS: Offering two-field mydriatic digital photographic screening to all people with diabetes in England over the age of 12 years. STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT: The programme is in its infancy, receiving the first year's annual reports from approximately 96 screening programmes, each of which have developed to offer screening to a minimum number of 12,000 people with diabetes, which would cover a population of 350,000 people with 3.4% diabetes prevalence. The national programme has commenced the External quality assurance (QA) programme in order to achieve and sustain the highest possible standards. POTENTIAL BENEFITS: England has a population of two million people with diabetes over the age of 12 and it is believed that there is a prevalence of blindness of 4200 and an annual incidence of blindness of 1280 people with diabetes. This programme has the potential to reduce the prevalence of blindness in England from 4200 people to 1000 people and a conservative estimate of reducing the annual incidence of DR blindness by one-third would save 427 people per annum from blindness. These figures are based on the UK certification of blindness but if World Health Organization (WHO) definitions are used the prevalence, incidence and potential reductions in blindness are much greater.",

        "abstract": "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology has emerged as a new and powerful technique to investigate the interaction between low-molecular-weight molecules and target proteins. In the present work, the authors assemble from a large compound collection a library of 2226 molecules (fragments having low molecular weights between 100 and 300 Da) to screen them for binding to chymase, a serine protease. Both the active chymase and a zymogen-like form of the protein were used in parallel to distinguish between specific and unspecific binding. The relative ligand-binding activity of the immobilized protein was periodically measured with a reference compound. The screening experiments were performed at 25 {degrees}C at a fragment concentration of 200 \u00b5M in the presence of 2% DMSO. Applying the filter cascade, affinity--selectivity--competition (competition with reference compounds and cross-competition with fragments), 80 compounds show up as positive screening hits. Competition experiments between fragments show that they bind to different parts of the active site. Of 36 fragments co-crystallized for X-ray studies, 12 could be located in the active site of the protein. These results validate the authors' library and demonstrate that the application of SPR technology as a filter in fragment screening can be achieved successfully.

        "abstract": "The decision on whether to implement a 20-year screening programme for a cancer requires weighing the harms and costs against the health benefits (such as the number of cancer deaths averted every year). The evidence of the benefits is often based on a single-number summary, such as the mortality reduction over the entire follow-up time in a single trial, or an average of such one-number measures from a meta-analysis of several trials. There are several problems associated with using the traditional one-number summaries from trials to deduce the yearly mortality reductions expected from a sustained screening programme. We here propose using a rate ratio curve, and its complement (a mortality reduction curve), to address the mortality impact (timing, magnitude, and duration) of a screening programme. This curve is easy to interpret, as it shows when mortality reductions begin, how big they are, and how long they last. We illustrate when and how such rate ratio curves from screening trials could be computed, and how they could be used to compare reduction patterns expected with different screening regimens. We encourage trialists to report the necessary data to arrive at such projections.",

This study investigates how the accuracy of breast cancer screening could be improved.\\n\\nMETHOD: Draw a comparison between screening for breast cancer and other inspection tasks that have been studied in the experimental psychological laboratory to suggest two low cost fixes that might improve the accuracy of breast cancer screening.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS: (1) Radiologists should not work for more than half an hour at a time; (2) two radiologists double reading should inspect the same series of mammograms in inverse order; (3) there should be a clerical check to see whether the efficiency of detection decreases with time on task; and (4) a more sophisticated engineering of the screening procedure might be accomplished by assembling a library of mammograms for which the correct diagnosis is known. If these library mammograms were mixed randomly with those to be inspected in some suitable ratio, it would then be possible to provide the radiologist with immediate feedback on the accuracy of (some of) his/her diagnoses. From experimental studies of inspection tasks this should improve diagnostic accuracy. These recommendations, of course, require evaluation in field trials.",

        "abstract": "Oncology drug discovery is, by definition, a target-rich enterprise. High-throughput screening (HTS) laboratories have supported a wide array of molecularly targeted and chemical genomic approaches for anticancer lead generation, and the number of hits emerging from such campaigns has increased dramatically. Although automation of HTS processes has eliminated primary screening as a bottleneck, the demands on secondary screening in appropriate cell-based assays have increased concomitantly with the numbers of hits delivered to therapeutic area laboratories. The authors describe herein the implementation of a novel platform using off-the-shelf solutions that have allowed them to efficiently characterize hundreds of HTS hits using a palette of Western blot-based pharmacodynamic assays. The platform employs a combination of a flatbed bufferless SDS-PAGE system, a dry ultra-rapid electroblotting apparatus, and a highly sensitive and quantitative infrared imaging system. Cumulatively, this platform has significantly reduced the cycle time for HTS hit evaluation. In addition, the routine use of this platform has resulted in higher quality data that have allowed the development of structure-activity databases that have tangibly improved lead optimization. The authors describe in detail the application of this platform, designated the Accelerated Pharmaco-Dynamic Profiler (APDP), to the annotation of inhibitors of 2 attractive oncology targets, BRAF kinase and Hsp90.",

        "abstract": "Screening of solution stability provides an early alert on potential liabilities of drug candidates so that strategies can be developed to overcome the challenges. A fully automated solution stability assay has been developed to accelerate traditional manual operation. The assay uses the advanced capabilities of a high-performance liquid chromatography instrument that is present in many pharmaceutical research laboratories. The samples are prepared automatically by a temperature-controlled autosampler. The samples are delivered to the stability matrices, mixed, incubated, and injected at selected time points during the reaction time course. This automated process occurs without operator intervention, thus allowing 96 experiments to be run with 0.5 h of a scientist's time compared to 8 h for the same study when performed manually. Automation not only eliminates the manual operation but also improves accuracy and throughput. The assay protocol has been optimized to achieve homogenous mixing and eliminate carryover. The assay is robust, flexible, and high throughput. It can be used to study stability for a large number of samples under multiple incubation conditions and has a wide range of applications in drug discovery and development, such as screening compound stability in biological assay media, obtaining a stability-pH profile, surveying compound stability in physiological fluids, and performing development forced degradation and excipient compatibility.",

        "abstract": "Inherited deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) can result in a potentially lethal disorder called classic galactosemia. Although the neonatal lethality associated with this disease can be prevented through early diagnosis and a galactose-restricted diet, the lack of effective therapy continues to have consequences: developmental delay, neurological disorders, and premature ovarian failure are common sequelae in childhood and adulthood. Several lines of evidence indicate that an elevated level of galactose-1-phosphate (gal-1-p), the product of galactokinase (GALK), is a major, if not sole, pathogenic mechanism in patients with classic galactosemia. The authors hypothesize that elimination of gal-1-p production by inhibiting GALK will relieve GALT-deficient cells from galactose toxicity. To test this hypothesis, they obtained human GALK using a bacterial expression system. They developed a robust, miniaturized, high-throughput GALK assay (Z' factor = 0.91) and used this assay to screen against libraries composed of 50,000 chemical compounds with diverse structural scaffolds. They selected 150 compounds that, at an average concentration of 33.3 microM, inhibited GALK activity in vitro more than 86.5% and with a reproducibility score of at least 0.7 for a confirmatory screen under identical experimental conditions. Of these 150 compounds, 34 were chosen for further characterization. Preliminary results indicated that these 34 compounds have potential to serve as leads to the development of more effective therapy of classic galactosemia.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Self-sampling for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing is accepted by up to 30% of non-attendees to the regular cervical screening programme. Here, the yield of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2 or worse (\u2a7eCIN2) and CIN3 or worse (\u2a7eCIN3) of 15, 274 HPV self-sampling responders amongst non-attendees were compared to that of 176, 027 women participating in regular screening in the same period and in the same region. We also analysed which subpopulations amongst non-attendees are targeted by HPV self-sampling, and which characteristics relate to hrHPV prevalence and yield of \u2a7eCIN2/\u2a7eCIN3. METHOD: Data from two consecutive self-sampling studies were pooled. \u2a7eCIN2/\u2a7eCIN3 yields, screening history, age and ethnic status were retrieved from centralised pathology and screening databases, respectively. A logistic regression model was fitted to analyse method of invitation, ethnicity, age group, and screening history as predictors for response rate, hrHPV presence and \u2a7eCIN2/\u2a7eCIN3 in non-attendees. For screening history analyses, women <34years were excluded since it was the first screening round in their life. FINDINGS: \u2a7eCIN2/\u2a7eCIN3 yields of HPV self-sampling responders were higher than those of screening participants (\u2a7eCIN2: relative risk (RR)=1.6, 95% confidence interval=1.4-1.9; \u2a7eCIN3: RR=1.8, 95%CI=1.5-2.1 with relative risk values increasing with age (test of homogeneity: \u2a7eCIN2: p=0.04; \u2a7eCIN3: p=0.03). Native Dutch non-attendees responded better than immigrants (32% versus 22%, p<0\u00b7001) and those screened in the previous round revealed a higher response than underscreened (i.e. previous smear taken >7years ago) or never screened (34% versus 25%, p<0\u00b7001) women. Strikingly, amongst under- and never screened women aged \u2a7e39years, never screened women responded better (25% versus 23%, p<0\u00b7001). \u2a7eCIN2 rates were higher amongst responding native Dutch women than immigrants (p<0\u00b701), and higher in under-/never screened women than in women screened in the previous round (p<0\u00b701). INTERPRETATION: Offering hrHPV self-sampling increases the efficacy of the screening programme by targeting a substantial portion of non-attendees of all ethnic groups who have not regularly been screened and are at highest risk of \u2a7eCIN2.",

Discovery of therapeutic antibodies and characterization of peptides can necessitate high expression of the target gene requiring the generation of clonal stably transfected cell lines. Traditional challenges of stable cell line transfection include gene silencing and cell-to-cell variability. Our inability to control these can present challenges in lead isolation. Recent progress in site-specific targeting of transgene to specific genomic loci has transformed the ability to generate stably transfected mammalian cell lines. In this article, we describe how the use of the Jump-In platform (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) has been applied to drug discovery projects. It can easily and rapidly generate homogeneous high-expressing cell pools with a high degree of reproducibility.

        "abstract": "Objectives Unsupervised online direct-to-consumer (DTC) access to medical services has rapidly expanded to medical screening tests, which have not been critically evaluated for their evidence basis. The objective of this study is to identify the scope of online-advertised DTC screening tests, outline the evidence for use of available DTC testing and suggest regulatory reform to address the relevant issues. Methods An observational study of website advertisements, testing services and counselling/follow-up services for DTC testing was conducted. Data were collected from websites between 4 April and 1 June 2011. Each website was assessed for tests offered, advertised indications and availability of counselling/follow-up services. Advertised testing indications were compared with US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations and/or specialty guidelines and categorized as Supported, Against, Insufficient Evidence or No Guidance. Results Of 20 companies identified as offering DTC screening tests, 95% (19/20) do not clearly offer pretest counselling, post-test counselling and/or test follow-up. One hundred and twenty-seven different tests were identified. Only 19/127 (15%) could be Supported for screening in a target group selected for testing; 38/127 (30%) were given recommendations to avoid use in specific target group(s) selected for testing ('Against recommendations'); 29/127 (23%) had Insufficient Evidence of value, and for 64/127 (50%) No Guidance could be given. Only 4/127 (3%) tests were Supported for general screening use. Conclusions Virtually all identified medical tests advertised and offered DTC are not recommended for use in screening by evidence-based guidelines. Limited oversight may lead to inaccurate self-diagnosis, treatment and wasted health resources.",

        "abstract": "Drug-plasma protein binding is an important parameter that, together with other physicochemical properties such as lipophilicity and pKa, greatly influences drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Therefore, it is important for pharmaceutical companies to develop a rapid screening assay to examine plasma protein binding during the early stages of the drug discovery process. Human serum albumin (HSA) and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP) are the most important plasma proteins that are capable of binding drugs. In this work, an automated and high-throughput (<3min/compound) strategy was developed using high performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) with commercial HSA and AGP columns to evaluate drug-plasma protein interactions for drug screening. A generic gradient was used throughout the study to separate drugs that were weakly and tightly bound to HSA and AGP. To accelerate the analysis time, the system was calibrated in a single run by pooling reference compounds without overloading the column. For both HSA and AGP studies, the developed methods were successfully transferred from HPAC-UV to HPAC-MS with single quadrupole MS detection and ammonium acetate, pH 7.0 as a volatile mobile phase. The MS detection enhanced the sensitivity, selectivity, and throughput of the method by pooling unknown compounds. For HSA analyses, the binding percentages obtained using HPAC were well correlated with the binding percentages from the literature. This method was also able to rank compounds based on their affinity for HSA. Concerning the AGP analyses, the quality of the correlation between the binding percentages obtained in HPAC and those from the literature was weaker. However, the method was able to classify compounds into weak, medium, and strong binders and rank compounds based on their affinity for AGP. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Cancer is a serious threat to human health. Although numerous anti-cancer drugs are available clinically, many have shown toxic side effects due to poor tumor-selectivity, and reduced effectiveness due to cancers rapid development of resistance to treatment. The development of new highly efficient and practical methods to quantify cell viability and its change under drug treatment is thus of significant importance in both understanding of anti-cancer mechanism and anti-cancer drug screening. Here, we present an approach of utilizing a nanomechanical fluctuation based highly sensitive microcantilever sensor, which is capable of characterizing the viability of cells and quantitatively screening (within tens of minutes) their responses to a drug with the obvious advantages of a rapid, label-free, quantitative, noninvasive, real-time and in-situ assay. The microcantilever sensor operated in fluctuation mode was used in evaluating the paclitaxel effectiveness on breast cancer cell line MCF-7. This study demonstrated that the nanomechanical fluctuations of the microcantilever sensor are sensitive enough to detect the dynamic variation in cellular force which is provided by the cytoskeleton, using cell metabolism as its energy source, and the dynamic instability of microtubules plays an important role in the generation of the force. We propose that cell viability consists of two parts: biological viability and mechanical viability. Our experimental results suggest that paclitaxel has little effect on biological viability, but has a significant effect on mechanical viability. This new method provides a new concept and strategy for the evaluation of cell viability and the screening of anti-cancer drugs.",

NMR-based screening has the advantage of directly detecting binding of a compound to the target. The spectra resulting from these screens can also be very complex and difficult to analyze, making this an inefficient process. We present here a method, RAMPED-UP NMR, (Rapid Analysis and Multiplexing of Experimentally Discriminated Uniquely Labeled Proteins using NMR) which generates simple spectra which are easy to interpret and allows several proteins to be screened simultaneously. In this method, the proteins to be screened are uniquely labeled with one amino acid type. There are several benefits derived from this unique labeling strategy: the spectra are greatly simplified, resonances that are most likely to be affected by binding are the only ones observed, and peaks that yield little or no information upon binding are eliminated, allowing the analysis of multiple proteins easily and simultaneously. We demonstrate the ability of three different proteins to be analyzed simultaneously for binding to two different ligands. This method will have significant impact in the use of NMR spectroscopy for both the lead generation and lead optimization phases of drug discovery by its ability to increase screening throughput and the ability to examine selectivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in any format that multiple proteins can be screened in one tube.",

        "abstract": "Target-based high-throughput screening (HTS) has recently been critiqued for its relatively poor yield compared to phenotypic screening approaches. One type of phenotypic screening, image-based high-content screening (HCS), has been seen as particularly promising. In this article, we assess whether HCS is as high content as it can be. We analyze HCS publications and find that although the number of HCS experiments published each year continues to grow steadily, the information content lags behind. We find that a majority of high-content screens published so far (60-80%) made use of only one or two image-based features measured from each sample and disregarded the distribution of those features among each cell population. We discuss several potential explanations, focusing on the hypothesis that data analysis traditions are to blame. This includes practical problems related to managing large and multidimensional HCS data sets as well as the adoption of assay quality statistics from HTS to HCS. Both may have led to the simplification or systematic rejection of assays carrying complex and valuable phenotypic information. We predict that advanced data analysis methods that enable full multiparametric data to be harvested for entire cell populations will enable HCS to finally reach its potential.",

        "title": "Facility Mammography Volume in Relation to Breast Cancer Screening Outcomes",
        "abstract": "Objectives To clarify the relationship between facility-level mammography interpretive volume and breast cancer screening outcomes.Methods We calculated annual mammography interpretive volumes from 2000\u20132009 for 116 facilities participating in the U.S. Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC). Radiology, pathology, cancer registry, and women\u2019s self-report information were used to determine the indication for each exam, cancer characteristics, and patient characteristics. We examined the effect of annual total volume and percentage of mammograms that were screening on cancer detection rates using multinomial logistic regression adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, time since last mammogram, and BCSC registries. \u201cGood prognosis\u201d tumours were defined as screen-detected invasive cancers that were <15 mm, early stage, and lymph node negative at diagnosis.Results From 3,098,481 screening mammograms, 9,899 cancers were screen-detected within one year of the exam. Approximately 80% of facilities had annual total interpretive volumes of >2,000 mammograms, and 42% had >5,000. Higher total volume facilities were significantly more likely to diagnose invasive tumours with good prognoses (odds ratio [OR] 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10\u20131.60, for total volume of 5,000\u201310,000/year v. 1,000\u20132,000/year; p-for-trend <0.001). A concomitant decrease in tumours with poor prognosis was seen (OR 0.78; 95%CI 0.63\u20130.98 for total volume of 5,000\u201310,000/year v. 1,000\u20132,000/year).Conclusions Mammography facilities with higher total interpretive volumes detected more good prognosis invasive tumours and fewer poor prognosis invasive tumours, suggesting that women attending these facilities may be more likely to benefit from screening.",

Among centres reporting number enrolled by method, about 19,000 participants were enrolled with direct mail, about 4200 with mass media, and about 1000 with community outreach. Cost per enrollee varied across centres but medians were (US) $101 (direct mail), $79 (mass media), and $4 (community outreach). Co-ordinators reported that it was important to know where to find persons likely to be eligible and interested, and how best to approach them.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Most NLST participants were recruited through direct mail, although median cost per participant was highest for that method.",

        "abstract": "Innovation and new molecular entity production by the pharmaceutical industry has been below expectations. Surprisingly, more first-in-class small-molecule drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1999 and 2008 were identified by functional phenotypic lead generation strategies reminiscent of pre-genomics pharmacology than contemporary molecular targeted strategies that encompass the vast majority of lead generation efforts. This observation, in conjunction with the difficulty in validating molecular targets for drug discovery, has diminished the impact of the \"genomics revolution\" and has led to a growing grassroots movement and now broader trend in pharma to reconsider the use of modern physiology-based or phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) strategies. This \"From the Guest Editors\" column provides an introduction and overview of the two-part special issues of Journal of Biomolecular Screening on PDD. Terminology and the business case for use of PDD are defined. Key issues such as assay performance, chemical optimization, target identification, and challenges to the organization and implementation of PDD are discussed. Possible solutions for these challenges and a new neoclassic vision for PDD that combines phenotypic and functional approaches with technology innovations resulting from the genomics-driven era of target-based drug discovery (TDD) are also described. Finally, an overview of the manuscripts in this special edition is provided.",

At the same time, it brings about a challenge of how to efficiently identify the potential drug candidates from thousands of compounds. A way used to deal with the challenge is to consider the drug pharmacokinetic properties, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME), in the early stage of drug development. Among ADME properties, metabolism is of importance due to the strong association with efficacy and safety of drug. The review will focus on in silico approaches for prediction of Cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism. We will describe these predictive methods from two aspects, structure-based and data-based. Moreover, the applications and limitations of various methods will be discussed. Finally, we provide further direction toward improving the predictive accuracy of these in silico methods.",

        "title": "Applications of Biophysics in High-Throughput Screening Hit Validation.",
        "abstract": "For approximately a decade, biophysical methods have been used to validate positive hits selected from high-throughput screening (HTS) campaigns with the goal to verify binding interactions using label-free assays. By applying label-free readouts, screen artifacts created by compound interference and fluorescence are discovered, enabling further characterization of the hits for their target specificity and selectivity. The use of several biophysical methods to extract this type of high-content information is required to prevent the promotion of false positives to the next level of hit validation and to select the best candidates for further chemical optimization. The typical technologies applied in this arena include dynamic light scattering, turbidometry, resonance waveguide, surface plasmon resonance, differential scanning fluorimetry, mass spectrometry, and others. Each technology can provide different types of information to enable the characterization of the binding interaction. Thus, these technologies can be incorporated in a hit-validation strategy not only according to the profile of chemical matter that is desired by the medicinal chemists, but also in a manner that is in agreement with the target protein's amenability to the screening format. Here, we present the results of screening strategies using biophysics with the objective to evaluate the approaches, discuss the advantages and challenges, and summarize the benefits in reference to lead discovery. In summary, the biophysics screens presented here demonstrated various hit rates from a list of ~2000 preselected, IC50-validated hits from HTS (an IC50 is the inhibitor concentration at which 50% inhibition of activity is observed). There are several lessons learned from these biophysical screens, which will be discussed in this article.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the existing newborn sickle haemoglobinopathy screening programme in Jamaica.\\n\\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis of infants screened during the period 8 November 1995 to 22 July 2006 was performed. Patient data for analyses was restricted to patients with homozygous (Hb SS) sickle cell disease. Published data from the Jamaican Sickle Cell Cohort Study was used to make comparisons with the study sample.\\n\\nRESULTS: The study sample consisted of 435 patients with Hb SS disease. Acute chest syndrome was the most common clinical (non-death) event accounting for approximately 50% of all events. Acute splenic sequestration, no longer a significant cause of mortality, was responsible for approximately 32% of clinical events. Seven deaths (1.8%) occurred during the study period compared with 17.6% to the same age in the Jamaican Sickle Cell Cohort Study. There was a lower proportion of hospital admissions and episodes of serious illness in the study group compared with controls.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Survival estimates for the study sample showed improvement compared with the Jamaican Sickle Cell Cohort Study. This study continues to demonstrate the benefits of, and as such shows support for, newborn screening and early interventions in sickle cell disease. In addition, it highlights some of the areas for continued focus and research development. Although the current system is providing an essential and beneficial service, the study emphasizes the need for newborn screening programmes to be comprehensive care systems to be fully effective.",

        "abstract": "The authors describe first a proof-of-concept experiment to show direct affinity screening using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) is a rapid and informative approach for natural product extract screening. The study used 10 alkaloid-enriched plant extracts and 8 desalted marine extracts spiked with specific inhibitors of bovine carbonic anhydrase II (bCAII; EC4.2.1.1) as a model set. The spiked extracts were incubated with bCAII and then analyzed by ESI-FTICR-MS. The noncovalent complexes were detected, and the specific inhibitors were reidentified in the spiked natural product extracts. There was no interference from the desalted/alkaloid-enriched extracts to the formation of the noncovalent complexes. The method allowed quick identification of the molecular mass of the bound ligand. The authors then applied the screening to identify active compounds in natural product extracts. They employed direct infusion and online size exclusion chromatography (SEC) ESI-FTICR-MS to detect intact target-ligand complex. Eighty-five methanolic plant extracts were screened against bCAII by direct infusion ESI-FTICR-MS and by online SEC-ESI-FTICR-MS. One noncovalent complex was identified from the same plant extract by both methods. The molecular weight of the bound ligand from this extract was determined. Mass-directed purification gave 6-(1S-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-7-methoxy-2H-chromen-2-one (1) as the active compound. Subsequently, the binding to bCAII was confirmed by ESI-FTICR-MS. The binding specificity was determined by competition experiments between 1 and furosemide, a specific ligand of bCAII.",

        "abstract": "Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that has emerged as an important target in cancer and several other diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, nerve injuries, inflammation, and infection. Discovery of novel agents that inhibit Hsp90 and have druglike properties is therefore a major focus in several academic and industrial laboratories. In this study, the authors describe the development and optimization in a 384-well format of a novel assay for the identification of Hsp90 inhibitors using fluorescence polarization, which measures competitive binding of red-shifted fluorescently labeled geldanamycin (GM-cy3B) to Hsp90 found in the NCI-N417 small-cell lung carcinoma cells. The authors demonstrate that GMcy3B binds with high affinity and specificity to cellular Hsp90. The assay results in excellent signal-to-noise ratios (>10) and Z\u2032 values (>0.75) at tracer concentrations greater than 4 nM and 1 \u00b5g/well of total NCI-N417 protein, indicating a robust assay. It also equilibrates after 5 h of incubation at room temperature and remains stable for up to 24 h. Furthermore, it is a simple mix-and-read format that is cost-effective and uses only low amounts of fluorophore and cell lysates. A study using more than 15,000 compounds from the National Institutes of Health Molecular Libraries Screening Center Network was performed to validate its performance in a high-throughput screening format.

        "abstract": "Objectives To identify the most effective, safe and cost-effective method of antenatal screening for Down's syndrome using nuchal translucency (NT), maternal serum and urine markers in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, and maternal age in various combinations.Design A prospective study of women who booked for their antenatal care at about 8-14 weeks of gestation, with follow-up to identify pregnancies with Down's syndrome ascertained through second trimester screening or at birth.Setting Twenty-five maternity units (24 in the UK and one in Austria) offering second trimester Down's syndrome serum screening that agreed to collect observational data in the first trimester.Participants The results were based on 47,053 singleton pregnancies, including 101 pregnancies with Down's syndrome.Measurements and tests NT measurements were included if obtained between 9 and 13 weeks of pregnancy; serum and urine samples were also taken and stored. Another pair of serum and urine samples was collected in the second trimester and included if obtained between 14 and 20 weeks. Urine and serum samples from each affected pregnancy and five matched controls were tested for:Serum:alphafetoprotein (AFP)total human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)unconjugated oestriol (uE(3))pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A)free beta-hCG.dimeric inhibin-A.Urine:invasive trophoblast antigen (ITA)beta-core fragmenttotal hCGfree beta-hCG.The matching criteria were gestation (using an ultrasound crown-rump length or biparietal diameter measurement), duration of storage, and centre. Screening performance of the individual markers and combinations of markers together with maternal age was assessed using standard methods. In addition pairs of first and second trimester serum samples from 600 controls were tested to secure a larger set in which screening performance could be determined using distribution parameters based on dates (time since first day of the last menstrual period).Main outcome measures The following were determined for different combinations of markers:efficacy (by assessing screening performance, focusing on the false-positive rate (FPR) for an 85% detection rate (DR))safety (focusing on the number of fetal losses due to amniocentesis (or chorionic villus sampling) in 100,000 women screened)cost-effectiveness (focusing on the cost of screening 100,000 women and the cost per Down's syndrome pregnancy diagnosed).Results Efficacy (screening performance) The false-positive rates for an 85% detection rate for the main screening tests are shown in the above table, in decreasing order of screening performance:With the serum integrated test, 10 weeks is the preferred time in pregnancy for the PAPP-A measurement. For the integrated test and the combined test, the timing of the measurement of the first trimester markers is less critical.Safety The lower false-positive rate with the integrated test compared with other tests means that at an 85% detection rate there would be nine diagnostic procedure-related unaffected fetal losses per 100,000 women screened compared with 44 using the combined test or 45 with the quadruple test.Cost-effectiveness Screening using the integrated test is less costly than might be expected because the extra screening costs tend to be offset by savings in the cost of diagnosis arising from the low false-positive rate. It was estimated that to achieve an 85% detection rate the cost to the UK NHS would be pound15,300 per Down's syndrome pregnancy detected. The corresponding cost using the second trimester quadruple test would be pound16,800 and using the first trimester combined test it would be pound19,000.Conclusions Implications for healthcare The results showed that screening performance in the first trimester of pregnancy was virtually the same as that in the second trimester, and in either it was much less effective than integrating screening measurements from both trimesters into a single test. In applying these results to screening practice several conclusions can be drawn. The following tests offer the most effective and safe method of screening:overall: the integrated testif an NT measurement is not available: the serum integrated testfor women who do not attend for antenatal care until the second trimester of pregnancy: the quadruple testfor women who choose to have a screening test in the first trimester: the combined test.At a constant detection rate, the cost-effectiveness of these four tests is broadly similar, any extra screening costs tending to be offset by fewer diagnostic costs. The evidence presented in this report does not support retaining the double test, the triple test, or NT measurements on their own (with or without maternal age) because each would lead to many more women having invasive diagnostic tests, without increasing the proportion of Down's syndrome pregnancies detected.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Obesity is associated with an increased cancer incidence and mortality and therefore cancer screening is particularly important for obese individuals. However, some US studies find lower screening uptake in this group. This study explored whether rates of breast and colorectal screening in England are lower for obese than healthy weight individuals.\\n\\nSETTING: Data were from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA).\\n\\nMETHODS: We analysed data from adults who were eligible to have been invited to the UK national screening programmes for breast or colorectal cancer (CRC) in the last five years, and had been given the screening module in Wave 5 of ELSA (N\u2009=\u20091804 for CRC screening, N\u2009=\u20092401 for breast cancer screening). Weight and height were measured by a nurse at Wave 4 (two years earlier). Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds of breast and CRC screening (ever) for participants in higher weight categories (Body Mass Index [BMI]\u2009\u2265\u200925) compared with healthy weight individuals (BMI <25), controlling for socio-demographic variables.\\n\\nRESULTS: Of ELSA participants, 63% reported CRC screening, and 92% of the women reported breast cancer screening. Obesity was associated with lower CRC screening, but effects were strongest for class III obesity (BMI \u226540) (45% screened; OR\u2009=\u20090.48, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.32-0.93, P\u2009=\u2009.029). There was no association between weight status and breast cancer screening.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Severe obesity appears to be a deterrent to CRC screening but not breast cancer screening. Targeted interventions may be required to promote CRC screening uptake in this group, which already has a heightened risk as a consequence of weight.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, the diversity of a library of drug-metabolizing bacterial cytochrome P450 (P450) BM3 mutants was evaluated by a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based screening method. A strategy was designed to identify a minimal set of BM3 mutants that displays differences in regio- and stereoselectivities and is suitable to metabolize a large fraction of drug chemistry space. We first screened the activities of six structurally diverse BM3 mutants toward a library of 43 marketed drugs (encompassing a wide range of human P450 phenotypes, cLogP values, charges, and molecular weights) using a rapid LC-MS method with an automated method development and data-processing system. Significant differences in metabolic activity were found for the mutants tested and based on this drug library screen; nine structurally diverse probe drugs were selected that were subsequently used to study the metabolism of a library of 14 BM3 mutants in more detail. Using this alternative screening strategy, we were able to select a minimal set of BM3 mutants with high metabolic activities and diversity with respect to substrate specificity and regiospecificity that could produce both human relevant and BM3 unique drug metabolites. This panel of four mutants (M02, MT35, MT38, and MT43) was capable of producing P450-mediated metabolites for 41 of the 43 drugs tested while metabolizing 77% of the drugs by more than 20%. We observed this as the first step in our approach to use of bacterial P450 enzymes as general reagents for lead diversification in the drug development process and the biosynthesis of drug(-like) metabolites.",

        "title": "Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms: the effects of age and social deprivation on screening uptake, prevalence and attendance at follow-up in the MASS trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/SETTING: The effectiveness of screening programmes may be improved by  knowledge of factors affecting screening uptake, disease prevalence and attendance for follow-up. Data from the Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS) are used to examine the influences of age and social deprivation in the context of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). METHODS: In the MASS trial, a population-based sample of 34,000 men aged 65 to 74 received an invitation to screening. The associations of attendance at screening with age, social deprivation and season of the year when invited to attend were investigated using logistic regression analysis. Similar analyses were performed for AAA prevalence and attendance at recall scans. RESULTS: Compared with men aged 65-69, those aged 70-74 were less likely to attend screening (79% vs 81%), had increased prevalence of AAA (6% vs 4%) and were less likely to attend for follow-up (79% vs 84%). Compared with those in the least deprived quartile, those in the most deprived quartile also were less likely to attend (75% vs 85%), had increased prevalence (6% vs 4%) and were less likely to attend for follow-up (80% vs 83%). Season showed no significant association with attendance at initial screening. CONCLUSIONS: Higher age and social deprivation are associated with both poorer attendance at screening and follow-up, and having an AAA. This highlights the importance of promoting screening programmes, particularly to the more deprived populations.",

        "abstract": "Stem cells, irrespective of their origin, have emerged as valuable reagents or tools in human health in the past 2 decades. Initially, a research tool to study fundamental aspects of developmental biology is now the central focus of generating transgenic animals, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine to address degenerative diseases of multiple organ systems. This is because stem cells are pluripotent or multipotent cells that can recapitulate developmental paths to repair damaged tissues. However, it is becoming clear that stem cell therapy alone may not be adequate to reverse tissue and organ damage in degenerative diseases. Existing small-molecule drugs and biologicals may be needed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153molecular adjuvants\u00e2\u20ac  or enhancers of stem cells administered in therapy or adult stem cells in the diseased tissues. Hence, a combination of stem cell-based, high-throughput screening and 3D tissue engineering approaches is necessary to advance the next wave of tools in preclinical drug discovery. In this review, the authors have attempted to provide a basic account of various stem cells types, as well as their biology and signaling, in the context of research in regenerative medicine. An attempt is made to link stem cells as reagents, pharmacology, and tissue engineering as converging fields of research for the next decade. (Journal of Biomolecular Screening 2009:755-768)",

        "abstract": "Signaling by the BCR-ABL fusion kinase drives Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Despite their clinical activity in many patients with CML, the BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors (BCR-ABL-KIs) imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib provide only transient leukemia reduction in patients with Ph+ ALL. While host-derived growth factors in the leukemia microenvironment have been invoked to explain this drug resistance, their relative contribution remains uncertain. Using genetically defined murine Ph+ ALL cells, we identified interleukin 7 (IL-7) as the dominant host factor that attenuates response to BCR-ABL-KIs. To identify potential combination drugs that could overcome this IL-7-dependent BCR-ABL-KI-resistant phenotype, we screened a small-molecule library including Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs. Among the validated hits, the well-tolerated antimalarial drug dihydroartemisinin (DHA) displayed potent activity in vitro and modest in vivo monotherapy activity against engineered murine BCR-ABL-KI-resistant Ph+ ALL. Strikingly, cotreatment with DHA and dasatinib in vivo strongly reduced primary leukemia burden and improved long-term survival in a murine model that faithfully captures the BCR-ABL-KI-resistant phenotype of human Ph+ ALL. This cotreatment protocol durably cured 90% of treated animals, suggesting that this cell-based screening approach efficiently identified drugs that could be rapidly moved to human clinical testing.",

        "abstract": "The concept of ligand-receptor binding kinetics is emerging as an important parameter in the early phase of drug discovery. Since the currently used kinetic assays are laborious and low throughput, we developed a method that enables fast and large format screening. It is a so-called dual-point competition association assay, which measures radioligand binding at two different time points in the absence or presence of unlabeled competitors. Specifically, this assay yields the kinetic rate index (KRI), which is a measure for the binding kinetics of the unlabeled ligands screened. As a prototypical drug target, the adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)R) was chosen for assay validation and optimization. A screen with 35 high-affinity A(1)R antagonists yielded seven compounds with a KRI value above 1.0, which indicated a relatively slow dissociation from the target. All other compounds had a KRI value below or equal to 1.0, predicting a relatively fast dissociation rate. Several compounds were selected for follow-up kinetic quantifications in classical kinetic assays and were shown to have kinetic rates that corresponded to their KRI values. The dual-point assay and KRI value may have general applicability at other G-protein-coupled receptors, as well as at drug targets from other protein families.",

        "abstract": "High throughput inhibition screens for human cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are being used in preclinical drug metabolism to support drug discovery programs. The versatility of scintillation proximity assay (SPA) technology has enabled the development of a homogeneous high throughput assay for cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibition screen using [O-methyl-(14)C]dextromethorphan as substrate. The basis of the assay was the trapping of the O-demethylation product, [(14)C]HCHO, on SPA beads. Enzyme kinetics parameters V(max) and apparent K(m), determined using pooled human liver microsomes and microsomes from baculovirus cells coexpressing human CYP2D6 and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, were 245 pmol [(14)C]HCHO/min/mg protein and 11 microM, and 27 pmol [(14)C]HCHO/min/pmol and 1.6 microM, respectively. In incubations containing either pooled microsomes or recombinant CYP2D6, [(14)C]dextromethorphan O-demethylase activity was inhibited in the presence of quinidine (IC(50) = 1.0 microM and 20 nM, respectively). By comparison, inhibitors selective for other CYP isoforms were relatively weak (IC(50) > 25 microM). In agreement, a selective CYP2D6 inhibitory monoclonal antibody caused greater than 90% inhibition of [(14)C]dextromethorphan O-demethylase activity in human liver microsomes, whereas CYP2C9/19- and CYP3A4/5-selective antibodies elicited a minimal inhibitory effect. SPA-based [(14)C]dextromethorphan O-demethylase activity was also shown to correlate (r(2) = 0.6) with dextromethorphan O-demethylase measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in a bank of human liver microsomes (N = 15 different organ donors). In a series of known CYP2D6 inhibitors/substrates, the SPA-based assay resolved potent inhibitors (IC(50) < 2 microM) from weak inhibitors (IC(50) >or= 20 microM). It is concluded that the SPA-based assay described herein is suitable for CYP2D6 inhibition screening using either native human liver microsomes or cDNA-expressed CYP2D6.",

A cross-sectional survey was used in clinical and non-clinical Indigenous and non-Indigenous services across Queensland Australia. A total of 175 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from urban, rural, regional and remote locations in Queensland took part in the study. Measures included the Indigenous Risk Impact Screen (IRIS), the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS), the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire (LDQ). Additional Mental Health measures included the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ). Principle axis factoring analysis of the IRIS revealed two factors corresponding with (i) alcohol and drug and (ii) mental health. The IRIS alcohol and drug and mental health subscales demonstrated good convergent validity with other well-established screening instruments and both subscales showed high internal consistency. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was used to generate cut-offs for the two subscales and t-tests validated the utility of these cut-offs for determining risky levels of drinking. The study validated statistically the utility of the IRIS as a screen for alcohol and drug and mental health risk. The instrument is therefore recommended as a brief screening instrument for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.",

The authors provide an overview of utrophin biology with a focus on regulation of the utrophin promoter and discuss current attempts in identifying utrophin promoter-activating molecules using high-throughput screening (HTS).\\n\\nEXPERT OPINION: The characterisation of utrophin promoter regulatory mechanisms coupled with advances in HTS have allowed researchers to undertake screens and identify a number of promising lead compounds that may prove useful for DMD. In principle, these pharmacological compounds offer significant advantages from a translational viewpoint for developing DMD therapeutics.",

Knowledge-based selection of descriptors that are suitable for specific applications is an important task in chemoinformatics research. If descriptors are to be selected on rational grounds, rather than guesses or chemical intuition, detailed evaluation of their performance is required.

        "abstract": "Cancer screening is aimed primarily at reducing deaths. Thus, site-specific cancer mortality is the appropriate endpoint for evaluating screening interventions. However, it is also the most demanding endpoint, requiring follow-up and a large numbers of patients order to have adequate power. Therefore, it is highly desirable to have surrogate endpoints that can reliably predict mortality reductions many years earlier. We here review a range of surrogate markers in terms of their potential advantages and pitfalls, and argue that a measure which weights incident cancers according to their predicted mortality has many advantages over other measures and should be used more routinely. Application to the UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Screening Trial data suggests that predicted colorectal cancer mortality, based on stage-specific incidence, is a more powerful endpoint than actual mortality and could advance the analysis time by about three years. Total colorectal cancer incidence as a surrogate endpoint provides little advance in the analysis time over actual mortality. The approach requires reliable prognostic data, (e.g. stage), for both the study cohort and a representative sample of the whole population. The routine collection of such data should be a priority for cancer registries. Surrogate endpoints should not replace a long-term analysis based directly on mortality, but can provide reliable early indicators which can be useful both for monitoring ongoing screening programmes and for making policy decisions.",

        "abstract": "In the field of drug delivery systems, microparticles made of polymeric matrix appear as an attractive approach. The in vitro release kinetic profile is crucial information when developing new particulate formulations. These data are essential for batch to batch comparison, quality control as well as for anticipation of in vivo behavior to select the best formulation to go further in preclinical investigations. The methods available present common drawbacks such as the time- and compound-consumption that does not fit with formulation screening requirements in early development stages. In this study, a new microscale high throughput screening (HTS) method has been developed to investigate drug release kinetic from piroxicam-loaded polylactic acid (PLA) and polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) microparticles. The method is a sample- and separation-based method where separation is performed by filtration using 96-well micro filter plates. 96 experiments can therefore be performed on one plate in one time in a fully automated way and with a very low sample and particle consumption. The influence of different parameters controlling release profiles was also investigated using this technique. The HTS method gave the same release profile than the standard dialysis method. Shaking, particle concentration, and the nature of the release medium were found to be of influence. The HTS method appears as a reliable method to evaluate drug release from particles with smaller standard deviation and less consumption of material.",

Therefore, there has long been a desire for a universal screening assay that could be used to screen all 7TM receptors independent of their signaling pathway. The receptor/beta-arrestin interaction is common to virtually all 7TM receptors. Therefore, an assay based on this interaction should achieve just that. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer technology can be used to measure the receptor/beta-arrestin interaction in living cells but due to various technical and biological reasons, the use of the technology for compound screening has been limited. The recent development of beta-arrestin mutants that significantly improve the assay signal, in combination with new improved instrumentation, has transformed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer technology from being a highly specialized research tool in molecular pharmacology to a more drug screening-friendly technique that is useful in an industrial setting.",

The detailed characterization of the assays included stability, homogeneity, and reproducibility of the recombinant P450 enzymes and the kinetic parameters of their reactions with Vivid fluorogenic substrates, with a focus on the specific characteristics of each component that enable screening in a low-volume 1536-well plate assay format.

IC(50) values obtained for the modifiers in 96- and 1536-well plate formats were similar and comparable with values obtained in assays with conventional substrates. An overall examination of the 1536-well assay statistics, such as signal-to-background ratio and Z' factor, demonstrated that these assays are a robust, successful, and reliable tool to screen for cytochrome P450 metabolism and inhibition in an ultra-high-throughput screening format.",

Recent advances in high-content imaging techniques allow simultaneous analysis of a range of cellular events. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to identify drug targets by combining genetic screening and high-content imaging in yeast.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY: In this approach, we infer the cellular functions affected by candidate drugs by comparing morphologic changes induced by the compounds with the phenotypes of yeast mutants.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Using this method and four well-characterized reagents, we successfully identified previously known target genes of the compounds as well as other genes involved with functionally related cellular pathways. This is the first demonstration of a genetic high-content assay that can be used to identify drug targets based on morphologic phenotypes of a reference mutant panel.",

High-throughput screening (HTS) of small-molecule libraries in whole-cell assays is one of the most frequently used approaches in drug discovery for infectious diseases. To aid in drug discovery efforts for HAT, the SYBR Green assay was developed for T. brucei in a 384-well format. This semi-automated assay is cost- and time-effective, robust, and reproducible. The SYBR Green assay was compared to the resazurin assay by screening a library of 4000 putative kinase inhibitors, revealing a superior performance in terms of assay time, sensitivity, simplicity, and reproducibility, and resulting in a higher hit confirmation rate. Although the resazurin assay allows for comparatively improved detection of slow-killing compounds, it also has higher false-positive rates that are likely to arise from the assay experimental conditions. The compounds with the most potent antitrypanosomal activity were selected in both screens and grouped into 13 structural clusters, with 11 new scaffolds as antitrypanosomal agents. Several of the identified compounds had IC50 <1 \u00b5M coupled with high selectivity toward the parasite. The core structures of the scaffolds are shown, providing promising new starting points for drug discovery for HAT.",

STK15 overexpression induces tumorigenesis and is amplified in various human cancers and tumor cell lines. Thus, STK15 represents an important therapeutic target for small molecule inhibitors that would disrupt its activity and block cell proliferation. The availability of a robust and selective small molecule inhibitor would also provide a useful tool for identification of the potential role of STK15 in cell cycle regulation and tumor development. The authors report the development of a novel, fast, simple microplate assay for STK15 activity suitable for high-throughput screening. In the assay, gamma-(33)P-ATP and STK15 were incubated in a myelin basic protein (MBP)-coated FlashPlate(R) to generate a scintillation signal. The assay was reproducible, the signal-to-noise ratio was high (11) and the Z' factor was 0.69. The assay was easily adapted to a robotic system for drug discovery programs targeting STK15. The authors also demonstrate that STK15 is regulated by phosphorylation and the N-amino terminal domain of the protein. Treatment with phosphatase inhibitors (okadaic acid) or deletion of the N-amino terminal domain results in a significant increase in the enzymatic activity.",

N-terminal fragments containing polyglutamine (polyQ) sequences aggregate and can bind to cellular proteins, resulting in several pathophysiological consequences for affected neurons such as changes in gene transcription. One transcriptional pathway that has been implicated in HD pathogenesis is the CREB binding protein (CBP)/cAMP responsive element binding (CREB) pathway. We developed a phenotypic assay to screen for compounds that can reverse the transcriptional dysregulation of the pathway caused by induced mutated huntingtin protein (\u00b5Htt). 293/T-REx cells were stably co-transfected with an inducible full-length mutated huntingtin gene containing 138 glutamine repeats and with a reporter gene under control of the cAMP responsive element (CRE). One clone, which showed reversible inhibition of \u00b5Htt-induced reporter activity upon treatment with the neuroprotective Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632, was used for the development of a high-throughput phenotypic assay suitable for a primary screening campaign, which was performed on a library of 24,000 compounds.

The assay was based on luminescence resonance energy transfer between a long lifetime fluorescent europium(III) chelate-dyed nanoparticle donor and a short lifetime, near-infrared fluorescent acceptor. The energy transfer prolonged the lifetime of the sensitized acceptor emission, and the fluorescence of the acceptor was measured using a time-resolved detection. The developed immunoassay was employed to screen inhibitors for enzyme 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. The enzyme overexpressed in MCF-7 cells catalyzed a reversible conversion of estroneto17beta-estradiol. The inhibition efficiency of the tested molecule was obtained by comparing the final concentration of converted estradiol after 60 min of conversion reaction in a sample and in a conversion control not containing an inhibitor. The Zbeta factor calculated using the E2 concentrations of the homogeneous assay was 0.64, demonstrating a relatively good performance of the assay. The results from the homogeneous assay were comparable with the results obtained using radioactively labeled estrone as a substrate and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation of estrone and converted estradiol after the enzyme reaction. Thus, this homogeneous assay can simplify the primary screening of potential new drug molecules by replacing a tedious radiometric HPLC method.",

        "abstract": "The authors describe the discovery of anti-mycobacterial compounds through identifying mechanistically diverse inhibitors of the essential Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) enzyme, pantothenate kinase (CoaA). Target-driven drug discovery technologies often work with purified enzymes, and inhibitors thus discovered may not optimally inhibit the form of the target enzyme predominant in the bacterial cell or may not be available at the desired concentration. Therefore, in addition to addressing entry or efflux issues, inhibitors with diverse mechanisms of inhibition (MoI) could be prioritized before hit-to-lead optimization. The authors describe a high-throughput assay based on protein thermal melting to screen large numbers of compounds for hits with diverse MoI. Following high-throughput screening for Mtb CoaA enzyme inhibitors, a concentration-dependent increase in protein thermal stability was used to identify true binders, and the degree of enhancement or reduction in thermal stability in the presence of substrate was used to classify inhibitors as competitive or non/uncompetitive. The thermal shift-based MoI assay could be adapted to screen hundreds of compounds in a single experiment as compared to traditional biochemical approaches for MoI determination. This MoI was confirmed through mechanistic studies that estimated K(ie) and K(ies) for representative compounds and through nuclear magnetic resonance-based ligand displacement assays.",

Biodynamic imaging is an emerging technology that probes 3D tissue using short-coherence dynamic light scattering to measure the intracellular motions inside tissues in their natural microenvironments. The information content of biodynamic imaging is displayed through tissue dynamics spectroscopy (TDS) but has not previously been correlated against morphological image analysis of 2D cell culture. In this article, a set of mitochondria-affecting compounds (FCCP, valinomycin, nicardipine, ionomycin) and Raf kinase inhibitors (PLX4032, PLX4720, GDC, and sorafenib) are applied to multicellular tumor spheroids from two colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (HT-29 and DLD-1). These were screened by TDS and then compared against conventional image-based high-content analysis (HCA). The responses to the Raf inhibitors PLX4032 and PLX4720 are grouped separately by cell line, reflecting the Braf/Kras difference in these cell lines. There is a correlation between TDS and HCA phenotypic clustering for most cases, which demonstrates the ability of dynamic measurements to capture phenotypic responses to drugs. However, there are significant 2D versus 3D phenotypic differences exhibited by several of the drugs/cell lines.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES When estimating the decline in breast cancer mortality attributable to screening, the challenge is to provide valid comparison groups and to distinguish the screening effect from other effects. In Funen, Denmark, multidisciplinary breast cancer management teams started before screening was introduced; both activities came later in the rest of Denmark. Because Denmark had national protocols for breast cancer treatment, but hardly any opportunistic screening, Funen formed a \"natural experiment\", providing valid comparison groups and enabling the separation of the effect of screening from other factors. METHODS Using Poisson regression we compared the observed breast cancer mortality rate in Funen after implementation of screening with the expected rate without screening. The latter was estimated from breast cancer mortality in the rest of Denmark controlled for historical differences between Funen/rest of Denmark. As multidisciplinary teams were introduced gradually in the rest of Denmark from 1994, the screening effect was slightly underestimated. RESULTS Over 14 years, women targeted by screening in Funen experienced a 22% (95% confidence interval 11%-32%) reduction in breast cancer mortality associated with screening (a reduction in breast cancer mortality rate from 61 to 47 per 100,000). The estimated reduction for participants corrected for selection bias was 28% (13%-41%). Excluding deaths in breast cancer cases diagnosed after end of screening, these numbers became 26% and 31%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS There is additional benefit in reducing breast cancer mortality from the early detection of breast cancer through mammographic screening over and above the benefits arising from improvements in treatment alone.",

        "abstract": "Objective Health policy in the UK is committed to tackling inequalities in cancer screening participation. We examined whether socioeconomic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening participation in England have reduced over five years.Methods Cross-sectional analyses compared cervical and breast screening coverage between 2007/8 and 2012/13 in Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England in relation to area-level income deprivation.Results At the start and the end of this five year period, there were socioeconomic inequalities in screening coverage for breast and cervical screening. Inequalities were highest for breast screening. Over time, the coverage gap between the highest and lowest quintiles of income deprivation significantly reduced for breast screening (from 12.3 to 8.3 percentage points), but not for cervical screening (5.3 to 4.9 percentage points).Conclusions Efforts to reduce screening inequalities appear to have resulted in a significant improvement in equitable delivery of breast screening, although not of cervical screening. More work is needed to understand the differences, and see whether broader lessons can be learned from the reduction of inequalities in breast screening participation.",

An alternate \"screening\" approach is to measure a large number of cellular features and systematically test each feature to identify those that are best able to distinguish positive and negative controls while taking precautions to avoid overfitting the available data. The cell measurement software the authors previously developed, CellProfiler, makes both approaches straightforward, easing the process of assay development. Here, they demonstrate the use of the screening approach to image assay development to select the best measures for scoring publicly available image sets of 2 cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation assays and 2 Transfluor assays.

In agreement with their pervasive role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression, miRNAs have been implicated in virtually all biological processes, including different pathologies.The use of screening technologies to systematically analyze miRNA function in cell-based assays offers a unique opportunity to gain new insights into complex biological and disease-relevant processes. Given the low complexity of the miRNome and the similarities to small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening experimental approaches, phenotypic screening using genome-wide libraries of miRNA mimics or inhibitors is not, per se, technically challenging. The identification of miRNA targets and, more importantly, the characterization of their mechanisms of action through the identification of the key targets underlying observed phenotypes remain the major challenges of this approach.This article provides an overview of cell-based screenings for miRNA function that were performed in different biological contexts. The advantages and limitations of computational and experimental approaches commonly used to identify miRNA targets are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "For more than a decade, RNA interference (RNAi) has brought about an entirely new approach to functional genomics screening. Enabling high-throughput loss-of-function (LOF) screens against the human genome, identifying new drug targets, and significantly advancing experimental biology, RNAi is a fast, flexible technology that is compatible with existing high-throughput systems and processes; however, the recent advent of clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas, a powerful new precise genome-editing (PGE) technology, has opened up vast possibilities for functional genomics. CRISPR-Cas is novel in its simplicity: one piece of easily engineered guide RNA (gRNA) is used to target a gene sequence, and Cas9 expression is required in the cells. The targeted double-strand break introduced by the gRNA-Cas9 complex is highly effective at removing gene expression compared to RNAi. Together with the reduced cost and complexity of CRISPR-Cas, there is the realistic opportunity to use PGE to screen for phenotypic effects in a total gene knockout background. This review summarizes the exciting development of CRISPR-Cas as a high-throughput screening tool, comparing its future potential to that of well-established RNAi screening techniques, and highlighting future challenges and opportunities within these disciplines. We conclude that the two technologies actually complement rather than compete with each other, enabling greater understanding of the genome in relation to drug discovery.",

DESIGN: A retrospective, new-user cohort study (between July 1, 2004, and June 30, 2006) using Medicaid claims data. SETTINGS: California, Missouri, and Oregon. PATIENTS: A total of 5370 children (aged 6-17 years) without diabetes mellitus taking SGA drugs and 15,000 children without diabetes taking albuterol (control individuals) [corrected] but no SGA drugs. INTERVENTION: Findings 1 year after recommendations from the American Diabetes Association and American Psychiatric Association called for metabolic screening of patients receiving SGA drugs. OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum glucose and lipid testing, 6-month incidence of diabetes, and dyslipidemia disturbances. RESULTS: Glucose screening was performed in 1699 (31.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 30.4%-32.9%]) SGA-treated children vs 1891 (12.6% [12.1%-13.2%]) control individuals. Lipid testing was performed in 720 (13.4% [95% CI, 12.5%-14.4%]) SGA-treated children vs 458 (3.1% [2.8%-3.3%]) controls. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, children with serious and/or multiple psychiatric diagnoses and those who used health care services more intensively were more likely to receive metabolic screening. The case incidence of glucose and lipid disorders was higher in SGA-treated vs albuterol-treated children (8.9 per 1000 children [95% CI, 6.6%-11.8%] vs 4.9 per 1000 children [3.9%-6.2%]; and 9.7 per 1000 children [95% CI, 7.2%-12.7%] vs 4.6 per 1000 children [95% CI, 3.6%-5.8%], respectively).

        "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions play an important role in the discovery and development of therapeutic agents. High-content profiling was developed to unravel the complexity of these interactions by providing multiparameter measurements of target activity at the cellular and subcellular levels. Two microtubule drugs, vinblastine and curacin A, were shown to modulate multiple cellular processes, including nuclear condensation, the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway as measured by RSK90 phosphorylation, and the regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton as measured in detergent-extracted cells. The heterogeneity of the response, addressed through population analysis and multiparameter comparisons within single cells, was consistent with vinblastine and curacin A having similar effects on nuclear morphology and 90 kDa ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK90) phosphorylation despite having distinct effects on the microtubule cytoskeleton. Ketoconazole, originally developed as an antifungal agent, exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitory and potentiating effects on both drugs in HeLa and PC-3 cells at concentration ranges near the plasma levels of ketoconazole attained in human subjects. Thus, high-content profiling was used to dissect the cellular and molecular responses to interacting drugs and is therefore a potentially important tool in the selection, characterization, and optimization of lead therapeutic compounds.",

To search for active compounds that can increase CLA-1 transcription, a novel cell-based assay was developed for application in high-throughput screening (HTS). Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were transfected with a CLA-1-promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct, and the stable transfected cell line was selected and named CLAp-LUC HepG2. With rosiglitazone as a positive control, this stable cell line was used to establish a specific CLA-1 gene expression assay in a 96-well microplate format. The evaluating parameter Z' value of 0.64 showed that this cell-based HTS assay was robust and reliable. Screening of 6000 microbial secondary metabolite crude extracts identified 8 positive strains. Between 2 identified CLA-1 up-regulators produced by actinomycete strain 04-4776, 4776B may stimulate not only the expression of CLA-1 on the transcriptional and translational levels but also the activity of CLA-1 to uptake the HDL-C in HepG2 cells.

        "abstract": "Despite advancements in therapies developed for the treatment of cancer, patient prognosis and mortality rates have improved minimally, and metastasis remains the primary cause of cancer mortality worldwide. An underlying mechanism promoting metastasis in many types of cancer is epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here the authors report a novel 3D model of EMT and metastatic breast cancer suitable for high-throughput screening (HTS) drug discovery. The primary assay incorporates the expression of the prognostic biomarker vimentin, as a luciferase reporter of EMT, in basil-like/triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma spheroids. Using this model, the authors developed a number of known antitumor agents as control modulators of EMT. U0126, PKC412, PF2341066, dasatinib, and axitinib downregulated vimentin expression by 70% to 90% as compared to untreated spheroids. Counterassays were developed to measure spheroid viability and the invasive potential of MDA-MB-231 spheroids after small-molecule treatment and used to confirm hits from primary screening. Finally, the authors conducted a pilot screen to validate this model for HTS using a purified library of marine secondary metabolites. From 230 compounds screened, they obtained a Z' score of 0.64, indicative of an excellent assay, and confirmed 4 hits, including isonaamidine B, papuamine, mycalolide E, and jaspamide. This HTS model demonstrates the potential to identify small-molecule modulators of EMT that could be used to discover novel antimetastatic agents for the treatment of cancer.",

        "abstract": "Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are validated cancer targets composed of six related proteins. From a drug discovery perspective, these are challenging targets that exert their cellular functions through protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Although several isoform-selective inhibitors have been developed using structure-based design or high-throughput screening (HTS) of synthetic chemical libraries, no large-scale screen of natural product collections has been reported. A competitive displacement fluorescence polarization (FP) screen of nearly 150,000 natural product extracts was conducted against all six antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins using fluorochrome-conjugated peptide ligands that mimic functionally relevant PPIs. The screens were conducted in 1536-well format and displayed satisfactory overall HTS statistics, with Z'-factor values ranging from 0.72 to 0.83 and a hit confirmation rate between 16% and 64%. Confirmed active extracts were orthogonally tested in a luminescent assay for caspase-3/7 activation in tumor cells. Active extracts were resupplied, and effort toward the isolation of pure active components was initiated through iterative bioassay-guided fractionation. Several previously described altertoxins were isolated from a microbial source, and the pure compounds demonstrate activity in both Bcl-2 FP and caspase cellular assays. The studies demonstrate the feasibility of ultra-high-throughput screening using natural product sources and highlight some of the challenges associated with this approach.",
